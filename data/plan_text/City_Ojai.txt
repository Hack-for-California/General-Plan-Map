            Air Quality Element
            INTRODUCTION
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF THE ELEMENT
            California Government Codes Sections 65300 and 65302 mandate that every city
            and county within the state prepare a General Plan containing the following
            elements: Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Conservation, Open Space, Noise and
            Safety. The purpose of General Plans is to provide and guide a community with
            long-term development plans and goals. The elements may be adopted individually
            or in various combinations (State of California, Office of Planning and Research,
            1990). California Government Codes Section 65302 states that cities or counties
            may prepare additional elements that may meet the unique needs of the
            community. Air quality is not always suggested as an individual element, but is
            often addressed in Conservation, Resource Management, Health and Safety and/or
            Circulation Elements. However, the addition of air quality elements to California
            General Plans has been recommended by the Southern California Association of
            Governments (SCAG), the regional planning agency for six Southern California
            counties including Ventura, and local air pollution control districts (Ventura County
            Air Pollution Control District [VCAPCD]) as the most effective process for
            identifying and integrating local actions into a comprehensive air quality strategy
            (SCAG,1990).
            Although air quality elements are not required, they are particularly important in
            California communities where air quality is a dominant issue with respect to its
            attainment and maintenance of state and federal standards. The main intent of air
            quality elements is to address the following:
            o    Problems with maximum air pollution levels that are higher than the national
                 and state clean air standards
            o    Reduction of the health and economic impacts of air pollution
            o    Compliance with the requirements of the Ventura County Air Quality
                 Management Plan
            o    Increase awareness of local responsibility for air quality and the vital role of
                 local government in meeting the emission reduction goals of the air quality
                 management plan
            o    Coordination of local projects that impact air quality both locally and
                 regionally (SCAG, 1990)

         Air Quality Element
         As Ventura County grows, attainment, maintenance, and preservation of the clean
         air standards will be significantly affected by local land use decisions made at the
         city and county level (VCAPCD, 1991). Ifland use decisions are made proposing
         growth, air quality improvement could be compromised. Population growth would
         initiate greater auto use and, in tum, emissions. Therefore, an important
         consideration in land use planning decisions will be the reduction of vehicle trips
         generated by new development.
         The contents of this document are intended to provide the City of Ojai with
         background technical infonnation so as to make infonned decisions with respect
         to adoption of policies and the development of ordinances.
         HISTORY
OVERVIEW
         The City of Ojai is located within the South Central Coast Air Basin. The Ventura
         County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD) monitors air quality and provides
         regulatory guidance for the region. This air basin is separated into two distinct
         areas, northern and southern, because of differing meteorology. The northern half
         comprises the rural portions of Ventura County and encompasses the entire area
         of the Los Padres National Forest. The southern half comprises the urbanized
         portion of the County which is divided into two airsheds: the Ojai Valley Airshed
         and the Oxnard Plain Airshed. Figure AQE-1 illustrates the County's two airsheds.
         Ventura County is a nonattainment area for the federal and state ozone standards
         and the state standard for ftne particulate matter (pM-tO) (VCAPCD, 1991).
         Although air quality has improved in recent years, the County is not close to
         reaching attainment offederal and state air quality standards. During the years 1987
         through 1989, Ventura County exceeded the federal ozone standard an average of
         44 days per year, while exceeding the more stringent state ozone standard an
         average of125 days per year (VCAPCD, 1991). An analysis of monitoring data for
         the years 1980 through 1989 indicates that maximum ozone concentrations and the
         number of days exceeding the standards are declining. Data collected since 1973
         shows dramatic decreases in the number of days having ozone concentrations
         greater than the federal standard. Because of these improvements, population
         exposure to unhealthful air is decreasing. In addition, lower maximum
         concentrations occur in the coastal areas with concentrations increasing inland; and
         coastal areas have fewer days exceeding the standards with the frequency increasing
         in inland areas (VCAPCD, 1991). Historically, Simi Valley has the worst ozone
         problem in the County; however, in 1991 and 1992, the highest ozone

            air quality are included in the Technical Appendix.
mSTORlCAL PERSPECTIVE
            Ventura County Air Quality Management Plans.
            The first study of air pollution in Ventura County occurred in 1966 and publicized
            the serious nature of the air quality problem in the County, citing over 70 adversely
            smoggy days per year (VCAPCD, 1991). As a result of the study, the Ventura
            County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD) was formed in 1968. The
            VCAPCD's mission was to regulate sources of air pollution and develop plans for
            cleaning the air.
            In 1979, the VCAPCD prepared an Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP), the
            first comprehensive air quality planning effort in Ventura County. This document
            predicted attainment of the federal ozone standard countywide by 1987, which
            soon became obvious that the prediction was optimistic and attainment by 1987
            would not occur.
            The 1982 AQMP was a refinement ofthe 1979 Plan and contained a more accurate
            emissions inventory and additional emission control measures. This AQMP was
            the first plan to separate the County into two airsheds, the Ojai Valley Airshed and
            the Oxnard Plain Airshed. The 1982 Plan was more realistic, recognizing that
            sufficient emission reductions would not occur to attain the federal ozone standard
            by 1987.
            In early 1985, the VCAPCD began a voluntary comprehensive effort to update and
            improve the 1982 AQMP. The improvement of the 1982 AQMP was initiated due
            to a lawsuit filed against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by the
            Citizens to Preserve the Ojai. The lawsuit was filed because attainment of the
            standards did not occur. The lawsuit requested the EPA to disapprove the AQMP,
            impose a moratorium on the construction ofnew major sources and modifications
            of reactive organic gases (ROG), and prepare a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP)
            to plan attainment of the federal ozone standard in the County (Ventura County,
            Resource Management Agency, 1979). In March 1989, the Citizens to Preserve the
            Ojai and the EPA reached a settlement agreement which established a schedule for
            the development of a federal clean air plan. However, after passage of the federal
            Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 on November 15, 1990, EPA requested court
            relief from development of a FIP for several air districts in California, including
            Ventura County. Relief was granted by the U.S. District Court on January 9, 1991.

Air Quality Element
That ruling was appealed by the plaintiffs. In July of 1992, the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals ordered EPA to develop and implement federal air pollution control
plans for various air districts in California. The EPA appealed that ruling to the
U.S. Supreme Court. In February of 1993, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the
EPA's appeal. Therefore, the EPA is now required to develop a FIP to bring
Ventura County and other California air districts into attainment of the federal
ambient air quality standard for ozone.
The 1987 AQMP provided a more accurate emissions inventory, proposed new
control measures for adoption, and proposed use of a new air quality model that
more accurately simulated conditions in the County. Although the 1987 AQMP
provided for additional emission reductions, attainment of the federal ozone
standard was not predicted to occur without further controls. The 1987 AQMP
was adopted in July 1988 and has led to the implementation of 25 new control
measures since that time.
Shortly after the AQMP was adopted, the California Legislature passed the
California Clean Air Act (CCAA). The CCAA required all nonattainment areas in
the state to develop new plans to meet federal and state air quality standards at the
earliest practicable date. To meet this requirement, VCAPCD prepared the 1991
AQMP, which was adopted by the California Air Resources Board on August 13,
1992. The 1991 AQMP is meant to meet the initial requirements of the CCAA and
continue the trend toward clean air.
Despite having put many strict controls into place, sizable reductions in emissions
must still occur to meet all clean air standards. The 1991 AQMP proposes a
control strategy representing the full implementation of known technology to
reduce ozone-forming emissions. This strategy concentrates on concurrent
reductions of ROG and nitrogen oxides (NO.), the two precursors to ozone.
Reductions of these pollutants could be via implementation of trip reduction
programs. For these programs to be effective, an average commuter ridership of
1.5 by 1999 would be necessary to achieve, as would no net increase in vehicle
emissions after 1997.
City of Ojai Plannjnlr
The City of Ojai initially prepared a General Plan in 1963. However, a new version
was prepared in 1978, adopted in 1979, and amended in 1987, 1988, and 1992. The
Land Use and Circulation Elements are scheduled to be updated in 1993.
Additional City goals were incorporated in the updated Plan and included
recommendations relating to the attainment of state and federal standards and

The City of Ojai's Residential Growth Management Plan (Ojai Municipal Code
10-6.101-10-6.201) and Commercial Growth Management Plan (Ordinance #686)
were prepared in 1979 and 1991, respectively, pursuant to the goals discussed in the
City's General Plan. The Residential Growth Management Plan limits residential
development to 12 single-family and 4 multifamily dwelling units through 1995 and
from 1995 into the future, development is more restrictive to 11 single-family and
3 multifamily dwelling units. Affordable housing is exempt from these restrictions.
The Commercial Growth Management Plan is similar in intent to the Residential
Growth Management Plan. In order to maintain a balance between residential and
commercial uses, the development of commercial uses is required to be the same
ratio as residential development. Commercial and office limits are expressed in
square footage. Allowable limits are based on the population of Ojai in 1988.
Commercial development allowed under this ordinance includes BP-Business
Professional Commercial Use Zone, the C-l Neighborhood Commercial Use Zone
and the C-R Commercial Recreation Zone.
In 1982, Ventura County adopted a Clean Air Ordinance as part of their Growth
Management Plan for unincorporated areas of the Ojai Valley. The ordinance's
goal is to limit residential building permits to a fixed annual maximum. The
maximum building permit allowances are 46 single lot and 140 multiple lot permits.
This ordinance attempts to limit emissions in the community through regulating
growth.
In 1988, transportation control measures and an implementation schedule were
adopted by the City of Ojai (Resolution No. 88-32). The City has made substantial
progress in implementing most ofthe transportation control measures indicated in
Resolution No. 88-32. Transportation control measures for the City include the
following:
o    Adopt a Circulation Element
o    Traffic flow improvements, including a couplet study, street extensions,
     intersection improvements, pedestrian improvements and a transportation
     system management ordinance

o    Parking and traffic management ordinances, including additional down town

o    Ridesharing measures, including park and ride lot development, preferential

     program
o Public transit measures, including an annual contribution to South Coast Area
   Transit (SCA1), improve public transit, shuttle services within the City of Ojai,
    discretionary development to provide incentives for transit use, contribute to
   citizens/senior transportation services, and require new development to
    provide bus stops and other appropriate transit infrastructure

o Air quality program development, air quality impacts analysis for new projects,
   revise guidelines for preparation of air quality analysis, implementation of air
   quality element for incorporation into City's General Plan and consistency
   with the County General Plan
Growth control affects the status of attainment of federal and state air quality
standards. The City initiated these regulations so as to mitigate traffic congestion
and to alleviate auto use through the limitation of growth and through commonly
used alternative transportation modes such as shuttles, bicycles, pedestrian access,
and carpooling and vanpooling.
Recent Events Causinf Air Quality Concern in the Ojai Valley Airshed
On July 28,1991, a train derailment occurred along Highway 101, north ofVentura,
along the coastal strip. The train derailment caused the release of hazardous
materials which shut down Highway 101 and rerouted traffic to Highways 33 and
150 (Casitas Pass) for several days. The rerouting substantially increased traffic
volumes passing through the Ojai area. With the increased traffic volumes, it could
be expected that local pollution levels would increase. However, pollutant levels
measured at the VCAPCD's monitoring station on Highway 33, approximately
53 meters northeast of the traffic route, indicated normal ozone and oxides of

Air Quality Element
nitrogen levels. These pollutants are measured at that station and are related to
mobile sources, although ozone is a secondary pollutant. Secondary pollutants are
those which form in the atmosphere from exposure to sunlight and chemical
reactions with other pollutants. The levels of pollutant data collected at this station
triggered questions from the public, the media, and the City of Ojai regarding the
location of the monitoring station, as well as the adequacy of the number of
monitoring sites in the Ojai Valley. The Technical Appendix contains a review of
the data and some of the issues related to this event.
Traffic control has been addressed by the City of Ojai. In 1992, the Ojai
Downtown Couplet Study was prepared by an independent consultant. The
purpose of the study was to address the feasibility of a downtown couplet. The
existing east/west routes into and out of the City are limited. This has led to poor
traffic operations at some of the intersections along Ojai Avenue. The couplet
comprises OjaiAvenue (Route 150) and MatilijaStreet. OjaiAvenue is assumed to
be for eastbound traffic and Matilija Street would serve westbound traffic. The
study considered the existing conditions and an improved existing conditions
scenario. In addition, the impacts of seven couplet alternatives were analyzed. The
results of this study indicated that implementation of a couplet would induce
greater traffic volumes on Matilija Street, thus creating potential socioeconomic
disruption to commercial land uses in the downtown area. Rather than
implementation of a couplet, the study recommended restriping and signalization
of the existing route to improve the road conditions.
In terms of air quality, a couplet would likely improve ambient air quality due to a
lessening of traffic jams and stop signals which allow for greater carbon monoxide
emissions. However, signalization and restripingwould provide virtually the same
benefits. Further assessmentwould require air quality modeling to determine actual
air quality emissions variances from each proposed scenario.
Health Effects
Clean outdoor air or ambient air is a mixture of gases: approximately 78 percent
nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, less than one percent carbon dioxide, less than one
percent argon (an inert gas), traces of other inert gases, and varying amounts of
water vapor. About 95 percent of the total air mass is concentrated in a layer about
12 miles high around the earth's surface. Into this finite air mass are poured all of
the products of combustion, vaporization, attrition (wearing or grinding down by
friction), the air-contaminating activities of civilization as well as the by-products
of natural occurrences such as volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and decaying
vegetation.

Air Quality Element
Air pollution is part of everyday life for millions of Californians. Thousands of
residents ofVentura County are regularly exposed to levels of air pollution that can
cause nausea, headaches, eye irritation, and dizziness even in healthy adults.
Geography, climate and population are key elements in Ventura's smog problem.
The area is surrounded by mountains that trap pollution in stagnant air. Persistent
stagnant weather conditions during much of the year not only prevent pollution
from dispersing in the atmosphere, but also increase the amount of time pollutant
gases are exposed to sunlight, thus prompting the chemical reactions that create
smog.
While air pollution affects everyone to a degree, some people are extremely
susceptible to severe health damage, particularly the 2.5 million Californians who
suffer from heart and lung diseases. Air pollution may be a contributing factor in
the 80,000 deaths from these diseases in California each year. In addition to people
with heart and lung diseases, children under the age of 14, whose lungs are still
developing, and the elderly, whose immune systems have been weakened with age,
are especially vulnerable to the damaging effects of smog. It should be noted that
Ojai has twice the percentage of persons in the population over 65 years of age
than is true for the County of Ventura as a whole.
High smog levels occur more than 100 times a year in Southern California, enough
to cause outdoor exercise and sporting events to be canceled or rescheduled to
protect the health of school children. The ill and the elderly are also advised to stay
indoors during these times. Peak summertime concentrations of ozone, the state's
worst pollution problem, are sometimes 3.5 times greater than the standard set by
the California Air Resources Board (ARB) to protect human health. During these
"smog alerts," even healthy adults are advised to refrain from jogging and other
outdoor exercises. Research sponsored by the ARB indicates that endurance
athletes may risk more health damage from exposure to smog than others because
they breathe more air and draw more pollutants deep into the lungs.
The results of research and many epidemiologic studies lead the National Academy
of Sciences and the American Medical Association to believe that air pollution can
cause long-tenn, irreversible damage to lung tissue leading to chronic lung disease.
While most diseases have been brought under control during the past 50 years,
deaths from emphysema, chronic bronchitis and lung cancer have increased
dramatically. Even when the statistics are corrected for smoking habits, there
remains a significant correlation between exposure to air pollutants and these
crippling lung diseases.

gases (hydrocarbons), and particulates can affect human health. All of the
following effects have been documented at various animal toxicological and human
clinical studies and are frequently experienced in Southern California.
o    irritation of mucous membranes
o    increase mucous gland secretions
o    paralysis of the ciliary mechanism that is necessary for the lungs to cleanse their
     surfaces of intruding dusts and infectious biological materials
o    reduces the immune capacity of cells that prevent inflammation
o    lead to changes in the gas transfer surfaces of the lungs
o    decrease the ability of a body to breath efficiently
o    interference with oxygen delivery to body tissues
Children living in heavily polluted areas exhibit a much greater incidence of lower
respiratory disease than do children living in areas with relatively clean air. Air
pollution is known to trigger asthmatic attacks in susceptible children, and there is
evidence to suggest that some forms of asthma are caused by air pollution. The
best available evidence indicates that children are especially vulnerable to tissue
damage from air contaminants. Children are possibly the most sensitive group in
the population because their lungs are developing. They have more than twice the
air exchange volume based on body weight; they have a fusterventilation rate than
adults.
After exposure to air pollution, minor symptoms, such as wheezing and sore
throats, begin to subside and eventually disappear. This occurrence has been
viewed by some as an indication that the effects of exposure to air pollution are
reversible and hannless. Recent laboratory studies with animals, however, show
that minor responses to air pollution may indicate tissue injury that develops over
a lifetime of repeated exposures. These findings may apply to humans as well as
animals, as indicated by a reduced ability to breathe normally.
An epidemiological study supported in part by the ARB examined the effects of

cllles: Lancaster, a city characterized by low levels of air pollution; Burbank and
Long Beach, characterized by intermediate levels of air pollution; and Glendora,
where the concentration of air pollutants is high. The inhaling and exhaling
capacity of individuals who lived in the smoggiest city, Glendora, was considerably
less than expected. One of the most pertinent preliminary findings is that
individuals who never smoked but lived in the city of Glendora exhibited a more
limited ability to breathe than smokers who lived in the city of Lancaster. This
study demonstrates the detrimental effects of prolonged breathing of smog that
individuals living in Los Angeles County sometimes experience.
There are no easy solutions to the air pollution problems in Southern California.
At the present time, California requires much more stringent emission standards
for vehicles sold in the State than are required by federal law. Yet the tremendous
number of automobiles on the road continues to contribute to the contaminants
that react in the air to become smog (VCAPCD, AQMP, 1991). Because
automobiles contribute so much to smog levels, the VCAPCD has developed
strategies to reduce the amount of automobiles on the road, such as reducing
automobile use and vehicles miles traveled through such tactics as car pooling and
encouraging alternative modes of transportation. In addition, the California Air
Resources Board has adopted strategies and regulations for alternate fuel vehicles
and has implemented more stringent motor vehicle emission standards. However,
the emission forecasts in the 1991 Ventura County Air Quality Management Plan
(AQMP) show that, even with continued growth in the county, emissions of both
reactive organic compounds and nitrogen oxides will continue to decrease well past
1995. The emission forecasts in the 1991 AQMP were based on more current
estimates of population and economic growth in the county, and on new and
enhanced emission control tactics. Furthermore, the District is developing the
1994 AQMP to comply with the mandates of the federal Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, which require that Ventura County artain the federal ozone
standard by 2005.
An additional artainment problem could be the proposed Weldon Canyon Landfill.
The estimated NOx and ROG emissions will exceed the five pounds per day
threshold of significance by over 100 times. Impacts would be equivalent to nearly
3000 new dwelling units in the Ojai Valley Airshed. This proposed landfill would
also be potentially inconsistent with a policy contained in Ventura County's Draft
Overall Community Goals for the Ojai Area Plan. This policy states, "Oil
development, landfills, and other industrial development shaD he controlled and conditions imposed
in IJf"fier to move toward attainment ofState and Federal!J mandated air quality standards. "

Air Quality Element
REGULATORY SETTING
In response to air pollution within the State of California, federal, state, and
regional authorities have adopted air pollution reduction measures. At the national
level, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is involved in local air
quality planning through the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), as recently amended by
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. At the state level, under the provisions
of Lewis Air Quality Act of 1976 and more recently the California Clean Air Act
of 1988 (CCAA), the ARB is charged with the responsibility of coordinating efforts
to attain and maintain ambient air quality standards and to conduct research into
the causes of, and solutions to, air pollution problems. At the regional level the
VCAPCD addresses air pollution which affects the respective county airsheds
through the Ventura County AQMP.
Regulatory AJ:encies
At the national level, the EPA has the ultimate responsibility for improving air
quality throughout the nation. The EPA reviews and approves the State
Implementation Plans (SIP) that incorporate air pollution control strategies
necessary to meet the requirements of the CAA. In Ventura County, the
VCAPCD is responsible for formulating and implementing the AQMPs whose
purpose is to set forth a comprehensive program that will lead Ventura County into
compliance with federal and state air quality standards. Designated portions of the
AQMP, those necessary to comply with federal standards, are submitted by the
VCAPCD to the ARB to be incorporated into the SIP alongwith AQMPs of other
air pollution control districts. Because the AQMP is also intended to contain
measures to comply with California air quality standards set forth in the CCAA, the
AQMP may be broader, in certain respects, than the federal requirements.
At the state level, the ARB was formed in 1967 by the California Legislature to
control air contaminant emissions and to improve air quality throughout the state.
The ARB has primary statutory authority to establish and enforce standards which
limit pollutant emissions from motor vehicles. The ARB also is responsible for
assisting the VCAPCD in the development and coordination of their local AQMP.
Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the ARB to review the AQMP, and other
proposed air quality-related rules and regulations for incorporation into the SIP
prior to submission to the EPA.
At the regional leve~ the SCAG was created in 1965 by the counties of Los
Angeles, Ventura, Impe~ Riverside, Orange, and San Bernardino to oversee
planning on a regional basis. SCAG's primary responsibility, with respect to air

quality planning, is in the development of transportation, land use, and energy
conservation measures. In 1988, the SCAG recommended that cities in six
Southern California counties, Los Angeles, Ventura, Riverside, Orange, San
Bernardino, and Imperial incorporate air quality elements into their General Plans
(SCAG, 1990). To date, the City of Simi Valley is the only jurisdiction within
Ventura County to have done so. Additionally, the South Coast Air Quality
Management District, which does not have jurisdiction over Ventura County, has
made this a mandatory part of its 1991 AQMP. The VCAPCD's AQMP includes
recommendations that encourage further air quality planning in the region, but no
specific reference to air quality elements. However, the VCAPCD has been working
closely with several cities in the County for the last few years to implement this
goal. They have held a number of transportation and informational workshops to
provide cities with background and implementing tools (VCAPCD, Chuck Thomas,
personal communication, 1992).
AIR QUALITY PLANNING PROGRAMS
Federal PJannjn~ Programs. Early federal legislative response to air quality
concerns consisted of the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955, the Clean Air Act of
1963, the Air Quality Act of 1967, and the Clean Air Act of 1970. The goal of the
Clean Air Act of 1970, as stated by Congress in its 1977 amendments, was "to
protect and enhance the quality of the nation's air resources."
The most recent Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 are much broader in scope.
The major titles of the 1990 Amendments address nonattainment of air quality
standards, mobile sources emissions, air toxics, acid rain, a new federal permit
program, enforcement, and the protection of stratospheric ozone. Title I
(nonattainment provisions) is directly related to the goals of the air quality element.
The goal ofTitle I is to attain air quality standards for six criteria pollutants: ozone
(0,), nitrogen oxides (NO,), sulfur oxides (SO,), particulates (pM-10 and TSP),
carbon monoxide (CO), and lead (Pb). California and National air quality standards
are included on Table AQE-l. All nonattainment areas are designated or classified
based on the severity of their nonattainment problem. Classifications include
extreme, severe, serious, moderate, and marginal and determine the extent of
remedial actions. The entire southern portion of Ventura County is in
nonattainment for ozone and has been designated as a severe area under both the
federal Clean Air Act and the California Clean Air Act.
The actions required to be undertaken under the severe classification the following:

o   Attainment is required within 15 years after enactment of the Clean Air Act
     Amendments of 1990.
o    Vehicle miles traveled provISIons require identification and adoption. of
     enforceable transportation control strategies and transportation control
     measures to offset any growth in emissions from increased vehicle miles
     traveled or numbers of vehicle trips and to attain reduction in motor vehicle
     emissions. This measure also requires provision of adequate access to
     downtown, other commercial, and residential areas and should avoid measures
     that increase emissions and congestion.
o    Offset requirements such that the ratio of total emission reductions of volatile
     organic compounds (VOCs), or reactive organic gases (ROGs), to total
     increased emissions of such air pollutant shall be at least 1.3 to 1, except that
     if the state plan requires all existing major sources in the nonattainment area to
     use best available control technology for the control ofVOCs, the ratio shall
     be at least 1.2 to 1.
In general, under Title I, the attainment date for a nonattainment area is the most
expeditious date attainment can be achieved, but no later than five years from the
date the area was designated nonattainment. The EPA may extend the period for
compliance up to 10 years. Separate compliance timetables pertain to ozone
attainment and include three years for marginal areas, six years for moderate areas,
nine years for serious areas, 15 years for severe areas, and 20 years for extreme
areas. These timetable adjustments are dependent upon the administrators
discretion based on the following issues: the number ofaccedences of the national
primary ambient air quality standard for ozone in the area, the level of pollution
transport between the area and other affected areas, including both intrastate and
interstate transport, and the mix of sources and air pollutants in the area.
Title I also requires each nonattainment area to submit a comprehensive inventory
of actual emissions as part of the State Implementation Plans (SIP). Areas must
achieve a 15 percent reduction from their 1990 actual emissions inventory within
six years. Thereafter, each area must achieve a three percent annual reduction.
State Planning Programs
The CCAA was signed into law on September 30, 1988 and took effect on
January 1, 1989. The CCAA established a legal mandate to achieve health-based
state air qualiry standards at the earliest practicable date. Through its many
requirements, the CCAA serves as the centerpiece of the local air pollution control

district's attainment planning efforts since it is generally more stringent than the
federal CAA.
The CCAA was recently amended on September 26, 1992 by the California
Legislature. The primary purpose of these amendments was to eliminate
differences between the CAA and the CCAA For example, the nonattainment
area designation schemes, the timing of the planning cycle, and the emission
reductions required were addressed in this legislation. The ARB is currently in the
process of updating CCAA implementation guidance for the air pollution control
districts .
Based on pollutant levels, the CCAA divides nonattainment areas into four
categories--moderate, serious, severe, and extreme--to which progressively more
stringent requirements apply. The Ventura County portion of the South Central
Coast fur Basin has been classified as a severe nonattainment area for ozone.
Ventura County is also not in attainment for PM-10. However, it is in attainment
for nitrogen dioxide (NO,), sulfur dioxide (SO,), and CO.
Severe nonattainment areas are required to meet the most stringent requirements
of the CCAA and are required to revise their AQMP to include specified emissions
reduction strategies to meet milestones in implementing emission controls and
achieving more healthful air quality. The new control requirements include the
following:
o    A pennitting program designed to mitigate all emission increases from new or
     modified pennitted source
o   The application of best available retrofit control technology (BAReT) for
     existing sources
o   Provisions to develop area and indirect source control programs
o   Transportation control measures to substantially reduce the rate of increase in
     passenger vehicle trips and miles traveled per trip
o   Transportation control measures to achieve an average commuter ridership of
     1.5 persons per vehicle by 1999, and no net increase in motor vehicle emissions
     after1997
o    Measures to achieve the use of a significant number oflow-emission vehicles
     by operators of motor vehicle fleets

Air Quality Element
o    Reducing population exposure to unhealthful levels of air pollution according
     to a prescribed schedule
o    Submission of an AQMP to the ARB by July 1, 1991 and triennial updates
     thereafter
The CCAA also includes the following additional requirements that can significantly
affect the selection of strategies to reduce pollutant emissions:
(1) reducing regional emissions for each nonattainment pollutant by five percent
     or more per year
(2) achieving an average commuter ridership of 1.5 persons per vehicle by 1999
(3) achieving no net increase in mobile source emissions after 1997
(4) achieving a substantial decrease in the growth of vehicle miles traveled and
     vehicle trips
(5) instituting public education programs
(6) reducing population exposure to severe nonattainment pollutants according to
     a prescribed schedule
(7) ranking control measures by cost effectiveness and implementation priority
According to the CCAA, air quality management districts must design their AQMP
to achieve a reduction in emissions of five percent or more per year (or 15 percent
or more in a three-year period) for pollutants causing Severe nonattainment.
However, an air basin may achieve a reduction of less than five percent per year if
it can be demonstrated that either of the following applies:
o    The alternative emissions reduction strategy is equal to, or more effective than,
     the five percent per year control approach in improving air quality
o    That despite the inclusion of every feasible measure, and an expeditious
     adoption schedule, the air basin is unable to achieve the five percent per year
     reduction in emissions
For emission reduction accounting purposes, the ARB has established a seven-year
initial reporting period from January 1, 1988 to December31, 1994. The reporting

intervals after this initial period occur every three years (i.e., 1997,2000, etc.).
Reeional PJannin~ Pr0lmlIlls
The Ventura County 1991 AQMP will meet the initial planning requirements ofthe
CCAA and continue the trend toward clean air. The 1991 AQMP proposes a
control strategy representing the full implementation of known technology to
reduce ozone-forming emissions and is designed to achieve a reduction in district-
wide emissions of five percent or more per year for each nonattainment pollutant,
averaged every consecutive three-year period. A full five percent per year reduction
in emissions from all sources would equal zero emissions in 20 years. This strategy
concentrates on concurrent reductions of ROG and NO", the two precursors to
ozone.
Local Air Quality PIannin~ Prowams
Air quality planning has been performed in the Ojai Valley for a number of years.
The City ofOjai initiated the Residential Growth Management Plan in 1979 and the
Commercial Growth Management Plan in 1988 in order to comply with the federal
Clean Air Act of 1977. Although, the Commercial Growth Management Plan was
initiated in 1988, it was not adopted until 1991. By instituting the growth
management plans, building permits were issued with less frequency and population
levels have remained at manageable levels.
In 1982, Ventura County adopted a Clean Air Ordinance as part of their Growth
Management Plan for unincorporated areas of the Ojai Valley. The ordinance's
goal was to limit residential building permits to a fixed annual maximum. The
maximum building permit allotments are 46 single lot and 140 multiple lot permits.
This ordinance attempts to limit emissions in the community through regulating
growth.
In 1988, the City instituted transportation control measures and an implementation
schedule into their General Plan. These measures are included in the Introduction
of this Element and were incorporated into the General Plan to meet attainment
of state and federal air quality requirements.
In addition, in 1989, Ventura County adopted a five-pound threshold for the Ojai
Valley Airshed for assessing whether a proposed development project would have
a significant adverse impact on air quality, pursuant to the California Environmental
Quality Act. This restriction was implemented to comply with the CCAA's ozone
standards. Tables AQE-2 and AQE-3 illustrate the development allowances which

would exceed the five pound per day emissions threshold.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
As was stated in the Introduction, the air quality element is often incorporated into
other elements of a General Plan instead of standing as a separate document. In
addition, there is often overlap between policies that are included in the Circulation,
Land Use, and Housing Elements. This section includes all of the measures
contained in other elements that overlap and are consistent with air quality policies
contained in Section 10.

GENERAL DEFINITIONS
Definitions of Air Quality Terms
Precursor: A primary criteria pollutant which has the ability to react with other
pollutants to form another pollutant. Examples of precursors include, oxides of
nitrogen (NO,), reactive organic gases (ROG)s, fine particulate matter (pM-tO), and
oxides of sulfur (SO,).
Secondary Pollutant: A pollutant that is not directly emitted from a specific
source, but is formed from reactions with other chemicals and influence of heat,

Air Quality Element
specifically solar radiation. Ozone is an example of a secondary pollutant. Its
precursor5 are NO" ROGs, and PM-10.
Air Quality Management Pian: A planning document prepared to direct a region
into meeting state and federal air quality standards. In areas that are not in
attainment for specific types ofpollutants, an air quality management plan (AQMP)
contains control measures to direct the region towards meeting attainment goals.
Nonattainment: The status assigned to a region by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (ARB) for a
region that does not meet the emissions standards assigned for each criteria
pollutant. Criteria pollutants for which standards are set include carbon monoxide
(CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO,), PM-10, sulfur dioxide (SO,), lead (Pb), and ozone.
A region having a nonattainment status indicates that its air quality is not healthful
for its population. Nonarrainment status is further defined by degree of
nonattainment. Under the federal govemmentdesignations, nonattainmentdegrees
include marginal, moderate, serious, severe, and extreme. Under the state
designations, nonattainment degrees include moderate, serious, and severe. These
definitions apply to each criteria pollutant listed in the paragraph above.
Air Quality Standards: Both California and the federal government have set air
quality standards for ozone, CO, NO.. SO.. PM-tO, and Pb. The California
standards are more stringent than the federal standards, and in the case ofPM-10
and S02, far more stringent. California has also set standards for sulfate, visibility,
hydrogen sulfide, and vinyl chloride (South Coast Air Quality Management District,
1991). The standards are based on human exposure to these pollutants. The
negative health effects resulting from exposure determine the level of allowable
regional emissions.

         Air Quality Element
         ISSUES AND NEEDS
OVERVlEW
         Ozone is a major problem in the southern portion of Ventura County due to
         growth and development. Growth contributes to greater automobile and stationary
         emissions which degrade air quality and facilitate accedences ofstate and federal air
         quality standards. In Ventura County, accedence of the state and federal ozone
         standard is considered to be caused by the large quantity of automobiles entering
         and leaving the County. Mobile emissions are most attributable to commuting to
         and from work sites located in neighboring counties, i.e., Los Angeles and Santa
         Barbara. Other factors contributing to ozone nonattainment include generation of
         electricity (the Ormond Beach Generating Station), offshore oil drilling operations,
         and other various stationary sources.
         PM-10 is considered a problem as exemplified by its state nonattainment status.
         However, the VCAPCD has implemented several control measures which have
         reduced PM-1 0 emissions. It is expected that attainment ofPM-1 0 will occur in the
         near future.
         Another issue of more recent concern is the location of the air monitoring station
         in the Ojai Valley. As was discussed earlier, the train derailment of July 1991
         required the rerouting of traffic through the Ojai Valley for five days. Greater
         traffic usually causes greater ozone levels in the atmosphere; however, in the Ojai
         Valley, ozone levels were elevated but were not at significant levels. According to
         VCAPCD, the meteorological conditions were not conducive to the formation of
         ozone. This explanation was disputed by the media and the public. Therefore,
         AeroVironment was asked to conduct a site and systems audit and analyze the data.
         This discussion is contained in the Technical Appendix. The results of our analysis
         concluded, that although the monitoring site location is not perfect, it meets all of
         the EPA's requirements for the site location. In addition, all of the equipment was
         and is in satisfactory working order. Our conclusion for the health and air quality
         complaints made by the public is that CO emissions were likely the cause of
         discomfort, not ozone. CO emissions are high when traffic slows down. Since CO
         levels are thought to be well within the standards in this area, it is not monitored
         at any monitoring station.

INTRODUcnON
            The air quality element defines objectives for future air quality. Goals, objectives,
            policies, and implementing programs contained in this Element are intended to
            improve local and regional air quality by reducing harmful emissions from both
            stationary and mobile sources. New goals and policies are intended to reduce
            pollutant emissions, alongwith those measures previously contained in the General
            Plan. This section is divided into differing sources of air pollution, i.e., attainment,
            transportation, etc. The sources are further broken down into goals, objectives,
            policies, and implementing programs.

              1.  All development proposals should be regulated via mitigation monitoring
                  programs whereby fugitive dust measures are implemented. The City should
                  request that the City and County of Ventura adopt the five pound/day
                  threshold ofsignificance for air quality impacts for that part oftheir jurisdiction
                  in the Ojai Valley Airshed.
Energy Conservation
              1. Reduce energy consumption and promote energy efficiency programs
              2. Reduce energy consumption by 20 percent to meet California Title 24
                  requirements
              3. Local government facilities and equipment that use energy shall incorporate the
                  most energy-efficient design consistentwith a reasonable rate of return and the
                  recognition of the environmental benefits from energy conservation
              4. Encourage the incorporation of energy conservation features in the design of
                  all new construction and the installation of conservation devices in existing
                  developments
              5. Encourage energy audits of existing structures, identifying levels of existing
                  energy use and potential conservation measures
              6. Promote the use of passive design concepts which make use of the natural
                  climate to increase energy efficiency
              7. Encourage that new construction not preclude the use of solar energy systems
                  by uses and buildings on adjacent properties and consider enactment of a
                  comprehensive solar access ordinance

2. The City should look into implementing building ordinances which would
   require residential and commercial buildings to be weatherized according to a
   California Public Utilities Commission 1987 survey. In addition, new residential
   and commercial buildings should meet the conservation standards set by the
   California Energy Commission.

2. The City shall post APCD newsletters on a monthly basis in City Hall to
   illustrate to the public the regions progress
3. The City shall provide information as made available from the APCD at City
   Hall regarding the air pollution problem in the region
Imp1ementine Strate!:ies
1. The City should make available current information on air quality
   nonattainment status, pollutant accedences, County programs, etc.
2. The City should request the Ventura County APCD to set up workshops, at
   least annually, at a convenient public place (e.g., City Hall) to review the County
   Air Pollution Management Plan goals, policies, objective programs, rulemaking
   and status of attainment
3. Encourage transportation modes that minimize the use of single passenger
   motor vehicles and the associated air emissions

           Circulation Element
           INTRODUCTION
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF THE CIRCULATION ELEMENT
                  he Ojai Circulation Ele-
           T      ment addresses broad
                  issues of physical mobil-
           ity, how goods and people
           move about within the commu-
           nity, as well as how goods and
           people move between Ojai and
           the outside world. Circulation
           is one of the most pervasive
           issues of the General Plan, and
           is related to land use, commu-
           nity design, noise, air quality,
           and      energy    consumption.
           Transportation issues affect not
           only the local area, but also re-
           quire coordination with the
           County and regional and State
           agencies.
           Maintaining a high quality of life within a community is largely dependent upon
           careful coordination of land use and transportation planning. Highly desirable
           communities are those where residents are effectively linked with local social and
           cultural resources, as well as shopping and services by a transportation system that
           prOVides a high degree of mobility, supporting, but not dominating the visual
           character of the community. It is thus the purpose of the Ojai General Plan Circu-
           lation Element to establish a safe circulation system that is consistent with OJai's
           character and needs in terms of the desired quality of life, sense of place, cost of
           maintenance, use of lands adjacent to roadways, and desired quality of traffic
           operations.
GOAL AND OBJECTIVES
           Balancing the need to protect Ojai's unique character and natural environment
           with the desire to eliminate traffic congestion is the primary challenge of the Circu-
           lation Element. The follOWing goal and objectives outlined in the box on the next
           page discuss the priorities which Ojai will pursue in meeting this challenge.
                                                                          r: koj40 J Iprojectlplunl(illal\circ.ele

          City of Ojai Circulation Element Goal and Objectives
                                                Goal
   It is the goal of the Ciry of Ojai to develop and maintain a transportation system that is
   protective of the communiry's unique character and living environment; maximizes freedom
   and safery of movementfor pedestrians, bi'iYcles, and automobiles; and that maintains a bal-
   ance between mobiliry and the cost-efficien'iY of maintenance.
                                             Objectives
   In implementing this goal, it is the objective of the Ciry to:
   â¢         strengthen the link between the communiry's transportation system and its planned
             land uses such that traffic flows can be improved while maintaining Ojai's unique
             communiry character and livabiliry;
   â¢         ensure that the area's roadway system is rejlective of the Ciry's commitment to
             environmental qualiry and preservation of its small town lifesryles;
   â¢         maintain a unified andjunctional street system;
   â¢         help reduce regional traffic growth;
   â¢         decrease dependence on single occupant automobile travel by providing a high level
             ofpedestrian, bi'iYcle, and public transit opportunities;
   â¢         preserve a sense of comfort and well-being throughout the communiry by reducing
             the intrusiveness ofcommercial, tourist, and regional traffic on residential neighbor-
             hoods;
   â¢        facilitate the efficient delivery of energy. water, and storm water, as well as the
             disposal of sewage in a manner consistent with protecting Ojai's environmental
             qualiry and small town character; and
   â¢         make efficient use ofexisting transportation facilities.

LEGAL AU7HORl1Y
           The State of California mandates that every city prepare a comprehensive General
           Plan for the long-term physical development of the City and any land outside its
           boundaries that is considered relevant to its planning. California Government
           Code Section 65302(b), pertaining to the required elements of the General Plan,
           states the general plan shall consist of a statement of development policies, and
           shall include:
                    "a circulation element consisting of the general location and ex-
                    tent ofexisting andproposed major thoroughfares, transportation
                    routes, terminals, and other local public utilities andfacilities, all
                    correlated with the land use element of tbe plan. "

           GENERAL PIAN APPROACH
BALANCING COMMUNITY CHARACTER AND CIRCULATION NEEDS
                    identified in the Land Use Element, Ojai's vision is to preserve its "small
           k      town" character by using the physical, environmental, and social aspects of
                    e community that form its character as the criteria for testing whether new
           development and public works projects respects and enhances the City's small
           town feel. This approach utilizes a broad palette of community features, neigh-
           borhood characteristics, and design images to describe the "Ojai experience" as the
           benchmark for the future (Land Use Element Figures 8 through 12). An important
           determinant of Ojai's character is its roadway system.
           Probably the best example of Ojai's policy of pre-
           serving the natural environment and forcing man-
           made features to fit into that environment is oak
           tree preservation. Large oak trees, which would be
           removed as part of road construction or widening
           projects in most cities, remain within OJai's streets
           and rights-of-way as ongoing reminders of Ojai's
           emphasis on development fitting around, rather
           than over the natural environment.
           The General Plan's approach to transportation is to
           balance community character and circulation needs
           to minimize the intrusiveness of the area's roadway
           system, and to provide physical improvements to
           the roadway system where it is physically and envi-
           ronmentally prudent to do so. In this concept, the Oak Tree Preservation
           roadway system will be designed to provide access and linkages between resi-
           dences, community activity centers, and the outside world, but will not be permit-
           ted to visually dominate the surrounding landscape or impact the serenity of Ojai's
           residential neighborhoods.
           OJai's local roadway system is composed almost exclusively of two-lane, undivided
           streets. Four lane and divided street sections are limited to portions of State High-
           ways 33 and 150. The area roadway system currently has only four traffic signals,
           located at the intersections of Highways 33 and 150 (where Ventura Avenue,
           Maricopa Highway, and Ojai Avenue come together), Ojai Avenue and Country
           Club Drive, Ojai Avenue and Bristol Road, and at Ojai Avenue and Signal Street. As
           part of the County's Congestion Management Plan, Fox Street as well as Bryant
           Street!Park Road will have traffic lights where each intersects with Ojai Avenue.

OJ ai's historic development, is a con-
tributing factor not only to its unique
small town character, but also to its
traffic congestion. When originally
planned, the downtown district of-
fered a wide boulevard that was based
on the ability of a horse and wagon to
tum around in the middle of the
street. Parking was located in the
front of commercial businesses to al-
low for convenient parking and ac-
cess. Unfortunately, planning for the
movement and volume of vehicles
throughout the City is much more Local Rural Roadway
complicated today, yet the space in which to move in this area remains the same as
in the horse and buggy era. A5 can be seen in the photo below, drivers in the
downtown area are faced with a number of choices within a short distance. In this
photo (which was taken during one of the City's larger community events), vehicles
can be seen parallel parking, turning, merging and, in one case, making an illegal
maneuver, all within a constrained street section filled with pedestrians.
Complicating        the     downtown
congestion issue is the fact that the
same area is also a major commer-
cial and tourist attraction in the Val-
ley.     During large community
events, the downtown Arcade and
Libbey Park area become congested
with tourists, event participants,
and shoppers all vying for parking
near the event location or commer-
cial business. Congestion also often
occurs when larger community
events at one of the area's two golf
courses take place. Local residents Dowlltmvn Circulatioll
have also cited local congestion occurs immediately following the dismissal of local
schools.
Traffic congestion at the ''Y'' intersection of Highways 33 and 150 frequendy occurs
dUring peak commuting periods. Referred to as the ''Y'' due to its unusual configu-
ration, the safety of the intersection of State Highways 33 and 150, has been the
subject of much public debate. Due to the limited number of roadways serving the
City, most of the traffic entering and exiting the City travels through this inter-
section, whose current geometries prOVide drivers approaching from the south
with litde time to maneuver into the appropriate lane after crossing the intersec-

lane to choose and have created
unnecessary traffic congestion.
The geometrics of this intersection
are further compli-cated by the
introduction of an Ojai Valley Trail,
which crosses Ojai Avenue at this
intersection. One intersection imÂ·
provement option recently dis-
cussed involved the installation of
a traffic circle at the ''Y.'' Although
the option was recognized as being
physically possible and as facilitat-
ing the movement of large num-
bers of automobiles through the Circulation Conflicts at "Y" Intersection
''Y,'' this concept was rejected because it would create a negative impact on pedes-
trian and bicycle circulation through the intersection.
As with many communities, Ojai has experienced a gradual acceptance and adop-
tion of uniform improvement standards to be applied throughout the community.
Although these standards bring a uniformity of design to the various components
of community infrastructure, their implementation has also begun to erode the
uniqueness of the community, especially in the realm of public improvements such
as roadways. This is evident in areas where new development has encroached into
older settings, imposing typical suburban development standards without a clear
plan for the end product. The result is typified by a rural street edge, characterized
by a dirt, gravel or asphalt path and soft street shoulder, suddenly interrupted by a
portion of concrete curb and gutter with sidewalk. Since it is unlikely that the
balance of the improvements will be made any time soon, the piecemeal imple-
mentation of such standards serves to disrupt the gentle small town, rural character
that the residents likely found more appealing in the first place.
A key concept of the Ojai General Plan Circulation Element is that the community's
roadway and transportation system is an integral part of the community's character,
its quality of life, and its economic livelihood. Ojai's historic downtown, which is
the center of the community's commercial and cultural focus, was developed along
Highway 150 to enhance the City's accessibility to visitors. Therefore, while it is
important to provide for the movement of traffic within, as well as through the
City, this objective will not be permitted to compromise the more important objec-
tive of preserving the community's essential character and the area's natural
environment which makes Ojai an attractive place to visit, live, and work.
Ojai believes that a constantly expanding circulation network and an endless se-
quence of programmed street improvements will not solve the problems of local
traffic congestion, and may in fact result in an irretrievable loss of the essential
qualities that make Ojai a desirable community. Expansion of the area's roadway
system using traditional traffic engineering principles and standards will not fit well

             ensures that the City of Ojai maintains and enhances the characteristics that em-
             body a truly "livable community" (see Figure 3 on previous page).
             The provisions of the General Plan also ensure that the City will act responsibly in
             reviewing proposals for new development. The Circulation Element recognizes
             that new development cannot be permitted to exacerbate existing traffic congestion
             problems, and that new development must be responsible for contributing to
             appropriate solutions.
Traffic Calming
             "Traffic calming" refers to programs designed to increase the compatibility of road-
             ways with their surrounding environment, as well as increase their carrying capac-
             ity, by creating a steady flow of traffic at slower speeds. By calming (slowing)
             traffic, less space is needed between automobiles to maintain safe stopping dis-
             tances, thereby allowing more vehicles to use roadways without requiring widen-
             ing. The effect of traffic calming is to create a safer, quieter environment for adja-
             cent land uses (Figure 4).

             Traffic calming techniques which may be incorporated into the City's circulation
             system include: speed humps, roundabouts, and neck-downs. Speed humps are
             raised roadway pavement areas running across the entire width of a street that
             normally have a height of 3 to 4 inches and a length of approximately 12 feet.
             Speed humps represent a lesser risk to vehicles than do traditional speed bumps,
             and have the advantage of being largely self-enforCing and or creating a visual
             impression, real or perceived, that a street is not intended for high speeds or
             "through" traffic. A roundabout is an at-grade intersection having a one-way circu-

                              Neck-downs consist of landscaped islands which are used to either narrow down a
                              roadway, or to define a parking lane on either side of a roadway. They can be used
                              to define entries into local residential neighborhoods, thereby discouraging
                              through traffic. They can also be used to create subtle changes in direction along
                              existing roadways by placing landscaping within existing parking lanes on one side
                              of the street, and providing parking and neck-downs on alternating sides of the
                              street (Figures 5a and 5b).

Circulation Element
Plan of Trails includes a combination of four different types of trail sections, a
special pedestrian district, and various support facilities.
Ojai Valley Trail
The Ojai Valley Trail provides a shared off-street pedestrian, bicycle, and equestrian
trail that connects to the Ventura County trails system. This trail provides recre-
ation and commuter connections along Highway 150 and 33. Extensions of this
trail also connect the Pedestrian Enhancement District, Ojai Village and Town
Center, Libbey Park, and Soule Park (Figures 7 and 8).
Bicycle and Pedestrian Trails
The Bike and Pedestrian Trail system includes a number of specialized trail sections
throughout Ojai. The trails denote where pedestrian and bicycle circulation is
most appropriate. The Trail also provides access to the major recreation facilities,
the Pedestrian Enhancement District, Ojai Village and Town Center, Ojai Valley
Trail system as well as National Park and local hiking and walking trails. The trail
system includes Class I, II, and III trails (Figures 7 and 8).
Trail Support Facilities
At strategic points in the trails system, facilities designed for the convenience of
trail users are planned to be provided (Figure 7). Such facilities may include
benches, drinking fountains, restrooms, picnic areas, interpretive and directional
signage, community information kiosks, equestrian staging, and automobile and
bicycle parking areas.
The type of facilities that will be provided at any particular location is dependent
on the physical conditions of the site.
Trail Stop
Generally located at major junctions of the trails system, trail stops will include, at
a minimum, directional signage depicting the Ojai trails system. Some trail stops
may also include rest areas, benches and drinking fountains, or be combined with
other trail support facilities (Figure 7).

Planning for the Pedestrian
             Sidewalks and Paths
             The City of Ojai is dedicated to creating a pedes-
             trian environment that is safe, efficient, and acces-
             sible to all residents. At the same time Ojai recog-
             nizes that different areas of the community require
             different sidewalk and pedestrian treatments con-
             sistent with the individual characteristics of the
             neighborhood. The City of Ojai, therefore, will
             strive to achieve a sare and comfortable walking environ
             ment by using a variety of sidewalk and path de-
             signs thrQughout the community. Due to the
             uniqueness of each street section, the City will ana-
             lyze the physical characteristics of the street right-
             of-way prior to trail implementation to determine
            "the appropriate sidewalk, path or other pedestrian
             facility is to be used (Figure 7). It is the City's in- Sidewalk Oak
             tent to logically transition sidewalk and trail sections so as to achieve a safe, com-
             fortable, and logical sidewalk and pedestrian path network.
             Site Development Considerations
             New developments will be required to be designed with pedestrians in mind, and
             thereby reduce pedestrian/auto conflicts and encourage people to walk. For exam-
             ple, buildings may be clustered along a pedestrian corridor or adjacent to a public
             walkway to reduce the distance for people to walk between buildings once they
             leave their cars, and to encourage drivers to leave their cars at home. The desirabil-
             ity of on-site pedestrian circulation, its connection to public sidewalks, trails,
             automobile circulation, and local and regional transit is an important factor in
             determining a new development's consistency with Ojai's character.
             Pedestrian Enhancement District (PED)
             The General Plan recognizes that, if walking is to be encouraged for both recre-
             ation and as an alternative fonn of transportation, pedestrians must feel safe and
             secure from adjacent street traffic; they must be provided with sidewalks and
             pedestrian paths that create logical and continuous connections between uses; and
             the over-all walking experience must be an enjoyable one. In order to meet these
             objectives, the General Plan makes a substantial commitment to pedestrian needs
             throughout the community. This commitment includes the creation of land use
             designations which focus on allowing residents to live and work at the same loca-
                                                                             r: Icoi40 J Iproiectlplan lfinallcirc.ele

              tion, implementation of a comprehensive trail system, and provision of efficient
             local transit network.
             In addition, the General Plan designates an area within the City's Town Center and
             Village as a special "enhancement" district that will focus on making improvements
             to support pedestrian activities. This "Pedestrian Enhancement District" or PED
             delineates an area in the community where the movement of pedestrians is an
             important aspect of the area's character. New development and public improve-
             ments within this area will be designed to favor pedestrian circulation. Typical
             improvements are to include: pedestrian oriented signage, street furniture, and
             landscaping; wide and enhanced sidewalk paving; prominent pedestrian street
             crossings; and narrowed street sections.
Trail Design Principles
             The trail system identified above is intended to create an integrated "system" that
             serves local commuter, recreation, and tourist needs as well as to prOVide connec-
             tions to the regional trails system. In delineating the Master Plan of Trails, several
             principles were used to prOvide continuity, improve public access, provide logical
             transition and destinations, and ensure the safety of trail users. These design
             prinCiples will be used as review criteria for alI new projects which are adjacent to
             or may have an impact on the planned trails system, to ensure that continuity,
             access, logic, and safety considerations are maintained and/or enhanced.
             Continuity
             Using the Ojai ValIey Trail as the backbone, each trail has been planned to be an
             integral part of an overall network. New development will be required to respect
             this continuity and ensure that existing and future trail through routes and access
             points are maintained.
             Community Access
             Continued, unrestricted use of the trail system for recreation and commuting, as
             well as prOViding alternatives to the automobile is an important contributor to
             Ojai's over-alI character. It is thus Ojai's intent to retain and expand the public's

            The Ojai trail system links neighborhoods, recreation, commercial and employment
            centers in the community, as well as other regional trail and open space systems.
            New development will be expected to integrate the utilitarian and recreational
            aspects of the trail system in project design.
            Safety
            Safety is a high priority for the trail system. Visibility of trails and trail crossings, as
            well as provision of appropriate security measures along trail routes are important
            considerations in the design of the system.
FACIliTATING THE USE OF PUBliC TRANSIT
            The City of Ojai sponsors a local transit service called the Ojai Trolley. The Trolley
            currently operates seven days per week from 7:30 a.m. until 5:30 p.m., and serves
            popular shopping areas, the Ojai Community Hospital, Ojai Valley Inn, Whispering
            Oaks, the community center, and Meiners Oaks. Regional transit service is pro-
            vided by South Coast Area Transit (SCAT), which operates a line connecting Ojai to
            downtown Ventura through Meiners Oaks and along State Highway 33. The SCAT
            line operates seven days per week from 5:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Both lines run on
            an hourly basis. An express route for commuters from Ojai to Ventura was canÂ·
            celed due to lack of ridership.
            As a means of reducing traffic and improving air quality, it is the intent of the
            General Plan to increase public transit ridership. This will be accomplished
            through a combination of public education, provision of transit amenities, and
            coordination of local Trolley and regional SCAT line schedules. A public education
            program will be undertaken to increase the public's awareness of area transit
            services. This education program will also be used to increase the public's under-
            standing of the advantages of public transit, including its role in reducing traffic
            congestion and improving area air quality.
            Within new developments that could generate significant amounts of transit rider-
            ship (e.g., shopping, schools, senior housing), bus turnouts and bus shelters will
            be required to be provided, if requested by SCAT or if needed to enhance Trolley
            services and ridership. Where such transit amenities are provided, new develop-
            ment will also be required to provide convenient pedestrian access between new
            uses and transit stops.
            Currently, Trolley and SCAT services run independently. The City of Ojai will work
            with SCAT to coordinate Trolley and SCAT bus schedules to facilitate transfers
                                                                               r.lcoj40 Ilprojectiplan \fillallcirc.ele

            both systems.
PUBliC UTIUTY CORRIDORS
            In addition to roadways, trails, and public transit, municipal Circulation Elements
            are required to address the need for public utility corridors for the deliveryÂ· of
            energy resources (gas and electricity), disposal of sewage, and provision of other
            public utilities (e.g., telephone, cable television). The General Plan intends that
            such utility corridors follow the same rules as for roadways, avoiding significant
            impacts on the natural environment, preserving oak trees, and fitting comfortably
            into the community's small town character. As a result, all such utilities are to be
            located below ground and within public street rights-of-way or dedicated utility
            rights-of-way or easements. New utility corridors are to be protective of the area's
            natural environment, and are to preserve mature oaks in place.
VALLEY WIDE SOLUTIONS TO TRAFFIC CONGESTION
            Morning and evening commutes in and out of the City are a major concern for Ojai
            residents. Due to the narrow width of State Highway 33, which connects Ojai to
            Ventura, commuters are often forced to negotiate the two lane highway in a long
            line of vehicles. Without adequate width to handle turns or slow moving traffic,
            congestion is common, especially dUring the evening peak commute hour. Con-
            gestion problems are particularly acute in the communities of Casitas Springs and
            Mira Monte, where numerous driveways front along the State Highway.
            Although residents are clearly frustrated with increasing congestion along State
            Highway 33, many have concluded that the commuter traffic is the price to be paid
            for living in Ojai and for protection of the rural character of the canyon connecting
            Ojai to Ventura. They feel that widening State Highway 33 would only result in
            temporary traffic improvements as it would also mean bringing additional develop-
            ment to the Ojai Valley.
            County policies have limited the widening of State Highway 33 due to the impacts
            which would result on adjacent rural communities. A bypass around these commu-
            nities is being proposed by the County and has been included in the State Trans-
            portation Improvement Program; however, funding for such a project is unlikely to
            occur within the planning horizon of the Ojai General Plan. In the absence of a
            comprehensive widening project, the County is proposing use of traffic controls,
            widening at critical intersections, and provision of acceleration and deceleration
            lanes, where feasible, to prOvide partial relief from congestion problems.
            The Circulation Element proposes taking a valley wide approach to solving conges-
            tion problems along State Highway 33. This would include limitations on develop-
            ment within both the County and City to reduce traffic impacts on the Highway
                                                                            r: 1coj40 I1projectlplan (fittal1circ.ele

until physical improvements and widening is in place, emphasizing transit alterna-

The City of Ojai has adopted residential growth controls, and has tied the rate of
commercial growth to population growth. Ventura County has adopted residential
growth controls for the Ojai Valley area. In addition, Policy 4.2.2.4 of the Ventura
County General Plan prohibits discretionary development that would add any
traffic on State Highway 33 during critical weekday commuter traffic periods with-
out appropriate mitigation.} The County has not established commercial growth
controls.
The net result of these policies is a significant inducement for commercial develop-
ment within the unincorporated portions of the Ojai Valley, where the vast majority
of commercially zoned land actually fronts on the highway. While it may be argued
that new commercial uses along State Highway 33 would not violate County policy
because these uses would cater specifically to commuters during peak commute
hours, and that provisions of acceleration/deceleration lanes would mitigate peak
hour impacts, continuing commercial development along the State Highway will
increase overall traffic on the highway and eventually result in significant off-peak
congestion impacts by increasing the number of conflicting left tum movements 2
The Ojai General Plan proposes that the County link commercial growth to resi-
dential growth, thereby removing the advantage of developing commercial uses in
the County.
}
     Policy AQ-P4 of the Ojai General Plan Air Quality Element prohibits approval of develop-
     ment projects that "do not mitigate their peak hour trips on State Highway 33 at the Edison
     curve through Castias Springs except for affordable housing projects."

     Currently, Ojai commuters can stop at commercial uses along the east frontage of the
     highway on cheir way home without reqUiring a left tum movement. However. during off~
     peak hours and weekends. patrons would be required to make left tum movements either
     into or from commercial establishments.

                   compromise the integrity of Ojai's bicycle and pedestrian circulation sys-
                   tems. Prohibit roadway and intersection improvements which would create
                   gaps in the community's bicycle and pedestrian trails systems.
            CIR-15 Require that new commercial, industrial, institutional, and recreational uses
                   be designed to facilitate pedestrian and bicycle access, giving on-site pedes-
                   trian and bicycle access equal priority to on-site automobile circulation.
            CIR-16 Enhance pedestrian safety by:
                   â¢       providing four-way stops at heavily used trail/street crossings;
                   â¢       constructing street "neck-downs" to narrow street crossings at key
                           pedestrian crossing locations; and
                   â¢       lengthening the "WALK/DON'T WALK" cycle or proViding a dedi-
                           cated pedestrian walk phase, including diagonal pedestrian cross-
                           ings at Signalized intersections.
            CIR-17 Provide new pedestrian connections between Libbey Park and those uses
                   which front Montgomery Avenue.
FACIIJTATING USE OF PUBUC TRANSIT
            CIR-18 Ensure public awareness of available public transit services through a com-
                   munity outreach program, which provides information on the availability of
                   transit services, and provides information on advantages of public transit
                   usage such as reduced traffic congestion and improved air quality.
            CIR-19 Require the provision of transit amenities including, but not limited to, bus
                   turnouts and bus shelters in new developments which can provide a signifi-
                   cant source of transit ridership (e.g., shopping, schools, senior housing)
                   when such facilities could improve Trolley service or ridership, and when
                   requested by SCAT.
            CIR-20 For uses located adjacent to transit stops, require the provision of conve-
                   nient pedestrian access between the development and the transit stop.
            CIR-21 Work with SCAT to coordinate SCAT and Trolley service schedules, increas-
                   ing the feasibility of passengers transferring from one system to the other.
            CIR-22 Work with SCAT to reinstate express commuter service on at least a trial
                   basis following the community outreach program described in Policy CIR-
                   18.

PUBUC UTIliTY CORRIDORS
            CIR-23 Require all new utilities to be placed underground3 and to be routed in a
                   manner which protects Ojai's unique community character, preserves ma-
                   ture oak and sycamore trees, and maintains the quality of the area's natural
                   environment.
VAIJ.EYWIDE SOLUTIONS TO TRAFFIC CONGESTION
            CIR-24 Ensure that new developments do not contribute to further deterioration of
                   levels of service on the regional roadway system, particularly with regard to
                   State Highway 33. Exceptions to this policy may be made for affordable
                   housing developments needed to achieve adopted Housing Element objec-
                   tives for the production of housing where no feasible mitigation measures
                   exist consistent with the need for production of affordable housing.
            CIR-25 Continue to tie the amount of Ojai's new commercial growth to the rate of
                   population increase in the City, and work with Ventura County to achieve
                   similar management of commercial growth within unincorporated areas,
                   thereby providing for the rational management of new traffic-generating
                   sources.
            CIR-26 Work with Ventura County and Caltrans to establish a funding mechanism
                   for needed improvements along State Highway 33.
            CIR-27 Ensure that the provision of roadway carrying capacity improvements sup-
                   ports, rather than leads, the determination of desired land uses and land
                   use character. While the absence of roadway carrying capacity presents a
                   constraint to development, its availability should not be permitted to lead
                   to development which is inconsistent with the desired character of the
                   community or the need to protect the area's natural environment.
            3      Electrical lines in excess of 66kv may be placed above ground when necessary.

DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
               The Development Review portion of the Circulation Element Implementation
               Program is intended to ensure that new development is consistent with the General
               Plan. This portion of the Circulation Element outlines the criteria that will be used
               to determine development requirements, as well as the site-specific analysis that
               will be needed. To ensure consistency with the Circulation Element, the follOWing
               fundamental questions need to be answered for each proposed development
               project:
               ./      Is the project design consistent with Circulation Element policies?
               ./      What roadway improvements need to be provided?
               ./      What trail improvements need to be provided?
Is the Project Design Consistent with Circulation Element Policies?
               All proposed discretionary development projects are to be consistent with the
               policies of the Circulation Element. Thus, the City will review policies CIR-3
               through CIR-20 to determine what modifications, if any, need to be made to the
               proposed discretionary development project to make it consistent with Circulation
               Element policies.
What Roadway Improvements Need to Be Provided?
               Individual developments will be reviewed to determine applicable roadway im-
               provement requirements by comparing them to the Circulation Element Map
               (Figure 9) and the Roadway Classification Table (Table B). At a minimum, new
               developments will be conditioned to provide the following improvements:

             Individual developments will be reviewed to determine applicable trail improve-
             ment requirements by comparing them to the Trail Classification System (Figure 8).
             At a minimum, new developments will be conditioned to provide the following
             improvements:
             â¢       Appropriate physical improvements to link the site to the existing trail
                      system;
             â¢       Appropriate easements/rights-of-way to link the site to the planned trail
                      system;
             â¢       Appropriate easements/rights-of-way for planned trails through or adjacent
                      to the site; and
             â¢        Directional signage and traffic controls to ensure trail safety.

           Trail Standards
           The basic trail standards to be used for implementation of the Trail Classification
            System are depicted in Figure 8, which identifies proposed location and width of
            each trail type depicted in Figure 7. It is recognized that these standards m.ay need
            to be modified, revised, or adapted to site-specific physical or environmental con-
           straints as each trail is constructed.

           review, the City Council will review and revise the priorities for individual studies.
           Upon completion of any study, specific implementation programs may be adopted
           as appropriate.
           Beginning with the first budget cycle follOWing one year after adoption of the
           Circulation Element, the City Council will annually review the list of special studies
           listed in this section and to revise the priorities of these studies, based on available
           resources. Upon completion of each study, appropriate General Plan implementa-
           tion programs may be added to the Implementation and Monitoring Program
           contained in the General Plan.
           The funding sources for each action listed below will be assigned annually as part
           of the General Plan Review and Update and the City's annual budget process.

            Conservation Element
            INTRODUCTION
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF THE ELEMENT
            The Conservation Element of the Ojai General Plan was prepared in conformance
            with State, law and pursuant to the realization of the City of Ojai General Plan
            overall goals, objectives and policies. The Element identifies natural resources;
            defines issues pertaining to the preservation of resources; formulates goals and
            objectives aimed at conservation of resources; and established policies and
            programs to implement objectives of long-term preservation and wise utilization
            of resources.
            The purpose of the Conservation element is to defme the City's resource
            conservation goals and to establish tools and mechanisms to obtain the desired
            goals. The Conservation Element, in combination with the Ojai Open Space
            Element, is formulated to guide the long-term management of the resources within
            City boundaries and to establish policy guidelines in its planning area. An inventory
            of these resources is provided in the Ojai Master Environmental Assessment
            (MEA). From the MEA's resource inventory, goals, policies and programs were
            formulated to ensure sound management and proper utilization and conservation
            of all resources of the City and preserved Ojai's unique living environment.
ASSUMPTIONS/DEFINITIONS
            The Conservation Element of the Ojai General Plan has been prepared pursuant
            to requirements of State Law. The Element is in conformance with the overall
            General Plan goals of the City of Ojai and has been formulated in a manner to
            implement the goals.
            As a premise to the establishment of the General Plan Conservation Element and
            its goals and policies, an outline of defmitions and assumptions used to create the
            Conservation Element is provided below:
                 o   Conservation involves a recognition and respect of all the earth's resources,
                     in that their management and preservation is the responsibility of our
                     fellow man for use and appreciation by future generations.
                 o   Conservation assumes that all things are either existing or potential
                     resources. Most resources are finite and if they are to be expended, it
                     should be done in a prudent and judicious manner.
                 o   Conservation inherently respects the inter-relationship between needs for
                     utilization and resources. It further establishes priorities which will

                     benefit of all living things.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            Under State Law, a City is responsible for preparing a comprehensive General Plan
            for the long-term physical development of the City. Section 65302, pertaining to

       in and around such trees.
       o   The area within the dripline of oak trees should not be disturbed.
       o   No impervious surfaces should be placed beneath these trees that will
           prevent soil aeration and root respiration.
       o   To avoid root-rot and disease, no landscape ground covers requiring
           year round irrigation shall be planted on new development parcels.
       o   Grading around oak and sycamore trees should not change the ground
           grade and drainage patterns in order to avoid the impoundment of
           water and subsequent root rot.
       o   Heavy equipment should not be operated beneath oaks and sycamores
           in order to avoid soil compaction and root suffocation.
       o   Trenching for the installation of utilities should avoid the root zone of
           oak and sycamore trees.
       Program: The City will review the Recreation, Land Use and Open Space

                             INTRODUCTION
          BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF THE LAND USE ELEMENT
                                      jai is a special place that evokes a
                              O       certain small town feeling in those
                                      who live or visit here. Upon entering
                             Ojai, one cannot help but gain an under-
                             standing of what small towns really are; OJ ai's
                             character harkens back to the "traditional"
                             small town, not the modern conception of
                             what small town image should be. For resi-
                             dents and visitors alike, Ojai is a friendly, com-
                             fortable place; it is familiar. For those who

                             social, phYSical, and economic health and vitality. The Land Use Element, there-
                             fore, focuses on the organization of the community's phYSical environment into
                             logical, functional, and Visually pleasing patterns that are consistent with local
                             social values. Of primary concern are the type, intensity, location, and character

                             However, as this infill occurs, the City will face Significant challenges. Ojai's natural
                             setting and significant environmental features need to be protected, and at the
                             same time, private property rights need to be recognized.
                             Ojai residents recognize that preservation of the community's small town character
                             is not a matter of chance, but requires concerted action and vigilance. Thus, the
                             City has established residential and commercial growth management programs, as
                             well as design guidelines. The effect of these programs is to ensure that the rate,

            required to adopt, as part of its General Plan, a Land Use Element which:
                      "designates the proposed general distribution and general location
                      and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry,
                      open space, including agriculture, natural resources, recreation,
                      and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings and
                      grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other
                      categories ofpublic andprivate uses of land. The land use element
                      shall include a statement of the standards ofpopulation density

           GENERAL PLAN APPROACH
PRESERVING OJAl'S SMALL TOWN CHARACTER
              t is the Ojai General Plan's approach to preserve the community's "small town"
           I  character by using the physical, environmental, and social aspects of the
              community that form its character as the criteria for determining the
           appropriateness of new development. Thus, new development must respect or
           enhance the City's small town feel and fit in with the existing land use pattern. A
           key component to Ojai's approach is to use the unique community attributes,
           overall community structure, and individual architectural and urban design features
           that together create Ojai's unique small town character. These will also act as the
           guiding principles for the design of new development projects, thus achieving a
           compatible "fit" between new development and the existing characteristics of the
           surrounding community, neighborhood, and area where they are developed (see
           Figure 3).
           The residents of Ojai share a common goal of ensuring that the existing "sense of
           community" is maintained, and that local social values are reflected in community
           and governmental decision making and the City's development review process.
                      Ojai's Land Planning and Design Approach:
              New developments shall use Ojai's unique community attributes, structure,
                    andfeatures as the guiding principles for all new project designs.

            Land Use Element
            The following provides a general description of the attributes, structure, and
            features that together make up Ojai's small town character. Community standards
            for all new development in Ojai are also detailed in the General Plan Land Use
            Implementation and Monitoring section of the Land Use Element.
Community Attributes
           As part of its approach to land use planning and community design, the Ojai
            General Plan recognizes a number of unique community attributes that together
            create Ojai's small town character. These attributes include those aspects of life in
            Ojai which attracted residents to the Ojai Valley, as well as what keeps residents
            from moving somewhere else. New development is to be compatible with these
            attributes to ensure compatibility with Ojai's community character.
                                                   Ojai Community Attributes
                                 0iai is a quiet, peaceful community whose pictu.resque valley setting,
                              architectural character, and protected natural environment combine to
                         provide a refuge from the chaotic sprawl of the metropolitan Los Angeles ar-

                         ...successfully blends the best ofsmall town lifestyles and a tourist economy.
                     Figure 4 - Community Attributes
Community Structure
           Ojai's community structure is comprised of five general types of land uses: RuraV
           Open Space, Suburban, Village, Employment-Generating, and the Downtown.
           Overall, Ojai is surrounded by a ring of rural and open space lands which provide
           definition to the developed portions of the community. Within this ring are a
           variety of suburban density residential neighborhoods, as well as commercial
           developments, which are generally located along Ojai Avenue. North of the
           downtown area is a village-type area of older residential neighborhoods mixed with
           small scale commercial development. At the center of Ojai is a traditional small
           town downtown which functions as the civic, cultural, and social heart of the
                                                                                    r.lcoj40 J lero;ectle1anlfinal1landuse.lIew

community. Southeast of downtown is an area of small industrial uses, as well as a
larger suburban business park development. New development needs to not only
establish a functional relationship with its site and surrounding properties, but
must also establish a comfortable fit with the overall structure of the community as
described below (see Figure 5).
In requiring that new development be consistent with existing land use patterns
and character, the General Plan recognizes that Ojai's unique land use character is
composed of a number of different types of uses that when taken together add
interest and diversity to the community. It is Ojai's intent, therefore, to preserve
this same diversity and individuality in new residential and commercial
development while ensuring that all new development "fit' with the surrounding
characteristics of each neighborhood area.

It is the intent of the General Plan to retain the community's existing land use
structure. This structure is depicted in the General Plan Land Use Plan which
outlines the general distribution of land uses that, along with the Land Use
Element text, define the types and intensities of uses, densities, standards and, in
some cases, the conditions under which the uses are considered to be appropriate.

The Land Use Plan carries out the community's goal to guide future development
and manage growth in a way that promotes the heath, safety, and welfare of Ojai
residents. A copy of the Land Use Plan is provided in a map pocket at the end of
the General Plan.
Rural and Open Space Lands
One of the most unique characteris-
tics of Ojai is that the edge of devel-
opment is defined by an abundance
of open land which surrounds the
community.         Physically, Ojai is
bordered on the north by the Santa
Ynez Mountains and the Los Padres
National Forest, and on the south by
Sulphur       Mountain.           These
topographic features stand as a TI OÂ· . V. II
backdrop to the community, and add           Ie 'Ia! a ry
opportunities for significant views and vistas both to and from the community. The
predominant development pattern along the highway corridors leading east and
west from Ojai is made up of a mixture of large citrus groves, range land, and other
agricultural uses. These rural and open land uses provide an important separation
between the City of Ojai and surrounding communities, and are a Significant
component of Ojai's small town character.
It is the City's intent that the large unbroken expanses of open lands around the
perimeter of the community be preserved. Development within these perimeter
lands is intended to consist of agricultural open space and very low intensity
development (less than I dwelling unit/lO acres [dulac]).
Suburban Development
The perimeter of Ojai's existing developed lands consists of suburban develop-
ment, much of it newer single family detached residential homes in the familiar
Southern California style. These neighborhoods were generally developed as
individual entities with few points of entry and little connection to the overall
community, and are designed physically and architecturally to facilitate automobile
travel. There is no easy connection to walking/bicycle paths, trails or designated
bicycle lanes leading into the center of town. The lack of street trees and the
presence of tract housing, including sidewalks at curbs, serves to further discon-
nect some of these developments with the character of Ojai. It is the city's intent
not to repeat this style of development.

Land Use Element
There are, however, some
excellent examples of suburban
neighborhoods within Ojai,
which will serve as models for
future neighborhoods.           The
"Acbolada" is a subdivision that,
at one time, comprised the outer
edge of the developed town. Its
rock and tree-lined streets mean-
der with the topography and
serve to tie a diverse collection
of older and newer homes
together with a strong "sense of      The Arbolada
place" that is unmistakably Ojai.
In addition to the Acbolada, older residential neighborhoods in the vicinity of the
downtown can serve as models for future development. These neighborhoods
exhibit a grid street pattern, and were built by individual contractors, meaning that
each home is a unique architectural statement, even though many of these
neighborhoods consist of modestly sized homes. The elimination of tract housing
with its repetitive architecture is key to preserving Ojai's unique small town
character.
There is also a substantial amount of
suburban commercial development
that is distinguished by large front
setbacks and parking between the
street and buildings. Most of this
development occurred during the past
30 years, and is located on the
perimeter of the community at the
west and east ends of Highway 150. In
addition, one such area of suburban
style development can be found just to
the west of the town core. This area is Suburban Commercial Development
composed of grocery, banks, restau-
rants, and other related commercial uses. The large building setbacks and street-
oriented parking make the area unfrienclly to pedestrians and bicyclists, and creates
an unfortunate barrier between the neighborhood to the west and the town center
to the east. The General Plan strives to avoid recreating this style of commercial
development. Instead, the General Plan intends that new commercial development
be small in scale, and similar in character to commercial development found in and
around the downtown area. In these areas, buildings are close to the street, and
encourage pedestrian and bicycle access between buildings.

Village Area
As one approaches the downtown area from almost any side street, buildings be-
come noticeably more dense, as lots become smaller and lot coverage increases.
Building setbacks lessen, and residential uses are mixed in with a variety of low
intensity commercial uses, such as lodging, realty, small medical and other service-
related office space, as well as some retail shops, such as antique stores and art gal-
leries.
                                                  The architecture of these areas
                                                  varies widely, and includes a mix of
                                                  building types and styles, from old

The older residential neighborhoods
in the central portion of Ojai reflect a
traditional style of development which
is currently enjoying a revival
throughout the United States, and
which the City wants for its newer
neighborhoods. These traditional or
"neotraditional"         neighborhoods
feature a grid street system, and tend
to de.emphasize the presence of
automobiles by using narrower street
sections than are typically found in
suburban style developments. The Commercial                Development                within             an

neighborhood as it would be in a suburban subdivision. It is this traditional style
of development that Ojai desires for its future.
Commercial development within this area is pedestrian in scale, unique in their use
(art galleries, bed and breakfast) or focused at serving the personal service needs of
the surrounding neighborhoods. It is this style of mixed-use development that Ojai
desires for its future.
The Town Center
Found primarily in and around Ojai's historic downtown, the area's development
pattern is characterized by smaller, contiguous buildings located at the immediate
edge of the public right-of-way. These smaller buildings with many shop store-
fronts and entries ensure a busy pedestrian atmosphere. Most of the buildings in
and around the town core are low-lying, one and two stoty structures of plaster,
wood or masonry exterior.
The strength of Ojai's town core as
a memorable place can be attri-
buted to the vision of Edmond
Drummond Libbey, whose fman-
cial support in the early 1900s
resulted in the formalized plan for
the town centered on a civic park
and small commercial district. It is
the intent of the Ojai General Plan
to preserve this focus on a civic
park (Libbey Park), and to retain
the small size of the central
commercial district. The architec- TIle Arcade at the Town Center
ture of the downtown's key
structures includes the arcade, which brought together a row of diverse
commercial buildings behind an elegant Spanish colonnade, and the post office,
whose tower serves as a visual landmark to Signify arrival at the center of town.
Although many intrusions and diverging styles have been developed in and around
this center, the images of these two structures as a relaxed but elegant backdrop to
the park are so strong that their impression seems to leave little room for anything
else. New development within the downtown area is to be smaller in scale than
these structures, and should not compete for visual prominence with them. New
development should also incorporate the pedestrian-friendly design of the
traditional downtown, with buildings set at the sidewalk and parking located
behind.
In most circumstances, there is a sharp line of delineation between the "village"
areas around the town center and the center itself. Often, a transition in street

                            a change in building type and lot coverage, which does well to emphasize the
                            ending of one district and the beginning of another.
                            It is the community's intent to recognize the significant impact that a traditional
                            downtown has had on Ojai's image as a small town by ensuring that new
                            development be compatible with the area's historic and architectural features, as
                            well as the civic and cultural focus the area provides to the community. Through
                            the implementation of General Plan policies, Ojai will strive to retain the Town
                            Center's importance as a traditional downtown for the enjoyment of visitors as well
                            as residents.

                            To the east of Libbey Park, southeast of the downtown area, is an area of small
                            industrial uses, as well as a larger modem business park. Industrial development
                            outside of the business park primarily consist of small uses on individual lots.
                            Immediately east of Libbey Park are areas zoned for manufacturing use that are
                            primarily residential in character, as well as areas that consist of a mix of residential
                            and industrial uses. It is the intent of the General Plan to both protect existing
                            residential uses, as well as to allow for an expansion of employment opportunities
                            by establishing:

                             The Ojai General Plan also identifies several special areas in the community that
                             possess unique development and design opportunities and needs. Within these
                             areas, Ojai's approach to land use planning is to provide conceptual designs in the
                             implementation portion of the Land Use Element to provide project deSigners with
                             a starting point from which new developments may be created that fit with the
                             community's small town character. These conceptual deSigns can be found

           environment also extends geographically, and is reflected in General Plan
           provisions related to regional planning and visioning programs, induding
           programs that indirectly affect the City of Ojal.
           The Ojai General Plan land use approach recognizes that the City must take a
           stewardship role in the management of the natural environment in both Ojal and
           the larger Ojal Valley where impacts to natural resources would impinge on
           community character and the quality of life of Ojal residents. In the review of
           individual projects, the Ojal General Plan considers natural features such as
           established trees, arroyos, streambeds, meadows, hillsides, and viewshed as critical
           elements of a project design that are to be proactively preserved and embellished
           upon in the design of new development.
BALANCING SMAIL TOWN liFE WITH A VIBRANT TOURIST ECONOMY
           The General Plan recognizes that Ojal residents have expressed the need to nurture
           and expand the range of community events that bring the community together and
           keep residents and families involved in local activities. Along with the physical
           components that comprise OJai's small town character, the large number of
           community cultural activities available to Ojal residents is a significant element of
           its small town character and strong sense of community. For a town of its size, Ojal
           has an unusually active community in terms of community events, such as the Ojal
           Music Festival, Summer Concert Series, Ojai Tennis Tournament, PGA Seniors Golf
           Classic, Ojal Mexican Fiesta, and the Ojal Theater Company's "Shakespeare in the
           Park." Ojal also boasts extensive public and private cultural facilities, such as art
           galleries and studios, as well as Libbey Bowl, which houses concerts and theater
           productions.

           ability to provide services and facilities that are not normally available in towns of
           OJai's size.
          While the area's visitor serving economy provides substantial benefits, it can at
           times, also impinge on the area's small town character by attracting large numbers
           of people, particularly during major events. Because the location of community,
           culrural, and tourist facilities encourages considerable pedestrian and bicycle activi-
           ty within the Town Center, congestion in this area during major community events
           can be highly disruptive. In addition, residents occasionally raise the concern that
           Ojai's commercial sector caters too much to tourists, fearuring expensive specialty
          goods, and sometimes neglects the daily shopping needs of local residents.
          It is the intent of the General Plan to both enhance the City's ability to continue to
          foster the community spirit that major events bring to the community, as well as to
          provide opportunities for new business which cater to local needs to grow and
          become successful. The City will continue to tap into the community's volunteer
          resourcefulness to ensure community events are a part of, but are not imposed on
          OJai's small town character. Implementation of the Village Mixed-Use land use
          designation will provide opportunities for new locally serving businesses, and
          improve pedestrian accessibility within the City's town center without negatively
          impacting the City's small town character.
MANAGING THE PACE OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
          The pace of development in the 1970s alerted the City of Ojai to the problems of
          rapid growth -- degradation of air and water quality, congested streets, and an
           inability for area public services and facilities to keep up with increasing demands.
          Mass produced suburban housing tracts with their repetitive architecrure nearly
          replaced traditional neighborhoods as the predominant housing type within the
          City. Unconstrained growth threatened to forever change the small town character
           that made Ojai such an desirable community and had attracted such an interest in
                                                                        r: lco;40 Ilproject!planl/illal\landuse.nelV

development. Thus, in 1979, the City adopted residential growth controls to
manage the pace of single family and multiple family development. Affordable
housing projects, such as the recently completed 21 unit Montgomery Oaks deve-
lopment, were exempted from residential growth controls.
Through the 1980s, commercial development continued. It became apparent that
air and water quality were still threatened, traffic congestion continued to mount,
and public services and facilities still struggled to maintain pace with the area's rate
of growth. Commercial centers were being developed at a rate faster than the
City's rate of population increase, and as commercial development expanded in a
nearly continuous corridor along Ojai Avenue, the vitality of the downtown area
was at risk. In addition, Ojai's overall small town character was threatened as the
City became increasingly commercial in nature, and the City's commercial base
tilted toward serving the area's tourist population. Thus, in 1991, the City adopted
commercial and office growth controls to tie the rate of commercial and office
development within the City to the City's rate of population growth.
The purposes of the City's growth control ordinances remain valid today, and it is
the intent of the General Plan that growth controls remain in effect as long as is
necessary to ensure the follOWing:
â¢        Community features and attributes of Ojai's small town character are
         protected.
â¢        Quality of life and open space areas within the City of Ojai are preserved.
â¢        Public services and facilities are able to serve both existing and new
         development in an economical manner within present and future budget
         constraints.
â¢        New development not overburden the area's transportation facilities, nor
         require the widening or construction of new roadways in a manner
         inconsistent with the preservation of significant community or
         environmental features or attributes.
â¢        A balance of housing types are available to accommodate all economic
         segments of the community, including older persons on fixed incomes.
â¢        A balance is maintained between the City's residential, commercial, and
         office sectors, protecting the community from becoming essentially
         commercial or tourist oriented.

INTEGRATING OJAl'S VISION WITH ACTIONS TAKEN BY OTHER AGENCIES
           The City of Ojai is not an island, but is part of a larger valley community, and has a
           population that is smaller than that of surrounding unincorporated areas. The
           overall valley community encompasses large areas of unincorporated County lands,
           including the mountainsides and agricultural lands that are a critical component of
           the Ojai's picturesque setting and small town character.
           Through its "Guidelines for Orderly
           Development" and the Ojai Valley
           Area Plan, Ventura County has
           established a means for coordi-
           nating its land use planning activi-
           ties with those of the City within its
           adopted "sphere of influence" and
           "area of interest. II However, OJ ai's
           existing adopted "sphere of influ-
           ence" and "area of interest" do not
           encompass all of the areas of
           concern to the future well-being of
           the CitY. Where needed, the poli-
           cies and programs of the Ojai He Ojai Vallry
           General Plan are directed to these
           additional areas of concern outside of the formal boundaries established by
           Ventura County and the County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO).
           Because Ojai is situated in an enclosed valley with substantial unincorporated lands
           and a significant unincorporated population, actions taken by Ventura County
           within these unincorporated areas can have a profound impact on the City and its
           residents' quality of life. Development within unincorporated areas escalates traffic
           volumes along City streets, increases demands on City parks and other public
           facilities, such as libraries and schools, and often introduces impacts that are
           incompatible with OJai's small town character.
           3        Sphere of influence refers to the area adopted by the County IAFCO, comprising the
                    City's "ultimate boundaries." According to County policy, the City is to be primarily
                    responsible for land use planning within its sphere, and applicants for development
                    will be encouraged to annex their properties into the City. The "area of interest" is
                    an area established by County policy within which applications for land use permits
                    are referred to the City for review and comment. Within the area of interest, the
                    County is primarily responsible for land use planning, and urban development is to
                    be limited to existing communities as designated on the County General Plan.

                                 relative to their planning activities.
                                 Since much of what is decided at
                                 the regional level is based on data Highway 33
                                 generated by individual participating cities, Ojai's approach will be not only to
                                 participate in providing information about the City, but also to actively monitor
                                 and comment on the conclusions reached.
                                 In the past, Ojai residents and the City srudied the feasibility of establishing a
                                 ''valley-wide city." While this concept was found to have merit as a tool for ensuring
Th, Ciry will illsist that       coordination of land and environmental management policie~ in the Ojai Valley,
  'cal valley-wide illterests be the concept was found to be economIcally mfeaslble. In addltlon, the reSIdents of

wide commulliry values.          addressing land use and land and environmental management policy outside of the
                                 present City limits is to mitigate potential impacts of development and other
                                 activities occurring within the unincorporated portions of the Ojai Valley, and to
                                 provide a basis for cooperative action between the City and Ventura County.
                                 While management of land use and roadway capacity along State Highway 33
                                 between Ventura and the Ojai Valley is critical to Ojai's furure, it is largely in the
                                 hands of Venrura County and Caltrans. Decisions made by the County to permit
                                 development along the corridor, as well as decisions by the County and Caltrans to
                                 increase the capacity of the State highway or to defer such efforts have the potential
                                 for creating widespread changes in OJai's quality of life by reducing or increasing
                                 the ease of commuting to work in Venrura, or by eliminating or exacerbating a
                                 fundamental development constraint.
                                 Thus, the City of Ojai will work both on the local and valley-wide levels to enhance
                                 local valley resident's representation in regional planning efforts. In working with
                                 the County of Venrura, the City will insist that local, valley-wide interests be
                                 protected and that County planning programs reflect local conditions and valley

It is Ojai's vision that the City and its individual communities and neighborhoods
need not abandon their local social values in pursuit of a "greater" regional good,
and that no one group should have to accept the brunt of the impacts of a regional
solution, nor should any group be forced to accept the brunt of other's possible
inaction toward a solution. It is thus a guiding tenet of the Ojai General Plan that
both the benefits and impacts of management decisions related to land use,
environmental regulation, and traffic flow need to balance regional and citywide
needs with the needs of the City's individual neighborhoods. Likewise, it is not
appropriate for a jurisdiction, neither the County nor the City, in approving a
development project, to internalize the benefits of development, and externalize
the related impacts.

PRESERVING 0JAl'S SMAlL TOWN CHARACTER
           LU-l   Emphasize retention of Ojai's natural environmental setting, small town
                  character, and scenic features as a priority over the expansion of urban
                  areas.
           LU-2   Preserve the following physical components of Ojai's small town character,
                  along with the desirable features of individual neighborhoods, and
                  incorporate them into the design of new development wherever feasible.
                         a well-defined urban area surrounded by open spaces and grazing
                         and agricultural lands;
                         a traditional grid street system with limited collector streets and
                         arterial highways, wherein residences front on most streets and
                         there is a noticeable lack of suburban subdivisions bounded by
                         block walls;
                         preservation of existing mature trees in place;
                         a lack of mass produced housing tracts with repetitive architecture,
                         resulting in neighborhoods that feature a custom home atmosphere;
                         residential streetscapes dominated by broad canopy trees and oaks
                         within some streets and street rights-of-way;
                         provision of multi-family living environments in small projects
                         distributed along or in close proximity to the length of the Ojai
                         Avenue corridor;
                         retention of a feeling of "openness" and preservation of views of the
                         hills and mountains which form the Ojai Valley, defining the extent
                         of urban development, as well as preservation of the natural
                         character of these hillside areas;
                         preservation of Significant community monuments such as Libbey

                         prominence of these features within the downtown area;
                         a traditional small town downtown which is pedestrian friendly, of
                         higher intensity than the balance of the community, and which has
                         a unique historical architectural character;
                         a generally low proftle form of development;
                                                                   r: koj40 1!project\pfa1l1/illalllanduse.1lew

              a clear lack of corporate architecture in the area's commercial
              sector, emphasizing instead distinct architectural forms within
              various commercial neighborhoods;
              commercial signage which is integrated into the overall site and
              architectural design of the projects they identify, whose materials
              are compatible with adjacent architecture, and which portrays its
               message in an unobtrusive manner in the minimal amount of space
              feasible;
              an emphasis on the retention of natural landforms and the natural
              environment over its conversion to urban forms; and
              an emphasis on ease of pedestrian and bicycle access and
               transportation.
LU-3  Maintain an inventory of land uses that provides diverse economic, social,
      and cultural opportunities; reinforces the characteristics that make Ojai a
      desirable place to live; and integrates complementary land uses in a manner
      which minimizes vehicle miles traveled within the community.
LU-4  Create and maintain places and opportunities for the residents of Ojai to
      interact, exchange ideas, and realize common goals of a unified community.
      Integrate plazas and focal points into new commercial and multiple family

LU-5  Promote a mix of urban and rural residential neighborhoods which
      encompass a range of housing types that:
              proVide a refuge from the congestion of nearby metropolitan areas;
              are visually attractive and compatible in intensity, dwelling unit size,

 DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
          The Development Review component presents a comprehensive set of develop-
          ment review criteria to be applied to new planning, public improvement, and
          development projects within Ojai. The development review criteria are used to
          help determine the consistency of proposed new development with policies con-
          tained in the Ojai General Plan Land Use Element. The criteria has been developed
          to answer the follOWing fundamental questions:
          ,/      Is the project consistent with the General Plan designations and Land Use
                  Map?
          ,/      Has the project been included within the residential or commercial growth
                  allocations as determined by the Ojai Growth Management Plan?
          ,/      Does the project meet General Plan public facilities performance standards?
          ,/      Is the project consistent with City wide or specific area design concepts and
                  planning principles?
                                                                        r: lcoi40 J Iproject!pfalll(inallimple.Jlew

Is the Project Consistent with the General Plan Designations and Land Use Map?
              All developments will be reviewed

               can be made by comparing the
               proposed land use with the spe-
               cific location on the General Plan Land Use Map. Development projects, whether
               new or expansions to existing uses, are permitted by the development intensity of
               their site as indicated on the General Plan land use map and as listed below.
               Development intensities outlined in the General Plan Land Use Element may be
               permitted only if the proposed project is consistent with all relevant policies,
               review criteria, and approach contained in the General Plan and all relevant stan-
               dards contained in the Development Review Program.

Therefore, all development projects must demonstrate that they can either meet
these standards or incorporate appropriate actions which:

         Figure 8 - Ojai's Architectural Landmarks and Diverse Imagery
 Ojai's small town character is reflected in many identifiable landmark
 buildings as well as in the type and scale of architectural features used
 throughout the community. When put in context with OJai's reverence
 for the surrounding natural setting, these identifiable features add to the
 unique physical character that make the town memorable. It is Ojai's
 intent to use these local community landmarks and architectural imagery
 as a palette of design elements to be used in the planning of new
 development projects.
 OJ ai's architectural imagery includes those existing design features that
 individually may go unnoticed but collectively reflect Ojai's unique
 character. The following pallette of community design features illustrate
 aspects of existing development that Ojai residents feel are important to
 the community character, and should be used as examples, not only of
 "good" or "quality" design, but the type of design details which will help
 project designers achieve the best "fit" with Ojai's community character.

 Ojai's small town character is reflected in a number of the community's
 more prominent landmark buildings and public spaces. Libbey Park, for example, demonstrates Ojai's
 commitment to providing a central public space for community and tourist recreation, social interaction, and
 cultural awareness. These community landmarks reflect the "image anchors" with which residents and visitors
 already associate. The City of Ojai intends to taI(e advantage of the design features of such recognizable places,
 buildings, and landmarks to establish a palette of design features that illustrate how the community's character
 can be integrated into new development throughout Ojai.

  Viewsheds and Vistas
  The surrounding mountains provide a distinct and memorable backdrop to Ojai. Views of the Tapa Tapa and
  surrounding hillsides give the community its sense of refuge; a feeling that Ojai is a place that is protected,
  tucked away. The preservation and/or enhancement of the existing viewshed will be used as an important
  project review criteria.

  Streets as Public Spaces
  OJ ai's streets are considered public spaces where residents, visitors, and business people interact on a daily
  basis. Ojai recognizes that its streets represent more than just facilities designed to move traffic around and
  through the community. In some cases, Ojai's streets make a bold statement as to the community's attitudes;
  the preservation of mature oak trees within the right-of-way for example. In the Arbolada, the streets reflect
  the relaxed, suburban residential environment. The character of the street changes substantially at the town
  center, from a soft shouldered, rural edge to a more defined, hard edged cross section. This change helps to
  reinforce the image of the town center as a true "center," more urban and civic in quality.
  As with other aspects of Ojai's physical character, street designs will be balanced with the individual needs of
  a paticular area of the community. Ojai places a priority on creating safe, functional, and logical walking,
  cycling, and driVing opportunities for all users consistent with OJ ai's unique character.

  Community Architecture
  Most buildings within the community are understated and residential in scale, Traditional building forms,
  including broad eaves and low-lying roofs, are typical. No single style predominates, except within the town
  center, where the Spanish colonial architecture of the Post Office and the Arcade establish a strong and
  memorable civic presence, Successful new development "fits" within the existing area and contributes to the

  Ojai has the quality of being "hand made." This quality is prevalent in the expression of many details that have
  evolved out of a natural expression of the relationship
  of the community to its setting. Mortarless rock walls,
  stone lined street edges, split-rail fences, hand-painted
  signs, all contribute to the sense of balance between the
  built and natural environment that prevails throughout
  the town.

General Plan Area Design Concepts
The Ojai General Plan identifies certain areas within the community that have been
identified as having specific development and design opportunities (see Figure 9).
As a method to more accurately describe General Plan Land Use policy within these
identified areas, the City has created these design concepts to give project design-
ers a starting point from which new developments may be created that fit with the
community's small town character. All new development within the areas identi-
fied will be required to demonstrate consistency with the design prinCiples in-
cluded in each of the design concepts presented below.

  Existing Character: Ojai's Town Center has a delightfully
  active atmosphere where people tend to park and leave their
  cars in one place to access a variety of activities on foot.
  Existing development in the town center has been developed
  over time using a scale of architecture that encourages
  community involvement, informal gatherings, and pedestrian
  movement between uses. Such community activity is highly
  valued by residents as one of the main components of OJai's
  small town character.
                                                                              citye

  attributed to the vision of Edmond Drummond Libbey, whose
  financial support in the early 1900s resulted in the formalized
  plan for the town centered on a civic park and small commercial district. The architecture of its key structures
  includes the arcade, which brought together a row of diverse commercial buildings behind an elegant Spanish
  colonnade, and the post office, whose tower serves as a visual landmark to Signify arrival at the center of town.
  Although many intrusions and diverging styles have been developed in and around this center, the images of
  these two structures as a relaxed but elegant backdrop to the park are so strong that their impression seems
  to leave little room for anything else.
  Other landmarks within Ojai's Town Center include the Ojai Valley Museum, Libbey Park Bowl, Saint Thomas
  Aquinas Chapel, and the Pratt House. Most of these community landmarks are located within a short distance
  of one another, close to commercial and community activity centers. Their architectural character and viSibility
  will serve as a benchmark for evaluating the compatibility of new development within nearby areas.
  Lalld Use alld Desigll Opportullities: Opportunities for development within the Town Center area are limited
  due to the lack of large vacant parcels. lnfill and redevelopment opportunities, however, are likely to occur in
  areas north of the downtown Arcade, east and southwest of Libbey Park, near City Hall, as well as the creative
  and adaptive reuse of existing commercial buildings.

  Existing O,araacr: As one approaches the northern Village
   Mixed-Use area from almost any side street, buildings
   become noticeably more dense, as lots become smaller and
   coverage increases. Building setbacks lessen, and residen-
   tial uses become mixed, with a variety of low intensity com-
   mercial uses, such as lodging, realty, small medical and
  other service-related office space, as well as some retail
  shops. such as antique stores and art galleries.
  The architecture of these areas varies widely and includes
  a mix of building types and styles, from old Victorian and
  Craftsman houses to small masonry commercial buildings.                                      LEGEND,
  Where walking paths or sidewalks are present, they are                                       ~ Village Mixed-Ux
  typically narrow, and often of dirt, gravel or asphalt. Trees
  are abundant and street improvements have often been made to accommodate them, diverting curbs and walks
  around the trunks and roots to assure their survival.
  Immediately east of Libbey Park and southeast of the Town Center has been zoned for industrial use but has
  remained predominantly residential in character. Originally intended to transition to industrial uses, tl,e
  smaller residential parcels has been slow to change.
  Land Use and Design Opportunities: Opportunities for development within the Village Mixed-Use area include
  infill development on vacant and underutilized parcels, as well as providing opportunities for residents to live
  and work witllin the same building or at the same location. Parcels designated as Village Mixed-Use located
  north of Ojai Avenue are planned to integrate commercial service and limited retail uses within the existing
  residential setting. New development is planned to include a pedestrian design emphasis which focuses on
  providing enhanced pedestrian access to all uses.

   shops, custom manufacturing, artist studios, and galleries in areas east of Montgomery Street. This will allow
   residents the opportunity to live and work in the same location.

  tentativeness of tl,e development
  does not clearly reveal the quality of the town that lies ahead. The businesses along the highway within this
  area are disconnected, too far to be within walking distance to the Town Center, and thus have continued to
  remain underutilized and predominantly auto dependent.
  Land Use and Design Opportunities: The eastern portion of the Ojai AvenuelHighway 33 corridor has perhaps
  tl,e most to offer in tefils of opportunities for development. Unlike tl,e Town Center and Village Residential
  areas, the East Ojai corridor still contains sizable parcels which are underutilized or vacant. Key to the
  development of this area is the establishment of an architectural focus or "theme" which would be implemented
  as development occurs. Reminiscent of uses that traditionally bordered the State's highways in the 1930s and
   I 940s, Ojai will encourage that new development in this area be oriented to visitor serving uses such as hotels,
  motels, resturants, and specialty commercial uses. New developments will also be expected to integrate a
  "California Highway" style of architecture into project designs (see design principles detailed below).
  The East Ojai Avenue Corridor also provides opportunities for the establishment of an eastern entry statement
                         or "gateway." Consistent with the California Highway theme suggested above,
                            monumentation would be constructed at the San Antonio Creek crossing (see concept
                              Ulustration below) in combination with a bicycle trail under crossing (see Ojai Master
                                Plan of Trails).

 INTERGOVERNMENTAL COORDINATION AND COMMUNITY
INVOLVEMENT PROGRAM
            The Intergovernmental Coordination and Community Involvement Program pro-
            poses actions that reflect the City's commitment to truly representational govern-
            ment, a government that looks for appropriate responses to specific issues. For
            example, some issues, such as the protection of natural resources, affect not only
            Ojai, but all Ojai Valley communities, as well as agencies charged with the manage-
            ment of resources within the Valley. Many issues cross geographic boundaries and,
            therefore, require concerted efforts by several governmental entities before they
            can be resolved. Intergovernmental coordination means actively pursuing regional
            solutions to regional problems. Ojai is committed to working with its neighbors to
            address these issues.
            At the same time, Ojai recognizes that to be truly representational, local govern-
            ment must reflect the values of the people it serves. To do so, Ojai has estab-
            lished, as part of its General Plan implementation program, mechanisms for inform-
            ing the community on local issues and soliciting citizen input.
Coordination ofLand Use Planning Activities
            Actively coordinate with the land use planning efforts of adjacent jurisdictions, and
            prOvide constructive comments regarding the impacts that such programs will have
            on the City of Ojai by taking the follOWing actions:
            ,/ Actively lobby the County and Ventura River Valley Municipal Advisory Agency
                Council to consider the formation and adoption of a municipal organization or
                advisory body (such as an area-wide planning commission) that would oversee
                the management of land use throughout the Ojai Valley.
            ,/ Closely monitor County development activity and respond to individual land
                use proposals that would impact local land use. Continue to monitor adjacent
                County land use proposals that could impact local land use and circulation
                decisions.
            ,/ Work with the National Forest Service to develop a wilderness transition area
                that provides guidelines for development adjacent to the Los Padres National
                Forest area.
            ,/ Work with the County on both a staff level and the City Council Board of Su-
                pervisors level to establish basic principles for development review and mitiga-
                tion of cross-jurisdictional impacts within the Ojai Area Plan jurisdiction, consis-
                tent with the concept that the impacts of new development must be offset by
                project related benefits within each of the jurisdictions in which the impacts
                will be experienced.
                                                                         r: ]coi40 J !projectlplan l(illallimpJe.lIew

           ./ Pursue fonnation of ad hoc coalitions with other local agencies and community
               groups as a means of increasing the effectiveness of Ojai's voice in regional
               planning efforts and the planning efforts of adjacent jurisdictions.
           ./ Provide local utility providers with a copy of the General Plan Annual Review
               and Update Report for review and comment.
           ./ Pursuant to the provisions of Government Code Section 65401, ensure that all
               departments within the City, and all other local government agencies (includ-
               ing the County, school districts, and other special districts) submit a list of pro-
               posed projects to the City, and that the City review and report on the consis-
               tency of these projects to the City Council as part of the General Plan Annual
               Review and Update Report.
Encourage Community Awareness
           The effectiveness of the programs described in the Ojai General Plan are dependent
           on the participation of community residents. To ensure that residents are made
           aware of these programs, the City shall publicize local programs and prOvide a
           forum for public debate of local issues by implementing the following actions:
           ./ As part of the annual review and update of the General Plan, hold an annual
               "Open Forum" before the City Council to allow public discussion of current and
               future land use issues facing the community.
           ./ Use public access cable to broadcast Planning Commission, City Council meet-
               ings, public events, and special presentations related to Ojai's future develop-
               ment.
           ./ Work with local cable television proVider to include a "reader line" on the local
               TV directory channel advertising public hearings, and public discussions and
              workshops regarding land use within the City.
           ./ Establish a connection with the public Internet and develop a "home page" and
              electronic mail system to provide public access to agenda, announcements, and
              other public infonnation via home and business computers.
                                                                       r:!coj40 J Iproiectlplan Ijinallimple.neIV

Citizen Involvement in Community Decision Making
              Many of the questions facing Ojai are complex issues requiring policy recommenda-
              tions and an evaluation of tradeoffs that are not easily done in a public forum. To
              address these issues, the City Council may appoint task forces or committees to
              research specific issues and to provide policy direction to the City Council. Mem-
              bers to these task forces would be appointed by the City Council. The task forces
             will be requested to provide recommended policy direction within a specific time
              frame, and will be disbanded after the presentation of their recommendations.
Obtain Feedback Regarding City Programs
             To provide local decision makers with regular input on how satisfied residents are
             with their community and their quality of life, a Community Survey will be devel-
              oped and updated every five years. Future surveys will address not only General
             Plan issues such as land use and circulation, but more specific issues currently
             facing the City as well.
Involve The Community In The Development Review Process
             In order to facilitate citizen participation in the development review process which
             would be meaningful to individuals at the neighborhood level, and to facilitate the
              public hearing process, the City of Ojai encourages informal meetings between
             citizen groups and developers on proposed development projects. The purpose of
             such meetings is to facilitate interaction between the developer and neighborhood
             interests in a relaxed, informal setting, and to provide the developer with the
             opportunity to inform and obtain feedback from the neighborhood. Specifically,
             the City encourages developers to meet with affected citizens, and ask Ojai resi-
             dents to give direction to proposed developments by:
             ./ delineating specific neighborhood values, goals, and objectives;
             ./ participating in choosing among alternative project designs; and
             ./ participating in the review and modification of development plans.
             Although the results of these informal meetings are not binding upon the City,
             early consultation and discussion between developers and affected citizens can
             significantly facilitate the development review process by resolving issues of social
             compatibility before public hearings begin.

              individual study, appropriate General Plan implementation programs may be added
              to the Implementation and Monitoring Program contained in the General Plan.
              The funding sources for each action listed below will be assigned annually as part
              of the General Plan Review and Update and the City's annual budget process.
City of Ojai Municipal Code Revisions (priority One)
              Subsequent to the adoption of the General Plan, the City will undertake a General
              Plan and Zoning Consistency Program to revise the Zoning Code to achieve consis-
              tency with and implement the General Plan. As part of the program, the City will
              prepare new zones, regulations, and exhibits which reflect the adopted General
              Plan land use policies. Table C provides a listing of the actions to be taken as part
              of the General Plan and Zoning Consistency Program, as well as any milestones
              which will need to take place prior to implementation of each action.
City of Ojai Growth Management Ordinance Readoption (Priority Two)
              One year prior to the expiration of the City's Growth Management Ordinance, the
              City will prepare for the readoption of the growth provisions contained in Title 10,

Community Entrance And Directional Signage Program (Priority Two)
           The City will take advantage of the existing character of entrances or "gateways"
           located along State Highways 33 and 150 as well as Creek Road by developing a
           programs that establishes City identification improvements at key entrances to the
           City (see Figure 5 - Community Structure). Such gateways are where visitors will
           receive their first impression and residents can feel a sense of place. It is impor-
           tant, therefore, that entrance signage designs not only identify the City's boundaries
           but also convey the image with which residents would like to be associated.
           Secondary directional signage will also be established as a method to provide
           direction to public parking, City Hall, Public library and other public facilities;
           historical and cultural places of interest; transit facilities; Forest Service station and
           trailheads; public parking areas; as well as locations where civic and cultural events
           are held.

           California Government Code Section 65400(b) requires the planning agency of
           each city and county in the State to provide an "annual report to the legislative
           body on the status of the (general) plan and progress in its implementation." The

Noise Element
INTRODUCTION
The Noise Element of the General Plan provides a basis for comprehensive local
programs to control and abate environmental noise and protect citizens from
e.xcessive exposure. The fundamental goals of the Noise Element are:
o    To provide sufficient information concerning the community noise
     environment so that noise may be effectively considered in the land use
     planning process. In so doing the necessary groundwork will have been
     developed so that a community noise ordinance may be utilized to resolve
     noise complaints.
o    To develop strategies for abating e.xcessive noise exposure through
     cost-effective mitigating measures in combination with zoning,Â·as appropriate,
     to avoid incompatible land uses.
o To protect those existing regions of the planning area whose no environments
     are deemed acceptable and 'a1so those locations throughout the community
     deemed !lnoise sensitive".
o    To utilize the defmition of the community noise environment, in the form of
     CNEL Of Ldn noise contours as provided in the Noise Element for local
     compliance with State Noise Insulation Standards. These standards require
     specified levels of outdoor to indoor noise reduction for new multi-family
     residential constructions in areas where the outdoor noise exposure exceeds
     CNEL (or Ldn) 60 dB.
History
Since the time of the industrial revolution, the use of mechanical devices has
increased dramatically. The technology has brought motor vehicles, jet aircraft, and
literally thousands of labor saving implements into common usage and has, at the
same time, increased both the magnitude and frequency of occurrence of
man-made sound in the environment.
The need for increased attention to noise in the planning process is a consequence
ofthis potential for continued elevation ofambient noise levels, the spread ofnoise
producing activities into formerly quiet areas, and heightened awareness of the
impact of noise on human health and amenity. Noise affects both physiological
and psychological well-being. In adrlition to causing hearing loss, noise interferes
with activities such as communication, sleep, and thought. Noise canÂ· be a source
of great armoyance for many persons and may be a contributing factor in
stress-related health disorders.

               Noise Element
LEGISLA1TVE REQUIREMENT
              The requirement for Noise Element preparation was first codified in 1971. In
               1976, the Department of Health Services issued Noise Element guidelines (Health
              and Safety Code Section 46050.1) followed shortly thereafter by model NoiseÂ·
               Ordinance AB 2038's Chapter 1009, (statutes 1984). Revisions to the General Plan
               statutes made extensive changes to the Noise Element requirements. Generally,
               these revisions shortened the list of State required issues and encouraged local
              governments to design their own approaches to noise controL The underlying
               purpose of the noise element, to limit community exposure to excessive noise
               levels, remains unchanged.
               In making city and county governments in California responsible for a Noise
               Element in their General Plans, the State Legislature has recognized the steady
               escalation of outdoor noise as a significant environmental hazard. Unlike other
               hazards faced by California residents, such as earthquakes or floods, noise is
              generated primarily by man's own activities. Considering noise in the planning
               process, then, is essential to controlling its impact on the community.
               Specific authority for this Element ofthe General Plan is contained in government
               Code Section 65302(g), which was revised by Senate Bill 860 (Belenson, 1975). The
               amendment became effective January 1, 1976, and requires the following:
                    A noise element which shall mognize gllidelines adopted by the Office ofNoise Control
                   pllrsllant to Section 39850.1 of the Health and Safety Code, and which qllantijies the

RELA170NSIllP TO OTHER GENERAL PLANELEMENTS
               The Noise Element is one of the more technical elements of the General Plan.
               However, the approach of this report is to present discussions of noise primarily
               in qualitative form for the lay-person to easily comprehend. Those.wishing a more
               detailed technical "-'<planation are referred to the Technical Report performed by
               Walker, Celano and Associates in Appendix B.
               Circulation Element
               The principle noise sources evaluated in the element are transportation noise
               sources, which are road, rail, and air traffic. Noise generated by these sources
               depends primarily on the number and type of vehicles in operation as planned for
               in the Circulation Element. The noise element affects the Circulation Element by
               suggesting that noise evaluation be included'in the analysis of location and design
               alterations for new roadways.
               Land Use
               Inseparable from the circulation considerations in the General Plan are the
               locations, types and densities ofland uses throughout the City. The locations of
               circulation routes in relation to different land uses can be a major determining
               factor of noise exposure. It is important that consideration be given in the Land
               Use Element to separating the most sensitive land uses from the sources of high
               noise levels. Land use noise standards are recommended as a part of this Element
               to assist in these considerations.
               Housing Element
               The Housing Element is related to the Noise Element in that both the location and
               insulation requirements of housing are, in part, determined by noise exposures.
               The Housing Element is concerned with the provision of adequate housing of
               acceptable quality, and noise exposure is an important factor affecting the quality
               of housing. The Noise Element recommends design standards for new housing in

             high noise impact areas. This will affect the cost and, in some instances, the
             location of new or rehabilitated housing.
             Conservation Element
             The Conservation Element identifies passive areas such as open space along creek
             beds, where low noise levels should be maintained.
GENERAL DEFINITIONS
             The following is not intended as a comprehensive glossary of acoustic terminology,
             but will provide, in approximately logical order, information sufficient to allow a lay
             person to better understand the technical language in the document.
             On a most fundamental level, sound is described by:
             Sound Pressure Amplitude - the actual pressure or force per unit area of the sound.
             The amplitude of the faintest rliscernible sound is approximately 1/5,000,000,000
             of a standard atmosphere (14.7 pounds per square inch). The standard reference
             pressure, which corresponds approximately to the minimum discernible sound
             pressure, is 20 micropascals. The amplitude of the highest reasonably tolerable
             sound is approximately 1 million times this minimum rliscernible value. The
             subjective manifestation of amplitude is loudness, but this is dependent upon other
             factors as well. The human ear acts as a signal compressor, with a factor of 3 in
             amplitude resulting in a factor of only 2 in perception of loudness.
             Sound Frequency - the rate at which the sound pressure fluctuates between values
             above and below the static pressure, in cycles per second. The unit Hertz (Hz) is
             defined as one cycle per second. Subjectively, frequency defines pitch. One octave
             of pitch corresponds to a 2 to 1 ratio of frequencies, and "middle COl is
             approximately 256 Hz. The normal range of human hearing is nominally 20 Hz to
             20,000 Hz, but, particularly at low frequencies, this is very dependent upon the
             amplitude of the sound.
             Decibel (dB) - A unit rlivision on a logarithmic scale whose base is the tenth root
             of ten, used to represent ratios of quantities proportional to power. In simple
             terms, if the power is multiplied by a factor of ten, then ten is added to the
             representation of the power on the decibel scale. If 0 dB represents 1 unit of
             power, 60 dB represents one million units, etc.
             Level - Sound amplitudes are more conveniently described on a decibel scale. A
              OJAI GENERAL PLAN                           5                  NOVEMBER 26, 1991

 pressure amplitude ratio of 10 corresponds to alevel difference of 20 dB. By using
o dB to represent a sound pressure amplitude of 28.3 micropascals or 20
 micropascals rms, the range of normally dealt-with sound amplitudes covers the"
level range 0 to 120 dB.
Sound Pressure Level (SPL - dB) - The ratio, in decibels, of the mean squared
sound pressure to the square of the reference pressure, 20 micropascals.
A-weighted Sound Level (FALor SAL - dB) - Sound pressure level in decibels
"measured by use of the A frequency weighting and the fast or slow exponential
time averaging. The A-weighting filter discriminates against low and very high
 frequencies in a manner similar to the human hearing mechanism at mode"rate
sound levels. The fast exponential has an averaging time of1/8 second. The slow
exponential has an averaging time of one second.
Time Average Sound Level (L",T - dB) - The level, in decibels, of the mean squared
sound pressure averaged over time period T. This is often referred to as
"equivalent sound level" and hence the "eq" subscript. The "equivalence" is to a
sound of constant level which has the same total acoustic energy content.
Sound Level Meter - An instrument consisting of a microphone, amplifiers, display
device (meter or numerical) and frequeneyweightingnetworks, meeting appropriate
performance specifications, for the purpose of determination of sound levels. For
measurement of time-average sound levels (L,~, an integrating sound level meter
is required. This employs aspecial metering circuit which weights equally all sounds
occurring within the measurement period. In a standard sound level meter, only
events which occurred within the past approximately one second (or 1/8-second
depending upon the meter setting) of the reading are included in the result. Some
meters are capable of performing both functions simultaneously.
Ambient Noise - The noise which results from the combination of all sources, near
and far. The ambient noise level is expressed as L",T or CNEL as judged
appropriate to the situation.
Background Noise -The steady noise level which characterizes a given environment
in the absence of transient sources. The background noise is usually expressed as
r..,." the noise level which is e,xceeded 90% of the specified time period.
Intrusive Noise - Noise from an identiftable source which causes a discernible
change in the existing acoustic environment. Noises can be intrusive by virtue of
excessive overall level, or as the result of unusual spectral or temporal

characteristics.
Noise Contour - A line on a map which indicates locations of constant ambient
sound level near or around known sources of noise. In practice, noise contours are
often shown as calculated for the dominant source of noise only.

EFFECTS OF NOISE
               Noise may have a variety of consequences for physical, mental, or social well-being.
                For discussion, these effects are categorized as either auditory of non-auditory.
               Auditory effects ofnoise include hearing loss and interference with communication.
               Non-auditory effects include physiological reactions, interference with sleep,
               adverse affects on hwnan performance, and annoyance.
               Auditory Effects
               Hearing Loss: Permanent hearing loss is, so fur as is presently known, the most
               severe effect of noise upon health. While noise-induced hearing loss was once
               associated primarily with certain industrial situation, increasing nwnbers of people
               in urban areas are presently exposed to ambient noise levels which over long
               periods of exposure will cause significant hearing impairment. Even where daily
               exposure to general community noise does not in itself pose a distinct hazard to
               hearing, it may still contribute to hearing loss. Community noise may prevent the
               person who works in a high noise situation from receiving enough quiet while off
               the job to allow the ears to recuperate from temporary hearing loss experienced on
               the job.
               Speech Communication: Interference with the ability to hear and understand
               speech communication is one of the more common experiences of noise intrusion.
               In a highly developed society, much value is placed on verbal exchange. Noise can
               reduce the amount and quality of this interaction. Normal conversation speech in
               the range of 60 to 65 dB and any noise in this range or louder may interfere with
               speech.
               The impact ofnoise on speech communication can be evaluated in terms ofspeech
               intelligibility requirements. Speech intelligibility is measured in terms of the
               percentage of key word in a group of sentences that can be correctly understood.
               As noise level increases, the percentage ofwords understood will decrease, unless
               the people communicating move closer together or raise their voices. One
               hundred percent intelligibility is not necessary for satisfactory communication in all
               situations. Most people can correctly infer the content of a sentence even though
               one or more words may not have been heard. Once intelligibility drops below
               about 90 percent, however, conversation becomes strained.
               Non-Auditory Effects
               Physiological Reactions:       In addition to hearing loss, a nwnber of other

 Noise Element
 physiological responses to noise have been docUmented. Changes in cardiovascular
 blood pressure and blood volume, breathing rate, pulse rate, and endocrine gland
 secretions have all been observed to result from exposure to noise. These'
 non-auditory effects distinguish physiologically from responses that occur in
 emotional states of fear or anger. They usually take place without conscious
 knowledge of their occurrence.
 It is not yet clear whether these physiological responses are associated with the
 onset or prolongation of any disease in humans. Noise has been cited as a
 contributing factor to the development of peptic ulcers, hypertension, colitis,
 migraine headaches and other disorders; but a causal link between noise exposure
 and non-auditory disease has not been established with certainty.
 Sleep Interference: From everyday experience as well as laboratory research, it is
 evident that noise interferes with sleep. In addition to awakening a person, or
 preventing the person from falling asleep, noise can shift the stage of sleep from
 a deep, restful stage to a lighter one. In laboratory tests this is observed as a change
 in brain-wave pattern of a sleeping subject. The significance of these shifts in stage
 of sleep to a person's long-term well-being has not been established.
 Disruption of sleep can occur at sound levels as low as 35 dB, but there is a great
 deal of variability in response among individuals. Some people awaken consistently
 when exposed to rather low level noise while others practically never awaken, even
 at levels up to 75 dB. A number of factors influence the degree to which noise may
 interfere with sleep. Impulsive or fluctuating noise is more disruptive than
 steady-state noise. Familiarity with the noise may reduce its ability to awaken, but
 there is no clear evidence that the quality of sleep is unaffected.
 Because of the number of variables involved, it has been difficult to establish a
 quantitative relationship between noise exposure and sleep interference.' In light
 of present knowledge, however, researchers recommend that noise levels inside
 dwellings not exceed 35-40 dB for satisfactory sleeping conditions.
Â·Physical and Mental Performance: Noise levels found in certain industrial situations
 are known to adversely affect the ability to perform physical tasks, even when the
 task requires little mental concentration. For a familiar, steady-state noise this is
 generally true only when the noise exceeds 90 dB. Irregular or unfamiliar bursts of
 noise can affect work efficiency atlower noise levels. Usually, the total quantity of
 work performed will not decrease, but the number of errors made will increase.
 Any task requiring the use of speech or other auditory signals will be subject to
 noise interference.

              Noise Element
              The ability to perfonn mental tasks such as reading, problem solving, or writing is
              also impaired by a noisy environment. As with sleep interference, there is a great
              deal of variability in individuals' responses. The degree of distraction, or
              interference with concentration, is related to the person's state of motivation,
              morale, stress, and fatigue, as well as characteristics of the noise such as intensity,
              pitch, impulsiveness, and infonnation content. Complex or demanding tasks are
              more likely to be disrupted by noise than are simple assignments.
              Annoyance: Annoyance is considered here to mean feelings of displeasure or
              resentment associated with the experience of noise, either because the noise is
              judged unpleasant or because the noise disrupts some ongoing activity. Annoyance
              is partly a psychological response to noise and partly a sociological response.
              Attitudes or values prevalent in a particular community can influence an individual's
              evaluation of noise.
              Annoyance is the most difficult of all noise responses to describe. Annoyance is
              a very individual characteristic and can vary widely from person to person. What
              one person considers tolerable can be unbearable to another of equal capability.
SEASONAL EFFECTS ON THE ACOUSTICAL ENVIRONMENT
              Weather conditions affect sound generation, sound propagation and conditions at
              potential sound reception points. In the most obvious sense, wet weather causes
              a significant increase in tire noise from roadways, and indeed, full rain generates
              considerable noise as it strikes roofs and other surfaces. No effort has been made
              to quantify these effects, as they are so unpredictably variable with details of the
              local surroundings.
              A more subtle effect would be the tendency of residents to keep windows open for
              ventilation in times ofwarm weather. This, again would be quite variable, as homes
              in warm areas are more commonly air conditioned, producing perhaps just the
              opposite effect.
              Quantitatively, with "typical" sized windows and nonnal residential construction,
              the difference between outdoor noise levels and indoor noise levels is
              approximately 10 dB when windows are open and 20-25 dB when windows are
              closed. This was demonstrated by measurements taken at Whispering Oaks as part
              of the Technical Appendix. To allow windows to be kept open at residents'
              discretion without causing excessive indoor noise pollution, the Noise Element has
              recommended 55 dB exterior noise guideline.

              Noise Element
              The most commonly considered effect of weather on noise levels is the effect on
              sound propagation over long distances as specific atmospheric parameters vary.
             The important parameters are: wind profile and direction, temperature andÂ·
              temperature proftle, humidity. These will be discussed in the following paragraphs.
SOUND PROPAGATION IN THE ATMOSPHERE
              In an idealized atmosphere, sound travels at the same speed in all directions and
              loses no energy to the air. In this case, we say that sound levels decrease by 6
              decibels (dB) for each doubling of the distance between the sound source element
              and the receiver. This is because for each doubling of distance, the radiated sound
              power is distributed over four times the area, and a power ratio of one-quarter is
              equal to -6 on the dB scale.
              Wind
              In a real atmosphere, the air is moving at different speeds, at different elevations
              and locations. The effective speed of sound is higher in the direction of the wind
              and lower in the direction against the wind. As sound propagates from areas of
              lower to higher effective sound speed, the "direction" of propagation is bent or
              "refracted" toward the regions of lower speed. Thus, in a typical windy
              environment, where the wind speed is lower near the ground than aloft, noise levels
              are accentuated in the direction of the wind and greatly attenuated in the direction
              against the wind. This is not the result of the wind "pushing" the sound energy in
              its direction (a small effect, since sound travels 700 mph in still aid), but rather
              because sound which started propagating upwards is refracted down to add with
              sound which would have reached the receiver anyway. In the most extreme case,
              the spherical model used for analysis in the ideal atmosphere is transformed to a
            . quasi-cylindrical model, in which levels drop at a -3 dB per distance doubling rate.
              In this case, the far-field noise level from a source which produces a 75 dB at 50 ft.
              would be increased by the wind gradient refraction from 35 dB to 55 dB at a
              distance of one mile. Effects of this magnitude are rare, since the structure of the
              wind gradient is seldom sufficiently stable over an extended enough region. Winds
            .of sufficient strength to produce significant increases in propagation are usually
              sources of noise themselves.
              In the up-wind direction, however, the so-called shadow zone created by upward
              refraction of sound (recall that in the upwind direction, the effective sound speed
              decreases with height) can result in noise levels many tens of dB lower than would
              occur in neutral conditions. This is an important consideration for noise s.urveys
              and enforcement measurements, particularly if the source is more than 100-200 ft.
              0IAI GENERAL PLAN                              11               NOVEMBER 26, 1991

  from the reception point.
  Temperature Profile
  The speed of sound in air is proportional to the square root of the absolute'
  temperature. Therefore, as for the wind proflle, sound will be refracted from
  regions of high temperature toward those oflower temperatUre. On a sunny day,
  the temperature decreases with distance from the ground (a so-called lapse
  condition). This causes sound to be refracted upward, causing formation of
  shadow zones near the ground in all directions and potentially increasing noise
  levels at hillside or other elevated locations.
  In the late evening following a warm day, conditions can reverse, forming an
  atmospheric layer (inversion) within a few hundred feet of ground where the
  temperature increases with elevation: In' this case, acoustic energy is partially
  trapped near the ground and the rate of attenuation is significantly reduced, similar
  to the down-wind condition.
  Temperature and Humidity
  The air in the atmosphere converts a small percentage ofacoustical energy into heat
  energy by three mechanisms: heat conduction, viscosity and molecular absorption.
  The first two effects are miriuscule, and of no significance relative to community
  noise issues. The third effect can result in several dB per thousand feet excess
  attenuation at high frequencies. The degree of absorption depends upon the
  relationship of the sound frequency and the characteristic time constant for
  e:<citation of internal vibrations in nitrogen and (more importantly) oxygen
  molecules.
  The time constant is strongly dependent upon the amount of water vapor in the
  atmosphere, and is secondarily dependent upon the temperature. Without
  reference to detail, it turns out that relatively dry air (20-35% relative humidity) has
  the greatest absorption. Very dry air and humid air have low absorption.
  Normally, these differences are of significance only for sounds of frequency 2 kHz
  or above, but at large distances (1000 ft. or more) they technically should not be
. ignored.
  Overall Effect
  In the built environment, the effect on sound propagation ofstructures, terrain and
  vegetation usually is greater than atmospheric irregularities. However, for hillside
  residences or other receivers which are located in remote areas at significant
  distances from major noise sources, noise levels can be expected to be higher than

CATALOG OF NOISE SOURCES
              This section contains a detailed description of the current noise environmentwithin
              the City of Ojai. This information is from the Technical Report prepared by
              Walker, Celano and Associates which is included as Appendix B of this Noise
              Element.
              The predominant land use in the City is residential. Residential land uses should
              therefore be considered the most noise sensitive in Oiai. Other noise sensitive land
              uses include schools, hospitals, museums, convalescent homes, libraries, and parks.
              Maintenance of a relatively quiet ambiance is important in maintaining the overall
              atmosphere of the area.
              The rural environment and lack of either a railroad or airport in the vicinity create
              a considerably quiet noise environment. The primary source of noise affecting the
              City of Ojai is motor vehicle traffic. CNEL Contours were computed for all
              roadways carrying traffic flows of 2000 Average Daily Trips (ADT) or greater.
              Because it was observed that the day-evening-night distribution of traffic in 0iai is
              not typical per usual traffic models, the distributions from the November, 1989
              count were used to determine CNEL weighting factors. FHWA RD77 and
              CALVENa noise emission models were used as a base line, but were modified to
              agree with measured data.
              The second source ofnoise is the industrial area on Bryant Street and Bryant Circle.
              At the present time, the main source is a precipitator atop the roof of the ITI
              facility near the northerly end of South Bryant Street. The Bryant Circle Industrial
              area is located at the east end of the City. The existing land uses in this industrial
              park are currently not significant noise generating sources. However, the future
              buildout of the Bryant Street area, which abuts a quiet residential area to the south
              and west, could pose potential noise impact conflicts.
              Additional noise sources identified by the City as sources ofcommunity complaints
              were:
              o    Gasoline powered leafblowers. Measurements were obtained for one of these
                   devices being operated in the 0iai Valley Hospital parking lot.

                  functions at Libbey Park Bowl.
~TALOG OF NOISE SENSITIVE RECEPTORS
             Ojai is primarily a residential community. Except for the main commercial corridor
             along Ojai Avenue and the industrial area on Bryant Street, essentially all roadways
             affect residential uses to some extent. Specific Noise Sensitive Receptors are as
             follows:

                  Highway/Ojai Avenue Intersection. TIlls area was judged to have the highest
                  noise impact potential in the City, due to the high traffic flow and proximity to
                  the roadway.

FUTURE AND EXISTING ACOUS71CAL ENVIRONMENT
              The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that noise contours be
              drawn on a City map for all significant noise sources in the community. However,
              noise contours as calculated from available modeling programs have meaning only
              in areas where essentially unobstructed sound transmission is possible. In Ojai,
              there are few locations where this situation exists, most notably along the Maricopa
              Highway between NordoffHigh School and El Roblar Drive. In most other areas,
              roadways are flanked by existing structures. Reflections from the structures cause
              noise levels between them and roads to be higher than predicted, generally by 1 to
              3 dB. Shielding by the structures causes noise levels behind them to be lower than
              predicted by 3 to 10 dB.

Noise Element
For this Element, graphical noise contours were calculated based on the actual
roadway geometry presented on a 600 ft. per inch map provided by Public Works,
The two or four lanes of each road were divided into 25 ft. long segments. Each
segment was treated as a point source of sound, the strength of which was
determined based on the ADT, speed, temporal distribution and truck mixture
traffic. FHWA RD-77 and CALVENO models were used to represent individual
vehicle noise emissions. Sound from all roadway segments affecting a given
contouring area were combined in a computer model which logically traces the
noise contour around the roadway grid. Propagation is based on spherical wave
spreading (-6 dB per distance doubling) plus 1.5 dB per 1000 ft. atmospheric and
ground absorption. The contour points were then stored on magnetic disk files for
subsequent plotting in CAD (computer aided drawing) program.
The results of these contour calculations are shown at 1n = 2000' on the contour
map on the following page. They have also been plotted at 1n = 600' on a City
                                       =
Street and Parcel Map and at a 1n 400' on the City Zoning Map. It must be
noted that the contours presented on the maps are approximate, and are intended
to provide an overview of the acoustical environment. Detailed assessments of
noise at specific locations will vary, based on local topographical conditions,
existing structures, roadway conditions, driver habits, etc.
Results of noise measurements and computations indicate the following general
characteristics of the Ojai acoustical environment:
o    Daytime noise in most areas of the City is dominated by automobile traffic.
o    Nighttime noise is very low, due to the near disappearance of traffic from local
     streets after around 10 p.m. Along Ventura Avenue, noise continue to be
     dominated by traffic. At other locations, crickets and other insects are the
    significant nighttime noise source.
o    Overall, the characteristic noise levels are approximately:
     o   50-55 dB daytime, 35-40 dB nighttime in side-street areas
    o    58-62 dB daytime, 40-50 dB nighttime a1ongOjai Avenue, south ofthe "Y',
         and Maricopa Highway

              NOISE CONTROL
              A common approach to mitigating noise impacts is through the use of setbacks.
              This approach may be more desirable for the City of Ojai due to its low volume
              roadways and the desire to avoid a "walled in" look. The setback approach simply
              requires that the homes or noise sensitive uses be setback away from the roadway
              at a distance great enough so that they are outside the noise impact zone. The
              setback area is landscaped. The landscaping actually provides very little noise
              reduction, however, residents seem to become less aware of the "noise probably
              because they can not see or have an obstructed view of the road.
              As previously discussed, the sources of noise in Ojai can be divided into two basic
              categories, transportation sources (primary traffic) and non-transportation sources.
              Local agencies have the responsibility to control the noise from the source, such
              as vehicle noise emission levels and enforcing the speed regulations to reduce
              vehicle noise.
              The most effective method the City has to mitigate transportation noise is through
              reducing the impact of the noise onto the community (i.e., noise barriers and site
              design review). Mitigation through the design and construction of a noise barrier
              (wall, berm, or combination wall/berm) is the most common way of
              alleviating traffic noise impacts. The effect of a noise barrier is critically
              dependent on the geometry between the noise source and the receiver. A noise
              barrier effect occurs when the "line of sight" between the source and receiver is
              penetrated by the barrier. The greater the penetration, the greater the noise
              reduction. Barriers should be required for residences where outdoor noise exceeds
              60 or 65 dB. Another noise reduction method would be for the City to provide
              retrofit incentives for residences that provide ventilation and better windows to
              reduce noise impacts.
              For existing residences, the following mitigation measures are possible: For
              outdoors, barriers (walls and berms), re-routing traffic, enhance speed limit
              enforcement, and maintaining auto exhausts in proper condition are methods to
              control noise. For indoors, ventilation modification (summer switch) to allow
              some windows to be kept closed, improvement ofseals on doors and windows, and
              relocation of vent openings to shielded sides of structures are some methods to
              control noise.
NOISE REGULATIONS
              The responsibility for the control of noise is divided among various levels of
              government and in tum divided among various agencies and departments at each
              governmental leveL Local agencies have several alternatives for the control of
              OJAI GENERAL PLAN                           18                  NOVEMBER 26, 1991

various noise generators. These include: enforcement of existing state and local
laws, creation oflocal ordinances and policies, adoption of Federal and State Noise
Standards, and the implementation of various land uses and site planning
techniques based on state and Federal planning guidelines. Some State and local
laws may include: Noise limits for on-highway motor vehicles for the state of
California, Noise limits for motorboats in or upon Inland Waters, Sound
Transmission Class (STC) and Impact Insulation Class (IIC) for non-single family
buildings for hwnan occupancy, noise limits for off-highway motor vehicles in the
State of California. These state laws can be innmerliately enforced by local and
builrling departments. In adrlition to state laws, local nuisance ordinances relating
to disturbing the peace and animal control can be enforced by local law
enforcement agencies and the County Department of Animal Control.
The second alternative mentioned is the creation of noise ordinances. Generally,
this includes the passage of new ordinances. In contrast to nuisance ordinances,
a noise ordinance attempts to provide noise level standards for reoccurring noise
generators or land use types. An ordinance should contain a well defmed, objective
noise standard for various land uses, based on an easy to calculate noise evaluation
scheme, maximwn noise levels, consideration for impulse and pure tone sounds,
appropriate reference pressure, and reference to a measurement procedure.
A local ordinance could also extend to the enforcement of Federal and State
product standards, to those products once purchased. According to the Noise
Control Act of 1972, the United States Environmental Protection Agency must
establish noise levels on new products including construction, transportation,
e1ectric/electronic equipment and any motor or engine. These product noise levels
could be adopted as a part of a noise ordinance by local entities to insure control
over specific noise sources which might otherwise be rlifficult to control.
Local jurisdictions could also adopt Federal and State regulations and guidelines for
local development. Three Federal and State regulations which are of particular
importance are: The Department of Transportation Design Noise Standards; The
Department of Housing and Urban Development (H. U.o.) Noise Standards; and
State Noise level Standards for various land uses. The H.U.o. noise guidelines are
used to help determine whether projects applying for H.U.D. or F.H.A. loans are
qualified on the basis of noise. The Department ofTransportation has established
noise standards and procedures to determine if particular roadways can qualify for
federally assisted noise abatement projects. State laws also establish standards
estimating adverse impacts of noise on various land uses. These standards could
be adopted as policy or ordinance by local entities locating the appropriate land
uses near noise sources. The advantage of using these standards, particularly the

H.UD. standards, is that they may have greater acceptability due to greater
resources available to State and Federal agencies. The disadvantage of these noise
standards is that they are inconsistent, individually they do not adequately measure
the noise conditions, and they may be too high to accurately reflect community
desires.

         GOALS, POUCIES AND PROGRAMS
         This section of the Noise Element sets forth the Goals, Policies and Implementing
         Programs. They evolve out of the discussion issues and needs discussed in the
         previous section of the document (Noise Exposure and Noise ControQ.
GOALS
         (1) A City that maintains a quiet acoustical environment
         (2) A City whose residents are protected from unhealthful levels of noise
         (3) A City that is planned to minimize noise conflicts
POLICIES
         (1) The City shall enforce the State Uniform Building Code which specifies that the
             indoor noise levels for residential living spaces not exceed 45 dB dn/CNEL due
             to the combined effect of all noise sources. The state requires implementation
             of this standard when the outdoor noise levels exceed 60 dB Ldn/CNEL.
             However, the City should implement a 55 dB outdoor noise standard.
         (2) The City should establish standards that specify acceptable limits and hours of
             occurrence of noise for various land uses throughout the City.
         (3) The City shall incorporate noise reduction features during site planning to
             mitigate anticipated noise impacts on affected noise sensitive land uses. New
             development should be permitted only if appropriate mitigation measures are
             included such that the standards contained in this Element or adopted
             ordinances are met                            .
         (4) The City should encourage the use ofwalls, berms or "inward orientation" in
             the design of residential or other noise sensitive land uses that are adjacent to
             major roads, commercial or industrial areas.
         (5) The City should enhance efforts to enforce vehicle noise emission regulations
             and speed limits.
         (6) The City should discourage nighttime traffic, particularly truck traffic, on
             streets in residential areas and schedule trash pickups between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m.
             in residential areas.
         (7) The City should adopt a new comprehensive community noise ordinance to
         OJM GENERAL PLAN                               21                 NOVEMBER 26, 1991
         Noise Element
             ensure city residents are not exposed to excessive noise levels from existing and
             new stationary noise sources.
PROGRAMS
         (1) Investigate and, if possible, implement mitigation programs for existing
             residences when traffic noise exceeds 55 dB CNEL.
         (2) Strengthen enforcement of vehicle noise emissions regulations and vehicle
             speeds.
         (3) Restrict the hours of operation of street sweeper and private parking lot
             sweepers.
         (4) Restrict hours of operation ofleafblowers and other power gardening activities.
         (5) Restrict hours of operation and days of the week of construction activities.
         (6) Adopt a noise ordinance to control noise levels and hours of occurrence for
             various hind uses throughout the City.
         (J) The City should develop an educational program to inform residents of the
             negative effects of noise on human health.

I.      INTRODUCTION
A.      Purpose of the Housing Element
Statutory Overview: All cities and counties in the State of California are required to
affirmatively further affordable housing opportunities within their respective jurisdictions.
Principal requirements of California Land Use Law include: adoption of Housing Elements
as part of each communityâs General Plan; inducements to provide affordable housing
through density bonuses and secondary dwellings; limitations on local land use authority
to deny affordable projects or impose conditional use requirements on multifamily
housing; and prohibitions on down zoning or imposition of development standards that
prevent attainment of Housing Element goals.
Housing Element Law: Housing Element law is codified in Article 10.6 of the California
Government Code commencing with Section 65580. Under these statutes, all commu-
nities in California are required to have a Housing Element as part of their adopted
General Plan. These Elements are to be updated periodically. The law further stipulates
that Housing Elements consist of an identification and analysis of existing and projected
housing needs along with a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial
resources, and scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement, and
development of housing. In summary, the Housing Element is required to contain: (i) an
assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to
the meeting of those needs; (ii) a statement of the communityâs goals, quantified
objectives, and policies relative to the maintenance, preservation, improvement, and
development of housing; and (iii) a program that sets forth a schedule of actions to
implement relevant Housing Element policies and achieve stated goals. A cross
reference of relevant statutes to corresponding sec-tions of the Housing Element is
summarized in Table A.
Housing Element Contents:          The Housing Element consists of the following major
components:
      â¢      An analysis of the cityâs demographic and housing characteristics and trends
             (Chapter II);
      â¢      An evaluation of land, financial, and administrative resources available to
             address the Cityâs housing goals (Chapter III); and
      â¢      A review of potential constraints, both governmental and non-governmental,
             to meeting Ojaiâs identified housing needs (Chapter IV);
      â¢      The Housing Action Plan for addressing the Cityâs identified housing needs,
             including housing goals, policies and programs (Chapter V).
B.      Community Context
The City of Ojai is a community of 7,535 persons (as of 2012) located on US Highway 33 in
the Ojai Valley of Ventura County, approximately 12 miles north of the City of Ventura.
The City is a predominately low density residential community contained within four
                                                7                            December 2013

square miles and surrounded by a rural landscape of large lot large estates, orchards
and picturesque hillsides. The community has long been known as a haven for artists,
musicians and health enthusiasts: a âvillageâ as locals call it. Its beauty gained fame
decades ago when the area was photographed to represent Shangri-La in the 1939
movie, The Lost Horizon. The community is built around a quaint downtown commercial
district filled with boutique shops, art galleries and a host of places to retreat from the
fast-paced lifestyle of more urbanized areas. A fundamental goal of the Housing Element
is to address the housing needs of current and future residents in ways that respect and
enhance the quality of life which is âonly in Ojai.â
C.      Public Participation
Public participation is an important component of the planning process in Ojai, and this
update to the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested parties
numerous opportunities for involvement. Appendix C contains a summary of these
opportunities as well as a list of persons and organizations that were notified during the
Housing Element update process and a summary of comments and issues raised.
D.      Consistency with Other Elements of the General Plan
State law requires that all portions of the General Plan be internally consistent. The City of
Ojai General Plan consists of nine elements: Land Use; Circulation; Housing; Air Quality;
Open Space; Conservation; Recreation; Noise; and Safety. This Housing Element builds
                                               8                               December 2013

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                                       I. Introduction
upon the other elements and is consistent with the policies and proposals set forth by the
General Plan. Examples of inter-element consistency include: residential development
capacities established in the Land Use Element are incorporated within the Housing
Element, and the discussion of infrastructure and public services in the Housing Element is
consistent with the Land Use and Safety elements. As the General Plan is amended
through time, the City will review the Housing Element for internal consistency, and make
any necessary revisions.
SB 1087 of 2005 requires cities to provide a copy of their Housing Elements to local water
and sewer providers, and also requires that these agencies provide priority hookups for
developments with lower-income housing. The Housing Element will be provided to these
agencies immediately upon adoption.

II.     HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This chapter examines general population and household characteristics and trends,
such as age, race and ethnicity, employment, household composition and size,
household income, and special needs. Characteristics of the existing housing stock (e.g.,
number of units and type, tenure, age and condition, costs) are also addressed. Finally,
the cityâs projected housing growth needs based on the latest Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) are examined.
The Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent data from the 2010 U.S. Census,
American Community Survey (ACS), California Department of Finance (DOF), California
Employment Development Department (EDD), Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG) and other relevant sources. Supplemental data was obtained
through field surveys and from private organizations. In addition, Ventura Countyâs
Consolidated Plan provides useful information for this update of the Housing Element. The
implications of these findings for the cityâs housing policies and programs are also
discussed.
A.      Population Characteristics
        1.          Population Growth Trends
Ojai experienced modest growth during the 1990s, but its population has declined since
2000, to an estimated 7,535 in 2012(see Table II-1 and Figure II-1).
                                                                   Table II-1

        2.      Age
Housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of the population. Different age
groups have different housing needs based on lifestyles, family types, income levels, and
housing preference. Table II-2 provides a comparison of the cityâs and countyâs
population by age group in 2010. This table shows that the age distribution of the cityâs
population is, overall, older than Ventura County as a whole (median age of 47.1 vs. 36.2
for the county). Children age 19 and under represent about 23% of the cityâs population
compared to about 29% for the county as a whole. Ojai also has a larger percentage of
seniors (65+) compared to the county (19.3% city vs. 11.6% county). Figure II-2 shows the
trend in age distribution from 2000 to 2012.

The racial and ethnic composition of Ojai differs from Ventura County in that a smaller
proportion of city residents are Hispanic/Latino. Approximately 18% of city residents
reported Hispanic/Latino ancestry, contrasted with about 40% for the County as a whole
(Table II-3).

B.      Household Characteristics
        1.         Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing
needed in a city. The Census defines a âhouseholdâ as all persons occupying a housing
unit, which may include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or
blood, or unrelated persons sharing a single unit. Persons in group quarters such as
dormitories, retirement or convalescent homes, or other group living situations are
included in population totals, but are not considered households.
Table II-4 provides a comparison of households by type for the city and Ventura County
as a whole, as reported in the 2010 Census. Family households comprised approximately
61% of all households in the city, compared to about 74% for the county as a whole. The
cityâs average household size is significantly smaller than Ventura County as a whole
(2.34 persons per household in the city vs. 3.04 persons per household in the county).
These statistics suggest that there is a lesser need for large units in Ojai than for some
other areas of Ventura County, and nearly one-third of households are persons living
alone.

        2.         Housing Tenure
Housing tenure (owner vs. renter) is an important indicator of the housing market.
Communities need an adequate supply of units available both for rent and for sale in
order to accommodate a range of households with varying incomes, family sizes and

occupied and renter-occupied units in the city in 2010 as compared to the county as a

        3.      Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The
U.S. Census Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than
one person per room, excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding
when there are more than 1.5 occupants per room. Overcrowded households are
usually a reflection of the lack of affordable housing. Table II-6 indicates that
overcrowding in the City of Ojai is less prevalent than for Ventura County as a whole.

According to Census Bureau estimates, overcrowding is more likely to affect renters;
about 4% of renter households in the city were overcrowded and an additional 2% were
severely overcrowded while only about 1% of owner households were overcrowded and
none was severely overcrowded.

        4.        Household Income
Household income is a primary factor affecting housing needs in a community â the
ability of residents to afford housing is directly related to household income. According to
the Southern California Association of Governments, about 46% of households in Ojai fell
into the lower-income categories 1 compared to just 40% for Ventura County as a whole
(Table II-7).

        5.        Overpayment
According to State housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30% of
gross household income. Table II-8 displays recent estimates for overpayment in Ojai for
owners and renters. It is estimated that 37% of owner households and 55% of renter
households were overpaying for housing.
Although homeowners enjoy income and property tax deductions and other benefits
that help to compensate for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may need to
defer maintenance or repairs due to limited funds, which can lead to deterioration. For
lower-income renters, severe cost burden can require families to double up resulting in
overcrowding and related problems.
  Together, the extremely-low, very-low, and low income categories are considered âlower-incomeâ

Extremely Low Income Households
State law requires quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of
extremely low-income (ELI) households. Extremely low income is defined as households
with income less than 30% of area median income. The 2013 area median income for
Ventura County was $89,300 (see Table II-15). For extremely-low-income households, this
means an income of $26,800 or less for a four-person household. Households with
extremely-low-income have a variety of housing needs.
        Existing Needs
According to SCAG estimates, extremely-low-income households represented about 14%
of all households in Ojai.
        Projected Needs
The projected housing need for extremely-low-income households is assumed to be 50%
of the very-low-income regional housing need of 87 units, or 44 extremely-low-income
units during the 2014-2021 period. The resources and programs to address this need are
similar to those for other low-income households and are discussed throughout the
Housing Element, including Chapter V, the Housing Action Plan. Because the needs of
extremely-low-income households overlap extensively with other special needs groups,
further analysis and resources for extremely-low-income households can be found in
Chapter II, Needs Assessment, Section E, Special Needs, and Chapter IV, Constraints,
Section A.g. Special Needs Housing.

C.      Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. The jobs
available in each employment sector and the wages for these jobs affect the type and
size of housing residents can afford.
        1.      Current Employment Characteristics
Current employment and projected job growth have a significant influence on housing
needs during this planning period. Table II-9 shows that the cityâs estimated labor
participation rate was approximately 63% of the working-age population, which is slightly
lower than the estimated 67% for the county as a whole.

Future housing needs are affected by the number and type of new jobs created during
this planning period. Table II-10 shows projected job growth by industry for the Oxnard-
Thousand Oaks-Ventura MSA (Ventura County) for the period 2008-2018. Total
employment in Ventura County is expected to grow by about 8% during this 10-year
period. The overall growth is expected to add 26,500 new jobs and bring the
employment of Ventura County to over 371,000 by 2018. The industries with the largest
projected job growth are Education/Health Care/Social Assistance, Leisure/Hospitality,
Professional and Business Services, and Accommodation/Food Services.

D.          Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the communityâs housing
stock and helps in identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the
number and type of housing units, recent growth trends, age and condition, tenure,
vacancy, housing costs, affordability, and assisted affordable units at-risk of loss due to
conversion to market-rate. A housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, mobile
home, or group of rooms, occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for
occupancy as separate living quarters.

        1.      Housing Type
As of 2010, the housing stock in Ojai was comprised mostly of single-family detached
homes, which made up over 68% of all units, while multi-family units comprised about 22%
of housing units. About 10% of units were single-family attached (condo) units. Table II-11
provides a breakdown of the housing stock by type in 2010.

        2.      Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior
to 1978 before stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed, may have
interior or exterior building components coated with lead-based paint. Housing units built
before 1970 are the most likely to need rehabilitation and to have lead-based paint in
deteriorated condition. Lead-based paint becomes hazardous to children under age six
and to pregnant women when it peels off walls or is pulverized by lead-based paint
coated windows and doors opening and closing.
Table II-12 shows the age distribution of the housing stock in Ojai as reported in the 2010
Census. This table shows that the majority of units were constructed prior to 1970. These
findings suggest that there may be strong need for maintenance and rehabilitation,
including remediation of lead-based paint, for a large proportion of the Cityâs housing
stock.

Independent field surveys by City Building and Planning staff were conducted during
2007 to better assess the condition of housing in Ojai. The results are depicted in Table 39
and suggest less overall need as opposed to data reported in the 2000 Census; 47 total
substandard units were identified in the surveys as opposed to 60 units using Census
definitions (i.e., lacking of plumbing, electrical and similar deficiencies). The survey data
also suggest that the majority of substandard conditions are largely cosmetic (i.e.,
deferred maintenance) as opposed to those needing major rehabilitation (Table II-13). In
sum total, 14 dwellings were identified as candidates for replacement (i.e., dilapidation
and functional obsolescence).

        3.      Vacancy
According to the state Department of Finance, the housing vacancy rate in Ojai was
approximately 8% in 2012. For the county as a whole, the vacancy rate was estimated to
be just over 5% (Table II-14).

        4.      Housing Cost
a.      Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on
the area (i.e., county) median income (âAMIâ): extremely-low (30% or less of AMI), very-
low (31-50% of AMI), low (51-80% of AMI), moderate (81-120% of AMI) and above
moderate (over 120% of AMI). Housing affordability is based on the relationship between
household income and housing expenses. According to HUD and the California
Department of Housing and Community Development, housing is considered
âaffordableâ if the monthly payment is no more than 30% of a householdâs gross income.
In some areas (such as Ventura County), these income limits may be increased to adjust
for high housing costs.
Table II-15 shows 2013 affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices
for housing in Ventura County by income category. Based on state-adopted standards,
the maximum affordable monthly rent for extremely-low-income households is $670, while
the maximum affordable rent for very-low-income households is $1,116. The maximum
affordable rent for low-income households is $1,780, while the maximum for moderate-
income households is $2,679. These figures are based on a 4-person household and are
adjusted for different household sizes.
Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage
interest rates and qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments,
                                                         24                                         December 2013

b.      For-Sale Housing
Median housing sales price statistics for Ventura County during 2012 (Table II-16) show
that housing in Ojai is generally more expensive than most areas of the county. The
median single-family sales price was $445,000, while the median price for condos was
$280,000. Based on the estimated affordable purchase prices shown in Table II-15, very
few single-family homes or condos are likely to be affordable to low-income residents.
These data illustrate that public subsidies are required to reduce sales prices to a level
that is affordable to lower-income homebuyers.

c.       Rental Housing
An internet search of available rental units in Ojai during August 2013 found rents ranging
from $895 to over $2,500 per month 2, with those units at the upper end of the range
being single-family homes.
When market rents are compared to the amounts lower-income households can afford
to pay (Table II-15), it is clear that extremely-low and very-low-income households have
difficulty finding rental housing without overpaying. However, most rental units fall within
the affordable range for low- and moderate-income households.
E.       Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to
special circumstances. Such circumstances may be related to oneâs employment and

income, family characteristics, disability, or other conditions. As a result, some Ojai
residents may experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or other
housing problems.
State Housing Element law defines âspecial needsâ groups to include persons with
disabilities, the elderly, large households, female-headed households with children,
homeless people, and farm workers. This section contains a discussion of the housing
needs facing each of these groups.
        1.      Persons with Disabilities
Disabilities may include sensory difficulties (vision, hearing, etc.), cognitive difficulties,
mobility difficulties or self-care difficulties. Such issues may make independent living
problematic.
Due to Ojaiâs small population, disability data was not reported in the most recent ACS.
Housing opportunities for persons with disabilities can be expanded through housing
assistance programs and providing universal design features such as widened doorways,
ramps, lowered countertops, single-level units and ground floor units. During the prior
planning period the City amended the Municipal Code to establish procedures to
ensure reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities pursuant to Government
Code Sec. 65008 and 65583 (SB 520).
Developmentally Disabled
As defined by federal law, âdevelopmental disabilityâ means a severe, chronic disability
of an individual that:
           â¢    Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental
                and physical impairments;
           â¢    Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
           â¢    Is likely to continue indefinitely;
           â¢    Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following
                areas of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive
                language; c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for
                independent living; or g) economic self-sufficiency;
           â¢    Reflects the individualâs need for a combination and sequence of special,
                interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms
                of assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually
                planned and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S.
Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage
of the population that can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many
developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group
living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals
                                                  27                                December 2013

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                            II. Housing Needs Assessment
may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy
are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the personâs
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-
based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and
their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental
centers, and two community-based facilities. Ojai is served by the Tri-Counties Regional
Center 3 (TCRC) which is based in Santa Barbara and operates a field office in Oxnard. As
of 2011 the Center served approximately 11,300 clients and had 280 staff persons. TCRC
reported that it assisted 144 Ojai residents in 2012. Any resident who has a developmental
disability that originated before age 18 is eligible for services. Services are offered to
people with developmental disabilities based on Individual Program Plans and may
include: Adult day programs; advocacy; assessment/consultation; behavior
management programs; diagnosis and evaluation; independent living services; infant
development programs; information and referrals; mobility training; prenatal diagnosis;
residential care; respite care; physical and occupational therapy; transportation;
consumer, family vendor training; and vocational training. TCRC also coordinates the
state-mandated Early Start program, which provides services for children under age
three who have or are at substantial risk of having a developmental disability.
         2.      Elderly
According to ACS estimates, approximately 32% of owner households and 18% of renter
households in Ojai were headed by someone age 65 or older (Table II-17). Many elderly
persons are dependent on fixed incomes and many have disabilities. Elderly
homeowners may be physically unable to maintain their homes or cope with living alone.
The housing needs of this group can be partially addressed through smaller units, second
units on lots with existing homes, shared living arrangements, congregate housing and
housing assistance programs.

        3.      Large Households
Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as
those with five or more members. Recent ACS data reported that about 8% of owner
households and about 15% of renter households had five or more members (Table II-18).
This distribution indicates a relatively low need for large units with four or more bedrooms,
and there are significantly more small households with one or two persons in Ojai.

        4.      Female-Headed Households
According to ACS estimates, about 11% of owner households and 18% of renter
households were headed by a female (Table II-19). While female-headed households
represent a relatively small portion of all households, they often have special challenges
                                                                29                                    December 2013

         5.       Farm Workers
Unlike most areas of the Southern California metropolitan area, agriculture is still a
significant component of the economy in Ventura County, with a total annual crop
value of over $1.8 billion in 2011 4. There is strong public sentiment for retaining agricultural
production, as reflected in the SOAR (Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources)
initiatives that have been approved by voters. Figure II-3 illustrates the wide variety of
crops produced in the county.

Accurate statistics regarding agricultural workers in Ventura County, especially migrant
workers, are difficult to obtain. One source of data for the Ventura County farmworker
population is the Migrant Health Program, housed in the federal Bureau of Primary Health
Care, Health Resources and Services Administration 5. In their most recent study (2000),
MHP researchers estimated the number of farm workers in several categories: total
number of farm workers, the number of seasonal farm workers, and the number of
migrant farm workers (those who establish temporary residences in connection with their
work), as well as the total number of people living in farm worker households (Table II-20).

As part of its technical assistance to member jurisdictions for the 2013 Housing Element
Cycle, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) compiled a variety of
demographic and employment statistics 6 that included information related to farm
workers. According to SCAG, about 11,000 persons living in Ventura County are

With its mild climate, agriculture is a year-round activity in Ventura County, and most
farm laborers are permanent non-migrant and seasonal laborers. As such, the housing
needs of farmworkers are primarily addressed through the provision of permanent
affordable housing, such as lower-cost apartments and single-family homes. In
compliance with the Employee Housing Act (Health and Safety Code Sections 17021.5
and 17021.6), the Municipal Code allows farmworker housing for up to 12 units or 36
persons by-right (i.e., without a CUP or other discretionary approval) in zones allowing
agricultural uses.
        6.      Homeless Persons
Homelessness is a continuing national problem that persists within local cities and
communities including Ventura County. During the past two decades, an increasing
number of single persons have remained homeless year after year and have become
the most visible of all homeless persons. Other persons (particularly families) have
experienced shorter periods of homelessness. However, they are often replaced by other
families and individuals in a seemingly endless cycle of homelessness.
The homeless count conducted by the Ventura County Homeless and Housing Coalition
(VCHHC) in January 2012 reported 41 homeless persons in Ojai, which represents about
2% of the county total (Table II-22). The most recent survey by VCHHC identified a
number of sub-populations of the homeless, as shown in Table II-23. These include families
that might be displaced through evictions, women and children displaced through
abusive family life, persons with substance abuse problems, or personssuffering from
mental illness.

Although there are myriad causes of homelessness, among the most common causes
are the following:
      â¢      Substance Abuse and Alcohol
            The 2012 Ventura County survey found that more than one-quarter of
            homeless persons reported problems with alcohol or other substance abuse.
            The Ventura County Housing and Homeless Coalition has identified a need for
            additional treatment facilities with supportive housing. They also recommend
            that a treatment facility be established for youth with drug and alcohol
            addiction.
                                                               33                                        December 2013

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                             II. Housing Needs Assessment
            The State of California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs licenses
            residential facilities and/or certified alcohol and drug programs in Ventura
            County. There are eleven residential facilities and two residential detoxification
            facilities in the county.
      â¢      Domestic Violence
            Nearly one-quarter of homeless persons in Ventura County reported being
            victims of domestic violence. The Ventura County Housing and Homeless
            Coalition has identified a need for additional shelters for battered women and
            runaway youth. These individuals also require counseling and assistance to
            become self-sufficient or return to their families. Victims of household violence
            can become homeless as a result of escaping abusive living environments.
            They also suffer physical and psychological trauma as a result of the abuse.
            Many of these persons (almost exclusively women) are ill equipped to fend for
            themselves and their children. Without access to low-income housing, reliable
            transportation and supportive counseling they are at a greater disadvantage
            and create special homeless needs. Common issues faced by battered
            women are lack of jobs, lack of child care, lack of affordable housing,
            underemployment, codependent substance abuse, and a need for
            marketable skills.
      â¢      Mental Illness
            Persons who are homeless and mentally ill have special needs that may not be
            served in traditional homeless shelters. Many are at risk in the community,
            frequently being victimized and often suffering from physical and mental
            illnesses due to lack of proper nourishment and shelter. Many of the homeless
            mentally ill do not avail themselves of services or cannot be served by
            traditional services due to their untreated psychiatric symptoms, active
            substance abuse, histories of abusive behaviors.
            The 2012 survey reported that 28% of homeless persons in Ventura County
            suffered from some form of mental illness. Ojai, as part of the Ventura County
            service area, receives assistance with the homeless mentally ill from the
            Ventura County Behavioral Health Department.
Although there are currently no emergency shelters within the City of Ojai, there are
services for the homeless and year-round shelters located in the larger population
centers of Ventura and Oxnard, where most homeless persons congregate. Senate Bill
(SB) 2 of 2007 amended Government Code Secs. 65582, 65583 and 65589.5 to strengthen
the planning requirements for emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing. SB
2 requires that shelters be allowed âby-rightâ (i.e., without a conditional use permit or
other discretionary approval) in at least one zoning district. In accordance with SB 2, the
City amended the Municipal Code during the previous planning period to allow
emergency shelters in the Business Professional Commercial (BP) zone.

F.          Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
As part of the Housing Element, jurisdictions must evaluate the potential for deed-
restricted low-income housing units to convert from affordable to market rate status
within the ten-year period 2013-2023. The inventory includes all multi-family rental units
assisted under federal, state and/or local programs including federal and state grants,
bond programs, redevelopment projects, local in-lieu fees, housing trusts funds,
inclusionary housing and density bonuses. The inventory covers all units that are eligible
for conversion to market rate housing due to termination of subsidy contracts, mortgage
prepayment, or expiring use restrictions. This inventory was compiled through City staff,
Ventura County Area Housing Authority and California Housing Partnership Corporation.
There are four assisted projects in the City: Whispering Oaks (a 101-unit senior rental
project owned and managed by the Ventura County Area Housing Authority);
Montgomery Oaks (a 21-unit family rental project owned and managed by Cabrillo
Economic Development Corporation); and two Section 8 property-based family rental
projects totaling 15 units (owned and managed by the Ventura County Area Housing
Authority). None of the properties is at risk of conversion within the 2023 time horizon
(Table II-24).

G.          Future Growth Needs
            1.           Overview of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is a key tool for local governments to
plan for anticipated growth. The latest RHNA was adopted by the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) in October 2012 and covers the projection period of
January 2014 to October 2021. The future need for housing is determined primarily by the
forecasted growth in households in a community. Each new household, created by a
                                                               35                                     December 2013

child moving out of a parent's home, by a family moving to a community for
employment, and so forth, creates the need for a housing unit. The housing need for new
households is then adjusted to maintain a desirable level of vacancy to promote housing
choice and mobility. An adjustment is also made to account for units expected to be lost
due to demolition, natural disaster, or conversion to non-housing uses. The sum of these
factors â household growth, vacancy need, and replacement need â determines the
construction need for a community. Total housing need is then distributed among four
income categories 7 on the basis of the countyâs income distribution, with adjustments to
avoid an over-concentration of lower-income households in any community.
          2.      2014-2021 Ojai Growth Needs
The total housing growth need for the City of Ojai during the 2014-2021 projection period
is 371 units. This total is distributed by income category as shown in Table II-25.

A discussion of the Cityâs resources for addressing this growth need is provided in Chapter
III.
7    Although AB 2634 requires Housing Elements to consider the needs of extremely-low-income households,
     the RHNA does not quantify the need for this category. State law allows individual jurisdictions to establish
     the extremely-low-income need as one-half of the very-low-income RHNA allocation.

III.     RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES
A.       Land Resources
Section 65583(a)(3) of the Government Code requires Housing Elements to contain an
âinventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and
public facilities and services to these sites.â A detailed analysis of sites with potential for
housing development is provided in Appendix B. The results of this analysis are
summarized in Table III-1, below. The table shows that the cityâs land inventory exceeds
the RHNA allocation for the 2014-2021 period. The Housing Action Plan (Chapter V)
contains programs to encourage and facilitate development of housing for all economic
segments of the community.

A discussion of public facilities and infrastructure needed to serve future development is
contained in Section IV.B, Non-Governmental Constraints. There are currently no known
service limitations that would preclude the level of development described in the RHNA,
although developers will be required to pay fees or construct public improvements prior
to or concurrent with development.
B.       Financial and Administrative Resources
         1.           State and Federal Resources
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) - The City of Ojai is eligible to
receive federal Community Development Block Grant funding annually through the its
âsmall citiesâ association with the Cities of Fillmore, Moorpark, Port Hueneme, Santa
Paula, and the County of Ventura. These funds are available for affordable housing
projects and public facilities serving low income residents, including new housing
construction, ownership and rental rehabilitation, infrastructure improvements and the
provision of public facilities and services for low income residents. The balance of this
funding can be utilized for economic development and planning activities. These funds
are allocated on a formula basis with Ojaiâs share being 3.2% of the annual allocation.
                                                            37                             December 2013

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                       III. Resources and Opportunities
Based on the most recent funding cycle, and allowing for a modest 2% annual increase
in totally funding, it is expected that Ojai may receive approximately $500,000 during the
forthcoming Housing Element cycle.
HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME) - Federal HOME funds can be used for a
variety of activities that promote affordable rental housing and homeownership for low-
and very-low-income households. Funds may be used for building acquisition, new
construction, reconstruction, moderate or substantial rehabilitation, first-time homebuyer
assistance, and tenant-based assistance. Grant recipients must provide a local match
ranging between 25% and 50% depending on program activity. Unlike CDBG monies that
are allocated by formula, HOME funds are channeled through the County of Ventura
and are available on a competitive basis.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program - The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)
Program was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to provide an alternate method of
funding low-and moderate-income housing. Each state receives a tax credit, based
upon population, toward funding housing that meets program guidelines. The tax credits
are then used to leverage private capital into new construction or acquisition and
rehabilitation of affordable housing. Limitations on projects funded under the LIHTC
program include minimum requirements that a certain percentage of units remain rent-
restricted, based upon median income.
Other State and Federal Resources â A wide variety of state programs provide funding
assistance for housing, as summarized in Table III-2.
        2.      Local Resources
Ojai Redevelopment Agency - Prior to 2012, State law required that redevelopment
agencies set aside no less than 20% of all tax increment revenue derived within
designated project areas for activities that increase, improve or preserve the supply of
housing affordable to persons of low- and moderate-income. Statutes then in effect also
required that 15% of all new privately developed housing and 30% of Agency-assisted
housing within the Project Area must be made affordable to persons and families of low-
and moderate-income. However, as a consequence of the state legislatureâs approval
of AB 1x26 and subsequent rulings of the California Supreme Court, redevelopment
agencies in California were dissolved in 2012 and this source of funding for affordable
housing is no longer available.

Non-Profit Housing Organizations - In addition to direct funding, Ojai has access to
indirect resources through alliances with local non-profit housing organizations. The
organizations most active in Ventura County include: (i) Area Housing Authority of
Ventura County, a political subdivision of the State responsible for providing affordable
housing through rent subsidy programs or by occupancy in one of its housing
developments; (ii) Peoplesâ Self-Help Housing Corporation (PSHHC), a private non-profit
housing developer providing design, implementation, technical assistance and property
management of low-income ownership and rental housing; and (iii) Cabrillo Economic
Development Corporation (CEDC), offering construction, property management,
homeownership, counseling and community building services.

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                          III. Resources and Opportunities
C.       Energy Conservation Opportunities
Energy efficiency is important not only for conserving natural resources, it has the added
benefit of keeping incidental housing costs in check. It also has public policy
ramifications relative to underwriting the cost of providing affordable housing. As noted
in Section III and codified in Title 25, Section 6920 of the California Code of Regulations,
utility expenses are part of the formula used in computing of maximum rents and sales
prices that may be charged for housing that is made available to target income groups.
High utility costs translate to lower the rent and price thresholds, which in turn result in
larger financial gaps between market rate and affordable housing. Simply put, as
residential energy costs rise, housing affordability declines. As such, it is in the shared
interest of the consumer and City to promote energy conservation. In this regard, there
are three principal means by which to promote efficient use of energy resources: (i)
building regulation; (ii) land use practice; and (iii) education and inducement.
Building Regulation. The City is subject to the California Building Code (âCBCâ) that
establishes minimum standards for all classes of construction. A component of the state
Building Code is Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations that prescribes minimum
energy conservation features and requires the adoption of energy budgets for all new
development. Beyond the requirements of Code (particularly in regard to existing
homes), the City has the opportunity to promote energy conservation as a condition of
receiving financial assistance for housing rehabilitation programs it may choose to
underwrite. One such approach would be to employ the standards prescribed in the
Code of Federal Regulations (24 CFR 39.7). Property improvements undertaken pursuant
to 24 CFR 39.7 encompass: (i) exterior weatherization consisting of weather-stripping,
caulking and water heater insulation blankets; (ii) interior weatherization consisting of
attic insulation, duct wrap and flow restrictors for showerheads and sink aerators; (iii)
energy-efficient retrofit consisting of water saver toilets, wall insulation, floor insulation,
space conditioning equipment, set back thermostats, pipe insulation, electronic ignition
of forced air furnaces and gas cooking appliances; and (iv) energy-efficient lighting.
Land Use Practices. The goal of promoting compact development and resulting
efficiencies is very relevant in the Housing Element update, in particular, mixed-use
development policies that foster smart growth principles by: (i) creating affordable
housing near employment, thereby reducing automobile dependency; and (ii)
concentrating growth in existing urbanized areas, thereby maximizing existing
infrastructure. In the prior Housing Element cycle, the City advanced these principals by
revamping the Village Mixed Use zone district to induce infill development. A companion
effort is presently underway to develop Green Building Guidelines that promote
sustainable designs and environmentally responsible construction. It is anticipated that
the Guidelines will embody the principals of LEED (Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design) that promotes a whole-building approach to sustainability by
recognizing performance in five key areas of human and environmental health:
sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection, and
indoor environmental quality.
Education and Inducement. According to Southern California Edison, 44% of residential
energy costs are attributed to heating and cooling systems, 33% is attributed to lighting
and appliances, 14% is attributed to water heaters and 9% is attributed to refrigerators.
                                               40                                 December 2013

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                       III. Resources and Opportunities
SCE further notes that residential consumers can realize significant savings by a variety of
relatively simple practices including insulating water pipes, weather stripping, cleaning
refrigerator coils, using compact fluorescent light bulbs, repairing leaky faucets, sealing
heating and cooling ducts, servicing furnace filters and installing programmable
thermostats. To both assist and incentivize consumers to conserve, SCE offers a variety of
programs; most notable, energy audits, performance incentives, equipment rebates,
design and construction assistance, and technical advice. With the recent advent of the
Green Building initiative, the City has the opportunity to affirmatively further energy
conservation education and avail its residents of programs available though SCE. In
addition, the City can better leverage its own resources by including SCE incentives in
housing rehabilitation programs it may choose to underwrite.

IV. CONSTRAINTS
In planning for the provision of housing, constraints to the development, maintenance
and improvement of housing must be recognized, and jurisdictions must take
appropriate steps to mitigate them where feasible. Local government cannot control
many of these constraints, such as those related to general economic and market
conditions, but others can be addressed. Potential constraints to housing are discussed
below, and include governmental constraints and non-governmental constraints.
A.      Governmental Constraints
Governmental regulations, while intentionally controlling the quality of development in
the community can also, unintentionally, increase the cost of development and thus the
cost of housing. These governmental constraints include land use controls, building codes
and their enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions required of
developers, and local development processing and permit procedures.
Land use controls may limit the amount or density of development, thus increasing the
cost per unit. On-site and off-site improvements such as roads, traffic signals on adjacent
streets, or sewer systems may increase an individual projectâs costs of development.
Processing and permit requirements may delay construction, increasing financing and/or
overhead costs of a development. The following describes potential governmental
constraints, which may affect the supply and cost of housing in Ojai.
        1.      Land Use Plans and Regulations
a.      General Plan
Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term General
Plan to guide its future. The land use element of the General Plan establishes the basic
land uses and density of development within the various areas of the city. Under state
law, the General Plan elements must be internally consistent and the Cityâs zoning must
be consistent with the General Plan. Thus, the land use plan must provide suitable
locations and densities to implement the policies of the Housing Element.
The Land Use Element provides for five residential land use designations and three flexible
designations, as shown in Table IV-1. The Special Housing Overlay (SPL) designation
accommodates very-low- and low-income housing, as described in the following
discussion of zoning regulations and in Program 6 in the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V).

b.       Zoning Designations and Development Standards
As is typical for most California jurisdictions, Ojai has adopted a variety of development
standards for all of its zone districts. These standards are codified in Title 10 of the Ojai
Municipal Code and include requirements for lot area, off-street parking, lot coverage,
density, building height and setbacks. Standards particular to residential construction are set
forth in Table IV-2. With the exception of density and height limits (discussed below), the
Cityâs development standards are not dissimilar to those imposed in other Ventura County
jurisdictions. Of the ten principal zone districts that allow residential construction, the Village
Mixed Use (VMU) district provides the most flexibility.

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                                           IV. Constraints
As shown in Table IV-2, height limits in the Cityâs multiple-family zones are limited to two-
story construction except in the VMU zone. Currently the zones other than VMU are also
subject to a 30 foot height limit. The City is considering lowering the basic height limit to
25 feet, except for architectural features up to 30 feet, which may be approved through
a design review process if determined to fit the neighborhood and not adversely impact
adjoining properties. VMU is the only zone district that allows residential units and does
not expressly limit the number of building stories. As noted in Program 6 (Chapter V),
consultation with non-profit housing developers confirmed that affordable housing is
feasible in Ojai within a two-story building envelope, therefore a two-story height limit
would not pose an unreasonable constraint to meeting the Cityâs affordable housing
needs.
c.      Provision of Housing for Lower-Income Households
Low-income housing can be accommodated in all zones permitting residential use,
provided they meet site development standards. These may include multi-family units in
residential or mixed-use zones, or second residential units that are permitted within all of
the single-family residential zones. In order to expand opportunities for lower-income
housing, the Special Housing Overlay (SPL) regulations were amended in the previous
planning period to allow multi-family development by-right at a minimum density of 20
units/acre for sites within the SPL overlay (see also the sites inventory presented in
Appendix B).
d.      Special Needs Housing
Persons with special needs include those in residential care facilities, persons with
disabilities, farm workers, persons needing emergency shelter or transitional living
arrangements, and single room occupancy units. Many of these groups also fall under
the category of extremely low-income households. The Cityâs provisions for these housing
types are discussed below.
      â¢      Residential Care Facilities â As defined in Section 10-2.3602 of the Ojai
             Municipal Code, the term âresidential care homeâ means: ââ¦a dwelling
             unitâ¦which provides twenty-four (24) hour nonmedical care of unrelated
             persons who are in need of personal servicesâ¦â and expressly include
             ââ¦childrenâs homes; transitional houses; orphanages; rehabilitation centers;
             and self-help group homes.â While the Cityâs Zoning Ordinance does not make
             expressed reference to shared living arrangements for disabled persons, such
             arrangements are clearly embodied within the definition of residential care
             homes. The Municipal Code allows residential care facilities for six persons or
             less as a permitted use in any residential zone in conformance with state law.
             Residential care facilities for seven or more persons are conditionally permitted
             in the R2 and R3 zones.
      â¢      Housing for Persons with Disabilities â Both the federal Fair Housing Act and the
             California Fair Employment and Housing Act impose an affirmative duty on
             local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e. modifications
             or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such
                                                 45                               December 2013

               accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal
               opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The Building Codes adopted by the
               City of Ojai incorporate accessibility standards contained in Title 24 of the
               California Administrative Code. For example, apartment complexes of three or
               more units and condominium complexes of four or more units must be
               designed to accessibility standards. A Reasonable Accommodation
               Ordinance was also adopted in 2013 in conformance with state law.
       â¢       Farm Worker Housing âHousing for agricultural employees occurs in two types
               of settings: housing accommodations located on farmland that is exclusively
               for farmworkers; or traditional housing that is intended for lower-income
               households but is not restricted to farmworkers.
               The majority of farm laborers in Ventura County are permanent non-migrant
               and seasonal workers. As such, the housing needs of farmworkers are primarily
               addressed through the provision of permanent affordable housing, such as
               apartments, lower-cost single-family homes, and mobile homes.
              The state Employee Housing Act 8 regulates farmworker housing and generally
              requires that facilities with no more than 36 beds (as group quarters) or 12
              separate units be treated as an agricultural land use that is not subject to any
              conditional use permit that is not required of other agricultural uses in the same
              zone. In accordance with state law, the Municipal Code was amended in the
              previous planning period to permit agricultural employee housing by-right in
              the Agriculture and Open Space zoning districts.
       â¢       Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing â An emergency
               shelter is a facility that provides shelter to homeless families and/or homeless
               individuals on a limited short-term basis. Transitional housing is temporary (often
               six months to two years) housing for a homeless individual or family who is
               transitioning to permanent housing. Supportive housing has no limit on length
               of stay and includes a supportive services component (e.g. job skills training,
               rehabilitation counseling, etc.) to allow individuals to gain necessary life skills in
               support of independent living.
               SB 2 of 2007 strengthened the requirements for local government regulations
               regarding emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing. Unless a
               city has sufficient existing shelter facilities to accommodate its need, land use
               regulations must identify at least one zoning district where shelters are a
               permitted use (i.e., do not require a conditional use permit or other
               discretionary review). The Municipal Code was amended in the previous
               planning period to allow emergency shelters with up to 27 beds by-right in the
               Business Professional (BP) zone. This zone designation is the best suited to
               accommodate homeless facilities by virtue of the mixed uses it allows and its
               proximity to complimentary health care facilities. In addition, the BP zone
               allows the most intense development of all zone districts within the City with an
               allowable Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 1.50 and overall lot coverage of 70%.

             Additional shelter beds may be permitted in the BP subject to a conditional
             use permit. Small emergency shelters for up to six persons are permitted by-
             right in any residential zone.
             The Municipal Code also specifies that transitional and supportive housing are
             residential uses subject to only those requirements that apply to other
             residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
Off-Street Parking Requirements
As shown in Table IV-3, required off-street parking within multiple family zone districts
range from two to three spaces per dwelling. Particularly noteworthy are the standards
applicable to higher density rental units (I.e., 9+ units per acre) which require as many as
two and one-half spaces per dwelling. In order to reduce potential constraints on
affordable housing and housing for persons with special needs, the Municipal Code was
amended in the previous planning period to allow reduced parking requirements for
projects that include off-setting considerations such as restrictions on the number of
vehicles that occupants may own, senior projects with alternative transportation options,
etc.

e.       Second Units
Second units are attached or detached dwelling units that provide complete
independent living facilities for one or more persons including permanent provisions for
living, sleeping, cooking and sanitation, located on the same lot as the primary structure.
The City permits the development of second units in all single-family residential zones. In
order to encourage construction of additional second units, in the previous planning
                                                               47                                              December 2013

period the Municipal Code was amended to eliminate the Design Review Permit
requirement for new second units that do not involve two-story construction or the
alteration of the second story of an existing two-story residence. In addition, the
construction of second units is exempt from the requirements of the Cityâs Growth
Management regulations. The Code was also amended to allow Home Splits, the division
of a single-family home of at least 2,000 square feet into two separate units without a
Design Review Permit when the project does not involve two-story construction or the
alteration of the second story of an existing two-story residence.
In 2013 the Code was also amended to create a program by which unpermitted units
that existed prior to 2006 may obtain legal non-conforming status. These provisions will
sunset on June 30, 2014.
f.      Mobile Homes and Manufactured Housing
There is an economy of scale in manufacturing homes in a plant rather than on site,
thereby reducing cost. State law precludes local governments from prohibiting the
installation of mobile homes on permanent foundations on single-family lots. It also
declares a mobile home park to be a permitted land use on any land planned and
zoned for residential use, and prohibits requiring the average density in a new mobile
home park to be less than that permitted by the Municipal Code.
The Municipal Code allows mobile homes and manufactured housing on permanent
foundations as a single-family residential use in any zone where single-family homes are
permitted. Mobile homes not on permanent foundations are permitted in the R-1 zone.
Mobile home parks are a conditionally permitted use in all residential zones.
g.      Density Bonus
Pursuant to state law (Government Code Sec. 65915 et seq.), cities and counties must
provide a density increase up to 35% over the otherwise maximum allowable residential
density under the zoning regulations and the Land Use Element of the General Plan (or
bonuses of equivalent financial value) when builders agree to construct housing
developments with units affordable to low- or moderate-income households. The
Municipal Code was amended in conformance with state density bonus law in 2013.
h.      Growth Management Ordinance
The Cityâs Growth Management Ordinance (GMO) regulates residential construction
through an annual permit allocation process. Similar traffic management-related policies
are embodied in the Air Quality Element and Circulation Element of the Cityâs General
Plan and limit the amount and intensity of future development through the establishment
of minimum acceptable traffic volumes. In 2013, the GMO was amended to exempt
second units and home splits from the program. The GMO was also amended to
eliminate the differentiation between single-family and multi-family allocation categories
by consolidating these into a single permit allocation pool, and to establish a special
pool to allow future use of unallocated units.
                                              48                              December 2013

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                                            IV. Constraints
Current County policy passed in 1988 prohibits discretionary development that may add
any unmitigable traffic on State Highway 33 through Casitas Springs during critical
weekday commuter peak travel periods. This roadway segment has experienced
unacceptable roadway service levels (Level of Service F) for several years and continues
to worsen. Companion traffic management policies are embodied in the Circulation
Element of the Cityâs General Plan. Policies 1, 2 and 3 have direct impact on residential
growth by limiting the amount and intensity of future development through the
establishment of minimum acceptable traffic volumes. Separate yet related policies
appear in the Cityâs Air Quality Element and are translated in the form of a Growth
Management Program.
        (i)     Residential Permit Allocations. Under the residential component of the
Growth Management Program and enabling ordinances, residential construction is
regulated through an annual permit allocation process. As shown in Table IV-4, annual
allocations have consistently exceeded actual construction, resulting in a cumulative
unused balance of 62 units. It is further noted that second dwellings and affordable
housing projects are expressly exempt from the allocation process. Together, these
factors provide evidence that the GMO does not impede housing production.
        (ii)    Permit Allocation Process. The process by which annual permit allocations
are made is dictated by criteria specified in the Cityâs Municipal Code. First and
foremost, all projects for which GMO permits are sought must meet the following
thresholds: (i) consistency with the Cityâs General Plan and Zoning Ordinance; and (ii)
availability of adequate public services and infrastructure. For projects meeting these
baseline thresholds, the Planning Director is delegated authority to issue permits for
single-family dwellings, while the Planning Commission is responsible for issuance of
multiple-family permits. Single family permits are issued on a âfirst come, first servedâ basis,
while multiple-family permits are allocated on a quarterly basis. When more projects are
proposed than there are permit allocations available, the Municipal Code specifies
preferences that guide the Planning Commissionâs allotments (e.g., infill development,
project readiness, social balance, design excellence and environmental compatibility).
Decisions of the Planning Director and Planning Commission are appealable to the City
Council.
        (iii)   Project Exemptions. As previously noted, second dwellings and affordable
housing projects are expressly exempt from the allocation process. This includes projects
that qualify for a density bonus in accordance with Government Code Section 65915
and applicable regulations of the City (per Section 10-6.401(e) of the Zoning Ordinance).

i.      Building Codes
State law prohibits the imposition of building standards that are not necessitated by local
geographic, climatic or topographic conditions and requires that local governments
making changes or modifications in building standards must report such charges to the
Department of Housing and Community Development and file an expressed finding that
the change is needed.
The City's building codes are based upon the California Building, Plumbing, Fire,
Mechanical, Electrical, Housing, Building Conservation and Energy Codes, and the
International Property Maintenance Code. These are considered the minimum necessary
to protect the public's health, safety and welfare. Although minor amendments have
been incorporated to address local conditions, no additional regulations have been
imposed by the city that would unnecessarily add to housing costs.
        2.        Residential Development Processing Procedures
State Planning and Zoning Law provides permit processing requirements for residential
development. Within the framework of state requirements, the City has structured its
development review process in order to minimize the time required to obtain permits
while ensuring that projects receive careful review.
The Cityâs permit process is codified in Title 10 of the Ojai Municipal Code and provides, in
regard to residential projects, three levels of governmental review: (i) approvals by the
Planning Director for Zoning Clearances and Minor Use Permits; (ii) approvals by the
Planning Commission for Design Review and Conditional Use Permits; and (iii) approvals
by the City Council when projects entail tentative maps, zone changes or other
legislative acts. With the limited exception of single-family dwellings within the RO and R1
zone districts, all projects, at a minimum, are subject to Design Review.
                                                                       50                                                        December 2013

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                                       IV. Constraints
Design Review â The Cityâs Design Guidelines are codified in Article 20 of the Zoning
Ordinance and provide objective and measurable criteria by which to evaluate
projects. The Planning Commission is charged with the responsibility for administering the
Design Guidelines and issuing relevant permits for all but the following types of
development: (i) single-family dwellings limited to one story (including second units); and
(ii) routine maintenance to all structures. The Design Review process entails discretion in
the application of prescribed standards; however, decision-making authority is expressly
limited to physical attributes of design as opposed to use or occupancy considerations.
This intent is reinforced with measures included in Program 17.
Permit Processing Time - The time required to process discretionary land use applications
has ranged from one to 33 months depending upon complexity, with an overall average
of 19 months. The types of discretionary approvals vary from project to project but are
typically processed concurrently, thereby improving overall time efficiency.
         3.      Development Fees and Improvement Requirements
State law limits fees charged for development permit processing to the reasonable cost
of providing the service for which the fee is charged. Various fees and off-site
improvement requirements are levied by the City (as well as other agencies) to cover
processing costs, provide services and construct facilities such as utilities, schools and
supporting infrastructure. These fees and public improvements are assessed through a
pro rata share system based on the magnitude of the projectâs impact or the extent of
benefit that will be derived. Table IV-5 summaries typical fee assessments and exactions
for a hypothetical 20-unit apartment project. Fees and exactions imposed on housing
projects in Ojai are comparable to those charged elsewhere within the county.

             Source: City of Ojai, 2013
The total development fees identified in Table IV-5 represent the estimated fees to
process and build a 20-unit apartment project. The City periodically evaluates the actual
cost of processing the development permits when revising its fee schedule.
After the passage of Proposition 13 and its limitation on local governmentsâ property tax
revenues, cities and counties have faced increasing difficulty in providing public services
and facilities to serve their residents. One of the main consequences of Proposition 13 has
been the shift in funding of new infrastructure from general tax revenues to development
impact fees and improvement requirements on land developers. The City requires
developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements necessary to serve their projects.
Such improvements may include water, sewer and other utility extensions, street
construction and traffic control device installation that are reasonably related to the
project. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for rights-of-
way, recreational facilities and school sites, consistent with the Subdivision Map Act.
City standards for new streets and highways are as follows:
        40 feet (curb-to-curb)
        60 feet (total right of way)
The Cityâs Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public improve-
ments including streets and other public works projects to facilitate the continued build-
                                                                          52                                                       December 2013

out of the Cityâs General Plan. The CIP helps to ensure that construction of public
improvements is coordinated with private development.
Although development fees and improvement requirements increase the cost of
housing, cities have little choice in establishing such requirements due to the limitations
on property taxes and other revenue sources needed to fund public improvements.
B.       Non-Governmental Constraints
         1.      Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints include physical features such as steep slopes, fault zones,
floodplains, sensitive biological habitat, and agricultural lands. In many cases,
development of these areas is constrained by state and federal laws (e.g., FEMA
floodplain regulations, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, and the
state Fish and Game Code and Alquist-Priolo Act). The Cityâs land use plans have been
designed to protect sensitive areas from development, and to protect public safety by
avoiding development in hazardous areas. While these policies constrain residential
development to some extent, they are necessary to support other public policies. The
assumptions regarding future capacity for housing development described in Chapter III
and Appendix B take these limitations into account.
         2.      Infrastructure Constraints
The infrastructure issues that most directly affect future housing development are water
supply, wastewater treatment and roadway capacity. These issues are discussed below.
a.       Water
Like all jurisdictions in Southern California, water supply is a serious concern in Ojai.
According to the Ventura County Watershed Protection District, water demand in
Ventura County has nearly tripled over the last 25 years, and is expected to double
again by 2050. In addition, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor data provided by
NOAA, the Ojai Valley is currently in a multi-year severe drought and has received only
43% of its average annual rainfall for this current water year.
Groundwater is the largest single source of water in Ventura County, and provides about
67% of the locally utilized water in the County. Agricultural demand accounts for 68% of
the total demand for groundwater in the County 9. Imported water from the State Water
Project represents about one-quarter of Ventura Countyâs total water supply, but under
normal circumstances is only available in the southern and eastern portions of the county
and does not contribute to water supplies in the City of Ojai.
The Golden State Water District (âGSWDâ) is an investor-owned public utility and operates
the water system for the City of Ojai, part of the unincorporated area east of Ventura

and part of the Meiners Oaks community west of Ojai. In 2010, the total water supply
conveyed by GSWC through the system to its customers was approximately 1,778 ac-
ft/yr. (compared to 2,710 ac-ft/yr in 2005). Of this amount, 87% was from local water well
extractions from the Ojai Valley Water Basin (âOjai Basinâ) and the balance was
purchased from Casitas Municipal Water District (âCMWDâ).
The EIR prepared in 2012 for the Cityâs 2006-2014 Housing Element concluded that
anticipated water supplies are adequate to serve the projected level of growth.
However, continuation of the current drought could result in the need for additional
measures to ensure adequate domestic water supply. It should be recognized that the
Cityâs obligations under state Housing Element law are to (1) provide adequate capacity
in its land use plans and zoning regulations to accommodate residential development
commensurate with the RHNA allocation; (2) analyze infrastructure limitations that could
hinder development; and (3) identify potential methods for removing infrastructure
constraints. Since other agencies have the primary authority for providing water, the
Cityâs power to address this issue is limited. Under state law, the RHNA allocations for the
current (2014-2021) period are final and not subject to revision or further review. Program
1 in the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V) includes a commitment to work cooperatively
with regional planning agencies in the preparation of future growth forecasts to ensure
that the Cityâs assigned share of housing need for the next planning cycle (expected to
cover the 2021-2029 period) reflects infrastructure and resource limitations such as water
supply.
b.       Wastewater
Wastewater collection and treatment is provided to City residents by the Ojai Valley
Sanitary District (âOVSDâ). OVSD operates a sewage treatment plant with a rated
capacity of 3.0 million gallons per day average dry weather flow (âGPDâ). The EIR
prepared in 2012 for the Cityâs 2006-2014 Housing Element, which had a 17% higher total
4th Cycle RHNA allocation over the current (5th Cycle) RHNA of 371 units, concluded that
the additional demand for wastewater treatment to serve the projected level of new
housing development would not exceed OVSDâs current capacity.
c.       Transportation
Access to the Ojai Valley is severely constrained by the limited number of routes
connecting the valley to surrounding areas, as well as the poor levels of service on State
Highway 33, the main route in and out of the Ojai Valley, and significant physical and
financial impediments to improving segments of this route. The EIR prepared in 2012 for
the Cityâs 2006-2014 Housing Element concluded that the additional traffic that would be
generated by the projected level of new housing development would not exceed
roadway capacity within the City of Ojai, but would cause a significant impact on SR-33
in the unincorporated Casitas Springs area to the southwest of the City. Under traffic-
related policies in the Cityâs General Plan, this situation poses a constraint on market-rate
development. However, affordable housing projects, second units and special needs
housing are expressly exempt from the Cityâs traffic impact-related policies.
d.       Summary
Water availability and roadway capacity pose the most significant potential
impediments to future housing production in Ojai. While there are various strategies and
                                               54                                December 2013

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                                         IV. Constraints
capital improvements that can help to mitigate these conditions, the cost and
jurisdictional means of implementing these actions are not wholly within the Cityâs
control. This suggests a blended approach that matches capacity with low-impact
development and programs that maximize opportunities through existing housing, while
at the same time pursuing projects and partnerships that provide requisite capacity for
managed growth. Toward that end, the following actions are included in Program 18 of
the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V):
        â¢   Facilitate RHNA objectives through new construction projects in which the City
            retains a financial and/or real property interest to best control design,
            development and occupancy; gear housing production toward small unit sizes
            and transit-oriented occupants; institute job-based occupancy preferences to
            minimize commute traffic; promote programs that achieve affordability
            through existing housing.
        â¢   Work in partnership with GSWC, OBGMA, CMWD and the County of Ventura
            on the following initiatives: (i) develop a detailed hydrological model to more
            accurately predict the effects of drought, increased pumping, and new wells
            in the Ojai Basin; and (ii) participate in an inter-agency watershed
            management plan for the Ventura River Watershed to achieve an accurate
            accounting of supply and demand.
        â¢   Work in partnership with Caltrans and the County of Ventura on the following
            initiatives: (i) conduct updated traffic counts and create a new model for
            evaluating future growth impacts and mitigation measures that includes
            entirety of SR-33 within Ojai Valley; (ii) develop a fully integrated traffic
            management program with consistent policy application; and (iii) implement
            roadway improvements to improve traffic flow on SR-33 throughout the Ojai
            Valley.
        3.       Land and Construction Costs
Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of new housing.
Changes in land prices reflect the cyclical nature of the residential real estate market.
The housing market is now in a downturn similar to previous cycles in the early 1980s and
early 1990s, and it is expected that recovery will occur and land prices will again rise,
although the timing cannot be predicted with certainty. Current (2013) estimates of
residential land cost range from $300,000 to $375,000 per acre.
Construction cost is affected by the price of materials, labor, development standards
and general market conditions. The City has no influence over materials and labor costs,
and the building codes and development standards in Ojai are not substantially different
from most other cities in Ventura County. The Cityâs Building and Safety Department
estimates current (2013) construction costs to be approximately $139 to $167 per square
foot for residential construction.
        4.       Cost and Availability of Financing
Ojai is similar to most other communities with regard to private sector home financing
programs. The recent crisis in the mortgage industry has affected the availability of real
                                                 55                             December 2013

estate loans, although for those homebuyers who can qualify, interest rates are at historic
lows. Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against
entire neighborhoods in lending practices because of the physical or economic
conditions in the area (âredliningâ). In monitoring new construction sales, re-sales of
existing homes, and permits for remodeling, it does not appear that redlining is practiced
in any area of the city.
C.      Fair Housing
The California Fair Employment and Housing Act: (i) prohibits discrimination and
harassment in all aspects of housing including; (ii) requires housing providers to make
reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities; and (iii) prohibits retaliation
against any person who has filed a complaint with the State. In furtherance of these
provisions and anti-discriminatory practices in general, the City participates in fair
housing initiatives including continued financial support of the Housing Rights Center;
promotes equal opportunity for all residents; and provides, to the extent legally
permissible, preferences to persons and households currently residing or employed in Ojai
in regard to occupying new affordable housing.

V.      HOUSING ACTION PLAN
A.      Goals and Policies
Chapters II, III and IV of the Housing Element evaluate the Cityâs housing needs,
opportunities and constraints, while Appendix A presents a review of the previous
element. This Housing Action Plan sets forth the Cityâs goals, policies, and programs to
address the identified housing needs and issues for the 2014-2021 planning period.
Quantified Objectives for new construction, rehabilitation and conservation are also
identified for this planning period.
The goals and policies that guide the Cityâs housing programs and activities are as
follows:
Adequate Housing Sites
        GOAL 1         Dovetail the provision of affordable housing with overarching
                       community objectives: low impact development, integration with
                       community context and linking jobs with housing.
        Policies:
        H-1            The City shall facilitate production of new affordable housing
                       through direct involvement in the design-development process to
                       best accomplish low-impact development principles.
        H-2            The City shall promote the preservation, conservation and
                       conversion of existing housing as a means to satisfy existing and
                       future housing needs through the inventory of housing that currently
                       exists.
        H-3            The City shall work in partnership with water and transportation
                       stakeholders to develop reliable data baselines, modeling
                       methodologies, mitigation measures and policy parameters to
                       maximum resource capacities.
        Programs:
            1. General Plan Update.
            General Plan law requires that all component elements, whether mandatory or
            optional, must be consistent with one another. A review of the current
            adopted General Plan reveals that baseline data relevant to air quality, water
            resources and traffic are outdated. If funding is available, the City will pursue a
            comprehensive General Plan update that addresses development constraints
            resulting from regional air quality, water quality, water supply and
            transportation issues. The City will also work cooperatively with regional
            planning agencies, including the Southern California Association of
            Governments, Ventura County Association of Governments, and the South
                                               57                               December 2013

            Coast Air Quality Management District, to ensure that future growth forecasts
            and housing needs assessments fairly reflect these environmental constraints.
            2. Affordable Housing Covenants.
            The conversion of market rate units into affordable housing through a
            combination of acquisition, Section 8 property-based assistance and purchase
            of affordability covenants is expressly allowed by State Housing Element law for
            rental properties containing three or more units. In the 2000-2005 Housing
            Element cycle, the City helped finance the purchase of 15 units at a cost of
            $300,000. According to preliminary analysis, there are 37 candidate properties
            totaling 279 multiple family units for which the purchase of affordable
            covenants and provision of project-based Section 8 rental assistance (in
            partnership with the Areawide Housing Authority) may be possible. Of this total,
            eight properties (50 total dwellings) consist of apartments between four and
            nine dwellings; 11 properties (157 total dwellings) consist of apartments with 10
            or more dwellings; and 18 properties (72 total dwellings) consist of mixed-use
            projects. Housing Element law requires that the purchase of affordability
            covenants must be accomplished within the first two years of the Housing
            Element planning period. The City will explore the purchase of affordability
            covenants during the planning period commencing in October 2013, if funding
            is available.
            3. Increase the Supply of Second Units.
            Second units provide an efficient method of expanding the supply of
            affordable housing for individuals and small families. The City will pursue a two-
            part strategy to encourage the development of new second units, as well as
            facilitate legalization of existing unpermitted second units.
            A. New Second Units. The City has the land base to accommodate
            approximately 759 second dwellings under existing zoning and development
            standards. The existing baseline of second dwellings is unknown, but the
            untapped potential appears significant. Second units are deemed affordable
            to moderate-income households by design; as such, affordability covenants
            would not be required. Furthermore, second units are exempt from Growth
            Management and traffic impact policies. The objective for this program
            corresponds to the number of second dwellings that were constructed during
            the previous Housing Element cycle.
            During the previous planning period, regulations were amended to exempt
            conforming second units from the Design Review Permit requirement. During
            the new planning period the City will consider additional amendments to
            second unit regulations to encourage construction of second units.
            B. Second Unit Compliance. During the previous planning period, a numeric
            disparity in statistics was noted between the Ventura County Assessor and
            State Department of Finance, suggesting an undercounting of unpermitted
            dwellings in the City totaling more than 300 units. This anomaly was affirmed by
            members of the Housing Element Task Force and Ojai Board of Realtors, and
                                                 58                              December 2013
City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                                     V. Housing Action Plan
            subsequently corroborated by the Ojai Valley Sanitary District (âOVSDâ). In a
            one-year period ending June 30, 2011, OVSD identified 70 candidate
            properties within the City having second units connected to the sewer system
            without benefit of permits. Through an amnesty program implemented wholly
            independent of the City, OVSD legalized sewer connections for 52 residential
            dwellings. Drawing upon the experience of OVSD, in 2013 the City established
            a second unit compliance process by which owners of unpermitted second
            dwellings and guest houses can bring the units into legal non-conforming
            status, making such properties more marketable in exchange for counting the
            units against the Cityâs RHNA goals.The program includes the following
            components:
                 a.      Incentivize participation by reducing or eliminating City fees, seeking
                 fee concessions from other stakeholder agencies, and applying penalties
                 after the compliance due date.
                 b.      The City will work, in coordination with other stakeholder agencies, to
                 establish programs that promote code compliance and maintenance of
                 the existing housing stock.
                 c.      Establish a period of participation in multiple phases of at least two
                 years.
            In order to encourage the provision of legal second units to the maximum
            extent feasible, it is the Cityâs intent to make garage conversions eligible for
            legalization when all applicable requirements are met.
            4. Home Split Program.
            According to preliminary analysis, there are 264 candidate properties which
            may be suited for an internal division of space where the resulting
            configuration yields two dwelling units, each exceeding 640 square feet (which
            is the existing limit for conventional second units). These candidates consist of
            properties containing at least 1/2 acre, with an existing building footprint of at
            least 2,000 square feet and an underlying zone designation of R-0-1/2, R-0-1, R-
            0-2, and R-0-4. Home split units, like second units, are deemed affordable to
            moderate-income households by design.
            During the previous planning period, regulations were amended to exempt
            conforming home splits from the Design Review Permit requirement and allow
            additions to accommodate additional kitchen and bathroom facilities, and
            established that home splits are exempt from the Cityâs Growth Management
            Ordinance.
            5. VMU Mixed Use Zoning.
            Within the Village Mixed Use (âVMUâ) zone district, the City has the land base
            to accommodate between 91 and 345 additional residential dwellings. The
            low end of this range represents what can be accomplished under current
            zoning (taking into account a communitywide development intensity of 63%),
            while the higher number reflects density at 100% of the current permitted
                                                  59                               December 2013

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                                  V. Housing Action Plan
            amount (taking into account proposed adjustments in development standards
            that would maximize development potential). VMU dwellings are deemed
            affordable to moderate-income households by design; as such, affordability
            covenants are not deemed necessary.
            During the previous planning period, VMU regulations were amended to
            provide less restrictive requirements for lot coverage and floor-area ratios
            (FARs) and flexible development standards including parking requirements. The
            implementing ordinance also included design guidelines for VMU projects.
            6. Facilitate Affordable Housing Development.
            During the previous planning period, a Special Housing (SPL) zoning overlay
            was applied to eight sites comprising 14.23 net acres. The SPL Overlay allows
            affordable housing projects at a density of up to 20 du/acre through a
            ministerial design review permit process. Four of the eight properties are City-
            owned, and the City has been in discussions with Peopleâs Self-Help Housing
            regarding the feasibility of development of affordable housing on one or more
            of the City-owned sites. Peopleâs Self-Help Housing is particularly interested in
            assisting with the development of a housing project on Site 11, which is a City-
            owned property adjacent to the Cityâs Public Works Department offices and
            equipment yard. City staff also encouraged the participation of the owners of
            the private properties considered for the SPL Overlay, and the privately-owned
            parcels in the SPL Overlay were included with the support of the property
            owners.
            In discussions with both for-profit and non-profit developers, particular attention
            has been paid to the appropriate height limit required to facilitate affordable
            housing at a density of 20 units/acre. Conceptual plans for several projects
            presented to City staff and decision-makers indicate that multi-family
            development at this density can be accommodated within a two-story limit
            and would result in better compatibility with the existing fabric of the
            community. Two-story projects would also be less likely to generate community
            opposition, thereby enhancing the overall feasibility of affordable housing
            development over the long term.
            During the planning period, the City will continue to work with housing
            developers to facilitate affordable housing development on SPL sites, and
            amend zoning regulations to facilitate development within a two-story building
            envelope. As part of the implementation of amendments to this program, City
            staff will also reassess the acreage and combination of SPL Overlay sites and
            make adjustments that may be appropriate to meet the goals of this program.
            For example, the net developable acreage for Site 11 was noted in the SPL
            Overlay as 0.87 acres because of potential slope and vegetation constraints;
            however, Peopleâs Self-Help Housing has evaluated this slope and believes that
            the developable acreage is closer to the propertyâs gross acreage of 1.74
            acres. As such, it would be appropriate to adjust upward the acreage of the
            SPL Overlay for this site. In addition, downward adjustments on other sites may
            also be appropriate while ensuring that the goals of this program are met in
                                                 60                              December 2013

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                                     V. Housing Action Plan
            conformance with the Cityâs RHNA allocation. Specific objectives regarding
            the SPL regulations include the following:
                â¢   Revise Table 2-10 of Sec. 10-2.704 to more accurately reflect the net
                    developable acreage for each site
                â¢   Revise SPL development standards to establish a two-story building
                    envelope
                â¢   Amend Sec. 10-2.704(g)(2) to reflect applicable state density bonus law
                â¢   Incorporate the No Net Loss provisions of Government Code Sec. 65863
                â¢   Amend SPL development standards to provide an additional 5% bonus
                    density incentive when parcels totaling at least 1 acre are consolidated
                    into a single building site
                â¢   Revise the affordability provisions (currently 15% extremely low, 15% very
                    low, 15% low and 20% moderate, with 30-50% senior) to 10% very low,
                    10% low and 5% moderate.
            7. Commercial Mixed Use
            A number of commercially-zoned parcels in the City are underutilized or
            blighted. As a stimulus to revitalization of these parcels, the City will pursue the
            creation of a new overlay district (outside of the Village Mixed Use district) to
            expand development options for these properties to include mixed-use and
            live/work projects. In addition to its economic benefits, such an overlay would
            create additional opportunities for workforce housing.
           8. Mortgage Assistance.
            The City will pursue state and federal mortgage assistance funding, to the
            extent assistance is available, to assist low- and moderate-income homebuyers
            or existing property owners to prevent foreclosure. Information will be provided
            on the City website and through flyers at other public locations.
Affordable Housing Supply
        GOAL 2          To provide a continuing supply of affordable housing to meet the
                        needs of existing and future Ojai residents in all income categories.
        Policies:
        H-4             The City shall adopt policies, programs and procedures to facilitate
                        attainment of RHNA goals, with particular emphasis placed on the
                        needs of persons and families of low and very-low income.
        H-5             The City shall actively seek and formulate partnerships with for-profit
                        and non-profit developers to produce affordable housing and
                        provide assistance in support of project applications to achieve
                        development objectives.
                                                 61                                December 2013

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                                 V. Housing Action Plan
        H-6            The City shall continue to support the Area Housing Authority of
                       Ventura County in the provision of Section 8 rental assistance and
                       shall seek to broaden the program to compliment other affordable
                       housing initiatives (e.g., secondary dwelling production, project-
                       based tenant assistance, etc.
        Programs:
           9. Inclusionary Housing.
            Inclusionary housing involves the reservation of a prescribed percentage of
            market rate dwelling units for target income households at affordable cost (or
            payment of affordable housing fees in lieu of on-site construction).
            Approximately one-third of all localities in the State employ local inclusionary
            policies.
            It is recognized that the courts have imposed restrictions on some aspects of
            inclusionary zoning regulations (e.g., the Palmer and Patterson decisions), and
            that the state legislature may consider amendments to existing law in response
            to court rulings; therefore, it is the intent of this program to comply with
            applicable law as may be in effect at the time such an ordinance is proposed.
            During the planning period, the City will consider adoption of an amendment
            to the Zoning Ordinance to establish a 15% inclusionary requirement on new
            residential construction. This percentage is consistent with requirements
            typically employed in other jurisdictions with inclusionary policies; and assures
            the production of affordable housing regardless of density. In addition, all
            inclusionary units would be subject to the occupancy preference
            requirements. To moderate the effect inclusionary requirements might have on
            overall housing production, the following actions shall be implemented: (i)
            exempt second units, split home units, small VMU mixed-use units (with a
            maximum of 640 square feet) and single-family homes developed on a single
            parcel of record; (ii) provide for density bonuses in accordance with the Cityâs
            density bonus regulations; and (iii) exempt all inclusionary affordable housing
            units from growth and traffic management requirements which are
            constructed on-site.
           10. Capacity Preservation.
            In order to preserve the Cityâs future capacity for residential development, the
            City will continue to enforce the Zoning Ordinance adopted in the prior
            planning period requiring that existing residential development potential be
            preserved by prohibiting downzoning or requiring the payment of in-lieu fees
            based on an inclusionary housing factor of 15%.
           11. Density Bonus.
            As an inducement to produce housing that is affordable to low- and
            moderate-income groups, the City will continue to implement density bonus
            provisions consistent with State law.
                                                62                              December 2013

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                                   V. Housing Action Plan
           12. Public-Private Partnerships.
            The development of affordable housing, particularly for extremely-low- and
            very-low-income households, as well as populations with special needs,
            generally requires collaboration among multiple parties (e.g., developers, non-
            profit housing sponsors, local government, etc.). In this regard, the Cityâs
            contribution can take a number of forms: (i) assisting in the review and
            preparation of concept drawings; (ii) analyzing development proformas and
            identifying gap financing; (iii) fast-tracking the environmental review and
            entitlement permit process; (iv) utilizing the Cityâs police powers to provide
            appropriate land use and zoning; (v) supporting applications submitted to
            funding agencies; and (vi) providing direct financial or development
            assistance when feasible. Recognizing the collaborative nature of affordable
            housing development, the City shall undertake the following actions:
                   a. Proactive Participation. The City shall continue its participation in
                       the County CDBG Program and similar collaborative efforts to
                       affirmatively further emergency shelter, transitional housing, single
                       room occupancy units, shared living arrangements, supportive
                       services and congregate housing needs outlined in the
                       Consolidated Plan; actively engage non-profit housing sponsors
                       and private property owners in implementing affordable housing
                       strategies outlined under âAdequate Housing Sites;â notify and offer
                       all reasonable assistance to facilitate the development of
                       affordable housing consistent with the General Plan and Housing
                       Element, with particular emphasis on the needs of extremely-low-
                       and very-low-income households and associated special needs
                       population segments (e.g., farmworkers, disabled, etc.).
                   b. Resource Development. To augment local funding sources, the
                       City shall: (i) actively pursue grant and loan funding to finance the
                       various housing initiatives listed in the Housing Element; (ii) work
                       cooperatively with for-profit and non-profit housing sponsors to
                       leverage resources (e.g., State and Federal tax credits); (iii)
                       continue participation in the HOME Consortium and CDBG Urban
                       County programs and actively pursue funding for projects; (iii) assist
                       with site identification and support applications for funding for
                       farmworker housing such as the Joe Serna Jr. Farmworker Housing
                       Grant Program; and (v) evaluate and implement other local
                       funding options if deemed feasible. Funding assistance and
                       regulatory incentives will prioritize multi-family and supportive
                       housing developments that include units for extremely-low-income
                       households.
                   c. Public Outreach. No less often than once each year, the City shall
                       conduct a noticed meeting to assess housing performance in
                       connection with the planning report required by California
                       Government Code Section 65400. As part of the annual review
                       process, the City shall promote the availability of housing assistance
                                                 63                              December 2013

                         programs will be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation
                         and posted on the Cityâs official website.
Housing Impediments
        GOAL 3           To remove impediments to the provision of affordable housing and
                         provide reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities.
        Policies:
        H-7              The City shall accommodate the full spectrum of housing types in its
                         land use regulations including, but not limited to, mixed-use
                         developments, rental and co-op housing, secondary dwellings, in-fill
                         development and special needs housing (e.g., SROs, group homes
                         and congregate living).
        H-8              The City shall periodically evaluate and adjust its regulations,
                         ordinances and development fees to ensure that they do not unduly
                         constrain housing production; new regulatory proposals shall be
                         evaluated for compliance with this policy in advance of adoption.
        H-9              The City shall encourage the construction or conversion of
                         emergency shelters, transitional housing and single room occupancy
                         units to meet the needs of the homeless population and shall
                         likewise facilitate development of group homes, congregate care
                         facilities and independent living units for persons with disabilities.
        Programs:
        13. Housing for Persons with Special Needs.
            Certain segments of the population have traditionally experienced a more
            difficult time finding decent, affordable housing due to special circumstances
            particular to these groups. Those segments possessing special needs, as
            defined in California Government Code Section 65583(a)(6), consist of ââ¦the
            elderly; persons with disabilities, including a developmental disability, as
            defined in Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code; large families;
            farmworkers; families with female heads of households; and families and
            persons in need of emergency shelter.â
            The City will continue to implement land use regulations as amended during
            the previous planning period to minimize potential constraints to special needs
            housing. The City will seek state and federal grants as they become available,
            offer regulatory incentives, contact supportive housing developers and partner
                                                 64                                 December 2013

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                                    V. Housing Action Plan
            with the Tri-Counties Regional Center to facilitate development of supportive
            housing for persons with disabilities, including developmental disabilities.
        14. Reasonable Accommodation for Persons with Disabilities.
            At the request of a person with a disability, local jurisdictions and housing
            providers must make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices
            or services when these accommodations may be necessary to afford a
            disabled person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. A housing
            provider must allow a person with a disability (at the tenantâs expense) to
            reasonably modify existing premises if the modifications are necessary to afford
            the disabled person full enjoyment of the premises. The Zoning Ordinance was
            amended during the prior planning period to establish procedures for
            reviewing and approving requests for reasonable accommodation. The City
            will continue to enforce the provisions of the ordinance, including: (i) an
            abbreviated ministerial procedure with minimal processing fee, expressly
            designed to accommodate reasonable exceptions in zoning and land use for
            housing for persons with disabilities; (ii) information on the rights of the disabled
            shall be disseminated on the website and in public places; and (iii) the
            adaptive retrofit program to underwrite the expense of modifying dwellings to
            accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities, to the extent grant funds
            are available.
        15. Homeless Population.
            In conformance with Senate Bill 2 of 2007, the City will continue to implement
            Zoning Ordinance provisions as amended during the previous planning period
            to facilitate the provision of emergency shelters, transitional housing and
            supportive housing consistent with the California Health and Safety Code,
            including: (i) acknowledge that transitional and supportive housing are
            considered a residential use of property subject only to those restrictions that
            apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone; (ii)
            allow residential care homes (inclusive of emergency and transitional shelters)
            serving six or fewer clients as a permitted use in all residential zone districts; (iii)
            allow residential care homes (inclusive of emergency and transitional shelters)
            serving more than seven clients within medium- and high-density residential
            zones (R-2 and R-3) by Conditional Use Permit; (iv) enforce objective
            management and development standards consistent with the provisions of
            Government Code Section 65583(a)(4); and (v) maintain the Emergency
            Shelter Overlay Zone (âESOZâ) on all commercially zoned land with a BP
            (Business Professional Commercial) designation.
        16. Growth Management Ordinance.
            The Cityâs Growth Management Ordinance (GMO) addresses air quality as a
            resource constraint and regulates residential construction through an annual
            permit allocation process. Companion traffic management policies are
            embodied in the Circulation Element of the Cityâs General Plan and limit the
            amount and intensity of future development through the establishment of
            minimum acceptable traffic volumes.The City will continue to implement the
                                                65                                  December 2013

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                                   V. Housing Action Plan
            provisions of the GMO, which was amended during the previous planning
            period to: (i) broaden the list of exemptions to include split homes and small
            VMU units; (ii) remove the differentiation between single-family and multi-family
            permit allocation categories and consolidate these into a single permit
            allocation pool; (iii) create a Special Project Pool into which unallocated
            annual permits are allowed to accumulate and be applied toward projects
            designated by the City Council; (iv) make explicit that project exemptions
            include housing for persons and families of moderate income; (v) remove
            ambiguity (insofar as possible) in the criteria used in the award of allocations
            for multiple-family housing; and (vi) clarify that preferences will only used to
            rank order competing applications for multiple-family allotments and not as a
            basis of project denial.
        17. Resource Constraints.
            Water availability and roadway capacity pose potential impediments to
            housing production. In conjunction with updating the General Plan, the Cityâs
            Environmental (CEQA) Guidelines shall be revised to impose a significance
            threshold that is linked to the Growth Management Ordinance. The
            environmental threshold shall apply to all non-exempt discretionary projects
            which entail the construction of new residential units in excess of the
            cumulative unused allocation of permits under the Growth Management
            Ordinance during the planning horizon of the Housing Element commencing in
            2014 and ending in 2021. Exempt projects are expressly limited to dwellings for
            which permits and approvals are lawfully obtained. All other non-exempt
            discretionary projects shall be subject to the following provisions:
                    a. An initial study and requisite environmental documentation shall be
                        prepared to determine the availability of sufficient water resources
                        and roadway capacity to accommodate the project within safe
                        yields and acceptable levels of service.
                    b. In the absence of conclusive evidence that adequate water
                        resources and road capacity are available to accommodate the
                        project, a Water and Traffic Management Plan shall be required for
                        each such project that fully mitigates the impacts upon water and
                        roadway capacity.
                    c. Where resource impacts cannot be mitigated through reasonable
                        and feasible measures, the resulting impact shall be deemed to be
                        significant and unavoidable. In such cases, the project shall either
                        be denied or the City may override the impact, at its discretion,
                        with overriding considerations.
            In order to minimize the impact of water supply and roadway capacity
            constraints on future housing supply, the City will take the following actions:
            â¢   Facilitate RHNA objectives through new construction projects in which the
                City retains a financial and/or real property interest to best control design,
                development and occupancy; gear housing production toward small unit
                sizes and transit-oriented occupants; institute job-based occupancy
                                               66                                December 2013

                affordability through existing housing.
            â¢   Work in partnership with GSWC, OBGMA, CMWD and the County of
                Ventura on the following initiatives: (i) develop a detailed hydrological
                model to more accurately predict the effects of drought, increased
                pumping, and new wells in the Ojai Basin; and (ii) participate in an inter-
                agency watershed management plan for the Ventura River Watershed to
                achieve an accurate accounting of supply and demand.
            â¢   Work in partnership with Caltrans and the County of Ventura on the
                following initiatives: (i) conduct updated traffic counts and create a new
                model for evaluating future growth impacts and mitigation measures that
                includes entirety of SR-33 within Ojai Valley; (ii) develop a fully integrated
                traffic management program with consistent policy application; and (iii)
                implement roadway improvements to improve traffic flow on SR-33
                throughout the Ojai Valley.
        18. Design Review.
            Design guidelines are codified in Article 20 of the Cityâs Zoning Ordinance and
            provide objective and measurable criteria by which to evaluate projects. The
            Planning Commission is charged with the responsibility for administering the
            Design Guidelines and issuing relevant permits for all but the following types of
            development: (i) single-family dwellings limited to one-story (including second
            units); and (ii) routine maintenance to all structures. The Design Review process
            entails discretion in the application of prescribed standards; however,
            decision-making authority is expressly limited to physical attributes of design as
            opposed to use or occupancy considerations. During the previous planning
            period, the City amended the Municipal Code to provide more definitive
            criteria by which to objectively evaluate and render decisions. Examples
            include graphics to illustrate the intent behind the Guidelines such as
            compatibility with the scale as shown below:
                                                67                               December 2013

Conservation and Rehabilitation
        GOAL 4         To maintain and enhance the quality of existing housing and
                       residential neighborhoods in Ojai.
        Policies:
        H-10           The City shall promote the cooperative repair, rehabilitation and
                       improvement of residential structures that are substandard or in
                       disrepair; resources shall be targeted to facilitate attainment of
                       Housing Element goals and address properties and occupants of
                       greatest need.
        H-11           The City shall require replacement of dwellings that are occupied
                       by, and affordable to, target income groups and removed from the
                       housing inventory due to demolition or conversion; exceptions shall
                       be granted for owner-occupied dwellings and non-conforming uses.

City of Ojai 2014-2021 Housing Element                                    V. Housing Action Plan
        H-12            The City shall encourage energy efficient construction in all new and
                        rehabilitated dwelling units and actively promote sustainable
                        construction.
        Programs:
        19. Retention of Affordable Units.
            Preservation of existing affordable housing is a high priority for the City,
            particularly rental units that encompass the majority of substandard housing. To
            facilitate the preservation and improvement of these units, the following
            actions shall be implemented: (1) continue the Cityâs housing rehabilitation
            loan program but selectively target assistance to dovetail with code
            compliance efforts; (ii) continue participation and support of the Section 8
            Rental Assistance (Voucher) Program administered through the Area Housing
            Authority of Ventura County; and (iii) continue financial support of the
            Community Assistance Program-Rental Subsidy Lease Assistance Loan and
            Grant Program administered by Help of Ojai.
        20. Anti-Displacement.
            Previous studies of development trends within the Cityâs Village Mixed Use
            district noted that the majority of new projects entailed the reuse, recycling or
            expansion of existing developed properties, resulting in the loss of dwelling
            units. To moderate these trends and the consequence of displacement, the
            Cityâs Zoning Ordinance was amended in 2013 to institute a replacement
            housing requirement for the demolition, removal or conversion of housing that
            is occupied by and affordable to target income households with the following
            exceptions: (i) exempt the removal/demolition of single family homes on a
            single parcel of record; and (ii) exempt the removal/demolition of non-
            conforming uses. The City will continue to enforce these provisions in order to
            facilitate the preservation of existing housing.
        21. Sustainability.
            Energy efficiency is important not only for conserving natural resources, it has
            the added benefit of keeping incidental housing costs in check. It also has
            public policy ramifications relative to underwriting the cost of providing
            affordable housing. High utility costs translate to lower the rent and price
            thresholds, which in turn result in larger financial gaps between market rate
            and affordable housing. Simply put, as residential energy costs rise, housing
            affordability declines. As such, it is in the shared interest of the consumer and
            City to promote energy conservation. In furtherance of these objectives, the
            following actions shall be implemented: (i) continue to collect, maintain and
            disseminate information from the Southern California Edison Company (âSCEâ)
            to encourage existing residents to participate in energy efficiency retrofit and
            rebate programs; (ii) incorporate energy conservation measures and financial
            incentives from SCE into the Cityâs housing rehabilitation assistance program;
            (iii) continue to implement âGreen Buildingâ guidelines, embodying LEED (The
            Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and âComplete Streetsâ
                                                 69                               December 2013

            construction; and (iv) devise incentives, in consultation with stakeholders, to
            encourage compliance with the âGreen Buildingâ guidelines.
Equal Housing Opportunities
        GOAL 5          To affirmatively further fair housing and assure equal access to
                        sound, affordable housing for all persons regardless of race, creed,
                        age or sex.
        Policies:
        H-13            The City declares that all persons regardless of race, creed, age,
                        physical disability or sex shall have equal access to sound and
                        affordable housing pursuant to State and Federal laws.
        H-14            The City will actively promote enforcement of fair housing laws and
                        continue its support of non-profit organizations that provide housing
                        and other assistance to special needs groups in Ojai (e.g., homeless,
                        disabled, etc.) and
        H-15            The City shall promote integration of all economic and population
                        segments in each residential project; however, it is recognized that
                        scales of economy and management efficiencies require that
                        certain projects are made exclusive to target groups.
        Programs:
        22. Fair Housing.
            The California Fair Employment and Housing Act: (i) prohibits discrimination
            and harassment in all aspects of housing including; (ii) requires housing
            providers to make reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities;
            and (iii) prohibits retaliation against any person who has filed a complaint with
            the State. In furtherance of these provisions and anti-discriminatory practices in
            general, the following actions shall be implemented: (i) continue regional
            participation in fair housing initiatives including continued financial support of
            the Housing Rights Center; (ii) promote equal opportunity for all residents and
            embody affirmative marketing and anti-discrimination clauses in all affordable
            housing agreements; and (iii) provide, to the extent legally permissible,
            preferences to persons and households currently residing or employed in Ojai
            in regard to occupying new affordable housing.
        23. Information and Referral.
            The California Government Code expressly requires that diligent efforts be
            made to engage the public in the process of preparing and adopting Housing
            Elements. In furtherance of this mandate, the following actions shall be
            implemented: (i) continue to collect, maintain and disseminate information
            from the County, Housing Authority and State Department of Equal Housing
            and Employment regarding housing and tenant rights; and (ii) notify the
                                                 70                             December 2013

                   Evaluation of the 2008-2014 Housing Element
Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that jurisdictions evaluate the
effectiveness of the existing Housing Element, the appropriateness of goals, objectives
and policies, and the progress in implementing programs for the previous planning
period. This appendix contains a review the housing goals, policies, and programs of the
previous housing element and evaluates the degree to which these programs have
been implemented during the previous planning period. The findings from this evaluation
have been instrumental in determining the Cityâs 2014-2021 Housing Action Plan (Chapter
V).
Table A-1 summarizes the programs contained in the previous Housing Element along
with the source of funding, program objectives, and accomplishments.
Table A-2 presents the Cityâs progress in meeting the quantified objectives from the
previous Housing Element.

                               Residential Land Inventory
State law requires the Housing Element to include an inventory of vacant or underutilized
sites with the potential for residential development during the planning period. The
assumptions and methodology for the residential land inventory are provided below and
summarized in Tables B-1 through B-3.
1.      Vacant and Underutilized Sites
Tables B-2 and B-3 summarize vacant and underutilized parcels designated for residential
development. During the previous planning period, the Municipal Code was amended
to apply an âSPL Overlayâ to eight sites listed in Table B-2 and shown in Figure B-1. The SPL
overlay allows multi-family development by-right at a density of 20 units/acre. The
estimated realistic capacity of the SPL sites is 176 units, which are allocated to the lower-
income categories based on the state âdefault density.â Of the eight sites, four are City-
owned, and the City has been actively exploring affordable housing development
opportunities on these sites with developers.
Table B-3 shows other residential sites with potential for development of moderate- and
above-moderate-income housing during the current planning period. The capacity of
these sites exceeds the RHNA allocation in the moderate and above-moderate
categories.
2.      Second Residential Units and Home Splits
The Municipal Code allows 2nd units in single-family residential districts, pursuant to state
law. During the previous Housing Element cycle approximately seven second units were
approved. In 2013 the Municipal Code was amended to establish a Second Unit
Compliance Program that provides an opportunity for property owners to legalize
unpermitted second units. It is anticipated that this program will encourage owners of
unpermitted second units to upgrade non-conforming units thereby providing additional
affordable housing opportunities in the planning period.
The Municipal Code was also amended to implement a âHome Splitâ program, which
allows owners of single-family dwellings of at least 2,000 square feet on lots of at least
one-half acre to divide the home into two units without discretionary review.
It is anticipated that these programs will result in at least 9 additional 2nd units and 9
home splits during the 2014-2021 planning period, of which a total of 8 units would be
expected to be affordable to lower-income persons.
3.      Land Inventory Summary
The results of the land inventory analysis are summarized as follows:

This analysis demonstrates that the Cityâs land inventory exceeds the RHNA allocation in
all income categories for the current planning period.
SPL Overlay
During the preparation of the Cityâs 2006-2014 Housing Element, the inventory of
residential sites identified insufficient capacity to accommodate the Cityâs RHNA
allocation in the very-low and low income categories. As a result, Program 6
(Demonstration Projects) called for the application of an âSPL Overlayâ to sufficient sites
for multi-family housing at a density of 20 units/acre to accommodate the RHNA. The
2006-2014 Housing Element reviewed candidate SPL sites and identified priority sites that
appeared to have the greatest immediate potential for affordable housing
development.
After adoption of the 2006-2014 Housing Element, the City commenced the
implementation phase of the SPL Overlay. Additional public meetings were held to
review and refine the site analysis and identify the most appropriate parcels for rezoning
to SPL. The parcels that were ultimately designated for the SPL Overlay are shown in
Table B-2. These parcels represent the results of an extensive public participation process
over a period of many months and many meetings with the Planning Commission and
City Council.
Analysis of Unaccommodated Need
Table B-2 shows the eight sites that the SPL Overlay was applied to in the previous
planning period. The SPL designation allows a density of 20 units/acre by-right, consistent
with state law. These sites have a realistic capacity of 179 units, compared to the
rezoning program requirement of 113 lower-income units. Although some of the SPL sites
have an estimated realistic capacity of less than 16 units, the realistic capacity of the
larger sites (i.e., Sites 6, 10, 17 and 21) totals 146 units, which exceeds the rezoning
requirement. In addition, pursuant to Government Code 65863, the City will ensure no
net loss of capacity to accommodate the lower-income RHNA throughout the planning
period. Therefore the rezoning program requirements were satisfied, and no carryover of
unaccommodated need is applicable pursuant to Government Code Section 65584.09.

Public participation is an important component of the planning process in Ojai, and this update
to the Housing Element has provided residents and other interested parties numerous
opportunities for involvement. Five public meetings were held between July and December
2013 to consider the Housing Element. Public notices of all workshops and hearings were
published in the local newspaper in advance of each meeting, as well as posting the notices
on the Cityâs website. The document was also circulated to housing advocates and nonprofit
organizations representing the interests of lower-income persons and special needs groups (see
Table C-1 containing a list of organizations notified of opportunities for participation). After
receiving comments on the draft Housing Element from the State Housing and Community
Development Department, a proposed final Housing Element was prepared and made
available for public review prior to adoption by the City Council.
The following is a list of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of this Housing
Element update. Public meetings were televised on Channel 10, the local public access
channel.

            Qperi Space Element
            INTRODUCTION
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF THE ELEMENT
            The Open Space Element of the City of Ojai General Plan was prepared in
            conformance with State law and pursuant to overall City goals, objectives and
            policies. It is consistent with other Elements of the Ojai General Plan.
                 The purpose of the Open Space Element is to incorporate resource,
                  conservation, recreational, aesthetic and safety goals, policies, and
                 programs into a comprehensive Open Space Plan for the City.
            This Element was created in conjunction with the formation of the Conservation
            and Recreation Elements of the Ojai General Plan (1986). The Conservation and
            Open Space Element may be adopted as one Element or separately under General
            Plan Law. The Ojai Open Space Element has been developed separately from the
            Ojai Conservation Element. This has occurred because of the unique character of
            the Ojai area and the importance of open space to the community.
            The Open Space Element is a product of research conducted for the Ojai General
            Plan Master Environmental Assessment (MEA) and the Conservation and
            Recreation Elements and field work in the Ojai community. The Element is based
            in part on data contained in the Ojai MEA. From the MEA inventory of
            important resources of the City, various goals, policies and programs were set forth
            in the Conservation Element. These were formulated to ensure the sound
            management and proper conservation and utilization of all resources of the City
            and to preserve Ojai's unique living environment.
            Recreational resources and opportunities are also identified in the MEA. The
            Recreation Element identifies existing and potential future Parks, Trails, Specialized
            Facilities and Preserves. The Recreation Element also establishes goals, policies
            and programs to meet the long-term recreational needs of the community. These
            needs include recreational open space. The Recreation Element's concepts have
            therefore been incorporated into the General Plan Open Space Element.
            In summary, resource conservation goals from the Conservation Element were
            incorporated into the Open Space Plan and long-term recreational goals were
            derived from the Recreation Element. Other relevant open space issues pertaining
            to aesthetics and public safety were considered and evaluated. A series of open
            space geographical overlays were then created, incorporating the identification of
            natural, cultural and aesthetic resources, recreational opportunities and safety
            hazards. This work effort resulted in the product of the City's Open Space
            Element Plan. The combined purpose of these Elements is to guide the long-term

ASSUMPrrONS!DEFINITIONS
            The Ojai Open Space Element is a product of the conservation, recreational, safety
            and aesthetic concerns of the Ojai community. Definitions, explanations and
            inventories of data pertaining to open space issues are provided in various section
            of the General Plan and MEA. Within the Introduction section of the General
            Plan and Index Matrix references sections within General Plan documents (i.e.,
            MEA, various General Plan Elements) where specific information regarding open
            space may be obtained. Definitions and categorization unique to the Open Space
            Element are provided below and on the following pages under "Legal Authority".
            California State General Plan law generally defines Open Space as any parcel or
            area of land or water that is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open space
            use, and that is designated on a local, regional or state open space plan.

            and illustrated on the Open Space Element Plan are listed below.
             A&ricultural Open Space
            Land currently used as, or available for, farmland production is classified and given
            various value by the California Department of Conservation. These lands are
            categorized and considered for agricultural preservation in the Department's
            "Important Farmland Inventory". The Ojai MEA (Geology and Soils sections) and
            Conservation Element identify these "Important Farmlands" in Ojai that are
            utilized for agriculture and which possess prime or important soils for agricultural
            production. Important Farmlands are defined in detail in the MEA Soils section
            and in the Conservation Element under "Important Farmland". They are depicted
            as Conservation Open Space on the Open Space Element Plan.
            Another type of open space related to agricultural land use is rangeland. Rangeland
            is land used for grazing by ranch animals, usually cattle. Policies and conservation
            of open space set forth in this Element are reflective of community desires to
            preserve important rangeland.
            Bioloeical Open Space
            As discussed in the Ojai MEA and Conservation Element, certain biological
            habitats are identified with "high" or "moderate" biological significance. These
            biologically "significant" areas are precisely defined in the MEA and Conservation
             OJAI GENERAL PLAN                             2                        MAY13,1987
 Qpen Space Element
Element under "Biological Resources" and are shown on the Open Space Element
Plan as Conservation Open Space. Open space and conservation policies reflect
the preservation of these important habitats.
Cultural Open Space
Archaeological and historical resources are also defined and identified in the MEA
and Conservation Elements. (See "Cultural Resources" sections.) They pertain to
properties that were, are, or may be significant in local and American history,
regional architecture, archaeology, and/or culture. Policies for their preservation
are set forth in the Conservation Element. Historical resources are designated on
the Open Space Element Plan.
Recreational Open Space
Recreational Open Space is defined as an open parcel of natural or landscaped land
that is intended for outdoor recreation and the enjoyment of nature. Parks, Trails,
Specialized Recreation Facilities and Preserves defined in the Recreation Element
are applied in this Element and shown on the Open Space Element Plan            â¢,
as Recreational Open Space.                                                ~
Scenic Open Space                                                            ~
Scenic Open Space is defined as those areas that establish the aesthetic and visual
character of the community. It relates to every aspect of the City of Ojai and its
associated views of natural scenery. This type of open space is difficult to
specifically identify and is considerably subjective. Within this Element, Scenic
Open Space pertains to views of and from the Ojai, the aesthetic quality of the
Valley's ridgelines illustrated in Exhibit OS-1 of the City of Ojai MEA, and areas
valued to protect and enhance the scenic character of the Ojai. Open space values
may relate to community identity, "entrance" themes or the appearance at City
perimeters or any portion of land which may otherwise portray "The Ojai".
Scenic Open Space is illustrated on the Open Space Element Plan.
Public Safety Open Space
Open space retention is necessary for certain land that has characteristics
hazardous to public health and safety. Such public safety risks primarily consist of
geologic hazards (e.g., seismic faults, landslides, etc.), hydrological hazards (e.g.,
flooding) and fire hazards. Public safety definitions and evaluations are provided
in the Ojai MEA under the specific topical sections: Traffic/Circulation; Geology;
Hydrology/f1ooding; and Public Services.

LEGALAUI7fDRITY
            Under State Law (Section 65302) a City is required to adopt an open space plan for
            the "comprehensive and long-range preservation and conservation of open space
            within its jurisdiction".
                   As established under State Law, open space may be designated on an Open
                  Space Plan as any of the following:
                   1. Open space for the preservation of natural resources, including but not
                        limited to, areas required for the preservation of plant and animal life,
                        including habitat for fish and wildlife species; areas required for ecologic
                        and other scientific study purposes; rivers, streams, bays, and estuaries;
                        and coastal beaches, lakeshores, banks of rivers and streams, and
                        watershed lands.
                    2. Open space used for the managed production of resources, including
                        but not limited to, forest lands, rangeland, agricultural lands, and areas
                        of economic importance for the production of food or fiber; areas
                        required for recharge of ground water basins; bays, estuaries, marshes,
                        rivers, and streams that are important for the management of
                        commercial fisheries; and areas containing major mineral deposits,
                        including those in short supply.
                    3. Open space for outdoor recreation, including but not limited to, areas
                        that have outstanding scenic, historic, and cultural value; areas
                        particularly suited for park and recreation purpose, including access to
                        lake shore, beaches, rivers and streams; and areas which serve as links
                        between major recreation and open space reservations, including utility
                        easements, banks of rivers and streams, trails and scenic highway
                        corridors.
                    4. Open space for public health and safety, including but not limited to,
                        areas that require special management or regulation because of
                        hazardous or special conditions such as earthquake fault zones unstable
                        soils areas, flood plains, watersheds, areas presenting high fire risks,
                        areas required for the protection of water quality and water reservoirs
                        and areas required for the protection and enhancement of air quality.

             ISSUES AND NEEDS
OVERVIEW
             Open Space issues in Ojai are numerous, complex and overlapping with other
             General Plan issues. Categories of Open Space have been established within the
             Element to clarify and simplify complex issues. In this manner the reader may
             easily find and reference a specific concern whether it relates to preservation of
             agricultural farmland, seismic safety open space, biological habitat, or parkland
             issues among others.
             The Ojai Master Environmental Assessment (MEA) provides a data base for this
             Element. The Conservation and Recreation Elements further explain reasoning
             and substantiation behind policies, programs and geographical open space overlays
             of the Open Space Element Plan. The Introduction Index Matrix of the General
             Plan provides a section reference within the General Plan where various open
             space-related terms and issues are explained.
             Major issues pertaining to each Open Space category of this Element are briefly
             discussed below.
AGRICULTURAL OPEN SPACE
             "Important Farmlands" identified in the Ojai MEA and Conservation Element are
             utilized in agriculture and have "Prime" or "Important" soils for agricultural
             production. Rangeland utilized in grazing is also considered valuable under this
             open space category. Retention of these areas for open space and agricultural
             production is a significant issue in Ojai City Policy.
BIOLOGICAL OPEN SPACE
             Biologically significant areas identified in the MEA and Conservation Element are
             also shown on the Open Space Element Plan. Biological open space/conservation
             and associated preservation policies for these important biological habitats are of
             major concern in the Ojai community.
CULTURAL OPEN SPACE
             Issues pertaining to cultural open space primarily relate to areas with known or
             potential existence of archaeological and historical resources. Goals, Policies, and
             Programs ofthe Conservation Element are established to preserve these resources.
             These policies have been applied to the Open Space Element to herein reflect
             conservation goals.

              Qpen Space Element
RECREATIONAL OPEN SPACE
             Recreation is an important aspect of Ojai's living environment. The Recreation
             Element establishes Goals, Policies and Programs to ensure the longevity of Ojai's
             recreational opportunities. Components of the Recreation Element (parks, Trails,
             Specialized Recreation Facilities and Preserves) are identified in this Element as
             Recreational Open Space.
SCENIC OPEN SPACE
             Scenic Open Space in Ojai is highly valued to protect and enhance the scenic
             character of Ojai. Major community issues include the protection of major
             surrounding ridgelines, establishment of buffer zones between other open space
             and urban areas, coordination of Scenic Corridors with Scenic Highways adopted
             with the Circulation Element, and most importantly, the preservation of views to
             and from the Ojai Valley.
             Scenic Open Space is the most difficult open space in Ojai to define and address
             objectively. Areas within or surrounding the City that are characterized with a
              feeling of "community identity" or are associated with the aesthetic, natural
             character of Ojai are highly valued in the community. Policies within this Element
             reflect the desires of the community to retain these special places as open space.
PUBLIC SAFETY OPEN SPACE
             State General Plan law requires cities to adopt a Public Safety Element. The City
             of Ojai has adopted the County of Ventura Public Safety Element. This Open
             Space Element's Public Safety Open Space is reflective of the Ventura County
             Public Safety Element and public safety/hazard issues addressed in the Ojai MEA.
             The need to create an Ojai Public Safety Element or updated County Element
             should be considered in the near future. The Element would establish specific Ojai
             City and County of Ventura combined Policy, define acceptable levels of public
             safety risks and would adopt mitigation methods to reduce these hazards to the
             established, acceptable levels.

INTRODUCTION
           This section of the Open Space Element sets forth City Goals, Policies, and
            Implementing Programs for the long-term retention of open space in Ojai. As
           previously mentioned, open space issues in Ojai are numerous and complex and
           involve other Elements of the Ojai General Plan. The Open Space Element has
            been organized in a format providing easy reference to other General Plan
           sections.
           Where necessary and appropriate, all or a portion of an open space category's
            Goals, Policies and Programs are cross referenced to another General Plan
           Element (i.e., Conservation, Recreation Elements). In such cases the referenced
            Element's Goals, Policies, and Programs are incorporated in the Open Space
           Elemen t by reference and by their application to the Open Space Plan.
           The fIrst category ("GENERAL") provides overall open space Goals, City Policies
           and Implementing Programs. The GENERAL section is then followed by specifIc
           open space issue sections.
GENERAL
           IT SHALL BE THE INTENTION OF THE CI'IY OF OJAl TO
           PROVIDE FOR THE LONG-TERM RETENTION OF IDENTIFIED
           AND POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT OPEN SPACE IN OJAl SO AS TO
           MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE THE QUALI'IY OF THE ENVI-
           RONMENT. SUCH OPEN SPACE INCLUDES BUT IS NOT UMITED
           TO THOSE AREAS IDENTIFIED AS SIGNIFICANT OR
           POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE OJAl GENERAL PLAN
           CONSERVATION AND RECREATION ELEMENTS.
               Policy. The City shall formally recognize open space areas in 0iai and
               shall establish measures to preserve the identified open space.
                   Program: Data contained in the Ojai Master Environmental Assessment
                   (MEA) shall be utilized to the maximum extent feasible in formulation of
                   an Open Space Plan for the Ojai General Plan. As the MEA data is
                   periodically updated and reflned, any changes in the MEA will be
                   considered for possible implications to the Open Space Element.
                   Program: Any data that is not within the MEA but is considered relevant
                   by the City in open space planning shall be considered and utilized in
            OJM GENERAL PLAN                           7                       MAY~1987

      preparation of the Open Space Plan and associated policies.
      Program: Appropriate standards and criteria will be established by the City
      for the preservation and use of open space lands. Specifically, pursuant to
      State law the following provisions for consistency with the Ojai Open Space
      Plan are hereby adopted by the City of Ojai.
         "65566. Any action by a county or city by which open space land or any
         interest therein acquired or disposed of or its use restricted or regulated,
         whether or not pursuant to this part, must be consistent with the local
         open-space plan.
         "65567. No building permit may be issued, no subdivision map
         approved, and no open-space zoning ordinance adopted, unless the
         proposed construction, subdivision or ordinance is consistent with the
         local open space plan",
      Program: Community/neighborhood open space systems will be included
      in specific plans, planned residential districts and any other planned
      development where appropriate.
      Program: The City shall adopt a resolution formally recognizing Article
      13b, Section 8 of the California State Constitution which directs the
      assessor to consider open space so as to "preserve its use for food and
      fiber, use and enjoyment of natural resources and scenic beauty and
      recreation" .
      Program: Existing and potential new land use and zoning provisions shall
      be pursued by the City to regulate land use in Ojai as it relates to open
      space. Such planning tools include but are not limited to:
         o Agricultural zoning;
         o Flood plain zoning;
         o Subdivision for public open space;
         o Development fees for acquisition of land for recreational open
             space uses;
         o Overlay zones in special open space areas or critical areas of the
              community;

          o   Acquisition of tax deed lands; and
          o Private and public golf course for future security as permanent open
             space.
  Policy. The Open Space Element and its Open Space Plan shall be
  recognized as an official and adopted policy document in the assessment
  of future development proposals in the City.
      Program: The Open Space Element and Plan shall be used in initial
      environmental assessments and during subsequent environmental
      documentation in City planning.
      Program: The Open Space Element and its base data shall be periodically
      reviewed to improve the content and effectiveness in guiding sound
      development policies and programs, and in soliciting maximum public input
      during community planning procedures.
  Policy. The City shall consider cooperative programs with other involved
  agencies and organizations for the acquisition, improvement,
  maintenance and/or preservation of open space.
      Program: The City shall actively pursue open space programs in
      cooperation with the Federal, State, Regional, County and special district
      agenCIes.
      Program: The City shall encourage private and quasi-private landowners to
      provide open space for preservation of natural features, landscaping,
      recreation, and other appropriate open space uses where feasible. This will
      include city support for a land bank program.
      Program: The State Code on Open Space Easements will be complied
      with and pursued by the City. The Code provides that a city or county
      having a General Plan may accept grants of open space easements in which
      the owner relinquishes to the public, in perpetuity or for a term of 20 years
      or more, the right to construct improvements on it. The easement
      agreement may also contain a covenant against the extraction of natural
      resources, cutting trees or growth except for preservation or other
      unfriendly activities. It must be consistent with the Open Space Element of
      the General Plan and must be in the best interest of the state/county/city
      and important to the public for the employment of scenic beauty, use of
      natural resources, recreation, or production of food and fiber.

  Policy: Open Space designations for preservation of all types of open
  space identified in this Element and throughout the General Plan shall be
  coordinated and integrated into a comprehensive, coordinated open
  space network through the City.
     Program: Multiple use of open space and connecting open space areas shall
     be pursued by the City by combining appropriate compatible open space
     land uses (i.e., hiking and riding trails along flood control channels; picnic
     sites and view points along scenic highways; multiple use of school
     playfields).
     Program: The selection and use of open space shall be coordinated with
     other public agencies (i.e., park and school sites; flood control storm drains
     and municipal water treatment facilities) to maximize the efficiency of open
     space uses.
  Policy; The City shall establish conformity between the General Plan
  Open Space/Conservation Elements and zoning.
      Program: The City will evaluate its zoning criteria for conformity with
      the Open Space and Conservation Elements. Conflicts in zoning will
      be resolved as expeditiously as possible, by revisions or additions of new
      and amended sections to the subdivision and other related ordinances.
      Program: The City will establish an equitable process for resolving
      conflicting open space and related property uses by:
      1.  Reviewing all development proposals with consideration of the
          environmental review process (CEQA) and the relationship with
          the Open Space Element and all other General Plan Elements;
      2   Public noticing, public discussions and making available text and
          maps depicting open spaces and open space issues;
      3. Providing opportunity for comment on the Open Space Element
          prior to future revisions.
  Policy: The City shall support provisions for open space via density
  transfers, development clustering, and open space dedications where
  considered appropriate and feasible for the City to conserve open space
  lands.

protects those unique and natural characteristics that make Ojai a desirable place
to live.
    PoliCY: The natural featwes and general environmental characteristics of
    Ojai's hillsides and ridgelines shall be permanently preserved.
         Program: No development or alteration to the natural condition of
         prominent ridgelines or adjacent/nearby areas shall be permitted by the City
         of Ojai. This program shall apply to the areas identified on the Open Space
         Plan as "Scenic Open Space" or "Scenic Points of Interest".
         Program: The City shall work with all appropriate jurisdictions to restrict
         all development visible from the valley on the south face of the slopes of
         Los Padres National Forest.
         Program: The City shall work with all interested parties to prohibit
         development visible from the valley on the north face of the Black
         Mountain and Sulphur Mountain. Development not visible would be
         permitted consistent with the intent of the general plan, its policies and
         programs.
         Program: The Open Space Plan shall formally designate open space areas
         that will maintain and enhance the hillsides and ridgelines and provide a
         buffer between development and open space or agriculture.
         Program: The City shall formulate and adopt a Hillside Development
         Ordinance in keeping with the Goals and Policies of this Element and the
         Conservation Element. The Ordinance will protect valuable hillside lands
         from exposure to development. It should also provide for hillside grading,
         standards and other restrictions.
         Program: Areas adjacent to open space and agricultural lands will be
         carefully scrutinized during any development proposal's review for
         compatibility with the open space. Buffer zones and screening of
         development are examples of provisions for appropriate blending in
         transition between land uses.
         Program: The City shall pursue the creation of a "Greenbelt Agreement"
         with the County of Ventura, City of Santa Paula and LAFCO to preserve
         open space and agricultura1 between Ojai and surrounding communities.
    Policy: In establishing City policy and in other decision making efforts,

                 the City will consider and highly value any open, natural, or special open
                 space characteristic of a particular area. That characteristic will bear
                 more weight than potential economic or other values which may result
                 from the development or alteration of the land.
                     Program: The City shall incorporate an aesthetic open space provision in
                     its development processing review. The provision shall require formal
                     consideration of the aesthetic qualities of a site or its surroundings during a
                     project's review.
                     Program: The City shall review its zoning code and incorporate
                     appropriate mandatory "findings" related to the preservation of Aesthetic
                     Open Space in the City.
                     Program: The City shall establish specific "finding" requirements related to
                     the future subdivision of all lands under its jurisdiction related to open
                     space within and adjacent to the City.
PUBLIC SAFETY OPEN SPACE
             The City of Ojai shall provide for the public health and safety by isolating
              hazardous or potentially hazardous areas in open space by providing open space
              buffers between hazardous or potentially hazardous areas and urban or rural
              neighborhoods.
                 Policy: The City shall identify and limit the extent and intensity of land
                 uses and development in hazardous areas such as, but not limited to:
                 steep slopes, streambeds, flood plains, fault zones and erosive or
                 landslide areas.
                     Program: Data within the Ojai MEA and other sources will be utilized to
                     officially identify areas hazardous to public safety in Ojai and to formulate
                     a Public Safety Element for the 0iai General Plan. The Public Safety
                     Element should be created and adopted as soon as a feasible.
                     Program: Areas such as but not limited to flood plains, flood control
                     channels, fault zones and fire breaks will be identified in the Public Safety
                     Element. These areas will be reserved under the Element for permanent
                     open space or compatible non-risk uses to protect public safety in Ojai.
                 Policy: Areas currently or potentially under uses containing any public
                 health or safety hazard shall be adequately buffered as expeditiously as
                 feasible to protect public safety.
              OJAI GENERAL PLAN                            13                           MAY13,1987
Qpen Space Element
      Program: Industrial and other uses with potential for public health/safety
      hazards shall be located appropriately and be adequately buffered with open
      space to absorb noise and other nuisances or dangers. These buffer areas
      will be assessed and provided on a project-specific basis, as proposed
      development is reviewed by the City.
      Program: The City, in preparing its Public Safety Element, will identify
      land uses that potentially threaten public health and/or safety. The
      Elementwill further disallow or restrict the identified uses as is appropriate
      and will require adequate open buffer areas to protect the public health and
      safety. These provisions will become policy within the Public Safety
      Element and applied to the Open Space Plan as Public Safety Open Space.

General Plan: Technical Supplement and
Environmental Impact Report (EIR), contains the
background information on the issues that
resulted in the Plan policies. Volume I is referred
to as the "Plan Policies Report" and Volume II as
the "Technical Supplement/EIR." State planning
law calls for seven General Plan elements: Land
Use, Circulation, Housing, Conservation, Open
Space, Noise, and Safety. The elements are
grouped in three General Plan sections in Volume
I as follows:
     Land Use and Circulation Section
       Land Use, Circulation, Open Space, Parks,
       Schools, and Utilities elements
     Housing Section
       Housing Policies; the full Housing Element

region by income category. The objective of the
redistribution is to "avoid further impaction of
localities with relatively high proportions of
lower-income households" (Gov. Code Sec.
65584). To generate the figures, ABAG
averaged existing city percentages in each
income category with the existing county and
regional percentages. The housing need in each
income category is obtained from an average of
existing percentages of each category in Orinda,
Contra Costa County and the nine-county bay
area. For example, the percentage of very low-
income households at each geographical scale
(city-county-region) is averaged to identify the
percentage need for very low-income housing
units out of the total need identified.
Because the State of California has declared
that local governments have a responsibility to
facilitate the improvement and development of
housing for all economic segments of the
community, the analysis of existing and
projected housing needs is defined in four
categories: very low income (0 to 50 percent of
median income); low income (50 to 80 percent);
moderate income (80 to 120 percent); and above
moderate income (above 120 percent).
In Orinda, those income categories translate
into the following incomes for a family of four,
based on incomes in Contra Costa County, 1990,
as defined by the U.S. Dept. of Housing and
Urban Development and based on a median
income of $44,100:
Very Low Income         less than $22,500
Lower Income            $22,501 to $35,300

3 . 3 . 8 Status of Existing Assisted Housing
State housing statutes adopted in 1989
(Chapter 1451) requires all housing elements to
address by January 1, 1991 the potential
conversion      of   existing   assisted-housing
development to non-low-income housing use. As
discussed in Section 3.2.4 of the Updated
Housing Element, Orinda has one assisted-
housing development, known as Senior Village,
which currently has a 20-year fixed subsidy, as
well as fixed bylaws requiring that it continue
to provide low and very-low income housing for
seniors and disabled persons. These conditions
are sufficient safeguards that these existing
assisted-housing units will not be converted to
market-rate dwellings within the time period
defined by the General Plan.
3 . 3 . 9 Consistency with General Plan and
Appropriateness of the Goals, Objectives
and Policies
The 1990 Updated Housing Element does not
represent a change from the goals of the
General Plan, nor a change from goals defined
in the 1987 Housing Element. Changes to
housing policies and objectives contained in this
document are considered to be minor relative to
the 1987 Housing Element. Such changes are
furthermore considered to be consistent with
the provisions of all other elements of the
current Orinda General Plan, and plans for
congestion management, the Zoning Ordinance,
and capital improvement programs. As stated
ORINDA GENERAL PLAN 5/20/87                                                                     38

B. Prevent unnecessary noise from all sources.
4 . 3 . 2 Noise Element: Implementing
Policies
A. Require an acoustical study and any
       necessary noise level mitigation where new
       residential or commercial development is
       proposed along Highway 24 corridor and
       adjacent tomajor arterials where projected

B. Review all multi-family development
       proposals within the projected 60 Ldn
       contour for compliance with noise standards
       (45 Ldn in any habitable room) as required
       by State law.
C. Develop ordinance to limit noise created by
       temporary activities such as building
       construction to the shortest duration
       possible, and to daytime hours wherever
       possible. All reasonable noise mitigation

5.0 Growth and Management Element
            Recreation Element
            INTRODUCTION
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF THE ELEMENT
            The recreational amenities of Ojai Valley have been long valued by local residents and
            visitors alike. The natural composition of the Ojai Valley facilitates a wide variety of
            outdoor recreational activities and contributes to the overall beauty of the City and its
            quality of life. Numerous recreational facilities are available. They range from hiking
            and horseback riding to tennis and golf.
            The amount, distribution, and accessibility ofrecreational land within a community are
            important in the development of an adequate park and recreation system. An overall
            recreation system must be developed with facilities that will meet the diverse needs of
            all residents. By providing regional and community parks, trails, and other recreational
            amenities, open recreational spaces contribute to the health and well being of local
            residents.
            The Recreation Element of the Ojai General Plan is a planning tool prepared to meet
            the recreational needs of the community. These needs have been identified by City
            staff, the Ojai Parks and Recreation Commission and active community leaders and
            citizens. The Ojai Parks and Recreation Commission serves the community by voicing
            the recreational needs of the community and formulating plans, programs and other
            methods by which to improve the recreational opportunities available to residents.
            The commission's participation in formulation of this Element reflects future
            recreational needs and plans of Ojai. The Element is composed of the following
            planning components:
            o    Definitions and categories of recreational requirements and opportunities;
            o     Inventory of existing facilities (included in the Ojai MEA);
            o    Identification of recreational issues and needs;
            o    Goals and Policies to guide recreational activities and development;
            o    Implementing Programs to attain defined Goals and Policies;
ASSUMPTIONS/DEFINITIONS
            Base data for the Recreation Element was derived from the Master Environmental
            Assessment (MEA) Recreation Section. The MEA section provides a complete
            recreation facilities inventory based on research of existing and proposed recreation

Recreation Element
facilities in the Ojai Sphere of Influence (see MEA "Recreational Facilities Matrix',).
The MEA Recreation section was utilized to identify recreational issues and needs of
the Ojai community. The Goals, Policies, and Programs of this Element were then
created in response to the identified issues.
Definitions and examples are provided below as a reference to categorization 6f, and
standards, for recreational facilities in this General Plan Element.
Recreation
Recreation may be defined as the refreshment of one's mind or body through activity
that amuses or stimulates.
An area of land set aside for public recreational use is the common understanding of
"Park". Two categories of parks discussed in this General Plan include:
Regional/County Parks
These parks include regional facilities operated by the County ofVentura. They attract
people from a wide range of age and interest. Examples ,of County parks in Ojai's
Planning Area include Soule Park and Camp Comfort. These widely utilized facilities
provide recreational opportunities to Ojai Valley and Ventura County residents.
Local/Community Parks
Local/community parks generally provide facilities to serve the daily needs ofa defined
neighborhood or community. Facilities may include: open areas for passive
recreation; active sport areas, e.g., baseball and court games; and neighborhood activity
centers. A local park may be a small neighborhood park Qess than 5 acres) such as
Daly Park or a larger city park such as Sarzotti Park or Libbey Park and it may have
specialized facilities used for community recreation needs.
Trails are defined in this Element as paths designed to accommodate hiking, horseback
riding and bicycling through an area and they mayor may not be removed from
vehicular traffic.
Trails are categorized in this Element according to function. Types of trails discussed
in this General Plan include:

Recreation Element
     o  Hiking
     o  Equestrian
     o  Bicycling
In some cases one trail will serve two functions as in the case of a hiking/equestrian
traiL These trails may also be used by off-road (mountain) bicycles. Bicycle routes and
some equestrian trails may exist on or adjacent to streets; hiking trails occur primarily
in the nearby hills of Ojai or the back country of Los Padres National Forest to the
north.
Existing and proposed trails, as identified on the Master Plan of Trails of the
Recreation Element, are also classified according to purpose. "Primary Trails" are
those routes that area portion of a regional system. They are used mostly for
recreation but may be used for commuting purposes to locations outside the city.
"Secondary Trails" are those located within the city that primarily serve local needs.
Specialized Facilities
These facilities provide specific recreational opportunities for local or regional use.
They usually have an individual element of attraction. The facility may exist alone or
be within a park, school, or other larger facility, and may be privately or publicly
owned and operated. Examples include:
     o  Arts, Museums, and Cultural Centers
     o  Auditoriums/Amphitheaters
     o  Botanical Gardens/Nature Center
     o  Campgrounds
     o  Equestrian Centers
     o  Festival Grounds
     o  Golf Courses
     o  School Playing Fields
     o  Vista Points/Scenic Areas

                o     Water Activity Areas (e.g. fishing, swimming, boating)
            Preserves
            An area ofland that is highly valued for its natural condition, unique scenic/aesthetic
            resources, biological resources, geologic phenomena or cultural significance may be
            classified or considered for designation as a Preserve. It is generally protected in its
            natural state from extensive urban development in order to maintain or enhance the
            aesthetic, natural quality of an area. An example of an existing Preserve is the Los
            Padres National Forest located to the north of Ojai.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            This Element of the General Plan is not mandated by State planning legislation.
            Instead, the subject of parks and recreation is included as an integral component of
            two other Elements, namely, Land Use and Open Space. Section 65302(a) of the
            Government Code of the State of California stipulates that the General Plan shall
            include:
                  "A land use element which designates the proposed general distribution and
                   general location and extent of the land for housing, business, industry, open
                   space, including agriculture, natural resources recreation, and enjoyment ofscenic

                   beauty, educanon,...  "
            and Section 65560 states that all cities and counties in California must adopt...
                   "A local open space plan for the comprehensive and long range presentation and
                   conservation of open space land within its jurisdiction...including, but to, areas
                   of outstanding, scenic, historical and cultural value, areas particularly suited for
                   park and recreation pw;poses, including access to lakeshores, beaches, and rivers
                   and streams, trails, and scenic highway corridors."
            Recognizing the important functions served by parks and recreation facilities in the
            Ojai community, the City of Ojai has chosen to expand this subject into a separate
            General Plan Element. This approach is permitted by Section 65303 of the California
            Government Code which states the following:
                  "...general plans may include the following element or any part or phase thereof:
                   (a)  A recreation element showing a comprehensive system of areas and public
                        sites for recreation, including the following, and, when practicable, their
                        location and proposed development

            (6) other recreation areas."
Although this Element of the General Plan is not mandated, community certification
for all federal and most State open space and conservation funding programs requires
the preparation of a Parks and Recreation Element.

index/reference of State General Plan requirements and under which sections of the
Ojai General Plan the State requirement is fulfilled.

         ISSUES AND NEEDS
OVERVIEW
         Recreational opportunities in Ojai are numerous. The area is known for its scenic
         beauty, natura1 resources and recreational amenities. Types of facilities and activities
         are defined and categorized in the above paragraphs for reference. An inventory of
         existing recreational facilities is provided on Exhibit REC-t of the City of Ojai MEA.
         The Recreation Element Map further illustrates types and locations of existing and
         proposed facilities; the Master Plan of Trails depicts existing and proposed bicycle,
         equestrian and hiking trails.
         The General Plan inventory, analysis, and Goals, Policies, and Programs of recreation
         facilities is divided into four issue areas. General recreation issues and the four areas
         are discussed in following pages.
GENERAL
         Issues regarding the overall recreation services and facilities in Ojai were raised based
         upon research and analysis of existing conditions. The primary recreation issues in the
         community are briefly listed below:
                 o     Continuation and enhancement of coordination between the City, County
                       and other involved recreational agencies and organizations and their
                       facilities
                 o     Recreation's role related to tourism in Ojai
                 o    Optimum utilization by the City of the proceeds of the Parkland Recreation
                      Tax in improving Ojai's recreation system
                 o    Funding of the maintenance of all existing and future recreational facilities
PARKS
         Numerous parks exist in the Ojai area. These parks consist of public and private
         facilities that serve local residents and visitors. The parks are generally sufficient to
         serve existing demands in the Valley.
         Park land in the City of Ojai is considered sufficient by standard per capita
         requirements. However, parks in Ojai are utilized by many non-city residents and by
         visitors, thus the parks serve more than local residents.

       Recreation Element
       City parks facilities in Ojai are generally considered less than adequate in size and scope
       to serve near future demands due to their wide usage by local and non-local people.
       A need has been identified by the community to expand the City's local/community
       park system. There have been no scheduled major additions to existing city parks
       facilities in the recent past.
       Major issues related to parks in Ojai include:
               o    Optimum utilization and park development of existing park areas
               o    Funding the maintenance, enhancement, and expansion of existing and
                    future city park areas
               o    Identification ofpotential new park sites and the retainment of that land for
                    future potential park and recreational uses
TRAILS
       The three types of trails in Ojai (bicycle, equestrian, hiking) are separate in purpose but
       often overlap in use (i.e., a hiking/equestrian trail in Los Padres National Forest). As
       such many interrelated issues have been raised. Trails issues identified below pertain
       generally to all trails in the Ojai Planning Area. Issues relating to specific bicycle,
       equestrian, or hiking trails are indicated by that specific trail in parenthesis.
               o    Formal General Plan designations of all trail systems
               o    Proper directional signing and marking of established trails
               o    Connection of all "Primary" Trails to regional trail systems
               o    Safety in design and use of trails
               o    Establishment of trail heads and/or staging areas and parking areas (hiking
                    and equestrian)
               o    Education program to inform the public of opportunities, existence and
                    location of trails
               o    Establishment of a cross-town connector (equestrian)

SPECIAl TZRD FACILl77ES
               Numerous recreational and cultural opportunities exist in Ojai. Specific programs
               within the City Recreation Department are based in a variety of facilities. Activities are
               provided from various locations in parks and facilities. The MEA Recreation Facilities
               Matrix provides an index of all recreation activities in Ojai and lists the activity facilities
               available in each park or recreation area (see MEA Recreation section).
               Many participants in City recreation programs are non-City residents (25% of
               participants are Ojai City residents). The City Recreation Department programs are
               popular and are often full or over capacity. Cultural programs are also popular and in
               need of additional facilities in which to be conducted. The Recreation Department
               uses schools and other facilities to conduct programs when parkland is not available
               or appropriate. The City has identified a need to expand the variety of recreational
               and cultural facilities and programs to satisfy these demands.
               County parks are appropriate for use in City programs but often are underutilized.
              Joint use of facilities could be coordinated with City recreation systems to enable
               optimum use of facilities. For example a reservation system could be established for
               use of county parks or schools by City recreation programs. In this way, an equitable
               system could be established, balancing the provision and use of the area's recreation
               facilities between the County, City, and other involved parties as appropriate.
               The major issues and needs relating to specialized facilities include:
                       o    Additional lighted ball fields
                       o    More efficient/extensive use ofschool facilities for recreational and cultural
                            arts programs
                       o    Additional recreation classes and organized programs
                       o    Additional fine arts and other cultural programs and activities
                       o    Utilization of all existing facilities within the community to the optimum
                           extent feasible and desirable
                       o   Vista Points and designation of Scenic Areas
                       o    Child-care integration with Recreation Department Program (i.e.,
                            babysitting service for children whose parents participate in recreation

                    property to National Forest land)

                o   Establishment of new trails in National Forest
                o   Establishment of new preserves and related facilities in other areas (such as
                    to the south of the City) where potential biological, aesthetic or other
                    recreational or open space values have been identified

             Safety Element
             INTRODUCTION
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF THE ELEMENT
             In 1971, the California Legislature passed legislation requiring two new elements to
             be added to the general plans of all cities and counties in the State. These were the
             Safety Element and the Seismic Safety Element.
             The impetus for this legislation was a series of natural disasters which had occurred
             in Southern Califomia in the preceding two years. The winter of 1969 saw
             particularly heavy rains, especially during January and February. Serious flooding
             occurred in many areas of Southern California but especially in Ventura County.
             These heavy rains caused substantially increased growth in the chaparral vegetation
             belts of the Southern California hills and mountains. Then during thirteen days of
             September and October, 1970, a series of disastrous fires broke out, fanned by dry
             desert Santa Ana Winds. The Ere burned over half a million acres of brush and
             timber land, destroyed 722 homes, killed 16 people and cost $233 million to
             control. The following winter landslides and mudslides occurred in the hills and
             damaged many of the structures that had escaped the fall flres.
             In response to these disastrous floods, flres and landslides, the 1971 Legislature
             enacted Government Code Section 65302.1, which requires ofeach city and county
             general plan:
                     A safety ekmentfor the protection of the community from fires andgeologic
                     hazards includingfiatures necessaryfor such protection as evacuation routes,
                     peak load watersupplY rtquirtments, minimum road widths, ckarances around
                      strnaUrtS, andgeologic hazards mapping in artas of known geologic hazard.
             The impetus for the Seismic Safety Element was the February 9, 1971, San
             Fernando Valley earthquake. This earthquake of 6.6 magnitude took 65 lives and
             caused almost $1 billion of damage to freeway interchanges, hospitals (accounting
             for the greatest loss of life), utilities, dams, and public, private, commercial and
             industrial buildings. The earthquake also revealed major discrepancies in building
             design and a laxness in land use planning.
             This disaster prompted the Legislature to require another element to the general
             plan, a Seismic Safety Element. Government Code Section 65302 (F) requires:
                     A seismic saftty ekment consisting of an identification and appmisal ofseismic
                     hazards such as susceptibility to surfOce npturesfrom faultin~ to ground shakin~ to

Safety Element
        groundfailure or to the effects ofseismicaf!y induced waves such as tsunamis Q1/d seiches.
         The seismic safety element shaD also inelude an appraisal of mudslides, andslides, and
         slope stability as necessarygeologic hazards that must be considered simultaneouslY with
         other hazards such as possible surface rupturesfrom faulting, ground shaking, ground
        failure and seismicaf!y induced waves.
Most recently, the Legislature adopted AB 2038 in 1984 which expanded the list of
mandatory safety issues to be addressed within the Element. The additional
concerns focused on seismic safety. Essentially, the Legislature took the issues
previously considered in the seismic safety element and made them safety element
requirements. At the same time, the Legislature deleted the seismic safety element
from the list of mandatory general plan elements.
In order to meet the state requirements discussed above, the City of Ojai adopted
the County of Ventura's e.'<isting Seismic Safety and Safety Element in 1974. This
adoption of a County element is provided for in Government Code Section 65302
(g).
In 1988, the City prepared a Master Environmental Assessment (MEA) as part of
a comprehensive update of its General Plan which included the Circulation, Open
Space, Conservation, Recreation, and Housing Elements. The MEA includes
several maps which delineate areas of flooding, fire, and seismic hazards within the
City. In 1989, the County updated and completely reformatted its General Plan,
doing away with the typical seven element format. In response to this reformatting
ofthe County General Plan, the City initiated a program for updating the remaining
City elements which have incorporated by reference adopted County elements.
These include the Noise and Safety Elements. The City is currently in the process
of updating its Noise Element.
The City of Ojai has created its own Safety Element with the text and exhibits
which follow. This element is more tailored to the specific safety issues which
concern the City of Ojai. One of the shortcomings in utilizing the County's Safety
Element has been that it discusses certain hazards which are not a concern within
the City of Ojai. The City's Safety Element therefore does not contain detailed
discussions of tsunami and seiche hazards, hazards which do not occur within the
City of Ojai. Tsunami and seiche hazards will only be referred to in the
assumptions I definitions portion ofthis element. Another shortcoming ofutilizing
the County Element for the City is that it does not provide detailed discussions on
certain conditions and policies which are unique to the City of Ojai. The City's
Safety Element identifies existing conditions which are unique to the City. These
include the ongoing effort to upgrade the remaining unreinforced masonry bearing

wall buildings within the City, and a detailed discussion of the level of fire service
currently being provided to the City by the County.
The City's Safety Element also includes references to maps delineating existing
hazards contained within the City's MEA.. The maps relevant to the issues
identified in this Safety Element have been updated and included as part of the
creation of this element to reflect most current 1991 environmental conditions.
The Safety Element contained within the following text and exhibits combines the
State of California requirements for safety elements and seismic safety elements
into one coherent document. The purpose of this Safety Element is to provide for
the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the
effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, and
dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence and
other geologic hazards known to the City; flooding; and wildland and urban fires.
The Safety Element includes mapping of known seismic and other geologic
hazards. It also addresses evacuation routes, peakload water supply requirements,
and minimum road widths and clearances around structures, as those items relate
to identified fire and geologic hazards.
The City of Ojai Safety Element achieves the following purposes:
         1.      To meet the requirements of State law for preparation of a Safety
                 Element.
        2.       To investigate the various hazards from a regional as well as a local
                 perspective so as to provide a more integrated picture of the
                 hazardous conditions within the City of Ojai and Ventura County.
         3.      To develop a framework which will permit the investigation of all
                 types of hazards and the resources they impact.
        4.       To present the information collected in a form which will allow
                 decision makers and the public to quickly evaluate the pertinent
                 aspects of a given hazard.
         5.      To offer a range ofresponse measures from which decision makers
                 may choose as they attempt to alleviate a given hazard.
         6.      To provide a framework in which future inventory and analysis can
                 be performed.

              Safety Element
ASSUMPTIONS/DEF1N1770NS
             This Safety Element has been prepared pursuant to State General Plan Guidelines
             for preparation of Safety Elements. It is in conformance with the overall General
             Plan Goals of the City of Ojai. The Element strives to provide decision makers
             with the information necessary to evaluate the nature ofa given hazard and possible
             courses of action.
             Base data for the Safety Element was derived from the City of Ojai Master
             Environmental Assessment (MEA) 1988, the Seismic Safety and Safety Element of
             the Ventura County Environmental Resources Agency 1974, the Updated County
             of Ventura General Plan (Hazards Chapter) 1989, the Ventura County Multi-
             Hazard Functional Plan, and applicable current Environmental Impact Reports
             (EIRs).
             Definitions and categories of risks and hazards that are referenced throughout this
             Safety Element are listed below.
             These are taken from the State of California's 1990 Guidelines for the Required
             Elements of the General Plan and from the Ventura County General PIan, Hazards
             Chapter.
             Active Fault
             A fault that has moved recently and which is likely to move again. For planning
             purposes, "active fault" is usually defined as one that shows movement within the
             last 11,000 years and can be expected to move within the next 100 years.
             Area of Special Flood Hazard
             The land in a flood plain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in
             any given year; is sometimes referred to as the "base flood" or "100-year" flood
             area.
             Critical FaciIity
             Includes facilities housing or serving many people which may pose unusual hazards
             in case of damage from or malfunction during an earthquake, such as hospitals, fire,
             police, and emergency service facilities, utility "lifeline" facilities, such as water,
             electricity and gas supply, sewage disposal, and communications and transportation
             facilities.

Safety Element
Dam Failure
Structural failure may be caused by seismic activity, or by landslides flowing into a
reservoir. Flooding may oCOlC as the result of structural failure of a dam.
Debris Flow/AvaIanche
Landslides involving mixture of rock fragments, gravel, sand, soil, mud, water, and
minor organic debris in which flow is the dominant transport mechanism. An
extremely high-velocity debris flow landslide is known as a debris avalanche.
Epicenter
A point at the earth's surface that is closest to the subterranean origin of an
earthquake.
Ewansive Soils
Soils which tend to expand when wet and shrink when dry due to mineralogical
composition.
A fracture in the earth's crust forming a boundary between rock masses that have
shifted.
Flooding:
A "flood" is an overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. The most
common type of flood, and the major subject of this section, is the "rainstorm-
river" flood. A second major type is a "coastal" flood, resulting from a relative
increase in sea level that may be caused by a storm, by a tsunami, or by subsidence.
Other potential causes of floods include dam or levee failure, landslides and seiches.
Floodway
The channel of a watercourse plus any adjacent flood plain area that must be kept
free of encroachment in order that the 1DO-year flood may be carried without
substantial increases in flood heights.

Safety Element
Ground Failure
A general tenn for occurrences when seismic activity causes the ground to lose its
cohesiveness, as in liquefaction, subsidence, and earthquake-related landslides.
Ground Shakine-
"Ground shaking" is the physical movement of the land surface due to earthquakes.
When a fault breaks, the accumulated strain energy is released as seismic waves that
travel outward in all directions from the earthquake focus (the point of first release
of tectonic stress located below the earth's surface on the fault plane, causing
ground shaking). Seismograms (records ofearthquake motion) indicate that several
kinds of motions, or waves, are created by earthquakes. These waves exhibit
different types and directions of movement. Each type ofwave can affect buildings
slightly differently depending on many diverse variables. The combined effect of
these waves makes up the ground shaking component of an earthquake.
Hazardous Buildine-
A building that may be hazardous to life in the event of an earthquake because it:
         1.      Was constructed prior to the adoption and enforcement of local
                 codes requiring earthquake resistant design of buildings;
         2.      Is constructed of unreinforced masonry; or,
         3.      Exhibits anyone of the following characteristics:
                    o    Exterior parapets and ornamentation that may fall on
                         passers-by;
                     o   Exterior walls that are not anchored to the floors, roof, or
                          foundation;
                     o    Sheeting on roofs or floors incapable of withstanding
                           lateral loads;
                     o   Large openings in walls that may cause damage from
                          torsional forces; or,
OJAI GENERAL PLAN                         6                SEPTEMBER 24, 1991
Safety Element
                      o    Lack of an effective system to resist lateral forces.
Hazardous Material
An injurious substance, including pesticides, herbicides, toxic metals and chemicals,
liquefied natural gas, explosives, volatile chemicals, and nuclear fuels.
Inactive Fault
A fault which shows no evidence of movement in recent geologic time and no
potential for movement in the relatively near future.
Landslide
A general term denoting downslope movement of slope materials composed of
rock, soil, fill or combinations thereof.
Liquefaction
The transportation of a saturated granular layer into a fluid state due to intense
ground shaking and/or increased pore water pressure.
Lurching
A sudden roll, pitch or sway of the ground resulting directly from the release of
selsrruc energy.
Non-Seismic Geotechnical Hazards
Geotechnical hazards not triggered by or related to seismic activity, including, but
not limited to, landslides, subsidence, expansive soils and coastal stability problems.
Potentially Active Fault
(1)      A fault that last moved within the Quaternary Period before the Holocene
         Epoch (the last 2,000,000 to 11,000 years);
(2)      A fault which, because it is judged to be capable of ground rupture or
         shaking, poses an unacceptable risk for a proposed structure.

Safety Element
Seiche
A seiche is a long wave which oscillates in an enclosed or partially enclosed body
ofwater as a result of seismic or atmospheric disturbances. Seiches typically occur
in lakes and bays, and are normally caused by unusual tides, winds or currents, but
can also be produced by earthquake ground motion. The shaking rocks the water
back and forth, setting up seiche waves.
The City of Ojai does not contain any substantial body ofwater within or adjacent
to the City limits which would create a primary seiche hazard. No goals, policies,
or implementation programs related to seiches need to be addressed within this
element.
Subsidence
Subsidence is any settling or sinking of the ground surface arising from surface or
subsurface causes. Its usual form is a dish-shaped or bowl-shaped region of
downward surface displacements. Some types of subsidence can be the result of
natural processes, including natural compaction of loosely consolidated alluvium
C'consolidation refers to the gradual compression of a soil under applied load), as
well as tectonics and earthquakes. Other types of subsidence are caused by human
activities. In California, four types of the latter have been identified; they are
named according to the action that causes the subsidence: groundwater withdrawal
subsidence, oil or gas withdrawal subsidence, hydro-compaction subsidence and
peat oxidation subsidence.
Surface Rupture
A surface rupture is a break in the ground's surface and associated deformation
resulting from the movement of a fault.
Tsunami
A tsunami is a traveling ocean wave generated by disturbances associated with
earthquakes, volcanoes or major submarine landslides. Commonly called a tidal
wave in the past, it is referred to now as a series of sea waves. These waves have
a long wavelength (distance from the crest of one wave to the crest of the
succeeding wave) normally over 100 miles, and a very low amplitude (height from
crest to trough). As these waves approach shallow water, the speed decreases from
a deep water speed of over 600 m.p.h. to less than 30 m.p.h., and their energy is
transferred from wave speed (velocity) to wave height (amplitude); waves as high

             as 80 feet can be fonned. Although the arrival time ofwaves can be predicted, the
             intensity of the wave when it reaches shore cannot be predicted.
             The City of Ojai is located several miles inland from the County of Ventura's
             tsunami hazard zone, which extends two miles upstream from the mouth of the
             Ventura and Santa Clara Rivers and Calleguas Creek. No goals, policies, or
             implementation programs related to tsunamis need to be addressed within this
             element.
             Wildland Fires
             Fires occurring in a non-urban, natural area which contains uncultivated lands,
             timber, watershed, brush, or grasslands.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
             Under State Law (Section 65302.1) a City is required to adopt a Safety Element" for
             the protection of the community from fires and geologic hazards including features
             necessaty for such protection as evacuation routes, peak load water supply
             requirements, minimum road widths, clearances around structures, and geologic
             hazards mapping in areas of known geologic hazard."
             A City is also required to adopt a Seismic Safety Element. Government Code
             Section 65302 (F) requires that a seismic safety element consist of:
                     An identification and appraisal of seismic hazards such as susceptibili!) to
                     surface mptumsfrom faulting, to ground shaking, to groundfailum or to the
                     iffects ofseismicaf!y induced waves such as tsunamis and seiches. This seismic

                     shaking, groundfailum, and seismicaf!y indtlced waves.
             The City of Ojai has combined the requirements for both the Safety and Seismic
             Elements into a Safety Element in accordance with the California State code in
             order to sufficiently detail the appropriate polices and programs for the City's
             planning area. This element has been submitted in accordance with State Code to

               ISSUES AND NEEDS
OVERVIEW
               Public safety issues in Ojai are numerous. The area is surrounded by topographical
               features which create geologic, seismic, flood, and fire hazards. Types of hazards
               are defmed and categorized in the previous section for reference. Historically, Ojai
               and the surrounding area has experienced damaging earthquakes, landslides, floods,
               dam failures and disastrous brush fires. In addition, the area is isolated from other
               regions of the County due to limited vehicular access created by topographical
               barriers. If roads and bridges leading to the City are cut off by an earthquake,
               flood, or mud slides, then medical, fire, and other emergency response would be
               severely restricted.
               The constant threat to life and property from these hazards creates a need to
               protect the community through sound planning, development, and maintenance
               practices, as well as through disaster education and preparedness programs.
               The General Plan inventory and analysis of public safety hazards is divided into five
               issue areas. The five areas include seismic and geologic hazards (below), flood
               hazards (page 27), fire hazards (page 29), hazardous materials and waste (page 32),
               and disasters (page 33). These issue areas are discussed below and in the following
               pages. Goals, Policies and Implementing Programs for the City of Ojai related to
               safety issues are listed beginning on page 37.
SEISMIC AND GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
               The City of Ojai is exposed to various geologic and seismic hazards as a result of
               the general topography of the area. Ojai is situated in a relatively narrow valley
               surrounded by dramatic mountains with numerous faults traversing the region.
               The following seismic and geologic hazards are known to exist in the Ojai area:
               Seismic Hazards                                 Other Geoloeic Hazards
               Surface Rupture                                 Landslides
               Ground Shaking                                  Expansive Soils
               Subsidence                                      Erosion
               Ground Failure

Seismic Hazards
The City of Ojai has not directly experienced a devastating earthquake. Although
the historic record shows little evidence for strong earthquakes or surface
displacement along faults in the southern area of Ventura County, the likelihood
of the occurrence of one or more such events within 50 to 100 years is not remote.
Only two historic earthquakes might have been devastating to present day
populated areas of the County, but they occurred in December 1812 and January
1857, before there was any semblance of population in the region. The earthquake
of 1812 severely damaged missions from present-day Santa Maria on the west, to
San Fernando on the east, for a total of116 miles. The 1857 earthquake is the first
historical earthquake of California to be described as a "great" earthquake. It is
estimated at 8.25 on the Richter Scale because it apparently ruptured ground from
Fort Tejon to at least 100 miles in each direction along the San Andreas Fault from
Fort Tejon.
The relatively recent 1971 San Fernando earthquake occurred along a fault having
little historic record of activity. Several of the faults within the southern half of
Ventura County are similar in structure. They are subject to
comparable tectonic forces as those associated with the San
Fernando earthquake. A map showing the County's major
earthquake locations and intensities between 1928 and 1971 is
illustrated in Exhibit GEO-2 of the MEA.
Most of the land in Ventura County is encompassed by the
Transverse Range geographic province of California. The
province is distinct from other provinces in that the nature of
its prevailing linear trend is west to east instead of northwest
to southeast (which is the case from most geologic trends in the state). The
province is bounded by three major faults, including the northwest trending San
Andreas Fault zone, which cuts the northeast comer of the County; the west
trending Big Pine Fault, which joins the San Andreas and forms the northern
boundary of the province; and the Malibu Coast Fault, which forms the southern
boundary of the province where the fault extends offshore to the west of the
County boundary. Each of these faults constitute a potential major earthquake
hazard. The following paragraphs outline each known hazard.
Surface Rupture
The major direct effect of earthquake faulting is surface rupture. This is when
faulting causes actual rupturing of the earth's surface.

Safety Element
Nearly all man-made structures are susceptible to damage ranging from severe to
total when affected by displacement along faults passing beneath their foundations.
The San Fernando Earthquake of 1971 has shown that no structures designed
under present standards are safe from severe damage or destruction as a result of
surface fault displacement of foundations. It is widely acknowledged that design
of most structures, such as single-family homes or larger structures, roads, bridges,
pipelines, or other conduits, to resist fault displacement is generally not feasible.
Only massive earth structures such as earthfill dams can be designed to remain
functional after several feet of displacement along an underlying fault.
Permanent effects of surface displacement along faults also can include:
         1.      Abrupt elevation or depression of ground surfaces of several feet
                 for distances of many hundreds of feet along the fault;
         2.      Disruption of surface drainage;
         3.      Changes in groundwater levels in wells;
         4.      Blockage and surface seepage of groundwater flow;
         5.      Changes in survey benchmark elevations;
         6.      Dislocations of street alignments and property lines of many feet
                 if lateral (horizontal) displacement also occurs along a fault;
         7.      Displacement of drainage channel and drains.
Secondary effects of surface displacements along faults within an urban area could
include:
         1.      Disruption ofmovement along roadways due to abrupt depressions
                 or elevation of pavement surfaces;
         2.      Possible flooding due to disruption of drainage channel and storm
                 drain flow;
         3.      Disruption of utility services such as water, gas, fuel, telephone and
                 electric power lines;
         4.      Temporary impact on industry and commerce similar to that

                  resulting from the occurrence of most kinds of regional natural
                  catastrophic events such as hurricanes or floods.
The State Division of Mines and Geology (Urban Geology Master Plan for
California. 1973, Bulletin 198) indicates that on a statewide basis the potential
hazard to structures from the surface displacement of faults is low compared to
such geologic phenomena as earthquake shaking and landsliding. Historically,
major losses due to fault displacement have been limited to the San Fernando
Earthquake of 1971. Structural losses due to fault displacement in the 26 other
major earthquakes in California are unknown but were probably small. Most of the
losses incurred during the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake and 1952 Tehachapi
Earthquake were caused by ground shaking and ensuing fires.
The greatest potential for fault activity is along any of the faults which lie within the
several major fault systems which transect the County from east to west. The 1971
San Fernando Earthquake which occurred along one of these major fault systems
illustrates the high level of activity that some faults within these systems may have,
and foretells the occurrence ofother such earthquakes in the Los Angeles, Ventura-
Santa Barbara regions.
The San Fernando earthquake of 1971 may be an example of the typical type which
could occur along some of the east-west trending faults which transect the County.
Based upon that earthquake, it is most likely that a surface fault displacement within
the County will be sudden, occurring over a period of less than one minute. The
displacement would be accompanied by sharp ground shaking lasting perhaps
several tens of seconds.
Many of the faults in the County are associated with major fault systems extending
beyond County boundaries. Several ofthese faults and fault systems are considered
to be active, but a great deal of additional information must be assembled to
determine the potential for, as well as the nature of, activity of most of the faults
including those presently considered to be active.
The present level of knowledge of the recency ofsurface or near surface movement
along the faults within Ventura County is not sufficient on which to base a firm
determination of the "degree" of activity of most of these features. There is some
evidence that some of the known faults have displaced at least late Quaternary
terrace sediments, indicating possible movement as recent as 11,000 years ago. This
is the primary basis for designating the most recently active faults, as these could
have the higher potential of future movement.
There are many places other than the San Andreas fault where faulting occurs. A

series of related faults is called a fault zone or a fault system. There are several faults
and fault zones located near the City of Ojai. In the event of surface displacement
along these fault zones, loss oftife and property damage in the unincorporated and
incorporated areas of Ojai could be significant. These zones are described below
and illustrated in Exhibits GEO-l and GEO-3 of the City of Ojai MEA.
SANTA ANAlARROYO PARIDA FAULT ZONE
This filUlt extends from Montecito to the Vent:w:a River and along the south side
of the Ojai Valley. This fault system is an eastward extension of the Mission
Ridge Fault in the Santa Barbara area and extends to the southeast end of the
Ojai Valley where San Cayetano zone apparently begins. The fault roughly
parallels the southern boundary of the City of Ojai. The Santa Ana Fault has
raised the Upper Ojai Valley relative to the Ojai Valley. The fault forms a
groundwater barrier in the alluvium beneath the Vent:w:a River. One school lies
in the fault zone and sewer mains and water transmission lines from Lake
Casitas and Vent:w:a to the Vent:w:a area cross this fault zone. This system is
considered potentially active.
UON MOUNTAIN FAULT
This fault is encompassed by the Lion Canyon Fault Zone which extends from
Santa Paula Creek along the south edge of Upper Ojai Valley through the Lion
Canyon area and possibly to Oak View and beyond to Lake Casitas. The fault
itself does not enter the City of Ojai. The actual Lion Mountain fault is located
between Lake Casitas and the San Cayetano fault zone, east of Ojai. The Lion
Mountain Fault Zone contains a major portion ofthe Oak View co=unity and
the southern section of the Ojai community. Major electrical transmission lines,
gas mains, water transmission lines and sewer mains between Oak View and Ojai
transverse this zone. Local geologic formations show relatively recent activity.
This fault is considered potentiaIly active.
POssmLE FAULTS
In addition to the above mentioned vicinity faults there is evidence that faults,
to date unmapped, may extend across the north part of the Ojai Valley area and
link the San Cayetano Fault zone to the east with faults and possible faults to the
west ofVent:w:a River.

SPECIAL STUDIES ZONES
In t 972 the California State Legislature enacted the Alquist-Priolo Geologic Hazard
Zones Act. Pursuant to this act the "State geologist shall delineate ... special
studies zones to encompass all potentially and recently active traces of the San
Andreas, Calaveras, Hayward, and San Jacinto Faults, and such other faults ... as
to constitute a potential hazard to structures from surface faulting or fault creep."
(Alquist-Priolo Act).
Two special studies zones briefly enter the City of Ojai's western boundary near the
Villanova school. Please refer to Exhibit GEO-3 in the City of Ojai MEA.
The intent of the zone is to provide for public safety from the hazard of fault
rupture by avoiding, to the extent possible, the construction of structures for
human occupancy astride hazardous faults. However, the precise location and
identification of hazardous faults within or near a zone of potentially active faults
can be determined only through detailed geologic investigations. Therefore the
State Mining and Geology Board has adopted policies and criteria for the
implementation of these zones.
The most significant criteria within the act is that no structure may be built across
the trace of an active fault. Furthermore, the area within fifty feet of an active fault
shall be assumed to be underlain by active branches and therefore, before any
structure can be built within the zone, a geologic investigation and submission of
a report by a geologist registered by the State of California are required. In
addition, any city or county may require more restrictive policies.
Ground Shaking
The physical movement of the land surface due to earthquakes is known as ground
shaking. When a fault breaks, the accumulated strain energy is released as seismic
waves that travel outward in all directions from the epicenter. Unlike a surface
rupture, ground shaking can occur great distances from an actual known fault. The
intensity of ground shaking/seismicity during an earthquake depends largely on
geologic foundation conditions of the materials comprising the upper several
hundred feet of the earth's surface. The greatest amplitudes and longest durations
of ground shaking occur on thick, water-saturated, unconsolidated alluvial
sediments. Ground shaking can also cause ground failure or surface rupturing due
to lurching and liquefaction.
Ground shaking can cause disruption of surface drainage, blockage of surface
seepage and groundwater flow, changes in groundwater flow, dislocation of street

alignments, displacement of drninage channels and drnins, destruction or damage
to buildings and property and possibly loss of life. Seismic shaking can renew
movement of old landslides as well as result in the formation of new slides. The
intensity of shaking within 10 miles of the epicenter focus point of the earthquake,
in areas underlain by deep alluvium, would likely be in the range of VII to VIII
Modified Mercalli intensity, and VI to VII in areas underlain by finn ground
bedrock (please refer to Table A). Higher intensities would be experienced
immediately adjacent to the epicentral area.
The State Division of Mines and Geology in their publication entitled, "Urban
Geology" 1973, Bulletin 149, indicates that on a state-wide basis, the potential
hazard to structures from ground shaking is higher than any other hazard.
Approximately one dozen unreinforced masonry buildings are located within the
City of Ojai. In order to reduce the risk of structural damage to these buildings in
the event of an earthquake, the City has recently adopted an ordinance to provide
seismic strengthening provisions for unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings.
The ordinance identifies 12 unreinforced masonry buildings, sets time limits for
these structures to meet current seismic code, and specifies the allowable design
criteria which is required.
The State Division of Mines and Geology has also indicated that the Ventura
County area could experience relatively high earthquake activity. It has been
estimated that within the ne..n year there is a 3% to 4% chance of occurrence for
a major earthquake measuring at least 7.0 on the Richter Scale; within the next fifty
years, it is estimated that there is a 50% to 90% chance of an earthquake of this
magnitude. The source of this anticipated earthquake is the 650-mile long San
Andreas fault.

Subsidence
Subsidence and differential settlement (the uneven lowering of the ground surface)
constitute minor natural hazards in the City of Ojai. Local subsidence may be
caused by extracting more groundwater than is replaced by the natural hydrologic
cycle. The results from this drawdown are empty pore spaces in the soil, wruch are
compacted from the weight of overlying material.
Subsidence, defined as the sinking or lowering of a part of the earth's surface, can
occur as a result of or independent of earthquakes. Seismically-induced subsidence
can be either a direct or an indirect result of an earthquake. Direct tectonic
displacement of bedrock can result from strong earthquakes causing either
subsidence or uplift of up to several feet over relatively large areas of ground
surface. Indirect subsidence resulting from compaction ofgradual soil layers caused
by ground shaking is more common. Such shaking causes subsidence by
compressing the soil deposit so that pore space formerly filled by groundwater or
air is eliminated. There must be an outlet for evacuation of these pore spaces in
order for subsidence to occur.
Differential settlement is a more common hazard often occurring when buildings
and bridges are built on poor foundation materials. Pilings are often used to
anchor structures to fIrmer deposits below the surface in these situations. Surface
footings tend to be used to support less important structures. If surface footings
are used to support one part of a structure and pilings for another, differential
settlementwill occur, with the area supported by surface footings setting faster than
the pilingsupported section. Differential settlement generally occurs slowly enough
that its effects are not serious.
Ground Failure
Earth materials in a natural condition tend to reach equilibrium over a long period
of time. In geologically active areas such as California and Alaska there are many
regions where earth materials have not yet reached a natural state of stability. For
example, most of the valleys and bay margins are underlain by recent loose
materials that have not been compacted and hardened by long-term natural
processes. Landslides are common on most of the hills and mountains as loose
material moves downslope. In addition, many activities of man tend to make the
earth materials less stable and hence to increase the chance ofground failure. Some
of the natural causes of instability are earthquakes, weak materials, stream and
coastal erosion, and heavy rainfall. Human activities that contribute to instability
include oversteepening of slopes by undercutting them or overloading them with
OJAI GENERAL PLAN                      18                    SEPTEMBER 24, 1991
Safety Element
artificial fill, extensive irrigation, poor drainage or even groundwater withdrawal,
and removal of stabilizing vegetation. These causes of failure, which normally
produce landslides and differential settlement, are augmented during earthquakes
by strong ground motions that result in rapid changes in the state of earth
materials. It is these changes, by means of liquefaction and loss of strength in fine-
grained materials, that result in so many landslides during earthquakes as well as
differential settlement, subsidence, ground cracking, ground lurching, and a variety
of transient and permanent changes in the ground surface.
Although the basic causes of ground instability are simple in concept, the
consequences are often complex and highly variable. They include numerous
varieties of landslides, ground cracking, lurching, subsidence, and differential
settlement. Moreover, these types of ground failure occur on a wide variety of
ground conditions. Landslides, for example, do not require a steep slope on which
to form, particularly during earthquakes. Many occur on slopes that are virtually
flat, and the surface on which they fail may be very shallow (1 to 2 feet deep) or as
much as hundreds of feet below the ground surface. The type of ground failure
that develops in a given area is determined by the nature of the natural man-made
disturbance that occurs and partly by the topographic, geologic, hydrologic, and
geotechnical characteristics of the ground.
Liquefaction
Liquefaction is a type of ground failure that can occur during an earthquake.
Liquefaction can occur on relatively level ground and have catastrophic effects on
structures. Liquefaction can cause buildings to collapse or sink, pipeline and storage
tanks to float or break, disruption or destruction of gas lines, sewer lines, roads, etc.
Liquefaction can also be the cause of landslides on slopes as small as 2.5%.
Liquefaction occurs when loose soils that are water-saturated are subjected to
ground shaking of high intensity and long duration. Liquefaction is manifested by
sand boils and mudspouts at the ground surface and water seepage through ground
cracks or by the development of quicksand-like conditions or landslides. When
quicksand-like conditions occur, buildings may sink or tilt into the ground and
underground facilities may float to the surface.
Several conditions are necessary to produce liquefaction includingwater saturation,
low density soil, uniform grain size, lack of confining pressure, high intensity and
high duration ground shaking. Ground shaking intensity depends on the magnitude
of an earthquake and the amplification of the ground shaking. In terms of soil
density, loose unconsolidated soil materials are the most subject to liquefaction.

Safety Element
Uniform grain size, such as a deposit of only sand, causes materials to be more
susceptible to liquefaction than mixed materials. The deeper in the soil zone the
higher the confining pressure and consequently, the lower the potential for
liquefaction.
Liquefaction can occur at any level of a soil deposit but
usually occurs within the upper 40 to 50 feet. The
potential for liquefaction exists wherever there are
saturated, loose sand deposits, especially if they are near
the surface. This includes most of the river valleys and the
low lying plains that have poor drainage. Since subsurface
soil properties are not precisely known, it is necessary to
assume that all alluvial areas having high groundwater may
be subject to liquefaction during strong earthquake
shaking.
Areas with alluvial soils are subject to liquefaction hazard.
In the Ojai vicinity, these areas are the Santa Ana Valley
north of Casitas Lake, the Ojai Valley, and the UpperOjai
Valley.
Referring to Exhibit GEO-4 of the City of Ojai MEA, areas designated high hazard
zones for liquefaction are alluvial areas which have had water table levels within 15
feet of the ground surface at some time in the last 50 years or since water well
records have been kept. Moderate hazard zones include alluvial areas which have
had water between 15 and 40 feet below ground level.
There are a few areas within the Sphere of Influence but outside the City
boundaries which are subject to liquefaction hazard. These areas are located along
or adjacent to San Antonio Creek and in the eastern portion of the Sphere of
Influence.
The majority of the City of Ojai is subject to liquefaction hazard. Those portions
of the City located far north along the City boundary or to the west of the Ojai
Country Club are free from significant liquefaction potential.
Inundation From Dam Failure
Dam failures can result from a number of natural or manmade causes such as
earthquakes (ground rupture or severe groundshaking), erosion of the face of
foundation, landslidingwhich displaces a large volume ofwater, rapidly rising flood
OJAI GENERAL PLAN                      20                    SEPTEMBER 24, 1991

waters, and struetural/design flaws.
There are currently no dams within, adjacent to, or upstream from the City of Ojai
which are large enough to endanger lives and property in the event of a failure.
The Stewart Debris Basis, northerly of Canada Street, is not technically adam (refer
to Exhibit GEO-3 of the City of Ojai MEA). The facility was designed by the
Corps of Engineers to accommodate a 500 year flood and is considered safe.
However, in the event of its failure, lives and property could be at risk. In adclition,
the threat of inundation from dam failure could oc= with the construction of a
dam upstream of the major drainage courses such as San Antonio Creek which
traverse or follow close to the City's borders. Because of these threats, this topic
is included in the safety element for present and future reference.
There are three general types of dams: earth and rockfill, concrete arch or
hydraulic fill, and concrete gravity. Each of these types of dams has clifferent
failure characteristics. The earth-rockfill dam will fail gradually due to erosion of
the breach; a flood wave will build gradually to a peak and then decline until the
reservoir is empty. A concrete arch or hydraulic fill dam will fail almost
instantaneously; thus a very rapid build-up to a peak wave and then a gradual
decline. A concrete gravity dam will fail somewhere in between instantaneous and
gradual, with corresponcling build-up of flood wave.
In adclition to the above mentioned characteristics, warning ability is generally
determined by the frequency of inspections for structural integrity, the flood wave
arrival time (the time it takes for the flood wave to reach its maximum clistance of
inundation), or the ability to notify persons downstream and their ability to
evacuate. The existence and frequency of updating and exercising an evacuation
plan that is site-specific assists in warning and evacuation functions.
A dam failure will cause loss of life, damage to property, and other ensuing hazards,
as well as the clisplacement of persons resicling in the inundation path. Damage to
electric generating facilities and transmission lines could also impact life support
systems in communities outside the irnmecliate hazard areas. A catastrophic dam
failure, depencling on size of dam and population downstream, could exceed the
response capability of local communities. Damage control and disaster relief
supportwould be required from other local governmental and private organizations
and from the state and federal governments.
Mass evacuation of the inundation areas would be essential to save lives, ifwarning
time should permit. Extensive search and rescue operations may be required to
assist trapped or injured persons. Emergency meclical care, food, and temporary

shelter would be required for injured or displaced persons. Identification and burial
of many dead persons would pose difficult problems; public health would be a
major concern. Many families would be separated, particularly if the failure should
occur during working hours, and a person inquiry or locator system would be
essential. These and other emergency operations could be seriously hampered by
the loss of communications, damage to transportation routes, and the disruption
of public utilities and other essential services.
Governmental assistance could be required and may continue for an extended
period. These efforts would be required to remove debris and clear roadways,
demolish unsafe structures, assist in reestablishing public services and utilities, and
provide continuing care and welfare for the affected population including, as
required, temporary housing for displaced persons.
Other Geololric Hazards
In addition to seismic hazards, the geology of the Ojai area has created geologic
hazards which may cause loss of life and property due to earth movement not
associated with a seismic event. The following geologic hazards are found
throughout the Ojai area.
Landslides
The widespread landsliding and slope instability throughout much of southern
Ventura County can be related to the intensity of past faulting and folding of
geologic strata, to the clay content of certain sedimentary formations and the
subsurface moisture content. The County of Ventura has not identified any areas
of past landslide activity within the City of Ojai, although the potential does exist.
Land development in hillside areas can result in the formation of new landslides if
grading or development design does not take into account potentially adverse
landslide conditions. Many of the area's natural slopes are underlain by bedded
sedimentary rocks that are inclined downhill. The slopes in these cases are
marginally stable and prone to failure along the bedding planes.
Generally in Ventura County, landsliding is most commonly found along
prominent fault zones (refer to Exhibit GEO-3 ofthe City ofOjai MEA), anticlinal
folds (upside down "U"-shaped folds in rock strata), areas of younger geologic
formations and areas of weak or clayey bedrock. Landslides and potentially
unstable slopes are especially common in hillside areas underlain by sedimentary
bedrock. Many landslides are also associated with steep slopes which have been

undercut by erosion. Subsurface water is also a contributing factor to slope
instability in the great majority oflandslide occurrences. In general, most existing
landslides in southern Ventura County are not of recent origins, over 100 years old
and most are not actively moving. They are subject to movement if triggered by
earthquakes, poorly planned grading or ifground moisture is substantially increased.
Several areas in the Ojai vicinity are subject to landsliding hazard. Most of these
large areas are in the hillsides to the north and south of the City of Ojai. The
Sulphur Mountain hills to the east of San Antonio Creek and south of the Upper
Ojai Valley have large areas susceptible to landsliding. In the National Forest,
northeast of the Ojai Valley, there is a large area of landsliding.
There are no significantly large areas oflandslidingin the City's Sphere of Influence
or in the City of Ojai.
Expansive Soils
Expansive soils are those which are generally clayey, expand or swell when wetted,
and contract or shrink when dried. These soils are typically located in areas of
moderate slope. Expansive soils are referred to as soils having high shrink-swell
potential. Downslope soil creep in hillside areas is a concern with regard to
expansive soils. As an expansive soil shrinks and swells it tends to move downslope
due to gravity.
Expansive soils tend to be very localized and site specific and a soils test is usually
necessary to determine a particular site's susceptibility to expansive soils.
Engineeringpractices can sometimes be applied to alleviate the problems associated
with building on expansive soils. Examples of these practices are appropriate
foundation design, less steep slopes, removal and replacement of expansive soils,
special landscaping, and irrigation techniques to bind and avoid wetting the soil.
Moderately expansive soils are prevalent throughout south Ventura County. Areas
of low potential for expansive soils are common along rivers and some canyons.
Small areas of highly expansive soils are scattered throughout the western portion
of the south County. Larger areas are common in the southeastern portion of
south County.
The great majority of the land within the City of Ojai is covered with moderately
expansive soils with the exception of the central portion of the City which has low
expansive potential. These soils can be built upon easily with conservative

              engineering practices. The northeastern corne~ of the City is covered with highly
              expansive soils which must be taken into consideration prior to land development.
              Please refer to Exhibit GEO-9 of the City of Ojai MEA.
              The majority of the City of Ojai's adopted Sphere of Influence is underlain by
              moderately expansive soils. The southeastern portion of the Sphere has highly
              expansive soils near Highway 150. Highly expansive soils are also prevalent in the
              portion of McDonald Canyon and the area east ofMeiners Oaks located within the
              Sphere ofInfluence boundaries.
              Erosion
              The majority of soils in the Ojai area have potential for very severe water erosion
              if the soils are cultivated or heavily grazed. The exceptions to this are areas along
              riverbeds. These areas experience no potential to moderate potential
              for erosion hazard.
              Outside the City limits, the trend of severe erosion hazard near the City increasing
              to very severe hazard to the northwest and reducing to moderate hazard to the
              southeast continues in the City vicinity. A small area east of Meiners Oaks,
              however, has potential for moderate erosion hazard.
              Potential for severe erosion hazard characterizes the majority of the soils within the
              City limits. To the northwest, the potential increases to very severe. To the
              southwest, the potential for erosion hazard is reduced to moderate. Please refer to
              Exhibit GEO-I0 ofthe City of Ojai MEA for an illustration of the erosion hazards
              which exist within the City and its sphere of influence.
FLOOD HAZARDS
              The potential of flooding is a major safety concern in Ojai. Parts of the City and
              surrounding areas are subject to flood hazards. Structures in the Ojai area are
              highly susceptible to damage from water runoff. Controlling and directing the flow
              of water will need to be addressed. This will be accomplished by specifically
              identifying areas susceptible to flooding and making appropriate plans of action.
              Climate
              The climate of the Ojai area directly affects the duration and intensity of rainfall.
              It is characterized by hot summers and mild winters. The mean annual precipitation
              for the area ranges from 19 inches near the confluence of San Antonio Creek and
              the Ventura River, to 30 inches in the mountains.
             OJAI GENERAL PLAN                        24                 SEPTEMBER 24, 1991
Safety Element
Major floods in the area are produced by unstable frontal storms that form in the
Pacific Ocean and approach the coast from the west. These frontal systems form
by cold air masses from the polar regions mixingwith very moist warm air from the
tropics. They have a potential for producing heavy and prolonged rainfall. The
rain generally occurs during the winter months from November to April. Storms
last from three to four days. Local storms can cause high intensity precipitation for
a duration of about six hours or less. General summer storms can also occur in
southern California during the later summer or early fall months. These summer
storms have not resulted in any major floods in the San Antonio Creek Basin
during the periods for which discharge records are
available.
Drainage
Drainage for the City of Ojai and Sphere of Influence is south and southwest. The
streams and drains are typical of the majority of streams in southern California;
streamflow is negligible except during and immediately after rains. Climatic and
basin characteristics are not conducive to continuous runoff. Runoff increases
rapidly in response to high-intensity precipitation and is magnified to some degree
by the impermeable surfaces created by urbanization. Streamflow is seasonal and
diminishes rapidly at the end of the winter precipitation season. Based on records
on the last 100-year period of flood history, some flood damage will occur in the
vicinity of Ojai on an average of once in every four years. The Ojai area historically
has been subjected to major storms on an average of once every 11 years.
Channel Analysis
There are many creeks and drains in the Ojai area which could have an effect on
the City when floods occur. The following tables and descriptions briefly detail
those watercourses which pose possible flood hazards for the City of Ojai.
    o   San Antonio Creek
        This a major tributary to the Ventura River. It originates in Senior Canyon
        north of the Ojai Valley southwestward to its confluence with the Ventura
        River north of Casitas Springs.
    o   Thacher Creek
        This creek originates northeast of Ojai and flows in a southwesterly
        direction to its confluence with San Antonio Creek in the City of Ojai.

Safety Element
  o   Stewart Canyon Channel
      Stewart Canyon traverses the City ofOjai and its Sphere of Influence from
      north to south. It goes through the center of the City. Along Stewart
      Canyon Channel urban development has occurred. This drain runs from
      the mountains north of the City south to its confluence with San Antonio
      Creek along the southern corporate boundary. A debris basin was built by
      the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the mouth of Stewart Canyon Storm
      Channel. It contains and regulates the outflow for both the Intermediate
      Regional (100-year) and Standard Project F100ds (SOO-year). Below the
      basin a concrete channel and covered box conduit has been constructed to
      accommodate the Intermediate and Standard Project F1ood. This
      improvement extends from the spillway of the debris basin to
      approximately 200 feet downstream of the Southern Pacific Railroad
      crossing. In this manner all flood hazards along Stewart Canyon Channel
      have been minimized above the downstream end of the channel
      improvement.
  o    Fox Canyon Barranca
     This traverses the City and Sphere from north to south in the eastern third
      of the City. Along Fox Canyon Barranca urban development has occurred.
      This drain runs from the mountains north the City to its confluence with
      Stewart Canyon Drain and then into San Antonio Creek, along the
      southerly corporate boundary.
     The principal danger of flooding along the Fox Canyon Barranca is the
      inadequate inlet under Daly Road. Following the 1985 Wheeler Fire, a
      debris barrier was constructed on Fox Canyon upstream of Daly Road.
      However, this inlet could still become clogged from debris generated
      upstream ofDaly Road. An upstream extension to the conduit under Daly
     Road is proposed which would eliminate the inadequate inlet at Daly Road
     and place Fox Canyon underground to the mouth of the canyon some 800
      feet upstream.
     The area tributary to Fox Canyon includes a large area east of the channel
      that is not collected due to a lack of lateral drainage facilities. The City
      Master Plan of Drainage (dated June 1979) proposes a storm drain parallel
      to Fox Canyon Channel. This drain would intercept much of the tributary
     east of Fox Canyon. It is designated as Drain 26 and is considered to be
     a Ventura County Flood Control "Redline" or jurisdictional channel.

Safety Element
    o   McNeil Creek
        McNeil Creek is an unimproved channel throughout its length and runs
        mostly through agricultural land. The channel is inadequate to contain an
         Intermediate Regional (100-year) Flood throughout its length.
    o   Happy VaIley Drain
         This drain travels northeast to southwest and is situated just outside the
         western boundary of the City limits. The flood plain for Happy Valley
         Drain south of El Roblar is partially developed.
    o   DronCreek
        This creek travels north to south, originating from the mountains and
        emptying into San Antonio Creek. Dron Creek has the potential to
        overflow its banks before it reaches San Antonio Creek.
Floodin~    Hazards
Almost all of the above described waterways pose a flooding threat to the City of
Ojai. Flooding can be aggravated by several factors such as inadequate channel
cross-sections, culverts at roadways, poor flow line alignment, and excessive debris.
The major watercourse influencing the City is San Antonio Creek. Damaging
floods along this creek and its tributaries in the vicinity of Ojai are reported to have
occurred in 1862, 1867, 1884, 1911, 1914, 1938, and 1943. Major floods along the
creek are described as having a peak discharge greater than 3500 cubic feet per
second. Major floods have been recorded along San Antonio Creek occurred in
1952, 1958, 1965, 1966 1969, and 1978. The flood of January 25, 1969 had the
largest recorded peak discharge at 16,200 cf./sec. The largest peak discharge for
San Antonio Creek during the 1978 winter storms was 14,000 cf./sec. which was
recorded on February 10th. This was facilitated by the 16.23 inches of rainfall
during the months of December and January in the City ofOjai. The January 16th
storm produced a 6,900 cf./sec. peak discharge on San Antonio Creek with the
March 4th storm producing a 10,100 cf./sec. discharge.
Most flooding problems along the San Antonio Creek are associated with excessive
debris accumulation and in some instances, alignment of the natural stream; losses
of recreational facilities such as picnic tables are common on an annual basis
(Flood Insurance Study, HOD, 1978). The Ojai Valley is periodically threatened by
flows containing large quantities of debris from steep canyons of the upper
OJM GENERAL PLAN                        27                     SEPTEMBER 24, 1991
Safety Element
watershed. The existing channels can become clogged with debris and no longer
carry the volume of flood flows. These flows then spread over the valley causing
loss in property and posing potential hazard to life.
Traditional improvement plans to alleviate debris flows are debris darns and basins
at canyon mouths and the lining of channels. These improvements would then
carry the cleared water from the basin outlets past points which are susceptible to
flood damages. Systematic and periodic flood channel preventive maintenance
including removing debris accumulating in flood channels and contributory streams
would lessen or remove flood threats from debris clogged channels.
The floods during the January 1969 storms resulted in excessive channel
sedimentation and production oflarge quantities of floating debris. In many areas,
severe sedimentation resulted in the blockage of road crossings. This occurred
along Grand Avenue and Ojai Avenue in the Ojai Valley and Highway 33 north of
Ojai.
Debris basins are invaluable during storm periods because they provide an area to
capture and accumulate debris before it can enter the downstream channels and
cause damage. The Stewart Canyon Debris Basin is credited with saving the City
of Ojai from major property damages and loss of lives. It is estimated that over
200,000 cubic yards of material were deposited in the basin by the January and
February 1969 storms.
The floods during the January/February/March 1978 storm season produced
minor flooding problems in numerous storm drains throughout the City of Ojai.
Most of these facilities are designed for a to-year storm and overflow during greater
storms. However, the result is primarily nuisance flooding since the design flows
are relatively minor. This type of flooding does not pose a serious threat to life and
property.
A burned watershed, results of the July 1985 Wheeler fire, posed a serious potential
threat of flooding to the Ojai Valley in the 1985-1986 flood season. Fortunately
emergency measures including debris darns, temporary channels, watershed
reseeding and extensive sand-bagging combined with a wet, but well distributed,
rainfall resulted in little serious flooding to the valley.
Flood Plain Manarement
In October 1978 the City of Ojai adopted a Flood Protection Ordinance
incorporating flood plain management programs recommended by a Flood
Insurance Study. The intent of the ordinance is to regulate development in flood

             year flood plain includes areas subject to toO-year flooding with average depths of
             less than one foot.
             The Master Plan of Drainage Study,
             prepared for the City of Ojai in June
             1979, identifies sources of funding
             which may be used by a development
             applicant in completing a specific
             project.
             Drainage areas in the Ojai Valley located
             outside of the City limits are subject to
             the Ventura County Flood Control
             District regulations and policies guiding
             flood control activities. Please refer to

FIRE HAZARDS
             Because of the mix of urban and wildland areas in the Ojai area, fire protection is
             a difficult problem and fire protection systems are complex. Much of the area
             surrounding the City of Ojai is covered with woodland, brush, or grassland. Large
             tracts of sparsely populated land must be protected from wildland fires in hot, dry
             summers at the same time that adequate protection must be provided to population
             centers. Fire protection in urban areas must also be designed and equipped to cope
             with industrial fires with their associated hazardous materials concerns, multi-level
             structures of varying occupancies, densely built and highly populated residential
             apartments and similarstructures, and transportation accidents involving hazardous
             materials.

 Safety Element
Fire Hazard Severity
In recent years, extensive study has been
undertaken at the State level to classify the
fire hazard severity of different regions of
the State. One of the key components in
measuring severity is the type and quantity
of flammable vegetation within a given unit
of land area. This factor, also known as
"fuel loading characteristics," can then be
combined with weather and slope to obtain
a measure of relative hazard. Please refer to
Exhibit GEO-3 of the City ofOjai MEA for
an illustration of designated fire hazard
areas. This exhibit is also included m
Appendix B of this document.
Fuel Loading
Three basic fuel loading characteristics have been identified by the State. "Heavy"
fuel loading vegetation is assigned to woodland and brushwood areas. This
characteristic is generally assigned to vegetation that is six feet or more in height
and which has a crown density of 20 percent or more of the ground area. The
heavy fuel loading vegetation types include oak woodlands and chaparral which are
found in abundance in the rural areas surrounding the City.
"Medium" fuel loading vegetation generally includes scrub vegetation that is less
than six feet in height but with similar crown density characteristics. This category
includes California sagebrush, coyote brush, manzanita, and other chaparral species
common to the area.
"Light" fuel loading vegetative types are various types of grasslands, herbaceous
rangelands and irrigated pasture lands. These areas are almost completely treeless
and highly flammable during dry seasons. The significance of this fuel is that it
carries the fire into the medium and heavy fuel beds.
Weather Conditions
The second major natural characteristics to consider in fire hazard measurement are
local weather conditions. In Southern California, very little rain normally fulls
between mid-April and the beginning ofNovember. By September, many portions
OJAI GENERAL PLAN                      3D                    SEPTEMBER 24, 1991
Safety Element
of the State are tinder dry from months of aridity. It is not unusual for strong,
drying winds to blow in from the north and east.
The State has established three"critical fire weather frequency" classes to measure
the weather-related fire hazard severity. These classes basically measure the annual
number of days in which a critical "fire load index" is exceeded over a 10-year
period, with Class I the lowest and Class III the highest level of danger.
Slope
The third major characteristic of fire hazard measurement is the degree of slope
present in a localized area. The rugged terrain and steep slopes that characterize
much of the area surrounding the City can create extreme access problems for
fighting fires once they have started. Generally, vegetation is more abundant in
steep canyon areas due to less severe sun and wind exposure and greater capture
of rain runoff. Fires that start in the bottom of canyons will burn 16 times faster
upslope than if they begin at the top of ridges and burn downslope.
The State has divided slope categories into three different classes of fire severity.
Class I includes slopes from 0 to 40 percent. This category assumes that direct
attack on the fire is possible with all-wheel drive fire trucks, bulldozers, and crews
and aircraft. Class II includes slopes between 41 and 60 percent. This class
assumes direct attack is not possible with fire trucks, but still possible in most cases
with bulldozers, hand crews, and aircraft. Class III includes slopes greater than 61
percent. This class includes areas mostly beyond the capability of bulldozers which
can only be directly attacked by hand crews and aircraft.
Level of Service
The Ventura County Fire Protection District provides the City of Ojai with
structural fire protection and general rescue services.
The City is mainly served by District Fire Station #21. The station is located in the
southeastern section of Ojai and has an estimated average response time of 4.9
minutes to calls in the City. Additional support can be provided by three District
stations outside of the City limits. These include the Meiner Oaks, Oak View, and
Upper Ojai stations.
Station 21 is manned by 3 firefighters, which is the standard engine company
staffing throughout the District. The station currently is equipped with a 50 foot
telesquirt, water tender, reserve engine, and brush engine.

            Safety Element
            The Fire District currently requires sprinklers in all buildings 5,000 square feet or
            greater. Any residential development outside of areas served by the water service
            district is required to maintain a minimum water supply to be used for fire
            suppression. All new development is required to provide steamer hydrants every
            500 feet in residential and 300 feet in commercial or industrial districts.
            The Fire Prevention Division is responsible for the review of all proposed
            development, street names, and inspection oflicensed care facilities, fire protection
            systems and businesses handling hazardous materials.
            Weed Abatement
            The Fire District's weed abatement program currently requires all flammable
            material, including weeds and trash, to be cleared from all lots.
            It is general policy of the District to clean the entire lot, but if in the opinion of the
            Fire Chief or his agent this needs to be modified, then in no case would the District
            clean less than 100 feet from all structures.
HAZARDOUSMATERlALS.AND WASTE
            Hazardous Material means a substance or combination of substances which,
            because of quantity of concentration, or physical, chemical, or infectious
            characteristics, may either a) cause or significantly contribute to an increase in
            mortality or an increase in serious illness; or b) pose a substantial present or
            potential hazard to human beings or the environment. Hazardous materials include
            substances that people rely on continuously, such as petroleum projects, oil-based
            paints, pesticides and the like.
            Hazardous Waste means any waste substance that may cause or significantly
            contribute to serious illness or death, or may pose a substantial threat to human
            health or the environment when improperly managed; these substances are
            generally toxic, corrosive, flammable or reactive.
            The basic difference between wastes and materials is the intended use. "Hazardous
            Wastes" are materials that are no longer useful and must be properly and safely
            disposed of, treated or recycled. In some cases, waste at one facility can be used
            as a raw material at another facility. In those cases, the material would be regulated
            under the hazardous material regulations, and not the hazardous waste regulations.
            Several catastrophic incidents over the past 20 years involving human illnesses, loss

          Safety Element
          of life and environmental destruction caused by hazardous materials and wastes, as
          well as gradual long term groundwater pollution from leaking dumps and tanks,
          have led to the enactment of hundreds of Federal and State laws which place limits
          and prohibitions on the way hazardous wastes are managed from the point of
          generation to the point of disposal. Increased regulatory requirements and the
          increased costs associated with the proper disposal ofall classifications ofwaste has
          led to illegal disposal operations countywide. The Ventura County Planning
          Division has inventoried all past and current waste disposal sites which may pose
          health or land use problems by adversely affecting land, water or air resources.
          The County's Hazardous Waste/Materials Management Plan has been adopted by
          the City of Ojai and is incorporated by reference into this Safety Element. The
          plan includes a coherent set of goals and strategies for the management of
          hazardous materials and wastes within the County.
DISASTERS
          In the event of a major seismic or wildfire event, the City of Ojai will require a
          disaster plan which outlines the various operations and procedures to be taken by
          local agencies. This plan shall discuss, at a minimum, evacuation routes, peakload
          water supply requirements, minimum road widths, and clearance around structures,
          in order to reduce casualties and damages during and following the disaster. Title
          3, Chapter 1, "Emergency Organization" of the Ojai Municipal Code currently
          establishes an administrative plan for disaster directives. This ordinance establishes
          a Disaster Council chaired by the Mayor and designates the City Manager as the
          Director of Emergency Services. In addition to the City's disaster plan, the
          County's Multi-Hazard Emergency Response Plan outlines the various operations
          and procedures to be taken by agencies throughout the County of Ventura.
          The City is currently in the process of updating the City's existing Disaster Plan.
          The revisions to the Plan include: a re-evaluation of the City's disaster
          preparedness, special first aid and CPR training for City employees, and
          development of a data base listing persons within the City who have special talent
          which may be useful in the event of an emergency. The City has recently
          completed a mailing to inform residents about earthquake hazards and how to
          prepare for them. Also, an unreinforced masonry ordinance has been adopted by
          the Citywhich will provide seismic strengthening for unreinforced masonry bearing
          wall buildings. This ordinance will assist in reducing the risk of structural damage
          to these buildings in the event of an earthquake.

Seismic Events
The City of Ojai lies approximately 35 miles southwest of the San Andreas fault.
A catastrophic earthquake having a magnitude of 8.3 on this portion of the San
Andreas fault is likely before the end of the twentieth century and is estimated to
have a current annual probability of occurrence between two and five per cent. It
is based on a repeat occurrence of the great Ft. Tejon earthquake of January 9,
1857, and other geophysical observations. As geologists know, at least eight major
earthquakes have occurred in this area, with an average spacing in time of 140 years,
plus or minus 30 years.
First instance property losses for the magnitude 8.3 event on the south-central San
Andreas fault are estimated to be close to $20 billion.
Dependingupon the time ofday or night, this magnitude 8.3 eventwill kill between
3,000 and 14,000 people and cause between 12,000 and 55,000 people to require
hospitalization.
The City must anticipate the occurrence ofgreat earthquakes which will overwhelm
present capabilities to respond adequately and in an organized manner.
Evacuation Routes
A major seismic event could conceivably cut off evacuation routes into and out of
the City of Ojai. Highway 33 north ofthe City could be temporarily closed through
portions of the Los Padres National Forest due to landslides. The section of
highway through the Forest includes six (6) wooden bridges and three (3) tunnels
which could sustain damage during a seismic event. Caltrans currently has plans to
replace all six (6) of the wooden bridges with concrete structures by early 1994, at
the earliest date. These bridges, located between Matilija and Bear Creeks, will cost
approximately $2.4 million to replace, with construction estimated to begin in early
1993.
Highway 150 east and west of the City could also experience closures due to
landslides. Highway 33 south ofthe City could experience disrupted pavement and
damage to bridges. In addition to the major highways, surface streets could
experience delays and detours due to disrupted pavement, downed power lines, and
structural debris. These disruptions could last up to 72 hours in some cases. It is
also possible that a major seismic event or other emergency in the Ventura area
could disrupt traffic along the Pacific Coast Highway (FCH) /Highway 101 north
of the City of Ventura. In the event of the closure of PCR/Highway 101,
Highways 33 and 150 may be designated as an alternative route between Ventura

and Santa Barbara via the City of Ojai.
The disaster map of the City's General Plan (Exhibit S-2located in the City ofOjai
MEA) identifies the major routes leading out of town and the distances to the
nearest hospitals outside of the City limits. The map also identifies locations of
nuclear fallout shelters designated by the State Office of Emergency Services. In
the event ofa non-nuclear emergency, emergency shelters will be set up by the Red
Cross at schools, parks, and other public facilities. These sites will be determined
by the Red Cross at the time of the emergency based upon the type and location
of the emergency.
Water Supply
The City of Ojai obtains 83% of its water from ground water supplies. The
remaining 17% is obtained from Lake Casitas via the lake's main conveyance
system. In the event of a major seismic disaster, both of these sources of water
may be limited.
Groundwater wells througbout the City may be damaged by faulting and earth
movements which could displace sources ofgroundwater. Wells with water sources
which remain intact may be rendered inoperable if water pumps are damaged or
power supplies are cut off. In addition, wells which remain operable may
experience damage to their distribution systems, severely limiting water availability.
Water supplied by Lake Casitas may be limited in the event of a dam failure or
damage to the lake's main conveyance system.
The City's disaster plan should include policies to deal with water distribution needs
immediately following a seismic event.
Minimum Road Widths
In the event of a major seismic disaster, emergency response vehicles will require
access to various structures throughout the City. The City's disaster plan should
include minimum street widths to accommodate emergency response vehicles.
Wildland Fires
The area surrounding the City of Ojai is particularly vulnerable to wildland fire
hazards which could pose a community-wide threat during a major conflagration.
The City's low-density residential areas closest to areas ofhigb fire danger pose the
greatest threat.
OJAI GENERAL PLAN                     35                     SEPTEMBER 24, 1991
Safety Element
Evacuation Routes
A major wildland fire has the ability to shut down anyone of the major highways
leading out of the City. It is not likely, however, that all major routes out of the
City would be shut down simultaneously. Formal fire evacuation routes have not
been predetermined, due to the unpredictability of a fire. Law enforcement
agencies will therefore need to react according to the needs of each situation.
Water Supply
A major wildland fire may result in decreased water pressure throughout the City
as a result of increased water use by firefighters and residents alike. This could
result in disastrous situations ifwater pressure drops below effective levels in crucial
areas. The City's disaster plan should outline backup water supplies and ways to
reduce pressure decreases before they drop below crucial levels.
Minimum Road Widths
In the event of a major wildfire disaster, emergency response vehicles will require
access to various structures throughout the City. The City's Disaster Plan should
include minimum street widths to accommodate emergency response vehicles, as
recommended by the Fire Prevention Division of the Fire District.
Clearances Around Structures
The City of Ojai currently follows the Fire District's brush clearance requirement
of 100 feet minimum around structures in high-bush areas. This has been proven
to significantly reduce hazards to life and property during wildfires by providing an
effective fire break.

                   identification and mitigation of seismic hazards are implemented.
             4)    Promote and encourage additional seismic investigations within the City by
                   Federal, State, and local agencies and organizations.
             Implementing Programs
             1)    The City shall require, prior to approval of a project located in a seismic
                   hazard zone, (as depicted on Exhibit GEO-3 in the City of Ojai MEA), a
                   geotechnical report defining and delineating any seismic hazard. Such
                   investigations shall include a site-specific characterization of anticipated
                   ground motion, which would include estimates of peak horizontal ground
                   acceleration and duration of shaking. If the City finds that no undue hazard
                   of this kind exists, based on information resulting from studies conducted on
                   sites in the immediate vicinity of the project and of similar solid composition
                   to the project site, the geotechnical report may be waived. After the report
                   has been approved or a waiver granted, subsequent geotechnical reports shall
                   not be required, provided that new geological datum, or data, warranting
                   further investigation is not recorded. The City shall submit one copy of each
                   approved geotechnical report, including the mitigation measures, if any, that
                   are to be taken, to the State Geologist within 30 days of its approval of the
                   report.
             2)    The City's Grading Ordinance shall be modified to include specific
                   regulations for identified areas with seismic hazards.
