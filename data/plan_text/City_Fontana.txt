Chapter 3.
Land Use
Element
INTRODUCTION
Purpose and Contents of the Element
The City of Fontana Land Use Element focuses on the physical distribution of
land uses within the City and its identified sphere of influence (that area
which it ultimately envisions as within its incorporated boundaries).
Specifically, it describes the long-range pattern and intensity of land uses
within the City, and indicates the number of households, persons and amount
of employment projected to be developed in the City at ultimate build-out. It
also provides goals, policies and action items addressing a variety of land use
related issues such as the balance of land uses in the community, land use
compatibility, creating ―one Fontana,‖ a unified City, infill and
redevelopment, and revitalizing Downtown.
Relationship to Other Elements
The land use element is a driving element in a general plan, to which all the
other elements relate. Because it sets out land use designations and pattern
and intensity of land use, the land use element affects circulation, housing,
public services and infrastructure, safety, conservation/open space, parks and
recreation, noise and air quality. The land use element also establishes the
primary basis for consistency with the City’s zoning code. It is important to
note, however, that elements are equal in terms of the requirement to comply
with their policies.

    Other Land Use Regulatory Documents
    The General Plan establishes the long-range direction, or blueprint, for the
    City. Several regulatory mechanisms are used to implement the General Plan
    on a day-to-day basis:
    Specific Plans/Community Plans
    Specific plans provide more focused guidance and regulation for particular
    areas. They generally include a land use plan, circulation plan, infrastructure
    plan, development standards, design guidelines, phasing plan, financing plan,
    and implementation plan.
    Fontana has 27 approved specific plans governing land use development in
    designated areas throughout the City. The majority of these Plans are built
    out or building out now. The Plans listed below are depicted on the
    community structure and land use plan graphics included in this Element,
    and can be obtained at the City of Fontana planning division.

                                                                               3. LAND USE ELEMENT
The City has also approved five community plans. Community plans were
used in the past to guide single family detached development in Residential-
Planned Community designated areas in Fontana, for projects less than 160
acres in size. The location of each of these plans is indicated below. Each is
proposed to incorporate single-family detached residential development on
7200 square foot lots or larger.
   Fontana Star Community Plan – located in northwestern Fontana,
    bounded by Hemlock Avenue to the west, Beech Avenue to the east, and
    Walnut Avenue to the north.
   Fontana Grandview Community Plan – located east of Lytle Creek
    Road, north of Curtis Avenue and west of Knox Avenue.
   Bellgrove II Community Plan – located in northwestern Fontana, north
    and south of Walnut Avenue, west of Hemlock Avenue and immediately
    east of San Sevaine Avenue.
   Centerstone at the Landings Community Plan – located in
    northwestern Fontana, north of Baseline Avenue, west of Hemlock
    Avenue and immediately east of the future San Sevaine Avenue.
   Morningside Community Plan – located in northwestern Fontana,
    bounded by Cherry Avenue to the west, Walnut Avenue and San Sevaine
    Road to the north and east, and Baseline Avenue to the south.
The common theme between both types of plans is a customized and
comprehensive plan that will yield a more desirable living environment than
could be achieved with conventional zoning.
Zoning Code
Zoning is a primary mechanism for implementing the general plan, providing
development standards, allowable uses, and other regulations that directly
implement the general plan. Government Code Section 65860 requires
zoning to be consistent with the general plan. The California Supreme Court,
in Lesher Communications v. City of Walnut Creek, held that the general
plan has primacy over zoning; in the court’s words "the tail does not wag the
dog." Fontana’s Zone Code and associated Zoning Map have been updated
in conjunction with this updated General Plan, ensuring the City a
contemporary land use policy/ regulatory system. The Zone Code and
Zoning Map are available at the City of Fontana Planning Division, and on
the city’s website at www.fontana.org.
Subdivision Ordinance
Fontana’s Subdivision Ordinance ensures that all subdivisions within the
City are designed with the infrastructure necessary to support the proposed
development, including road access, drainage, parks, school sites, utilities
and related easements, and lot size and configuration.
                                                                                               3-5

    Redevelopment Plans
    Through redevelopment, cities have the power to turn blighted, deteriorating
    areas into revitalized, productive community assets. Fontana currently
    manages five redevelopment areas throughout its jurisdiction. These are the
    Downtown, Jurupa Hills, North Fontana, Sierra Corridor Commercial and
    Southwest Industrial Park project areas. See Figure 3-1, Redevelopment
    Project Areas, at right, for a depiction.
    Annual Budget
    The City’s annual budget is the process by which City resources are
    committed over the ensuing fiscal year. It is an ongoing means of
    determining priority and reallocating resources according to anticipated near-
    term conditions. This is especially the case where the work entails a major
    project, such as overhauling the City’s Municipal Code, or involves retaining
    consultants or specialists to augment the staff. This aspect of budgeting
    complements the ―hard‖ implementation improvements reflected in the
    Capital Improvement Program, which is also part of the annual budgeting
    process.
    Capital Improvements Plan
    Fontana prepares a Capital Improvements Plan, which serves as a planning
    and budgeting mechanism for the major projects to be undertaken by the
    City. This Plan addresses projects for public works and infrastructure
    installation, maintenance and repair, parks and recreation services, and
    miscellaneous support services such as graffiti removal and street sweeping.
    The Plan must conform to the policy direction provided in the General Plan.
    San Bernardino County General Plan
    Cities are allowed to plan for unincorporated areas adjacent to their
    boundaries that are logical extensions of their future growth and good
    candidates for annexation. However, until annexation does occur, these
    lands, within the City’s sphere of influence, remain under the governance of
    San Bernardino County and its General Plan. The City of Fontana’s sphere
    of influence includes over 9700 acres. The boundary between the City and
    its sphere of influence is also depicted on Figure 3-1 Redevelopment Project
    Areas, at right.
    Rialto Municipal Airport Plan
    Rialto Municipal Airport, a general aviation airport owned and operated by
    the City of Rialto, is located west of the City of Fontana, between SR 210
    and Baseline Avenue. In accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations, the
    guidance provided in the Rialto Airport Comprehensive Land Use Plan
    should prevail when development is considered within the airport’s
    delineated safety zones.

     COMPONENTS OF THE PLAN: LAND USE
     DESIGNATIONS
     All general plans require cities to specify land uses and intensity of
     development. Although not as specific as zoning classifications, general
     plans are required to describe each land use designation and include a
     diagram of the location of these uses. Both of these components are included
     in this section of the land use element.
     Land Use Designations
     Each of the land use designations, which are mapped on the City’s General
     Plan Land Use map, are described below, along with either their specified
     density range (range of dwelling units permitted per acre) or intensity,
     expressed as allowable floor-area-ratio (ratio of building area to lot area, see
     Figure 3-2 below).
     Figure 3-2        Ratio of Building Area to Lot Area
3-10                                                           LAND USE ELEMENT

                                                                                3. LAND USE ELEMENT
Actual density (residential uses) and Floor Area Ratio (FAR) (non-residential
uses) ranges are determined on a parcel specific basis. Density and FAR are
based on adjusted gross acreage, which takes out the area for collector streets
and above, public facilities (excluding schools), and open space (excluding
parks). To estimate adjusted gross acreage of a property, the General Plan
uses the total gross acres multiplied by 70% (.7) to provide an approximate
calculation.
Residential Designations
Each of the residential land use designations listed below have been
developed to encourage a variety of housing types that would best serve and
support the diversity of the residents of Fontana. The designations support
residential densities from 2 to 24 dwelling units to the acre. In addition, in
order to facilitate and encourage innovative development, Specific Plans are
allowed in any of the listed residential land uses provided that the density of
the overall project is within the allowed density range of that designation and
the project area is a minimum of 145 net acres.
Residential Estate (R-E)
      2 du/ac
1) This low-density designation reflects natural, environmental, and other
    constraints adjacent to the hillside areas in the community, as well as the
    lack of infrastructure in the area. Development in R-E areas is intended
    to evoke a rural feeling.
2) A minimum lot size of one half acre is required, however this may be
    increased in order to preserve hillside areas, depending on slope and
    geotechnical considerations.
Single Family Residential (R-SF)
    2.1 – 5 du/ac
1) Typical suburban single-family detached residential development is
    intended in this designation.
2) 7200 sf average lot size must be maintained over any proposed
    development; the minimum lot size is 6000 sf.
Residential Planned Community (R-PC)
    3.0 - 6.4 du/ ac
1) The intent of the R-PC designation is to provide for the managed growth
    of master planned communities offering a mix of residential housing
    types and amenities available for various economic segments of the
    population.
                                                                                               3-11

     2) The designation recognizes approved single-family residential
        development areas within approved Specific Plans. Refer to those
        approved Specific Plans for additional detailed density information
        related to the R-PC designated areas.
     3) The R-PC designation is also intended to accommodate development of
        new planned residential communities in Fontana either using
        conventional zoning or a Specific Plan (for projects of 145 acres
        minimum).
     4) For projects of 145 acres minimum size (net), the following provisions
        apply:
        a. Single-family detached residential development is allowed by right,
            at densities from 3.0 to 4.7 du/acre, with a specific plan.
        b. For single family detached residential development at densities
            between 4.7 and 6.4 du/acre:
            i) The project must be adjacent to an activity center or major or
                 primary highway as identified in the General Plan Circulation
                 Element;
            ii) The project must have mix of for sale residential product types
                 including: single-family homes, condominiums, townhomes,
                 and/or rental multifamily housing projects that contain at least
                 100 units with 25% usable open space;
            iii) A specific plan must be prepared;
            iv) The design of the community must encompass a variety of
                 amenities to serve the project which may include, but are not
                 limited to, the following:
                 1) 25% open space,
                 2) Trails and paseos,
                 3) Child care facilities,
                 4) Neighborhood/satellite community libraries,

                 13) Public facilities/parks substantially in excess of that required
                     by Quimby Act provisions
                 14) Other amenities may include public facilities with a
                     recognizable connection to the project, substantially in
                     excess of minimum requirements.
3-12                                                           LAND USE ELEMENT
                                                                                3. LAND USE ELEMENT
        v) If affordable housing is proposed for at least 20% of the units in
            the project, then per state law a density bonus of 25% will be
            granted, and a mix of for sale residential product types including
            single family homes, duplexes, condominiums, townhomes,
            and/or multi-family housing (projects that contain at least 100
            units) is permitted. A specific plan must be prepared. Overall
            average project density shall not exceed 8 du/ac.
5) For projects of less than 145 acres the following provision applies:
   a. Single-family detached residential development at 10,000 sq. ft.
        minimum lot size is required.
Medium Density Residential (R-M)
   5.1-7.6 du/ac for single-family detached product type;
   7.7-12 du/ac for single family attached or multiple family product
   type
1) This residential category accommodates a range of housing types
   including multiple-family, single-family attached, and single family
   detached.
2) Intended for use near major arterial corridors and commercial and
   activity centers.
3) A 4,000 sq/ft minimum lot size is required for single family detached
   development.
Multi Family Residential (R-MF)
   12.1 – 24 du/ac
1) Typical development in this residential category would include duplexes,
   condominiums, townhomes and apartments. Small lot, detached
   residential units with a minimum 3,000 square foot lot size are also
   permitted if proposed as a part of a Specific Plan. If affordable housing
   is proposed for at least 20% of the units in the project, then per state law
   a density bonus of 25% will be granted, and a mix of for sale residential
   product types including single family homes, duplexes, condominiums,
   townhomes, and/or multi-family housing (projects that contain at least
   100 units) is permitted. A specific plan must be prepared.
2) Multi-family units are intended to be located near activity centers such as
   commercial and employment centers, major community facilities, and
   arterial corridors.
3) In order to achieve density beyond the 12.1 range the design of the
   community must encompass a variety of amenities to serve the project on
   site which may include, but are not limited to, the following:
   a. Child care facility;
   b. Paseos and trails;
                                                                                               3-13

     2) Offices and businesses providing professional services, including legal
         services, financial institutions, administrative and corporate offices,
         medical offices and clinics are also permitted in these areas.
     3) FARs at the upper end of this range are intended primarily for office type
         uses.
     General Commercial (C-G)
         0.1– 1.0 FAR
     1) The C-G designation is intended for retailing, wholesaling, and service

         services, financial institutions, administrative and corporate offices,
         medical offices and clinics are also permitted in these areas.
     3) FARs at the upper end of this range are intended primarily for office type
         uses.
     Regional Mixed Use (RMU)
         0.1 – 1.0 FAR for non-residential; 12-24 du/acre for residential
     Preferred Mix and Range of Uses: 10-30% retail; 5-15% office; 15-30% light
     industrial/business park; 25-35% residential; 4-6% public open space.
     1) Areas designated Regional Mixed Use are intended as centers for
         employment generating commercial and industrial uses. The General
3-14                                                           LAND USE ELEMENT

                                                                                3. LAND USE ELEMENT
   Plan has identified six opportunity areas within Fontana where this type
   of development pattern can be accommodated.
2) Projects developed under the RMU category must be minimum 20 acres
   in size, except if proposed east of Sierra and north of SR 210.
3) Specific development types allowed in RMU include: research and
   development facilities, general commercial uses, corporate business
   parks, service business offices, light manufacturing, warehouse retail,
   entertainment centers, hotels and convention centers, professional
   business offices, day care centers, and public open space.
4) Residential development at the Multi Family density designation is
   permitted if the residential development is part of a project developed
   with a Specific Plan.
5) Warehousing and distribution facilities are not permitted in this land use
   category. , except as provided for under a zoning overlay district for
   warehousing distribution/logistics type uses.
6) Distribution of uses within projects in RMU areas may deviate from the
   preferred mix and range of uses, depending on prevailing market
   conditions, so long as the most-case mix of uses is not exceeded, which
   would require supplemental environmental analysis.
7) This mix of uses can be accomplished: (1) as a combination of uses
   within a single structure, such as retail uses along the ground floor with
   residential or office uses on upper stories; or (2) as a combination of uses
   within a single parcel or group of parcels. The intent is to create vibrant
   activity centers where the function and design of uses are more
   integrated than in traditional single-use areas, which are oftentimes more
   isolated in nature.
Industrial Designations
Light Industrial (I-L)
   0.1-0.6
1) Development in I-L designated areas is intended to include employee-
   intensive uses, including business parks, research and development,
   technology centers, corporate and support office uses, ―clean‖ industry
   and supporting retail uses, auto, truck and equipment sales and related
   services.
2) High quality development is encouraged in these areas, developed to
   more stringent design standards than for uses allowed within the General
   Industrial district.
3) Specific uses to be implemented within projects in I-L areas may be
   evaluated on the basis of their compatibility with adjacent land uses.
                                                                                               3-15

     General Industrial (I-G)
        0.1-0.6 FAR
     1) Uses in this designation may include: manufacturing, fabrication,
        assembly, processing, trucking, equipment, automobile and truck sales
        and services.
     2) Specific uses to be implemented within projects in I-G areas may be
        evaluated on the basis of their compatibility with adjacent land uses.
     Public Designations
     Public Facilities (P-PF)
          0.1 FAR
     1) This designation identifies the locations of properties in public or quasi
        public ownership, such as existing schools; the facilities of public and
        quasi-public agencies such as the City, County water and sewer districts,
        and fire protection districts; and the locations of hospitals and quasi-
        public institutions.
     Recreation Facilities (P-R)
          0.1 FAR
     1) The P-R designation is used for regional and local parks, and any
        recreational facility operated by a public or quasi-public agency.
     Public Utility Corridors (P-UC)
     1) The P-UC designation is used to indicate locations in the planning area
        that contain easements for public utilities.
     Open Space Designations
        Open Space (OS)
     1) Areas, which for environmental reasons have been planned to remain in a
        natural condition, including the Jurupa Hills and the foothills of the San
        Gabriel Mountains bordering the National Forest, have been designated
        OS. The character of these areas is to remain natural.
     2) This includes areas which are in public ownerships and may have slopes
        of 20% or greater or be subject to wildfire.
     3) Permitted land uses in OS designated areas include quarries, flood
        control channels, ground water percolation basins and agriculture. Only
        structures related to the management of resources are permitted.
3-16                                                           LAND USE ELEMENT
                                                                                3. LAND USE ELEMENT
Overlay Designations
Boulevard Overlay
   0.1– 1.0 FAR for non-residential uses;
   7.7 – 24 du/acre for residential uses
1) The Boulevard Overlay is a flexible designation that is intended to apply,
   in conjunction with the underlying land use designations, on identified
   stretches of Foothill Boulevard, Arrow Highway, and Sierra Avenue.
2) The appearance and function of these major north-south and east-west
   boulevards is critical to the City’s image and
   economic health. To ensure the long-term
   viability and attractive appearance of these
   boulevards, the intent of this overlay designation
   is to encourage retail activity to cluster at major
   intersections. In the stretches between the retail
   nodes, non-retail uses such as offices, services,
   incubator/multi-tenant uses, mixed use and
   residential development are the preferred uses.
3) Residential development at the Medium and
   Multi Family densities is intended to locate in
   mid-block locations that are not viable for
   commercial/activity center type development. A
   minimum lot size of six contiguous acres, and a
   minimum project size of 100 multi family units per project, is required for
   multi family development. Single-family residential development such as
   townhomes or other forms of ―boulevard‖ style housing may also
   be developed at a density of 5 to 24 dwelling units per acre, and for
   projects less than six acres in size.
4) In order to facilitate the development transition along these corridors,
   incentives are provided to stimulate lot consolidation of small parcels
   and development of larger consolidated projects. The boundaries of the
   overlay designation are not precise: they can be adjusted to allow the
   development of projects of optimal size and configuration.
5) Specifically, this overlay seeks to:
   a. Encourage focused commercial development at key roadway
        intersections;
   b. Enhance flexibility in development by allowing for a complementary
        mix of higher density residential uses, professional offices, civic and
        institutional uses, and mixed-use projects that are compatible with
        those uses allowed by the underlying land use designation.
                                                                                               3-17

        c. Ensure compatibility between adjoining uses.
        d. Provide a critical residential mass to support corridor commercial
             uses.
     Activity Center Overlay
        0.1– 1.0 FAR for non-residential uses;
        7.7 – 24 du/acre for residential uses
     1) Activity Centers have been conceptually identified on Figure 3-4,
        General Plan Land Use. This depiction is not intended to indicate these
        centers’ ultimate size or precise location.
                           2) The Activity Center Overlay designation is
                               intended to stimulate the development of intimately
                               scaled activity centers within areas planned for
                               residential development from Baseline Avenue to
                               the northern border of the City. Activity Centers
                               are intended to accommodate a mix of land use
                               types serving only their surrounding residential
                               neighborhood.
                           3) Activity centers are generally located within a half-
                               mile of potential users, allowing for a comfortable
                               walking distance for most residents.
     4) Activity centers may be networked by multi-purpose trails and bicycle
        trails, with the purpose of linkage, as well as providing alternative means
        of transportation. Centers may also be linked to other adjacent or nearby
        recreational open space or educational or community facilities.
     5) Specific uses intended in these activity centers include: community
        serving retail commercial; professional offices, service businesses,
        entertainment centers, sales outlets, restaurants, day care centers,
        institutional, public and quasi public uses.
     6) Residential development at the Medium and Multi Family density
        designations is permitted within this designation, if the residential
        development is part of a project developed under a Specific Plan.
     7) The mix of uses should promote civic activity, define neighborhood
        character and provide focus, provide places for people to meet and
        socialize, and enhance an area’s overall quality of life.
     Downtown Overlay
     1) The overlay’s boundaries are Foothill Boulevard on the north, and
        Merrill Avenue on the south, Juniper on the west and Mango on the east.
3-18                                                          LAND USE ELEMENT

                                                                                  3. LAND USE ELEMENT
2) This overlay designation is intended facilitate the future redevelopment
     and revitalization of the Downtown area.
3) More focused and detailed policy direction for the overlay will be
     developed by the City as a follow-on to the General Plan update process.
PHYSICAL AND LAND USE SETTING,
CHARACTER AND GROWTH
The City of Fontana is set on an alluvial plain flowing southward from the
confluence of Lytle Creek and the San Sevaine wash. The San Bernardino
and San Gabriel Mountains to the north, and the Jurupa Hills to the south,
provide a dramatic backdrop for the developed areas of the City.
In the early 1900s, Fontana was a diversified agricultural community,
producing major commodities such as citrus, grain, grapes, poultry, and
swine. In 1942, the area began to transition to a more industrial base with the
founding of the Kaiser Steel Mill. By the 1950s, Fontana was the region’s
leading producer of steel and steel-related products. Much of the steel

was produced at the Kaiser Steel Mill in Fontana.
Today, Fontana is both a bedroom community, with a commuting population              This historic photograph
of workers, and, due to its suburban location near several major freeway and         provides a snapshot image of the
rail transportation corridors, is also a major Inland Empire hub of                  City of Fontana’s agricultural
warehousing and distribution centers. These uses are located primarily in the        past.
City’s southern half, adjacent to the Interstate 10 corridor. There is also
some concentration of these uses near Cherry Avenue and Baseline. Heavy
industrial areas surround the former Kaiser Steel plant (now California Steel)
within the City’s sphere of influence, and along the I-10 corridor between
Valley Boulevard and Slover Avenue. The California Speedway, a regional
entertainment attractor, is also located within the City’s sphere of influence,
south of Foothill Boulevard, and west of Cherry Avenue. This venue attracts
large crowds at the range of race events held there monthly, and particularly
at the two NASCAR Indy events held there each year.
A range of residential neighborhoods has developed in the City. The
established single and multi-family residential neighborhoods and
commercial core of Fontana is largely contained between Baseline and
Valley Boulevard. Newer residential development is occurring along the
northern edge of the City west of the I-15 freeway, and radiating north and
south of the SR 210 corridor. A large portion of Fontana, north of the SR
210 still remains to develop as a mix of planned communities and job
centers. In fact, nearly a third of the acreage within the City and its sphere is
vacant. Residential planned community development, together
                                                                                                                  3-19

      with some planned industrial uses, makes up the majority of the existing
     developed land use between Jurupa Avenue and the southern boundary of the
     City.
     The City of Fontana’s incorporated area encompasses 23,455 acres, or nearly
     37 square miles. The City’s sphere of influence adds another 9,973 acres, or
     15.5 square miles to the total planning area. The City’s sphere of influence is
     bounded on the north generally by Foothill Boulevard, and encompasses
     roughly the western half of the City from Foothill Boulevard to the I-10
     freeway, as well as large portions of the area between the I-10 and south to
     Jurupa Avenue. See Figure 3-3, Community Structure, for a conceptual
     visual depiction of the land use setting for Fontana’s planning area.
     Population & Employment Growth
     Fontana is a rapidly growing, dynamic community, and an increasingly
     powerful development center in the Inland Empire. The City experienced a
     35% increase in population within its incorporated boundaries in the period
     between 1990 and 2001, growing from 87,535 persons to 135,100 persons.
     This is significant as cities west of Interstate 15 experienced a lower 29.8%
     gain during the same period. The City experienced another 8% gain,
     increasing to a population of 145,770, in 2003. Fontana’s employment
     increased from 24,593 jobs in 1991, to 41,377 jobs in 2000. The City’s
     yearly job growth in 1999 and 2000 far exceeded the job growth rate of the
     Inland Empire as a whole. At build-out the City’s land use plan has the
     capacity to generate a 1.6 job-to-housing unit ratio.
     LAND USE PLAN DESCRIPTION
     Pattern of Land Use
     The distribution of planned land uses in the City of Fontana is mapped in
     Figure 3-4, General Plan Land Use. The summary of the land uses within the
     City’s plan is depicted in Table 3-2, Land Use Plan Statistical Summary:
     Residential Designations, and Table 3-3, Land Use Plan Statistical Summary:
     Non-Residential Designations, below. Build-out projections are also
     included below for residential dwelling units and the population they
     generate, and for the potential square footage of non-residential development
     and estimated jobs for non-residential land use designations.

Note:
1 Probable density factor is assumed to be the mid point of the density range for each category.
2 Adjusted gross acreages were derived by multiplying total acreage by 0.7(70%) to allow for streets and arterials, public facilities, open space and schools.
3 Projections of population by residential designation are based on a persons-per-household factor of 3.93 for the Residential Estate, Single Family Residential, Residential Planned Community, and Medium Density Residential
land use designations. For the Multiple Family Residential and Regional Mixed Use designations a persons-per-household factor of 3.19 was used. These factors were derived from statistics generated in the 2000 US Census
 of Population. This projection of population represents the mid-range of population that could be generated within this land use plan.
44.7 dwelling units per acre is the probable density factor used for development within the City Sphere of Influence designated Residential Planned Community. A probable density factor of 5.9 was used for areas with this
designation in the City incorporated area, in order to account for the fact that s specific plans already approved in this area were approved at a higher overall density than the mid-point of this range.

                                                                                3. LAND USE ELEMENT
As described earlier in this Element, the system of land use designations for
the City has been streamlined and simplified from that which was previously
used. Key changes include the addition of a multi family residential
designation to the City’s system in order to accommodate development at 12-
24 dwelling units to the acre. Additional areas have been identified as
appropriate for the Regional Mixed Use designation, and that designation will
allow the incorporation of residential development at the multi family density.
The area within the City’s sphere of influence previously designated for
Industrial Estate development, is now intended to transition to a solely Light
Industrial designation. The public facilities and commercial designations
have been simplified as well.
The pattern shown on the land use plan reflects existing development and the
anticipated future development in the City. The land use plan focuses non-
residential development potential around existing and new freeway
interchanges along Interstate 15 and on Interstate 10, as well as along SR
210. These areas can capture the largest traffic volumes moving through the
City and maximize sales potential, and can also use that access to put
products into the goods movement system serving the area.
Land Use Projections
The City’s planning area incorporates 16,620 total acres of residential land
uses, and 16,848 total acres of non-residential land uses. At the mid-point of
the density range for each residential land use designation, the land use plan
provides for 56,986 dwelling units to be developed in the incorporated City
and 10,207 dwelling units in the sphere of influence. Based on a factor of
3.93 persons per household for single family units, and 3.19 persons per
household for multiple family dwelling units, at the mid-point of the
allowable density range within the land use designations, this equates to a
projected population of 215,001 persons in the City and 40,075 persons in the
sphere of influence at build-out. However, taking into consideration the
minimum and maximum densities allowed within the land use designations,
the projected population that could be generated within this plan in the City
could range from 133,532 to 247,775 at build-out, and from 32,119 to 48,032
persons in the sphere of influence at build-out.
The land use plan also provides for total of 2,440 acres of community and
general commercial development (which could include development of
office uses), 8,150 acres of light and general industrial uses, and 1,086 acres
of regional mixed use development, which is intended to include a mix of
commercial, industrial and higher density residential development. At build
out the land use plan could generate 105,992 jobs

     using the probable intensity factors (FARs) for each non-residential land use
     designation.
     Vacant Land
     As of the fall of 2001, nearly 40% of the area within the City and its sphere
     of influence is vacant. This area includes lands that have been classified as
     agricultural by the San Bernardino County Tax Assessor as of 2001.
     According to the San Bernardino County Agricultural Commissioner’s
     records only a dozen nurseries and a small acreage of vineyards are still in
     production in the planning area. This vacant area totals more than 10,000
     acres, 8897 acres within the incorporated City boundaries, plus 2418 acres in
     the City’s sphere of influence. The majority of the vacant land in the City is
     located north of SR 210. Growth has already begun to occur north of SR 210
     with the development of Hunter’s Ridge, Summit Heights, Citrus Heights
     and Sierra Lakes, and will further be induced by this major east-west
     transportation corridor within the City. Environmental constraints that will
     require recognition and mitigation in that area as it develops include the
     potential location of endangered species, as well as seismic, flood and
     wildland fire hazard areas. Chapter 9, the Open Space & Conservation
     Element, and Chapter 11, the Safety Element contain more information about
     environmental constraints and physical hazards in the City of Fontana.
     In addition to the large open areas of the City still available for development
     in the north, scattered infill opportunities are located in the central core of the
     City, and significant development opportunity areas exist in its sphere of
     influence to the west and north, in a concentrated area south of Slover
     Avenue and east of Sierra Avenue, and south of Jurupa Avenue in the
     southeast corner of the City.
     ISSUES, GOALS, POLICIES & ACTIONS
     ISSUE #1: BALANCED LAND USES
     How can the City ensure that land uses in the community are balanced
     between residential, non-residential, open space and public facilities, so
     that the broadest range of our residents’ needs are met?
     Discussion: As indicated in the City’s vision statement, we desire that
     residents have the choice of living and working here. We recognize that
     balancing residential and job-producing land uses within the community
     increases the quality of life here, and is insurance that the community will
     remain economically and fiscally sound. We also recognize that the quality
     of the design of the community, as well as the amenities, services, schools,
     and parks and open spaces here all contribute to our ability to draw new
     residents, workers and businesses to our community, and to keep them here.
3-28                                                             LAND USE ELEMENT

                                                                               3. LAND USE ELEMENT
GOAL #1:
Land Use in our community is balanced between residential,
commercial, industrial, open space and recreational land uses that are
developed to high standards of quality and provide diverse economic,
social, and cultural opportunities for our citizens and those who wish to
invest here.
Policies:
1) Development shall be consistent with our land use plan and contribute to
     the maintenance of an economic base that provides high quality jobs for
     those who choose to both live and work in Fontana.
2) A variety of residential uses, product types, and densities shall be
     developed in Fontana to meet the housing needs of people with varied
     incomes and lifestyle choices.
3) New planned communities in our City shall be developed to high
     standards for site design and landscaping and shall incorporate and/or be
     linked with amenities such as community facilities, schools, parks and
     other forms of open space.
4) Activity centers identified conceptually on the Land Use Plan shall be
     the preferred form of development for residentially serving retail,
     services and entertainment uses, and shall incorporate open spaces for
     public gathering as well.
5) Areas designated as Regional Mixed Use on the Land Use Plan shall be
     developed with a mix of non-residential and residential uses responsive
     primarily to regional market and locational forces.
Actions:
1) Incorporate new provisions in the zoning code for mixed-use/multiple
     use development.
2) Create and adopt guidelines for mixed use development within the
     Activity Center overlay designation to augment the regulations provided
     in the Zoning Code.
3) Create and adopt guidelines for mixed use development within the
     Regional Mixed Use designation to augment the regulations provided in
     the Zoning Code.
4) Establish project review criteria that reward variety in development mix
     and product type, efficient use of land, high levels of amenity features,
     attention to quality details, and effective use of open space features as
     integral components of the development.

     ISSUE #2: LAND USE COMPATIBILITY
     How can we ensure that the diversity of land uses already developed in our
     community, and those still remaining to develop, support the quality of life
     of our residents and workers?
     Discussion: In a diverse City such as Fontana, with a mix of residential,
     industrial and commercial land uses, achieving compatibility between land
     uses can be a delicate balancing act. For example, the impacts of the
     trucking industry, so important to our economy, must be balanced with the
     needs of our residential communities. Residential and industrial land uses
     have already developed in close proximity south of Interstate 10 in Fontana,
     and further development of both types is planned. Site planning, orientation
     of uses on site, buffering between adjacent properties, and limitation of noise
     and emissions, will all be necessary to achieve compatibility of uses in south
     Fontana and address quality of life issues.
     Further, the diverse transportation system that serves our City is generally an
     asset to us through its road, highway and rail links. However, transportation
     corridors can have negative noise, odor, air quality and safety impacts on
     adjacent development, if they are not carefully managed. Our most
     significant transportation facilities – Interstates 10 and 15, and SR 210, are
     under the jurisdiction of Caltrans, the state highway agency, not the City of
     Fontana. This imposes a significant coordination responsibility on city and
     state officials so that local and regional needs are properly reconciled.
     Finally, the utility easements that traverse our City from northeast to
     southwest can serve an important purpose in buffering uses from each other,
     and can be used to link portions of the community together.
     GOAL #2:
     Quality of life in our community is supported by development that
     avoids negative impacts on residents and businesses and is compatible
     with, and enhances, our natural and built environment.
     Policies:
     1) New development with potentially adverse impacts on existing
          neighborhoods or residents such as noise, traffic, emissions and storm
          water runoff, shall be located and designed so that quality of life and
          safety in existing neighborhoods are preserved.
     2) Regionally beneficial land uses such as transportation corridors, flood
          control systems, utility corridors, and recreational corridors shall be
          sensitively integrated into our community.
     3) Infill development within existing residential neighborhoods shall be
          compatible with adjacent uses and enhance the local character.
3-30                                                             LAND USE ELEMENT

                                                                                3. LAND USE ELEMENT
4) Hillside development and development adjacent to natural areas at
     northern and southern edges of the City shall be designed to preserve
     natural features and habitat.
5) Multiple uses within utility easements shall emphasize open spaces but
     may accommodate more intensive uses to safely augment adjacent uses.
Actions:
1) Review City design guidelines to verify adequacy of impact rules and
     update them where necessary.
2) Review City design guidelines to insure that provisions are included for
     guidance of regional scale development, with special emphasis on
     buffering, open space linkages, mobility separation and aesthetics.
3) Adopt residential infill site design guidelines for application especially
     where the predominant neighborhood character is well established so that
     infill projects contribute to that character.
4) Review and amend hillside development standards and review/ amend
     the grading ordinance to require sensitive treatment of hillside
     development.
5) Administer a utility coordination program with utility providers to
     consolidate disruptions of public rights-of-way.
6) Coordinate with utility providers to determine which open space
     opportunities have potential and negotiate agreements accordingly.
7) Establish and maintain an ongoing liaison with the County of San
     Bernardino to influence their General Plan update within the City’s
     sphere of influence.
8) Establish and maintain an ongoing liaison with the County of San
     Bernardino to conform development projects within the City’s sphere of
     influence to the City’s General Plan.
9) Establish a program and schedule for conversion of the area formerly
     designated for industrial estates to planned industrial uses.
10) Administer a process for reviewing the design of residential projects
     adjacent to transportation corridors to ensure that they are appropriately
     buffered.
ISSUE #3: ONE FONTANA: UNIFYING OUR CITY
How can we ensure that our community is physically and aesthetically
unified, and has a consistent image and quality character?
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                   3-31

     Discussion: Several dominant physical features divide our City. Sectors of
     the community were developed at notably different points in time — and this
     will become more evident as time goes on. All of this lends to a diffusion of
     appearance.
     It is important to recognize that uniformity is not the goal. Rather, the intent
     is to accommodate a legitimate variation of development types and styles
     within an identifiable framework. While much of this is accomplished by
     policy direction in the Community Design Element, land use patterns and
     guidance play an important role in this regard.
     While development in our City has been positively influenced by the major
     transportation facilities that traverse our community, those same facilities
     have over time physically isolated portions of our City. The portion of our
     City located south of Interstate 10 is isolated from the rest of the community,
     the core of the City between Baseline Avenue and Interstate 10 is insular and
     relates to Sierra Avenue, and the portion of the City north of Baseline and
     particularly north of SR 210, has stronger physical connections to Rancho
     Cucamonga than to Fontana. The central core of the City does not function
     sufficiently as a center, a heart or a draw for all of the residents of the City.
     The views into our City from the transportation corridors that traverse or
     border also strongly influence public perception of our community.
     Consistently high standards of design must be applied to the edges of our
     City so that it is perceived as attractive and high quality. Entries into the
     community clearly mark Fontana’s territory and call attention to the quality
     standard expected here. Corridor design and landscaping are important
     contributors to the desired image.
     Overall community image is also strongly influenced by what goes on within
     the vast unincorporated territory within the City’s sphere of influence. This
     influence is so powerful in part because of the extensive county lands and in
     part because this territory lies along some of the important corridors linking
     Fontana to the regional transportation system. In short, it’s land that a lot of
     people see and associate with Fontana. Consequently, close coordination
     with the County has long been an important priority and will continue to be
     so.
     Finally, cutting across this entire topic, is the strong role played by our
     arterial highway system and the corridors it serves. They tie the entire
     community together and offer the primary means by which people
     experience the community as a whole. It is in the domain of this network
     that land uses, streetscapes and improvements can best convey a cohesive
     quality throughout our community without resorting to a boring – and
     impractical – uniformity.
3-32                                                              LAND USE ELEMENT

                                                                                  3. LAND USE ELEMENT
GOAL #3:
Our community is developing in a unified, orderly, logical,
environmentally sound manner, which ensures that the City is unified
and accessible to all residents, and results in economically sound
commercial areas, vibrant neighborhoods, and jobs rich centers.
Policies:
1) Areas adjacent to freeway and major arterial corridors shall be given
     special land use and development standards guidance.
2) Land uses within freeway and arterial corridors shall be arranged around
     focal points of varied sizes and configurations to convey a sense of
     distinctiveness.
3) Circulation system improvements shall continue to be pursued that
     facilitate connectivity across freeway and rail corridors.
4) Improvements shall be made to transportation corridors that promote
     physical connectivity and reflect consistently high aesthetic values.
5) Activity centers should be linked with residential neighborhoods and be
     accessible by multiple modes of transportation.
6) Annexations shall be pursued that promote Community balance, quality
     development, and improvement of the City’s economic base as follows:
     a. Annexations may be initiated by the City Council (adopted
          resolution) or by property owners or registered voters (written
          petition).
     b. Annexations should be initiated for unincorporated land that is
          contiguous to the City’s corporate boundaries that are desirous of
          City services, such as, police, street sweeping, graffiti removal, tree
          trimming, street improvements and maintenance, sewer availability,
          and other services provided by the City.
     c. A Plan for Services shall be prepared for all annexations and
          submitted to the City Council for review and consideration.
     d. A fiscal impact analysis shall be conducted for all annexation areas.
     e. Pre-zoning of a proposed annexation area shall be completed prior to
          submission of an annexation application to the Local Agency
          Formation Commission of San Bernardino County.
     f. Irrevocable Agreements to Annex shall be utilized when sewer
          service is extended outside the City’s corporate limits to an existing
          residence or an existing commercial or industrial establishment.
     g. Irrevocable Agreements to Annex shall be utilized when sewer
          service is necessary for new developments that are not contiguous to
          the City’s corporate boundaries; otherwise, annexation to the City is
          strongly urged.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                     3-33

        h. Pre-annexation agreements may be utilized for proposed
             developments or existing developments that are not contiguous to the
             City’s corporate boundaries. Pre-annexation agreements may be
             used to outline land use designations, development standards, condi-
             tional use permits approved by the County of San Bernardino,
             donation of right-of-way easements, sewer service, and other
             requirements, as necessary.
     Actions:
     1) Influence and adopt provisions of the I-10 Multi-jurisdictional Land Use
        Strategy and Program where they contribute to improving the quality and
        image of Fontana through this important window on the community.
     2) Review operation of overlay districts periodically to determine the extent
        to which they are achieving the desired land use patterns and intensities
        and make modifications as necessary to improve their effectiveness.
     3) Use the mandated annual report specified in the government code as a
        means of identifying where land use strategies reflected in the General
        Plan need to be strengthened or revised.
     4) Incorporate City identity generating projects in each annual budget cycle
        and capital improvement program to facilitate continuous progress
        toward the desired City image.
     5) Continue and expand the current annexation program to include, but not
        be limited to the following components:
        a. Respond to annexation requests on an ad hoc basis.
        b. If property lies outside the City limits, work with property owners to
             obtain right-of-way easements, in conjunction with obtaining
             property owner consent for annexation.
        c. Identify and pursue a logical phasing plan for annexation of parcels
             along Foothill Boulevard.
        d. Establish and meet with neighborhood committees comprised of
             interested property owners, residents and businesses, in regular
             meeting times and places in the unincorporated areas, to discuss the
             annexation process and benefits.
        e. Target unincorporated island areas and establish a ―neighborhood
             block‖ approach to annexation.
        f. Work with City lobbyist to revise legislation on the ―island
             provisions‖ in the government code to either increase acreage
             limitation or delete acreage limitation entirely.
        g. Seek annexation for contiguous properties at all times, particularly
             where development projects are proposed.
        h. Work closely with County Planning staff for pending development
             proposals that are contiguous to City boundaries; and develop
             annexation strategies at all times. If annexation is not feasible, hold
             in abeyance the irrevocable agreement to annex for sewer service,
3-34                                                           LAND USE ELEMENT

                                                                                3. LAND USE ELEMENT
          until the City-development standards are met.
6) Establish a signage program for determining the design, placement and
     financing responsibilities of City entry/welcome signs adjacent to
     unincorporated areas.
7) Work with Caltrans, San Bernardino County, and neighboring cities to
     ensure that functional and aesthetically pleasing design of transportation
     corridors is consistently implemented (see Action 1, above, related
     specifically to the I-10 corridor).
ISSUE #4: INFILL AND REVITALIZATION OF OUR
CORE AREAS
How can the City’s core developed areas be revitalized by a careful mix of
infill, revitalization, redesign and, where necessary, redevelopment?
Discussion: When approaching Fontana from outside the City, one strong
impression is that there is a lot of vacant land. That is certainly true in the
northern and western portions of our City. It is less so toward the central and
older sectors. What is more evident in those areas is that a number of land
parcels are simply underutilized: activity takes place there, but a lot of land
parcels and many buildings are simply not performing to their true potential.
This is accentuated by the fact that many of these land uses are poorly
maintained and convey an image of decline. That is particularly so in some
of the unincorporated areas within Fontana’s sphere of influence.
The net result of these conditions is that a considerable amount of
development potential remains in the City. This potential can be realized in
one or more ways:
          Vacant parcels scattered within existing development can be built
          upon;
          Existing development can be intensified and rehabilitated to become
          more productive;
          Existing development can be redesigned to become more
          contemporary and functional in its use of the land;
          Existing uses can be removed and replaced: redeveloped; or
          Some combination of these strategies where properties are
          characterized by a mix of conditions and potentials.
As growth pressures increase in the general area, property values increase
and quality expectations of citizens escalate. Land reserves represented by
vacant infill and underutilized parcels take on even greater importance.
Consequently, policies to guide this important community resource are a
critical part of Fontana’s development guidance system.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                   3-35

     This phenomenon is not new, and our City has been quite proactive in
     stimulating the development of residential infill parcels as well as
     refurbishing and updating some of the deteriorating housing stock.
     Non-residential areas, such as the commercial development along Sierra
     Avenue, Foothill Boulevard and Arrow Highway, are even more challenging
     to address because of the fact that so much commercially and industrially
     designated land in this general market area is available. Further, many of the
     land parcels are of a size, shape or location as to be difficult to develop in an
     efficient manner; and there is a great deal of market competition by nearby
     projects that are large, well designed and well established in the market
     place.
     This General Plan, therefore, contains a strong commitment to focusing
     economic development potential along key corridors and in selected activity
     centers at major intersections. This is accomplished through two overlay
     districts that augment provisions of standard zoning to allow market
     flexibility.
     One of the key strategies represented by the activity center and corridor
     overlay system in this Plan is simply to promote a clustering of related uses
     so that distinct, discernible ―places‖ of varied sizes, functions and complexity
     can emerge. By this means, economic activity can be stimulated to reinforce
     itself: achieving greater private sector profit, public benefit and sustainability
     over the long haul. Existing magnets for development can therefore be made
     much more attractive and, over time, achieve a desired living environment.
     The General Plan seeks to guide private and public energies and resources
     toward reversing these patterns and reclaiming the vitality that has been lost
     in these areas.
     GOAL #4:
     The quality of life and economic vitality in our City’s core areas are
     enhanced by strategic infill of new development and revitalization of
     existing development.
     Policies:
     1) Infill development shall be accorded a high priority in the commitment
          of City resources and available funding.
     2) Special incentives shall continue to be applied to revitalization of
          deteriorated housing stock, residential neighborhoods, major business
          corridors and employment centers.
     3) Where necessary to stimulate the desired mix and intensity of
          development, land use flexibility and customized site development
          standards shall be achieved through various master planning devices
3-36                                                            LAND USE ELEMENT

                                                                                 3. LAND USE ELEMENT
     such as specific plans, planned development zoning and creative site
     planning on individual building sites.
4) Clustering of development at key points with intermediate sectors of less
     intensive uses should be promoted along arterial corridors.
5) Assembly of parcels to allow for more efficient development patterns
     should be promoted wherever adjacent neighborhoods are not adversely
     impacted.
6) Code enforcement shall be used in coordination with all relevant City
     departments to reverse deterioration and achieve acceptable levels of
     development quality.
7) Aggressive collaboration with the County of San Bernardino shall be
     sustained to achieve acceptable development quality within Fontana’s
     sphere of influence.
8) Maintaining ongoing relationships with businesses, property owners and
     residents in designated infill areas shall be a priority for City staff.
Actions:
1) Review and update the City’s infill development ordinance on a regular
     basis to insure its effectiveness and focus its application in areas of
     greatest need.
2) Research and apply other tools that can be brought to bear on reversing
     deterioration, including but not limited to establishing maintenance fees
     on rental properties as a form of business.
3) Survey the area designated with the Boulevard Overlay designation to
     identify and set priorities on potential sites for assembly and
     revitalization, intensification or redevelopment.
4) Establish regular review dates for evaluating the effectiveness of the
     updated Zoning Ordinance in meeting revitalization objectives.
5) Review code enforcement resources and procedures to determine how
     and to what extent they need strengthening to meet the quality
     expectations expressed by this Plan.
6) Continue to support upgrading and replacement of the portion of the
     City’s housing stock that is aging and deteriorating, especially where this
     pattern is just beginning to emerge in neighborhoods.
7) Continue and intensify the coordination program for influencing County
     development policy/practices.

                                   ISSUE #5: REVITALIZING DOWNTOWN
                                   How can the City’s Downtown be reinvented so that it functions as a center
                                   for the community and attractive destination for residents and visitors?
                                   Discussion: The City’s Downtown has been identified on the Land Use Plan
       Without a strong and       with a Downtown Overlay extending from Foothill Boulevard on the north,
  inclusive heart, a city tends to to Merrill Avenue on the south, and from Juniper Avenue on the west, to
become a collection of interests   Mango Avenue on the east. Within this designation, the core commercial
  isolated from one another. It    area of Downtown stretches roughly to Arrow Boulevard on the north and
 falters at producing something
greater socially, culturally, and  Orange Way on the south. The boundaries of the overlay extend beyond the
economically than the sum of its   core commercial area in order to take in the Civic Center and other public
        separated parts.          facilities to the north and the Metrolink Station and senior housing
Jane Jacobs, The Death and Life    development to the south. The City’s vision for the Downtown calls for it to
     of Great American Cities      function as a lively destination within the City, and to be connected into the
                                   community and other civic destinations within the Downtown area. Our
                                   community recognizes the value of integrating a mix of land uses into what
                                   amounts to our ―main street‖ in terms of land values, rental rates, sales tax
                                   generation and less tangible, but no less important improvement in quality of
                                   life and sense of place here.
                                   To put this issue in perspective, it is important to note that many suburban
                                   communities have no recognizable downtown at all. They struggle to find a
                                   focal point that can perform unique functions within their community and
                                   serve as a symbol recognizable to citizens and visitors alike. Cities that have
                                   such focal points and have strengthened them uniformly benefit from this
                                   prominent community feature. Fontana is fortunate to have such a locale and
                                   must therefore seek to return it to prominence in the life of the City. Its value
                                   is functional, economic, and even psychological in the leverage it provides in
                                   stimulating a sense of community. Our challenge is not to create a
                                   downtown, but to re-energize the existing, historic downtown.
                                   GOAL #5:
                                   Our Downtown is a vibrant, pedestrian-friendly, economically healthy,
                                   safe, convenient and accessible district that serves as the true heart and
                                   focal point of the community.
                                   Policies:
                                   1) Downtown should be revitalized and redeveloped with a mix of uses
                                        attractive to broad segments of Fontana’s population that stimulates
                                        activity during day and evening hours, and on the weekend.
                                   2) New projects implemented in Downtown shall be designed and scaled to
                                        attract pedestrians and promote interest and life on the street.
                                   3) The physical connections among public and civic uses in and around the
                                        Downtown, and between Downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods,
   3-38                                                                                       LAND USE ELEMENT

                                                                                3. LAND USE ELEMENT
     shall be expanded and improved with custom design standards found
     only in the downtown area.
4) Downtown, its Metrolink Station and Transit Plaza, and the surrounding
     community shall be accessible and connected by multiple modes of
     transportation including pedestrian, bicycle, transit and automobile.
5) The residential neighborhoods that are connected to the Downtown shall
     be preserved and enhanced.
6) Special events and community celebrations should be focused, at least
     partially, on the downtown area to stimulate its role as a community
     focal point.
Actions:
1) Publish, disseminate and work toward the implementation of the
     guidance provided in the 2003 Downtown Economic Feasibility and
     Development study conducted for Downtown.
2) Complete a detailed land use and ownership survey of the Downtown
     Overlay area in order to identify opportunities for property consolidation
     and stimulation of new development projects.
3) Develop and initiate implementation of Downtown Overlay land use and
     design guidelines.
4) Establish a focused program for funding downtown improvements
     including, but not limited to grant funding from state, federal and
     foundation sources.
5) Develop a collaborative program with the Chamber of Commerce,
     downtown business interests, residents, property owners and investors to
     promote downtown revitalization.
6) Create and promote a downtown database that clarifies investment and
     development opportunities there and makes them available to the larger
     business community as a means of stimulating reinvestment.
7) Review and assess the existing and potential community activities and
     celebrations that could involve the downtown area and recommend
     priorities for action.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                   3-39
     ISSUE #6: PROVIDE A SAFE AND SECURE
     COMMUNITY
     How can we ensure that the physical design of residential, commercial and
     industrial developments in our community supports an environment that
     positively affects our residents and employed workers?
     Discussion: In a diverse City such as Fontana, with a mix of residential,
     industrial and commercial land uses, designing a safe community that
     reduces the incidence and fear of crime is paramount. This concept can be
     achieved by incorporating Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design
     (CPTED) to all new and amended development. CPTED encourages the
     creation of a defensible environment by addressing both physical and
     psychological aspects of crime by designing a physical environment that
     positively affects human behavior while reducing the opportunity for
     negative behavior and/or illegal acts.
     The goal of CPTED is to reduce opportunities for crime with physical design
     features that discourage crime while encouraging the legitimate use of the
     environment. CPTED strategies are guidelines anyone, including property
     owners, developers, and planners can apply to reduce the opportunity for
     crime and improve quality of life. CPTED principles can be applied
     relatively easily and inexpensively to structures and property and are
     encouraged within the City.
     The four overlapping CPTED strategies are: Natural Surveillance, Territorial
     Reinforcement, Natural Access Control and Maintenance.
     GOAL #6:
     Develop our community in a safe, defensible, unified, orderly and,
     environmentally sound manner, in order to facilitate a reduction in
     crime, resulting in a safer community.
     Policies:
     1) Residential, Commercial and Industrial development shall be designed in
         accordance with safe standards and CPTED principles.
     2) All development within the City shall be evaluated for safety and
         maintenance.
     Actions:
     1) All development within the City shall incorporate CPTED guidelines and
         practices into the design to the satisfaction of the Director of Community
         Development and the Chief of Police.
     2) The Chief of Police and Director of Community Development shall
         prepare, adopt, and maintain a CPTED guidelines manual that include
3-40                                                           LAND USE ELEMENT

     widely accepted professional principles for all development within the
     City.
3) Projects not in compliance with CPTED guidelines shall be considered

Chapter 4.                        Circulation
Element
INTRODUCTION
The Circulation element is one of seven mandated elements of the
General Plan and is intended to guide the development of the City's
circulation system in a manner that is compatible with the Land Use
Element. Due to the importance of a well planned circulation system, the
State of California has man- dated the adoption of a citywide Circulation
Element since 1955. The current State mandate for a Circulation
Element is found in Government Code section 65302(b), which states
that the General Plan shall include:
         “... a circulation element consisting of the general location and
         extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares,
         transportation routes, terminals, any military airports and ports,
         and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the
         land use element of the plan."
The anticipated level and pattern of development as identified by the
buildout of the Land Use Element will generate traffic demands on the
City's infrastructure system that must be accommodated by the
circulation system, transportation terminals, public utilities and facilities.
To help meet these demands and achieve balanced growth, the City has
adopted specific goals and policies, which serve as the basis for the
Circulation Element.
A Circulation element must take into account that increasing population,
energy shortages and the continued degradation of air quality are
producing profound changes in how we view both transportation
requirements and land development patterns.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Circulation and Land Use Elements mutually affect one another. The
nature, routing and design of circulation facilities are among the major
determinants of the form of human settlement and of the uses of the land.
City of Fontana General             Amendment No. 06-013 Resolution No. 2007-66                       4-1

    Conversely, land uses create a demand for circulation facilities. The
    goals and policies of the Circulation Element also have a direct
    relationship with the housing, open-space, noise and safety elements.
    State law requires consistency among all the elements of the General
    Plan.
    COMPONENTS OF THE PLAN
    Major Thoroughfares and Transportation Routes
    Classification of Streets
    For the purposes of analysis and evaluation of roadway needs, a roadway functional
    classification system has been established for the City of Fontana. These
    classifications are divided into Standard and Modified categories. Typical cross-
    section elements associated with each standard classification are shown in the City’s
    adopted Street Design Guidelines on file with the City Engineer. Street cross-
    sections that require deviation from the typical cross-sections are also shown in the
    City’s adopted Street Design Guidelines on file with the City Engineer. Modified
    cross-sections shall only be applicable to infill areas where substantial development
    exists with existing physical constraints, including street improvements. In no case
    shall the modified cross-section be less than the existing adjacent cross-section or
    the previously adopted cross-section for the street on this General Plan.
    Additional right-of-way dedication beyond the approved typical cross-section may
    be required in order to accommodate additional turn lanes in order to maintain
    acceptable levels of service per City requirements. The City has adopted Standard
    Intersection Geometry Layouts which are on file in the adopted Street Design
    Guidelines.
    The six roadway classifications are briefly described in the following paragraphs:
    Major Highways
    These roadways can accommodate six or eight travel lanes and may have raised
    medians. These facilities carry high traffic volumes and are the primary
    thoroughfares linking Fontana with adjacent cities and the regional highway system.
    Driveway access to these roadways is typically limited to provide efficient high
    volume traffic flow. Right of way (including sidewalks) on these facilities varies
    between 132 and 156 feet depending on the number of lanes. See the City’s adopted
    Street Design Guidelines on file with the City Engineer.
    Primary Highways
    These roadways are designed to accommodate four travel lanes with a median,
    within a typical 104-foot right of way, carry high traffic volumes and provide
    limited access. Their primary function is to link the major highways to the
    secondary highways as well as to carry vehicles entering and exiting the City from
    neighboring areas. Driveway access is also typically limited on these facilities,
4-2                                                          CIRCULATION ELEMENT

                                                                                 4. CIRCULATION ELEMENT
where feasible. See the City’s adopted Street Design Guidelines on file with the City
Engineer.
Secondary Highways
These roadways are typically four-lane streets, providing two lanes in each
direction. These highways carry traffic along the perimeters of major developments,
provide support to the major and primary highways, and are also through streets
enabling traffic to travel uninterrupted for longer distances through the City.
Secondary highways have a 92-foot wide right of way, which includes sidewalks.
See the City’s adopted Street Design Guidelines on file with the City Engineer.
Collector Streets
These roadways are typically two-lane streets that connect the local streets with the
secondary highways allowing local traffic to access the regional transportation
facilities. Collector streets have a 68-foot wide right of way. See the City’s adopted
Street Design Guidelines on file with the City Engineer.
Industrial Collectors
These roadways are typically two-lane streets, which are designed to accommodate
industrial traffic. Industrial collectors also have an 80-foot wide right of way, which
includes sidewalks. See the City’s adopted Street Design Guidelines on file with the
City Engineer.
Local Streets
These roadways are typically two-lane streets that designed to serve neighborhoods
within residential areas. There are several variations on local streets depending on
location, length of the street, and type of land use. These are illustrated in the City’s
adopted Street Design Guidelines on file with the City Engineer.
Public Transit
Bus Service
Public transportation in the Fontana area is provided by Omnitrans, the regional
Public Transit operator for San Bernardino County. Omnitrans functions as a joint
powers agency supported by the County of San Bernardino and all the cities in the
east and west San Bernardino Valley. The City of Fontana is represented on the
Omnitrans Board. Omnitrans is financed through the State Transit Development Act
and Urban Mass Transit Funds.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                        4-3

    Omnitrans service in Fontana is primarily oriented in the east-west direction,
    connecting the City to the adjacent communities of Rialto, San Bernardino and
    Colton to the east and Rancho Cucamonga, Ontario, Montclair, and Pomona to the
    west. A north-south connection across the I-10 freeway is provided on Sierra
    Avenue. A map of Omnitrans’ current services is provided in the Appendix C.
    Currently, Omnitrans provides service on 13 fixed routes in Fontana. Detailed
    descriptions of these routes and their major service areas are also listed and
    described in Appendix C.
    Demand/Response System
    Omnitrans provides Fontana residents that qualify for service under the Americans
    with Disabilities Act with a demand/response transportation system known as
    "Access." A resident may call and request a pick-up and delivery to a requested
    destination on a space-available basis with a reservation made 24 hours in advance.
    Short Range Transit Plan
    Omnitrans periodically updates its serviced plan through the preparation of a Short
    Range Transit Plan (SRTP), which evaluates service for a five-year period. A map
    of service proposals by Omnitrans in the SRTP is provided in Appendix C. The
    SRTP for the years 2004-2009 established the following routes within Fontana:
       Route 10 – The Route extends direct service from Fontana Metrolink station
        along Baseline Avenue to the 4th Street Transit Mall in San Bernardino.
       Route 14 – The Route extends direct service from Fontana Metrolink station
        along Foothill Boulevard to the east side of the City of San Bernardino.
       Route 15 – This route extends from the Fontana Metrolink station to Rialto, San
        Bernardino to Redlands Boulevard in Redlands.
       Route 19 – This route connects Fontana, Colton, Loma Linda, and Redlands.
       Route 20 – This route connects the Fontana Metrolink station and Kaiser
        Permanente hospital.
       Route 28 – This route connects the Kaiser hospital to other Kaiser facilities in
        southwest Fontana in Southridge Village.
       Route 29 – This route connects Fontana and Bloomington.
       Route 61 – This route connects Fontana, Ontario, and Pomona.
       Route 66 – This route connects Fontana and Montclair.
       Route 67 – The modified route will connect the Fontana Metrolink Station to
        the Ontario Civic Center and no longer serve Chaffey College.
       Route 71 – This route connects Fontana to the Ontario Mills Mall and other
        areas in the City of Ontario.

Commuter Rail
Commuter Rail service is provided by the Southern California Regional Rail
Authority (SCRRA), which operates the Metrolink train service.
In June 1990, the California Legislature enacted Senate Bill 1402, Chapter four of
Division 12 of the Public Utilities Code. The bill required the transportation
commissions of the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino
to develop jointly a plan for regional transit services within the multi-county region.
In August 1991, the Southern California Regional Rail Authority (SCRRA), a Joint
Powers Agency (JPA), was formed. The purpose of the newly formed SCRRA was
to plan, design, construct and administer the operation of regional passenger rail
lines serving the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and
Ventura. The SCRRA named the regional commuter rail system "Metrolink."
Today in 2007, Metrolink, in its 15th year of operation, serves over 44,000
passengers daily. There are seven lines in the Metrolink train network; the Ventura
County Line, Antelope Valley Line, San Bernardino Line, Riverside Line, Orange
County Line, Inland Empire-Orange County Line and 91 Line (Riverside-Fullerton-
Downtown LA). All but the Inland Empire-Orange County Line intersect at Union
Station in Downtown Los Angeles. The City of Fontana is served by the San
Bernardino Line, with a station located at Sierra/Orange Way. Of the seven
metrolink lines, the San Bernardino Line is most widely used and the Fontana
station is the fifth busiest station with recorded AM Peak Hour boardings of over
360 passengers.
The San Bernardino Line provides service seven days a week. On weekdays, there
are 16 round trips per day on the San Bernardino Line with about half of them
during commute hours, but with close to hourly service in the mid-day. Travel time
between Fontana and LA Union Station is about one hour and 15 minutes. On
weekends, there are ten round trips on Saturday and six on Sunday.
Terminals – Intercity Transportation
Buses
There are two existing bus transit terminals in the City of Fontana; the Fontana
Metrolink Station and the South Fontana Transfer Center. Both serve as locations
where numerous Omnitrans routes intersect with timed transfer opportunities (i.e.,
schedules of the routes are coordinated to facilitate transfers with limited waiting).
The Fontana Metrolink Transfer Center is located off-street at the southwest corner
of Orange Way and Sierra, adjacent to the Metrolink Station. Nine routes serve the
facility; Routes 10, 14, 15, 19, 20, 61, 66, 67, and 71. Restrooms and other
amenities for transit riders are provided at the Center.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                      4-5

    The South Fontana Transfer Center is an on-street facility located at the intersection
    of Sierra and Marygold, adjacent to the Kaiser Hospital. Seven routes intersect at
    this location; Routes 19, 20, 28, 29, 61, 71, and 90.
    Park-and-Ride
    A park-and-ride facility is located at Beech Avenue and the SR-210 Freeway.
    Access to and from the freeway for this park-and-ride facility is limited to buses and
    High Occupancy Vehicles (HOV) only. Another park-and-ride lot at the I-15/SR-
    210 interchange is proposed in the southeast quadrant of the interchange.
    Rail
    There is a rail terminal in the City of Fontana served by the Southern California
    Regional Rail Authority (SCRRA) which operates the Metrolink commuter rail
    system. The nearest public rail access for longer-distance passenger train service is
    at the Amtrak station located in San Bernardino.
    EXISTING CONDITIONS
    Existing Roadway Systems
    Fontana is served by three regional freeway facilities. The San Bernardino Freeway
    (Interstate 10) is an eight-lane east-west freeway, which traverses the southern
    portion of the City. The Ontario Freeway (Interstate 15) is an eight-lane freeway,
    which runs northeast-southwest through the northwest portion of the City and its
    sphere of influence. The newly opened Foothill (State Route 210) Freeway is a 6-
    lane freeway that runs east-west in the northern part of the City connecting Fontana
    with the Interstate 210 Freeway in Los Angeles County in San Dimas. This freeway
    currently is open from west to east up to Alder Avenue in Rialto, but is planned to
    be extended to the east to connect with the I-10 Freeway in the City of Redlands.
    Completion of this freeway is scheduled for the summer of 2007.
    Fontana benefits from a generally regular north-south/east-west grid system of
    streets, with many gaps to major streets due to physical or man-made barriers,
    namely at the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) and the I-10 Freeway. The City’s key
    north-south arterials include Sierra Avenue, Cherry Avenue, and Citrus Avenue, all
    of which have interchanges with I-10. Sierra Avenue is generally a four-lane
    divided arterial, which serves the primary commercial areas of the City. Cherry
    Avenue is a four-lane arterial (divided in some segments), which serves an industrial
    area west of the current City limits and has an interchange with I-15. Etiwanda
    Avenue, which also has an interchange with the I-10 Freeway, is the westernmost
    arterial in the City and its sphere of influence. Similarly, Alder Avenue is the
    easternmost arterial in the City and its sphere of influence.
    Key east-west arterials include Jurupa Avenue, Slover Avenue, Valley Boulevard,
    San Bernardino Avenue, Arrow Boulevard, Foothill Boulevard, Baseline Avenue,
    and South Highland Avenue. Valley Boulevard is a four-lane divided major arterial

                                                                                4. CIRCULATION ELEMENT
located immediately north of I-10 Freeway. San Bernardino Avenue and Arrow
Highway are regional arterials fronted by a mixture of uses. Foothill Boulevard
(Historic Route 66) is a four-lane divided arterial, which is fronted largely by
commercial developments. Baseline Avenue is improved to six lanes from Citrus
Avenue to the I-15 Freeway. South Highland Avenue (State Route 30) has been
reconfigured to serve as the southern frontage road to the State Route 210 Freeway.
San Bernardino Avenue, Arrow Boulevard, Baseline Avenue, Summit Avenue, and
Sierra Avenue provide interchange access to I-15. South of the I-10 Freeway,
Slover Avenue is the key alternative paralleling the freeway and Jurupa Avenue is
another key arterial that provides for east-west traffic movements. A map of the
City’s existing circulation network showing the number of lanes is included in the
Appendix C.
Analysis of Current Conditions
A comprehensive database of current average daily traffic (ADT) volumes for
streets and highways in the Fontana area was developed by collecting count data
from various sources including the City of Fontana, the County of San Bernardino,
and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). The arterial ADT
volumes are tabulated by arterial and major segment and presented in Table A in the
Appendix C. This table also indicates the designated functional classification and
total number of two-way lanes on each roadway segment. Key observations from
the assembled existing traffic volume data are also presented in Appendix C.
Intersections and Traffic Control/Operations System
There are currently a total of 150 intersections within the study area (city and sphere
of influence), which are controlled by traffic signals. Of these, a total of 122 are
controlled by the City of Fontana, seven by the County of San Bernardino, in the
sphere of influence area, and 14 are controlled by Caltrans. The Caltrans signals are
located at the on/off-ramp terminals along the I-10, I-15 and SR-210 freeways and at
the intersections on Foothill Boulevard, which is State Route 66. Of these traffic
signals, 37 are on the County CMP signalized intersection list. A graphic
illustrating the location of these intersections is included in the Appendix C.
The City of Fontana has a Traffic Management Center (TMC), located within the
City Hall complex, that provides monitoring and control of the City’s signal system
and its coordination with the regional and neighboring jurisdictions’ traffic control
systems. The Fontana Advanced Traffic Management Information System
(ATMIS) project that is currently being deployed by the City includes specialized
services related to the design of software and hardware for the TMC. These services
include procurement, integration, installation, and construction supervision for the
development of the TMC. The TMC software and hardware provide for the
expansion and control centralization of the City’s existing traffic control systems
and deployment of new and upgraded ITS elements. A major component of the
ATMIS project is development of the software that includes a GIS-based graphical
user interface and software for the connection to the Caltrans ATMS. This software
provides for centralized monitoring and control of all deployed field elements from
the operator’s workstation. The ATMIS project started through an extensive systems
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                       4-7

    engineering design cycle and started with an analysis of the needs and requirements
    for the TMC and a connection to local Caltrans District 8. Deployment of the TMC
    elements and communications subsystem has been phased to provide for current and
    future needs.
    According to the City of Fontana’s Traffic Signal System Conceptual Buildout Plan,
    approximately 140 additional traffic signals are planned to be constructed within the
    City and the Sphere of Influence area by the buildout of the Master Plan.
    A detailed discussion of the City’s major intersections, types of control, jurisdiction,
    volumes, and levels of service was completed in a Focused Traffic Study, which
    was conducted per SANBAG Congestion Management Program guidelines and is
    available under a separate document.
    Daily Traffic Levels of Service
    A generalized daily level of service analysis was conducted for existing conditions
    for the City’s arterial system using the ADT volumes presented in the previous
    section. Level of service analysis is used to evaluate congestion and delay on streets
    and highways. The relative level of congestion is evaluated on a scale from A
    through F. Level of Service A indicates free-flow conditions with no delay. Level of
    Service F indicates breakdown of the system with very long delays. Level of Service
    D is typically considered the worst acceptable level in an urbanized area.
    Level of service analysis is typically conducted for peak hour traffic conditions at
    street intersections, which is where street capacity is constrained. For a citywide
    study of this nature, where peak hour data at each intersection are not available, the
    level of service is estimated based on the total daily traffic volume. Experience has
    shown that, taking intersection capacity constraints into account, and assuming a
    typical 10% peak hour peaking percentage, a divided arterial (opposite directions
    separated by a raised median or a painted two-way left-turn) can accommodate
    approximately 9,000 vehicles per lane per day, and an undivided arterial (opposite
    directions separated only by a painted line) can accommodate approximately 6,000
    vehicles per lane per day.
    The relationships between the traffic volume, capacity and level of service are
    shown below:
             Volume is 0-60% of capacity: Level of service A
             Volume is 61-70% of capacity: Level of service B
             Volume is 71-80% of capacity: Level of service C
             Volume is 81-90% of capacity: Level of service D
             Volume is 91-100% of capacity: Level of service E
             Volume is over 100% of capacity: Level of service F
    The capacity of each arterial street was calculated using the above assumptions, and
    compared with the existing traffic volume to determine the level of service. This
    information is also presented in detail in Table A in the Appendix C. Assumed daily
4-8                                                          CIRCULATION ELEMENT

                                                                                4. CIRCULATION ELEMENT
capacities, volume/capacity ratios and corresponding levels of service are presented
by each arterial segment in this table.
Traffic on most of the City's arterials is operating at very acceptable levels of
service. The following paragraphs describe those arterial segments that show level
of service D or worse for the existing condition:
    Sierra Avenue (Merrill Avenue to I-10) – This segment of Sierra Avenue has
     a mix of LOS E and F. Sierra Avenue is a four-lane divided arterial (five lanes
     south of San Bernardino Avenue) serving the main commercial core of Fontana,
     and carries the heaviest traffic volumes in the City in the range of 32,800 to
     57,600 ADT. The actual peak hour level of service along Sierra may be better
     than E, since the peak hour volume is less than 10% of the total daily traffic.
     However, the important observation of this analysis is that this segment of
     Sierra experiences congestion at the present time, and because much of the
     commercial development has occurred close to the right-of-way, there is little
     opportunity for increasing the capacity of Sierra Avenue without major street
     widening.
    Sierra Avenue (at I-15 Freeway) – Relatively high volumes on Sierra Avenue
     at the I-15 freeway interchange cause congested conditions in both the AM and
     PM Peak Hours. Proposed signalization/widening at the ramps and the
     widening and realignment of Riverside Avenue and Sierra Avenue will improve
     traffic flow.
    Cherry Avenue (Valley to I-10 Freeway) – This segment exhibits LOS F
     conditions due to heavy freeway access volumes and predominance of trucks.
    Cherry Avenue (Slover to Santa Ana) – This segment operates at LOS F, but
     only has two lanes while carrying over 17,000 ADT and high volumes of trucks.
     Proposed widening of Cherry Avenue to six lanes will improve this condition.
    Citrus Avenue (Valley to Slover) – In this segment, Citrus Avenue carries
     between 22,000 and 29,000 vehicles in a mostly two-lane street, which results in
     LOS F operation.
    Citrus Avenue (Arrow to Merrill) – Traffic volumes in this segment are about
     28,000, while this 4-lane segment has a daily capacity of 24,000, resulting in
     LOS F. A proposed median construction project will improve this condition.
    Citrus Avenue (Randall to San Bernardino) – Traffic volumes in this
     segment are about 22,300, while this 4-lane segment has a daily capacity of
     24,000, resulting in LOS E.
    Valley Boulevard (east of Sierra) – This segment of Valley Boulevard carries
     33,000 ADT and is Level of Service E. A significant portion of this traffic is
     generated by the commercial traffic on all sides of the intersection as well as
     heavy freeway access traffic. The intersection of Valley Boulevard and Sierra
     Avenue is by far the heaviest traveled intersection in the City.
    Slover Avenue (Sierra to Locust) – Slover Avenue carries between 10,000 and
     18,000 vehicles per day on a two-lane exhibiting mostly LOS F conditions.
     Conditions are also worsened by the presence of large volumes of trucks.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                       4-9

         Foothill Boulevard (Beech to Almeria) – This segment carries 32,900 ADT on
          a 4 lane street resulting in LOS E.
         Jurupa Avenue (Live Oak to Sierra) – This segment carries between 10,900
          and 18,000 ADT, exhibiting LOS E and F conditions. Jurupa Avenue carries
          significant freeway bypass trips due to its interchange with I-15 and its
          connection to Riverside through Sierra. Traffic volumes are high on this
          segment for its two-lane configuration.
     Current Deficiencies
     Major Traffic Congestion Areas
     The level of service analysis as presented above and detailed in Table A in the
     Appendix C, indicates several key existing problem areas, as discussed below:
         The first (and most significant) occurs on Sierra Avenue from I-10 to San
          Bernardino Avenue, and on Valley Boulevard east of Sierra. This is the highest
          volume intersection in the City, experiencing more than 90,000 entering
          vehicles on an average day. The area has the highest concentration of
          commercial developments, traffic from institutions such as Kaiser Hospital and
          the freeway access traffic. The improvements to the I-10 interchange have
          recently been completed upgrading this interchange to a single-point urban
          interchange, which should help ease congestion problems on Sierra Avenue.
         The second problem area includes all of the arterials approaching I-10 from the
          north and south. Traffic converges on Sierra, Citrus, and Cherry to access the
          freeway. All three of these streets presently carry heavy traffic volumes on the
          north side of I-10 exacerbated by high volumes of truck traffic from industrial
          developments. It is therefore unlikely that these interchanges could
          accommodate the traffic from significant new amounts of development north of
          the freeway unless the street capacities are increased or alternate routes are
          provided. As noted above, there is limited potential for widening Sierra Avenue
          north of I-10, but existing development would not appear to preclude widening
          Citrus and Cherry. In addition to improving these interchanges, new freeway
          connections and over-crossings are also essential to ease traffic congestion and
          help community connectivity
         The third significant area of congestion is on Jurupa Avenue from Live Oak to
          Sierra and to the east as indicated above. This is due to heavy freeway bypass
          traffic and lack of capacity on the two-lane Jurupa Avenue.
     Through Traffic Problems
     Traffic congestion on Sierra Avenue throughout its length results in spillover of
     traffic onto parallel streets. To avoid the congestion on Sierra Avenue, many drivers
     utilize either Juniper Avenue (west of Sierra) or Mango Avenue (east of Sierra) for
     north-south travel through much of the City. Juniper and Mango are both relatively
     continuous two-lane collector streets, except between Foothill Boulevard and

highways. Juniper carries as many as 11,000 vehicles daily, and Mango carries as
many as 9,500.
Both Juniper and Mango are primarily fronted by residential developments. The
residential character of these streets is basically incompatible with the increasingly
heavy traffic volumes. A policy decision should be made regarding the character of
these streets over the long term, such as turning them into one-way streets.
Trucks
Designated Truck Routes
The many industrial facilities within Fontana and neighboring communities create
significant truck travel. The location of these industrial facilities results in a high
volume of trucks intermixing with local residential traffic. These truck trips
originate from the I-10, I-15, SR-210 and SR-60 freeways, as well as the
neighboring communities via the arterials. Many of the arterials are not
appropriately designed to accommodate the volume and size of trucks currently
using these facilities. Heavy truck volumes at the freeway interchanges along the I-
10 Freeway contribute to the congestion at those locations. The new and redesigned
freeway interchanges are being designed to better accommodate the heavy truck
volumes.
To optimize the circulation pattern and protect the residential areas within Fontana,
certain arterials have been designated as truck routes. These arterial truck routes are
illustrated in Figure 4-2, Designated Truck Routes, and should be designed in
accordance with their roadway classification.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                          4-11

It is also advisable to design the heaviest truck volume streets with larger curb return
radii, such as 50-foot radius, and median islands set back from the intersections to
accommodate truck turning maneuvers.
It should be noted that Sierra Avenue, between Valley and Foothill Boulevards,
north of I-10, has not been designated as a truck route due to the need to maximize
this roadway's capacity, especially in light of projected traffic volumes.
Cherry and Citrus Avenues have been designated as truck routes because they are
close to trucking centers. For the most part they provide direct connections between
the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10) and the Foothill Freeway (SR-210) and there is
more opportunity for roadway widening to accommodate the increased size and
number of vehicles. Again, particular attention should be paid to minimizing the
noise and air quality impacts of these vehicles upon adjacent residential uses. Other
north-south truck routes include Etiwanda Avenue and portions of Alder Avenue,
and Sierra Avenue north of SR-210.
Railroads
Rail Service
Both freight and passenger rail services are provided in the City. The Metrolink
commuter rail service was described earlier. It is located on the former Santa Fe rail
line, now operated by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF), which passes east-
west through the City between Arrow Boulevard and Merrill Avenue. Amtrak
service is provided on the Union Pacific rail line just south of the I-10 Freeway, but
the nearest station is in San Bernardino. The roadway crossings on the Union
Pacific main line are all grade separated because of the close proximity of the line to
the freeway. All of the roadways that extend over the freeway remain elevated over
the railroad tracks. The Metrolink/BNSF line has all at-grade crossings, except at
Cherry Avenue.
Extensive freight rail service is provided within the City. The existing land use plan
concentrates industrial use in locations already served by rail spur lines. With the
influx of new industrial developments in the City, it is desirable that these new
developments have access to the rail spur lines.
Rail service provided by the Union Pacific Railroad on its main line through
Fontana is expected to grow significantly in the future due to the increased
international trade at the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, as well as
population growth in southern California. Currently there are 24 trains per day on a
peak day passing through Fontana on the UP main line. By 2025, this is forecast to
increase to 132 trains per day. The BNSF main line runs through Riverside County
and crosses the UP line in Colton. It will carry the major growth in rail traffic
associated with the Ports. Growth in train traffic on the other rail lines and spurs in
Fontana will be limited to the needs of the local industrial users which need rail
service.

     PROJECTED TRAFFIC VOLUMES
     Focused Travel Demand Model
     As part of this circulation system analysis, a focused travel demand model was
     developed to analyze the traffic impacts of projected development within the City at
     “buildout” of the proposed General Plan land uses. The latest version of the
     RIVSAN CTP Model was obtained from SCAGs Inland Empire Office. This model
     currently has a year 2000 base-year and year 2030 as regional horizon year for the
     future. Approximately 40 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in this model constitute the
     City of Fontana and the Sphere of Influence (study) area. These zones were
     disaggregated to approximately 120 TAZs for planning purposes. In coordination
     with the General Plan team and City staff, land use quantities (in acres) were
     estimated for the Buildout conditions of the study area for each of the TAZs. These
     land use quantities were then converted to socio-economic data compatible with
     inputs to the CTP Model using sub-regionally acceptable average factors and mid-
     point densities for each land use type. These model input data include the number
     of single and multiple dwelling units, population, retail and total employment. The
     CTP model highway network was also obtained from SCAG and refined by adding
     secondary and collector streets and zonal connectors to represent a more detailed
     network consistent with the finer zone system. Zone maps showing the original and
     disaggregated TAZs, the list of input data (Table B), and the original and refined
     highway networks are provided in the Appendix C.
     The model input data for the disaggregated TAZs were submitted to SCAG Inland
     Empire Office. From these data, SCAG generated trips for all study area zones and
     substituted for the original study are TAZs. The model was run using these new
     buildout trips in the project area and the estimated 2030 trips from all other zones in
     the model representing the southern California region. Trip generation, distribution
     and mode choice functions for the model were carried out by SCAG and the four-
     period trip tables (AM, PM peak, mid-day and night-time) were provided to the
     General Plan team. The team performed traffic assignments for all four periods and
     combined them to generate total daily volumes. These daily volumes were assigned
     to the City of Fontana’s future planned circulation network. The results were
     analyzed in detail and entered into a table similar to the existing conditions analysis.
     These projected buildout condition volumes are also indicated in Table A in the
     Appendix C, along with the future classification, number of lanes and capacities for
     each roadway segment. Similar to existing conditions, projected volumes were
     divided by the assumed future capacities to identify the future volume/capacity
     ratios, LOS, potential future capacity deficiencies and expected congestion
     problems. Results of this analysis are also shown in Table A in the Appendix C.
     Buildout Traffic Forecasts and Operating Conditions
     The following paragraphs illustrate the key observations from the analysis of
     projected traffic conditions for the buildout of the General Plan:
4-16                                                          CIRCULATION ELEMENT

                                                                                   4. CIRCULATION ELEMENT
    The I-10 Freeway is projected to carry between 200,000 to 250,000 daily trips
     within Fontana.
    SR-210 and I-15 are also projected to carry close to 200,000 daily trips each in
     the vicinity of the study area.
    Similar to existing conditions, the north-south arterials are expected to be more
     heavily traveled and congested than the east-west arterials. This is generally
     due to the fact that there are more east-west streets, more freeways to carry the
     regional trips, and more continuity than the north-south streets.
    With the completion of the SR-210 Freeway, it is expected that volumes on the
     parallel arterials will still increase, but will remain well within their buildout
     capacity. For example, projected volumes on Baseline Avenue and Highland
     Avenue may increase by as much as 250% to 300%, but the levels of service are
     expected to generally be no worse than LOS C on these arterials.
    Foothill Boulevard, Merril Avenue, Arrow Boulevard, Randall Avenue and San
     Bernardino Avenue are expected to experience only moderate growth in traffic,
     generally in the range of 25% to 50% on the highest growth segments. These
     arterials are expected to operate well within acceptable conditions.
    With the development of the land uses in the City’s northern portion, traffic
     volumes in this area are expected to increase substantially. Traffic on Sierra
     Avenue near the SR-210 Freeway is expected to be as high as the volumes near
     the I-10, both being around 70,000 to 72,000 ADT. The projected increases in
     ADT on Sierra Avenue are expected to be as much as 600% to 700% from
     today’s volumes.
    Alder Avenue is expected to carry heavy traffic volumes from I-10 to Randall
     Avenue, which will potentially exceed the capacity of its ultimate 4-lane
     configuration.
    Cherry Avenue, Citrus Avenue, and Sierra Avenue will experience heavy
     volumes and congested conditions near the SR-210 Freeway, suggesting the
     need for additional freeway crossings.
    In the City’s southern portion considerable growth in traffic volumes is expected
     surrounding the I-10 Freeway. In particular demand for crossings of I-10 is
     expected to increase substantially as well as the demand for travel on Valley
     Boulevard, which could be as high as 42,000 east of Citrus.
    Jurupa Avenue is expected to experience more than 100% growth in traffic
     volumes, but is expected to operate acceptably with the ultimate capacity
     provided by the 4 to 6 lane configuration.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                          4-17

     RECOMMENDED SYSTEM
     IMPROVEMENTS
     General Policies
     As demand for the City's major arterials increases, limiting interruptions to smoothly
     flowing traffic becomes even more important. Reducing the number of vehicles
     slowing in traffic to enter driveways by instituting a policy to consolidate driveways
     and limit access off major arterials is one way of accomplishing this. Replacing
     many individual driveways with a central mid-block access with connections
     between center’s parking areas provides off-street circulation of slower vehicles,
     while traffic along major arterials continues at increased speeds. The City has
     initiated Access Management strategies with all new development. Candidates for
     this type of limited access policy include Sierra Avenue, Citrus Avenue, and Cherry
     Avenue, between I-10 and the SR-210, and South Highland Avenue, Baseline
     Avenue, Foothill Boulevard, Valley Boulevard and Slover Avenue.
     In addition, bus turnouts should be provided where feasible along these arterials to
     aid traffic flows and safety by removing stopped vehicles from travel lanes, thus
     eliminating a momentary loss of capacity. Typically, bus turnouts are located at
     one-mile intervals.
     In order to alleviate existing and potential future congestion on arterial approaches
     to freeway interchanges, it is recommended that arterial segments that are located
     between freeway ramps and the next parallel facility, on either side of the freeway,
     be planned with one additional lane in each direction beyond their designated
     functional classifications. These lanes will function as “auxiliary lane” for more
     freeway access capacity and more efficient traffic flow between the ramps and the
     adjacent intersections and can serve as dedicated right-turn lanes at the next
     intersection.
     System Improvements
     The recommended future arterial street classifications and new connections are
     presented in Figure 4-3, Recommended Circulation Master Plan. These
     recommendations were developed based on discussions with City staff, existing
     system uses, identified existing congestion problems, and projected future traffic
     volumes and potential deficiencies, as discussed in previous sections.
     To provide for continuous traffic flow throughout the City and to and from the City
     and the neighboring areas, a series of roads and road segments are recommended for
     construction. These recommendations are listed in Appendix C.
     In addition to arterial connections and upgrades, additional crossings of the local
     freeways are anticipated. These include two interchanges with I-10 Freeway, one at
     Alder Avenue and one at Beech Avenue. Both locations are recommended to have
     full interchanges with the I-10 Freeway. Due to the projected traffic volumes at
4-18                                                         CIRCULATION ELEMENT

                                                                                   4. CIRCULATION ELEMENT
current interchange locations and the fact that existing ADT on Sierra Avenue north
of I-10 is currently over capacity and will worsen in the future additional parallel
interchange facilities are recommended. This entire north-south corridor from
Etiwanda Avenue to Alder is in critical need for north-south capacity and
connectivity. The present congested conditions will significantly worsen if
additional freeway interchanges and grade separations are not provided across the I-
10 freeway and the Union Pacific Railroad tracks.
The proposed interchange at Alder Avenue should alleviate some of the congestion
at Sierra Avenue in addition to serving planned residential and commercial land uses
in this area. A proposed Beech Avenue interchange is expected to alleviate
anticipated congestion at both Cherry Avenue and Citrus Avenue. In addition there
are existing ramps at this location north of the freeway that were formerly used as a
roadside rest. These ramps may be useful as part of a future park-and-ride facility,
with potential direct access to the future carpool lanes on the I-10 Freeway.
In addition, freeway over-crossings (no interchange ramps) are also recommended at
Mulberry Avenue and Cypress Avenue for enhanced community connectivity and
relief of potential over-capacity conditions at the other I-10 interchanges along the
corridor. Also Poplar Avenue is proposed to have an over-crossing at the I-10
Freeway.
Currently, Cypress Avenue is designated as a 4-lane secondary highway to be built
over the recently completed SR-210 Freeway. This segment is planned to connect
South Highland Avenue to Sierra Lakes Parkway in the future. Almost the entire
area bounded by Citrus Avenue and Sierra Avenue to the east and west and Sierra
Lakes Parkway and South Highland Avenue to the north and south is designated as
freeway-oriented commercial land uses in the General Plan.
Cypress Avenue is projected to carry between 6,000 and 8,000 daily vehicles in this
area. The aforementioned commercially designated land uses are projected to be
very traffic intensive and will require an adequate circulation network for support.
Traffic projections have also indicated that Sierra Avenue will carry nearly 68,000
ADT over the SR-210 Freeway, while Citrus Avenue will carry over 52,000 ADT in
this area. Both Citrus and Sierra have interchanges with the SR-210 freeway and
will be used for regional as well as local circulation traffic. The projected volumes
on Sierra and Citrus crossing the SR-210 Freeway indicate traffic operation by as
much as 20% over capacity for future conditions. This segment of Cypress in this
traffic intensive area will serve as a vital circulation link for both local and regional
traffic as well as to provide a critical community connectivity link across the SR-
210 Freeway. Based on the above, it is recommend that Cypress Avenue be
extended over the SR-210 Freeway as a 4-lane secondary arterial with no
interchange ramps.

     ISSUE #1 MAJOR THOROUGHFARES AND
     TRANSPORTATION ROUTES
     Discussion: The City’s major thoroughfares and transportation routes, which are
     the network of local and arterial streets, should be designed such that they will
     provide the necessary hierarchy and capacity for local property access, intra-city
     travel and adequate access to regional transportation facilities. The arterial street
     system should provide adequate capacity to accommodate the traffic generated from
     the buildout of the proposed general Plan land uses and regional traffic within
     acceptable levels of service. The arterial system should provide seamless
     connectivity among all sub-areas of the City. Advanced technologies in traffic
     control and operations should be employed to maximize the capacity and efficiency
     of the arterial system.

     roadway capacity by requiring traffic studies to identify local roadway and
     intersection improvements necessary to mitigate their traffic impacts.
5) Locate new development and their access points in such a way that traffic is not
     encouraged to utilize local residential streets and alleys for access to the
     development and its parking.
6) Design, monitor traffic flow, and employ traffic control measures, including
     signalization, limiting access and access control, exclusive right and left turn-
     turn lanes, lane striping, and signage to ensure City streets and roads continue to

27) The City shall adopt and periodically update Street Design Guidelines
     outlining/identifying all street cross sections (standard and non-standard) and
     intersection cross sections within the City of Fontana. Street cross sections vary
     throughout the City as a result of adoption of specific plans, community plans,
     annexation of County areas, or as dictated by existing development constraints.
     These guidelines shall be maintained and updated at the discretion of the City
     Engineer.
ISSUE #2 PUBLIC TRANSIT, TERMINALS AND
INTERCITY TRANSPORTATION
Discussion: Public transportation plays an important role in providing a well-
balanced transportation system for the City. A well planned and efficient public
transportation system provides an essential primary mode of transportation to those
without access to automobiles and an alternative mode of travel to the motorists to
help reduce the demand and congestion on the City’s street network. The various
modes of public transportation including bus, commuter rail, demand responsive
transportation, etc. should provide efficient connectivity and integration via
coordinated park-and-ride facilities and multi-modal terminals.
GOAL # 2
A regional network of multi-modal transportation facilities including an
improved citywide public transit system is provided that ensure the safe and
efficient movement of vehicles, people and goods throughout the City of
Fontana and to and from the region, and provides mobility to all City residents
and helps reduce vehicular trips City-wide.
Policies
1) Provide appropriate transportation terminal facilities for inter-city and regional
     travel by public and private transportation modes.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                       4-25

     2) Continue to support the regional bus system to provide intra-city service, inter-
         city service to major employment centers, and connection to other regional
         transportation transfer points.
     3) To encourage transit ridership and transportation demand management
         including carpooling, required vanpool parking spaces, plan for the provision of
         additional transportation centers to be used as a park-and-ride for ridesharing,
         high-occupancy vehicle lanes, regional bus and passenger rail services.
     4) Continue to coordinate transit planning with the Southern California Association
         of Governments (SCAG), the San Bernardino Associated Governments
         (SANBAG), the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
         (MTA), the Southern California Regional Rail Authority (Metrolink),
         Omnitrans and adjacent communities.
     5) Recognize alternative and private transportation services (vans, buses, shuttles,
         taxis and limousines) as an integral part of public transportation.
     6) Coordinate with local and regional human service agencies and public schools
         that provide mass transit services to reduce duplication of transportation
         services.
     7) Where needed and appropriate, require new development to provide transit
         facilities and accommodations, such as bus shelters and turn-outs, consistent
         with regional agency plans and existing and anticipated demands.
     8) Ensure accessibility of disabled persons to public transportation facilities and
         services in accordance with all Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
         regulations.
     9) Encourage commuters and employers to reduce vehicular trips by offering
         incentives such as reduced price transit passes and preferential parking for
         ridesharing.
     10) Investigate and implement new opportunities to further plan, develop and
         finance demand responsive transit service for the elderly, handicapped and
         recreational purposes.
     ISSUE #3 TRUCKS
     Discussion: Truck traffic is a significant component of the overall transportation
     system in the City of Fontana. Many of the City’s vital industries rely heavily on
     regional and local truck transportation. Large volumes of heavy duty trucks on the
     City’s transportation system and regional access facilities result in additional
     congestion and accelerated deterioration of the infrastructure.

                                                                                  4. CIRCULATION ELEMENT
GOAL #3
A circulation system is provided that reduces conflicts between commercial
trucking, private/public transportation and land uses.
Policies
1) Provide designated truck routes for use by commercial trucking that minimize
     impacts on local traffic and neighborhoods.
2) Provide appropriately designed roadways for the designated truck routes
     including designated truck routes for large STAA trucks that can safely
     accommodate truck travel.
3) Develop appropriate protection measures along truck routes to minimize noise
     impacts to sensitive land uses including but not limited to residences, hospitals,
     schools, parks, daycare facilities, libraries, and similar uses.
4) Encourage the development of adequate on-site loading areas to minimize
     interference of truck loading activities with efficient traffic circulation on
     adjacent roadways.
ISSUE #4 RAILROADS
Discussion: Freight and passenger rail system have been an integral part of the City
of Fontana’s transportation network for decades. Increased traffic demand on the
rail system as well as the City’s street network will create opportunities for
increased conflict between the two modes.
GOAL #4
Rail facilities continue to develop while minimizing the impacts to land uses
and arterial circulation.
Policies
1) Work cooperatively with the railroad companies to maintain a safe and efficient
     rail system within the City.
2) Establish connections between inter-city rail and major activity centers to
     improve freight transfers and provide passenger service.
3) Develop safe and efficient design standards to minimize the impact of at-grade
     arterial railroad crossings.
4) Provide appropriate noise attenuation measures for new residential
     developments.
5) Work with regional agencies to identify the impacts of increased rail and freight
     traffic due to Alameda Corridor and Alameda Corridor East on traffic and
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                         4-27

          circulation across corridor rail facilities and work towards implementation of
          appropriate circulation improvements.
     IMPLEMENTING THE CIRCULATION
     ELEMENT
     The City’s commitment to the goals and policies of the Circulation Element is
     realized through plan implementation. Policy must be translated into action. The
     following are relevant implementation tools, which may be used to effectuate plan
     goals and policies.
     Police Powers
     The State of California authorizes “police powers” to local jurisdictions to help
     protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens. The manifestation of the City’s
     regulatory police powers is the Municipal Code. Sections of the Municipal Code,
     which will help implement the Circulation Element, include the Subdivision,
     Building, Zoning and Public Works Codes.
     Street and public facility standards specified in the Circulation Element will be
     required in the development process through the regulatory powers of the Municipal
     Code, on a project-by-project basis. The following specific methods of
     implementation are found in the Municipal Code.
     Specific Plans
     The State of California also authorizes the adoption of Specific Plans by local
     jurisdictions to assist in the orderly implementation of the General Plan. The
     Specific Plan is a regulatory tool available for addressing the unique development
     characteristics of a particular area within the City. While Specific Plans must be
     consistent with the General Plan, they can provide guidelines at a level of detail that
     are inappropriate to the General Plan. Each Specific Plan is intended to be generally
     consistent with the development standards, goals and policies of the Circulation
     Element.
     Zoning
     The Zoning Code is one of the documents which assists in implementing parts of the
     Circulation Element. The Zoning Code prescribes allowable uses and development
     standards, including building height, density, bulk, setback, coverage, landscape
     requirements, parking standards, and off-street loading and service requirements.
4-28                                                           CIRCULATION ELEMENT

                                                                                 4. CIRCULATION ELEMENT
Other Implementation Methods
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
All projects as defined by CEQA are subject to environmental review to determine
if the activity will have a significant effect on the environment. If a possible
significant effect is deter- mined, the City prepares and initial study to decide
whether the project warrants an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) or Negative
Declaration. In either case, the City may apply conditions to the Project which will
mitigate the impacts on the transportation system. The conditions help to implement
the goals and policies of the Circulation Element.
Congestion Management Plan (CMP)
All projects that meet the threshold for Countywide CMP are subject to preparation
of CMP Traffic Impact Studies per San Bernardino Associates Governments
(SANBAG) CMP Guidelines. CMP TIAs identify various local and regional
circulation system improvements and impact shares as conditions for the
development of the subject project. The conditions help to implement the goals and
policies of the Circulation Element.
Caltrans Project Development Procedures
The Caltrans Project Development Procedures, which include Project Study Reports
(PSR), Project Report (PR), preliminary engineering (PE), and plans, specifications
and engineering estimates (PS&E) are tools for implementing improvements
consistent with the City’s Circulation Element on the state-owned transportation
facilities such as freeways, interchange ramps, freeway over-crossings, park-and-
ride facilities, and improvements to conventional state highways (surface street
routes).
Short and Long-Range Transit Plans
These are programming documents developed by local and regional transit operators
that provide means to implement some of the multi-modal elements of the
Circulation Element including new or improved bus routes or increased service,
transit stations, etc.

INTRODUCTION
Creating a Sense of Place
The City of Fontana is enhancing its image by building on its strengths and
planning for the future. High quality community design
occurs through proactive planning and careful attention to
detail. Rather than allow rapid growth to divide the City
into isolated sub-areas, this element directs the creation
of a more unified Fontana, establishing visual
connections and guiding new development. The intent of
the goals, policies and actions in this Community Design
Element is to achieve a sense of place at the multiple
scales at which the community functions.
                                                                            Fontana's Metrolink Station is a

Plan, but the City of Fontana has long recognized the importance of
community appearance and design to its vitality and future. Through
updating the goals and policies of the 1990 Community Design Element, the
City recognizes that creating a positive community image is an on-going
process that requires sustained commitment.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                6-1
                                    Background: From an Industrial Base to a
                                    Diverse Community
                                    Like many cities in the Inland Empire, Fontana has experienced major
                                    growth and transition. Its previous image as an industry town has quickly
                                    given way to a diverse community with rapid residential growth to the north,
                                    an older downtown and core area in transition, and an industrial area
                                    coexisting with a planned residential community in the south. The challenge
                                    of this plan is to enhance Fontana’s community image amid this diversity and
                                    change.
                                    As the City begins to develop the extensive vacant land in its northern areas,
                                    it has a tremendous opportunity to guide development patterns that enhance
                                    its identity and build vibrant neighborhoods and activity centers. Over time,
                                    the City will also have the opportunity to better integrate the planning of
                                    unincorporated areas into its policy framework. Finally, the existence of
                                    many vacant parcels suitable for in-fill development gives the City the
                                    chance to strengthen its core and improve the compatibility of adjacent land
                                    uses.
                                    ACHIEVING THE VISION: CHARACTER
                                    AND IMAGE
                                    Creating Identity from Diversity
                                    The overriding vision of Fontana is to create a strong community identity
                                    from a diverse base, while at the same time avoiding a sterile sameness. The
                                    City’s physical character consists of an older downtown, both old and new
                                    neighborhoods, a large industrial base, major freeways, a strong grid of
                                    arterial highways, and a backdrop of natural open space to the north and
                                    south. From this context comes the vision for Fontana’s community design:
                                        An aesthetically attractive City unified by selected design features;
                                                  Clearly marked formal entries at key points that identify
                                                   community gateways, edges and boundaries;
                                                  Vibrant downtown and Civic Center areas that are the heart of
                                                   the City and provide a mix of activities, services and
                                                   entertainment destinations;
                                                  Enhanced views of the City from freeway corridors that are
                                                   attractive, diverse and appealing;
                                                  Unimpeded views of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino

                                                                     6. COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
    Development project standards based on quality as well as creativity and
     flexibility of design; and
    Development in the sphere of influence that is consistent with this vision
     and City policies for achieving this vision so that eventual integration
     into the City is a seamless process.
PLAN COMPONENTS: WHAT MAKES
UP COMMUNITY DESIGN?
The Scale of Urban Design
When people think of design, they usually think at a scale no larger than an
individual building. However, community design exists at the street,
neighborhood, district and city level, and requires careful planning at
multiple scales to carry it out. In general, effective urban design helps to
unify a city visually and to create a distinct sense of place in special areas of
a city.
Unifying Principles of Urban Design
Because of the varied scales at which a community functions, planners and
designers need to work from certain unifying principles. A commonly used
model of urban design comes from theorist and author Kevin Lynch (The
Image of the City, 1960). His overriding idea was for cities to create a more
memorable identity by enhancing the image of their major elements. He
divided the city into the following functional areas, each of which contributes
distinct design potential:
    Paths – A city is often viewed from and defined by the paths that run
     through and around it. Paths connect activity areas and can have an
     important identity of their own. In a large sense, perceptions of Fontana
     are formed from the major paths – mainly arterial highways – that pass
     through it and from the views into the community from highway
     corridors that traverse it.
    Landmarks – Visually prominent buildings, important cultural centers
     or special natural features serve to give a city a distinct image and are
     important amenities. Fontana is working to preserve and create               Distinctive street trees and
     landmarks within its downtown area as well as preserving its excellent       landscaped median strips give
     views of nearby hills and mountains.                                         Baseline Ave. near the I-15 a
                                                                                  strong and attractive identity
    Edges – Boundaries are important in urban design because they signal
     one’s arrival at a new land use, area or feature. If edges are clearly
     marked, such as in the use of entry signs or monuments, a city’s identity
     is strengthened. The City of Fontana is paying attention to its many
     edges with entry statements and improved signage at key intersections.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                     6-3

                                      Nodes – Activity centers or concentration of uses provide land use
                                       diversity and interest. Shopping centers, transportation hubs, historic
                                       areas, and town centers serve important functions for residents and
                                       visitors alike. The City of Fontana has made great strides in creating a
                                       major downtown node with its revitalization program, including the
                                       Civic Center Campus and Downtown Overlay District.
                                      Districts – Special areas of the city have their own visual and functional
                                       identity and work against the visual monotony seen in many cities today.
                                       In selected sub-areas, cities can enhance identity through the use of
                                       specialized design treatment, signage, street furniture, and landscaping.
                                       The City of Fontana has frequently used the district concept with the
                                       approval of several specific plans that offer distinct qualities not found
                                       elsewhere in the City. The downtown core is another example of how
                                       the City is working to reinforce the unique characteristics of this district.

                                  automobile-dominated environments, these images are most often seen from
                                  a moving vehicle. By unifying the treatment of one or more of these
                                  elements, a streetscape can have a coherent image and one that makes a
                                  strong statement within a city. Sadly, many cities give scant attention to their
                                  streetscapes, resulting in a visually disjointed experience as one moves along
                                  the street. In Fontana, streetscapes are of crucial importance to the image of
                                  the City because of the freeways and arterials that shape the pattern of
                                  movement within and through the City. The City’s streetscape improvement
                                  plan focuses especially on Foothill and Valley Boulevards and Sierra
                                  Avenue.

                                  Current Community Design Conditions
                                  The challenge in Fontana is to create a strong community image where none
                                  has dominated in the past. Currently, there is a shortage of unifying
                                  community design elements, but the City is moving to address this area.
                                  There are several City monument signs at key entry points, and a banner
                                  program has been initiated in parts of the City. Medians exist along some
                                  stretches of major corridors, and many gaps remain to be filled. The City’s
                                  logo appears on some street signs and in many public facilities. Plans for
                                  downtown revitalization and design guidelines for major arterials are in
                                  process.

   A Downtown in Transition
   Downtown Fontana is centrally located and contains many of the
   City’s major civic buildings and historic architecture. It also
   functions as a major transportation hub. With mature landscaping
   and several adjacent parks, the downtown has a base upon which
   to build a vibrant, focused area. The abandoned Pacific Electric
   Railroad right-of-way represents an opportunity to tie the City
   together visually and, at the same time, strengthen a physical
   connection to the Downtown Area.
   The revitalized downtown will contain a variety of architectural
   styles with shopping areas reminiscent of early commercial “Main Streets.”        Mature landscaping and notable
                                                                                     community facilities along Sierra
   Through the implementation of a unifying streetscape improvement plan,            Avenue provide the base for the
   quality architectural guidelines, and a variety of retail, civic and recreational downtown revitalization plan.
   uses, the area can be transformed into a pleasant and walkable downtown,
   and a destination for entertainment, dining and the arts.
   Diverse Architectural Themes
   Because Fontana experienced its major growth since 1960, the City lacks a
   clearly defined architectural character. Some important architectural
   remnants of the City’s agricultural and industrial past remain and the
   downtown area has some notable older architecture. An architectural and
   design theme for the City would, therefore, be broad and inclusive, featuring
   Spanish Colonial, Italian/Mediterranean, Art Deco/Streamline Moderne,
   Craftsman Bungalow, agricultural, and Main Street Commercial styles. This
   array of styles can be used to highlight distinctions throughout the City.
                                                                                       The historic Sunkist packing

   A City Defined by Transportation                                                    heritage
   Fontana has been influenced significantly by the local and regional
   transportation system. Accessed by major freeways, intersected by large
   commercial arterials and crossed by railroad lines, the City has already begun
   to build on its rich heritage of movement. The redesign of the Metrolink
   Station south of downtown, which also includes a large bus depot, has
   incorporated Spanish Colonial style shelters. The design guidelines for
   Foothill Boulevard, part of the historic US Route 66, will evoke automotive
   themes. The Pacific Electric Inland Empire Trail, currently an abandoned
   right-of-way which cuts a diagonal swath through the City, is being
   transformed into a multi-use “rail trail” providing not only recreational
   opportunities but the potential to incorporate unifying agricultural and
   transportation design elements into downtown.

    ISSUES, GOALS, POLICIES & ACTIONS
    Introduction
    The organizing principle of this element is that community design exists at
    various levels, from the scale of an individual project to that of the entire
    community. In between, districts and neighborhoods become visually
    distinct sub-areas yet still tied to the City. The challenge for the City of
    Fontana is to incorporate new development into the design fabric of the City
    so that it contributes both to overall community image and to its immediate
    context. The best way to plan for this is to establish design guidelines and
    policies at each of these important levels. The following structure offers a
    way of thinking about design features applicable to these distinct levels and
    provides the basis for the issues, goals, policies and actions that follow.

ISSUE #1: DESIGN THEME FOR THE CITY
How can Fontana establish a unifying design theme while still
encouraging diversity within sub-areas of the City?
Discussion: For a number of reasons, it has been hard for Fontana to
maintain a unified visual identity. First, there is the sheer size of the
community, encompassing 36 square miles (and another 15 miles if the
sphere of influence area is included). Secondly, the rapid growth of newer,
residential specific plan areas in the north and west - each with its own
design theme - has given the City multiple identities. Also, since Fontana
wasn’t incorporated until 1952 and experienced the bulk of its growth after
1960, no one architectural style has predominated in the City. Finally, a
considerable amount of unincorporated land over which the City has no
jurisdiction lends further diversity to the community’s identity.
Nevertheless, the City has made positive steps towards building a distinct
community identity. The City has updated and incorporated its logo –
featuring a fountain with a backdrop of mountains – on bus stops, entry signs
and monuments, and trash receptacles at a few areas throughout the City.
The City seal also appears on major street signs. Overall, however, there is
much more to be done to create a stronger sense of place for the City. As it
establishes design guidelines for selected areas, the City recognizes that
flexible guidelines can often avoid the visual monotony resulting from
standards that are too strict. Nevertheless, some direction must be followed
if positive change is to be achieved. For instance, in the developing areas of
north Fontana, a Mediterranean design theme is being implemented overall.
GOAL #1:
Our City has a unified overall community image and appearance with
distinct districts and neighborhoods.
Policies:
1) Major entry points or gateways into the City, especially along arterial
     corridors, shall be marked with City identification and with enhanced
     landscaping and streetscaping to highlight Fontana’s identity.
2) Arterial corridors should be improved with installation of a palette of
     consistent landscaping and street furniture to reinforce the City’s
     identity.
                                                                               The entry monument sign on
3) The City logo should appear in all public spaces and on public facilities.  Baseline Ave. incorporates the City
                                                                               logo and provides a sense of
               4) Development in north Fontana should be designed to           arrival to motorists
                  incorporate elements consistent with a Mediterranean design
                  theme.

                                          improvement standards to strengthen and unify the City’s image.
                                     2) Adopt a program for the design and installation of special treatments at

                                     5) Consistently incorporate the City’s logo into street furniture, street signs
                                          and other signage based on scale, location and materials, taking into
                                          account cost of maintenance as well as installation.
                                     ISSUE #2: OPEN SPACE: VIEWS AND USE
                                     How can the City best preserve and incorporate view corridors into its
                                     design guidelines?
                                     Discussion: Fontana has the good fortune to be surrounded on the north and
                                     south by a significant amount of visible open space in the form of mountains
                                     and hills. To the northwest and northeast respectively lie the San Gabriel and
                                     San Bernardino Mountains; to the south lie the Jurupa Hills. These views are
                                     further enhanced by the fact that the City’s street system is almost totally a
                                     north/south and east/west grid, enabling largely unobstructed views. Clearly,
                                     one of the best ways to enhance the City’s identity is to use this natural open
                                     space as a defining visual boundary and a view corridor.
This view of the Jurupa Hills frames
the City to the south.               The City has long recognized the need to incorporate view corridors in its
                                     design guidelines. In 1987, the City commissioned a Scenic Corridor Plan
                                     and Design Guidelines Study for the North Fontana area. This study
                                     identified six scenic corridor routes and two freeways for special design
                                     treatment including:
                                         north-south routes: Sierra, Citrus and Cherry Avenues
                                         east-west routes: Foothill Blvd., Baseline and Highland Avenues
                                         major freeways: I-15 and I-210.
                                     The study recommended the creation of spacious view corridors and
                                     incorporation of community design themes, streetscape identity devices and
                                     specialized landscape treatment at strategic points along these routes. Many
                                     of these ideas will also be expanded to other areas of Fontana, including the
                                     enhanced landscaping and overpass improvements seen along the I-10
                                     Freeway in southern Fontana.

                                                                                     6. COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
                GOAL #2:
                We preserve and use our open spaces as recreational amenities, visual
                boundaries and view corridors.
                Policies:
                1) The design of major community facilities such as the community centers,
                     parks, bikeways and trails will take advantage of the views provided by
                     the adjoining mountains and hills.
                2) A series of strategic points along the scenic corridors will be created
                     where special community design and landscape treatment is warranted.
                3) The City’s open space network shall be designed to integrate both the
                     built and natural environment.
                4) Preservation of open space near the periphery of City boundaries
                     provides important visual contrast to the built environment.
                Actions:
                1) Recognize and enhance view corridors in the design guidelines for Sierra
                     Avenue and Foothill Boulevard.
                2) Create an attractive scenic environment along existing freeways by
                     continuing the program of landscape improvements along I-10 near the
                     Sierra Avenue off-ramp.
                3) Adopt design guidelines for the review of projects along the I-10 and I-
                     210 corridors.
                4) Address view corridors and access to open space in the Parks, Trails, and
                     Recreation Master Plan
                                                                                                  Enhanced freeway corridor
                                                                                                  landscaping improves the view

                How can the appearance of major arterials that cross Fontana be
                improved?
                Discussion: Since Fontana is at the crossroads of major freeways and
                arterials, the community’s image is often experienced from an automobile.
                The City has initiated a streetscape improvement program for its major
                arterials, consisting of design guidelines for Foothill, Sierra and Valley
                Boulevards.
                                       Sierra Avenue, the major north/south corridor, provides
                                       additional entry statement possibilities and runs the full
                                       length of the City, including directly through downtown.
                                       Foothill Boulevard provides a strong east/west
                                       connection with neighboring cities and will receive

                              What type of downtown revitalization would best serve the residents of
                              Fontana?
                              Discussion: From an urban design perspective, Fontana’s downtown lacks
                              unifying design features but contains a number of strong opportunities for
                              improvement. Although the downtown lacks enough historic buildings to
                              warrant historic district designation, the downtown has a number of notable
                              older buildings, a Civic Center undergoing redevelopment and new senior

establish design guidelines for both shopping centers and residential
neighborhoods that provide more attention to pedestrian amenities and link
neighborhoods with shopping and community facilities.
With regard to architectural design, the City encourages a diversity of styles
that provide visual interest instead of artificially imposing one overall theme.
Although unifying themes for neighborhoods are desirable, variation in
architectural style, orientation and detailing of individual product types
within development projects should be achieved.

Existing and new development reflects extensive use of high-quality,
contemporary design, incorporating unifying, community-wide design
elements.
Policies:

     trail, parks and school facilities as new areas develop.
GOAL #5.2:
Neighborhood organization and design reflect diverse and high quality
development standards, strong integration into the broader community,
and energy-efficient environmental siting standards.
Policies:
1) Schools and parks should be conveniently located within new residential
     communities.
2) Higher density residential uses should be located near retail and activity

                                        residential, commercial and industrial zones?
                                        Discussion: Because Fontana has long been a transportation and industrial
                                        node, it follows that conflicts occur where different uses meet. This is

INTRODUCTION
A City on the Move
Fontana is the fastest growing community in the Inland Empire. Positioned
at the crossroad of major interstate freeways and served by east/west rail
lines, the City is a hub of multi-modal transportation and a gateway to one of
the most dynamic areas in the United States. Employment within Fontana’s
primary and secondary markets total more than three million people. With a
large amount of undeveloped land and commercial/industrial areas in
transition, the City is still in a position to carefully guide its economic future.
Located within the fast-growing Inland Empire, Fontana needs to determine
its role in the region and implement a strategic plan to meet its goals.
                                                                                    Fontana’s strategic location has
                                                                                    been called the “Crossroads of
                                                                                    the Inland Empire”
About This Element
Although not a required element by state law, the City decided long ago that
sound economic planning is an integral part of the General Plan. With the
goal of creating an on-going Economic Strategic Development Plan, this
element creates the policy framework for sound economic growth as well as
development strategies that enhance the City’s fiscal health. Because
economic decisions shape the future, this part of the General Plan is
intricately related to the Land Use, Housing and Circulation Elements.

    VISIONS FOR A BALANCED
    COMMUNITY
    From its start as an agricultural community, through its evolution to a steel
    town, to its current role as a diverse center for residential and employment
    uses, Fontana has maintained its key goal of fostering a healthy and
    innovative economy. This focus tracks closely with the vision and values of
    Fontana’s residents, elicited in the community visioning process conducted
    as part of this General Plan update. Specifically, the community process
    resulted in the formulation of a vision for Fontana, thereby setting the goals
    of this Element:
        A vibrant community with a balance of residential, commercial and
         industrial uses;
        A diversified industrial base, reflecting new trends and opportunities of
         the modern economy;
        Use of the City’s advantageous setting as a transportation hub for the
         Inland Empire;
        A revitalized Central Business District which anchors an attractive and
         active downtown area;
        Enhanced arterial corridors which create an attractive setting for business
         development and expansion;
        Expanded shopping and entertainment destinations providing
         opportunities and convenience for the residents of Fontana; and
        Continued use of the redevelopment process as a tool for revitalizing
         commercial and industrial areas of the City.
    COMPONENTS OF THE CITY’S
    ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
    ACTIVITIES
    Common Strategies – How do Cities Enhance
    Their Economies?
    A number of specific economic development programs and strategies are
    commonly implemented by cities:
        Redevelopment – The process of rebuilding blighted or distressed areas
         of a city. Typically, a city is able to designate a redevelopment project
         area by making findings of blight, in compliance with state law, and then
         promote its improvement or acquire the property using eminent domain.
         As redeveloped property increases in assessed value, the City’s

                                                            7. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
     Redevelopment Agency receives the increase, or tax increment, and may
     use the proceeds toward further redevelopment or the provision of
     affordable housing for low or moderate- income households. The City of
     Fontana has an active redevelopment program focusing on five project
     areas: downtown Fontana, North Fontana, Jurupa Hills, Southwest
     Industrial Park, and the Sierra Corridor.
    Jobs/Housing Balance – A balanced ratio of jobs to housing units
     means that a community provides employment for its residents and
     minimizes in or out-commuting. A ratio of 1:1 would indicate a
     jobs/housing balance. While a ratio greater than 1 indicates a net surplus
     of jobs, a number less than 1 would result in an outflow of workers to
     jobs elsewhere. An imbalance of jobs and housing is believed to be a
     major cause of traffic congestion and housing affordability problems
     near major employment centers. Further, state law requires that each
     community address the provision of affordable housing to meet its share
     of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment.
    Fiscal analysis – Where does the money come from? – To pay for the
     services they provide, all cities rely on a steady stream of revenue. In
     California, the two major sources of revenue for local cities are sales
     taxes and vehicle license fees, both of which are shared with the state
     government. From this perspective, commercial development is
     advantageous because it generates sales tax revenues without imposing a
     significant demand for city services. Charts 7-1 and 7-2 depict the
     distribution of City’s new development costs and revenues in the year
     2003.
    Municipal Budgets: What services do cities provide? – In addition to
     providing basic law enforcement, fire, parks, and community
     development services, cities must also perform maintenance of
     infrastructure such as roads, sewers, community buildings and
     landscaping. In order to provide these services, Fontana, as well as other
     cities, may adopt a Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) that identifies
     projects to be completed and the funding sources to be used. In
     Fontana’s case, the CIP is a seven-year plan. The City of Fontana’s CIP
     has financed many physical improvements within the City.
    Economic Development Strategy – Fontana has an active economic
     development program coordinated by the Department of Housing and
     Business Development and the Economic Development Center.
     Furthermore, although not required to do so, the City has found it
     advantageous to devise and implement its own Economic Development
     Strategy.

Taking the Initiative
Fontana’s economy is influenced by many external factors such as interest
rates, employment trends, and regional influences, as well as state and
federal influences, including budgeting and news laws and regulations.
Nevertheless, there are many internal factors within Fontana’s control that
can help build a strong local economy. One way the City of Fontana is
proactive in its efforts to improve the local economy is through the
implementation of its Economic Development Strategy. The City of
Fontana’s strategy is made up of the following components:
         Integrating Planning, Business Development and Capital Spending;
         Focusing efforts on business retention and business
         development/attraction;
         Maintaining a safe and clean community;
         Annexing areas presently within the City’s sphere of influence;
         Focusing on inside/out investment within the community – from the
         developed central core of the City outward to the developing areas in
         the north and south;
         Networking at other levels of government, including county, state
         and federal, in order to secure funding for Fontana; and
         Investing in infrastructure to serve the community.
The City is aligning its energies to realize the following goals of its
Economic Development Strategy:
         Facilitate in-fill development projects within the community;
         Enhance the City’s tax base;
         Promote job creation throughout the community;
         Plan and encourage economic development along the City’s major
         transportation corridors;
         Operate as an “ombudsman” to promote and facilitate economic
         development; and
         Take a proactive role in regional economic development issues.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
Fontana’s Economic Context
    Location – Located in the growing western portion of the dynamic
     Inland Empire, and with access to and from Interstates 10, 60, and 15 and
     SR 210, as well as the region’s rail transportation system, the City of
     Fontana is in a strong position to capitalize on its visibility and
     opportunities for growth. The projected increase of goods movement of
     products coming through the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach will
City of Fontana General Plan                                                            7-5

      maintain the Southern California region as the primary import/export
      gateway to the United States. With the completion of the Alameda
      Transportation Corridor for truck and rail traffic, the connection to and
      from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and the region is greatly
      improved. However, limited land availability, traffic congestion and
      high land prices in the South Bay region of Los Angeles has pushed a
      significant amount of new industrial development to the Inland Empire.
     Demographics – Fontana is a young, rapidly-growing and ethnically
      diverse community. Its largest ethnic group is Hispanic/Latino (58% of
      population). The City’s population as a whole is younger – with its 2000
      Census median age of 26.2 – than even San Bernardino County, the
      youngest county in southern California. Its households are fairly large –
      3.85 people per household – compared to the regional figure of 3.12. Its
      median income per family - $45,782 according to the 2000 US Census –
      is higher than the county’s figure of $42,066.
     Labor Market – From 1991 to 2000, the City of Fontana experienced
      rapid growth in employment, with a 68.2% increase in the City’s
      employed labor force, or 24,593 employed persons from 16,784 in 1991,
      according to the California Department of Finance, as compiled by John
      E. Husing, Ph.D. of Economics & Politics, Inc. This was due in part to a
      dramatic job rate growth of 140.4% within the Distribution and
      Transportation sector. In the same time period, the number and size of
      firms in the City increased, with a 19.1% increase in the number of firms
      and an increase of about 9 workers per firm. California Department of
      Finance research also indicates that sectors employing high percentages
      of Fontana residents were also the sectors experiencing job growth
      during this time period.
      In 1999 and 2000, the City of Fontana’s job growth rates, 13.9% and
      8.5% respectively, exceeded that of the Inland Empire region, with rates
      of 6.2% and 5.4%, respectively. The California Department of Finance
      attributes the growth in the City’s employment to the migration of
      businesses from Southern California’s coastal communities to inland
      communities, due to lower land prices in the Inland Empire and the
      availability of vacant land in Fontana.
     Real Estate Market – In the 1990s Fontana experienced record sales of
      new and existing homes and rising home prices within the City,
      according to the California Department of Finance, as compiled by John
      E. Husing, Ph.D. of Economics & Politics, Inc. From 1991 to 2000,
      Fontana’s housing stock grew by 6,525 units, or 22.2%. During this
      period, new and existing home markets followed a similar path, with
      home prices peaking in 1990, prices declining from 1991 to 1995, and
      record sales in 1999 and 2000. By 2000, new and existing home sales
      reached 2,796 and 1,111 units, both the second highest ever in their
      respective categories. By the first quarter of 2001, median new and
      existing home prices reached record highs.

                                                           7. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
     California Department of Finance research indicates strong growth in the
     single-family housing market, as shown in the ratio of home sales to the
     City’s existing single-family homes, where Fontana’s home sales in 2001
     equaled 13.9% of its housing stock.
     The Economic/Market Analysis for the City of Fontana prepared by
     Realty Research Associates in 2002 indicated the following regarding the
     retail and industrial sectors in Fontana:
    Retail Trends –
         The retail demand in Fontana continues to be for community centers,
         power centers anchored by a warehouse store and neighborhood
         centers servicing the local population.
         A demand forecast for retail services in the area indicates that an
         additional regional mall is supportable. However, with the proposed
         175-acre Victoria Gardens Regional Center in the planning process
         in neighboring Rancho Cucamonga, this project will meet the
         additional demand generated by new household growth over the
         forecast period. If for some reason this project is not developed,
         there will be demand support for an alternative regional center in the
         Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga, and Fontana trade area.
         Neighborhood shopping centers, where most convenience goods are
         purchased will be located throughout the City based on residential
         development patterns. Data from the public survey conducted as part
         of this General Plan update indicates that nearly 60% of Fontana
         residents travel less than 5 minutes to a neighborhood shopping
         center. For shopping goods, nearly 78% of the Fontana residents
         visit a club/warehouse store and have an average expenditure of
         $136 per visit.
         Convenience store sales, such as food, have grown from 1990 at a
         rate similar to the growth in population. This is consistent with the
         local trade area of most supermarkets anchoring neighborhood
         centers.
         General merchandise sales, which are a major store category, have
         experienced a slower than average growth rate. The major general
         merchandise sales now occur in discount stores such as Wal-Mart,
         Target or K-mart or in discount warehouse stores such as Costco and
         Sam’s Club. Neighboring cities have drawn off the general
         merchandise sales share as they have added discount stores to their
         community centers.
         The specialty store category has also lagged as new stores have
         located in or near community sized centers rather than neighborhood
         centers.
         The building material/home improvement category suffered a decline
         with the close or relocation of home improvement centers. The home
         improvement centers typically are stand-alone or located adjacent to
         community-sized centers. The single-family suburban nature of the
City of Fontana General Plan                                                           7-7

            City of Fontana would provide the support for a home improvement
            center.
            Eating and drinking establishments have done well. The sales per
            square foot generated by fast food outlets are often a motivation for
            adding outlets to retail centers. From the resident’s survey the trend
            toward eating away from home is evident. The average household in
            Fontana indicated they spend $41 per week for food away from
            home verses an average weekly grocery expenditure of $103 per
            week.
            The automotive category is one that has grown significantly for the
            City of Fontana. Auto malls, with access and visibility from a
            freeway corridor provide for a high sales volume and corresponding
            high sales tax revenue. As automobiles are a major retail item that
            has a sales tax, the amount of land associated with an auto mall
            makes them a prime candidate to increase sales tax revenue for the
            host municipality.
        Industrial Trends –
            The major demand in the industrial sector will be for warehouse
            distribution space, with some manufacturing uses. Industrial uses
            such as warehouse and distribution that depend as accessible regional
            transportation corridors will be the most likely industrial users in
            Fontana. The freeway network and rail service in Fontana provides
            for access throughout the region.
            The core of the Inland Empire: Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga,
            Fontana and Mira Loma, have become the “inland port” for goods
            distribution throughout the western United States. This trend will
            continue.
            The development of an industrial base will provide the City with an
            asset base for the long-term economic health of the City. The most
            economically beneficial firms are those which are “point of sale”
            locations adding the benefit of sales tax revenue, plus the property
            tax revenue to the City.
    Development Outlook –Future Opportunities
    With a large proportion of undeveloped land, especially in the north, and a
    population expected to reach over 150,000 by 2005, housing, commercial
    and industrial development need to be balanced to maintain the fiscal health
    of the City. There are also major opportunities for in-fill development within
    the City, and within the City’s sphere of influence to the west of the City’s
    existing core developed area.
    A Fiscal Impact Analysis completed by Taussig & Associates as part of this
    General Plan update addressed existing and new development within the
    incorporated boundaries of the City. The fiscal impacts of development
    within the City’s sphere of influence will be studied in a separate analysis at
    the time annexation occurs.

In terms of revenue relating to Existing Development within the City, the
fiscal impact analysis report calls attention to the projected elimination of the
Utility Users Tax in the City in 2004. With this loss of revenue, funds
available for the City to invest, and to receive interest revenue on, will
decrease as well. These projected losses, coupled with increasing costs for
park maintenance services and recreation services, are projected to result in a
deficit of over $8 million per year for existing City development. A $6
million per year deficit is projected on new development within the City
limits due to increases in the levels of service (and associated spending) for
police services, parks and recreation, coupled with the projected loss of the
Utility User’s Tax. The complete text of the Fiscal Impact Report can be
found in Appendix J to the General Plan.
Revitalization and Change
The success of the City’s economic future depends on how it addresses older
areas in transition as well as new development areas. Revitalizing the City’s
core area, and the boulevards which serve it, as well as attracting a healthy
mix of residential, commercial and industrial/ business park uses for the
City’s vacant areas, will be the engine of economic change. Continuing to
use the redevelopment process to promote economic development will
provide the benefits of increased tax-increment that can be used to finance
City improvements.
Fontana has an active program of economic development and business
attraction. The Department of Housing and Business Development maintains
an Economic Development Center that provides assistance on site selection,
housing programs, business licenses and job training. A City-sponsored
website – www.fontanabusiness.org - is available for information on business
development. Partnerships with the private sector are important as well, and
the City has a long-established relationship with the Fontana Chamber of
Commerce.
The City is also actively reshaping its public facilities and updating its
infrastructure. A new Civic Center Campus, incorporating a new, state-of-
the-art library and extensive public spaces, is planned. The Fontana leg of
the Pacific Electric Empire Trail will be constructed through downtown and
the Civic Center. Three major senior housing complexes are planned at the
southern entry to downtown (the first of the three opened in 2003), adjacent
to the Metrolink Station. The City’s Redevelopment Agency is actively
working to revitalize five project areas throughout the City. Major
interchange upgrade projects are planned and being implemented along
Interstate 10. The State’s highway agency Caltrans is expected to bring other
freeway improvements to the region to respond to increasing cargo and
container traffic as well. The Alameda Corridor East will no doubt bring
improvements to the City’s interface with the rail system that traverses it
east-to-west.

     ISSUES, GOALS, POLICIES & ACTIONS
     ISSUE #1: BALANCED LAND USES A DIVERSE
     ECONOMIC BASE
     How can the City ensure a fiscally healthy balance of residential,
     commercial and industrial land uses?
     Discussion: Sales taxes are a major source of revenue for the City. Since the
     closing of Kaiser Steel in 1983, seven industrial parks have been added to the
     City, as well as a major regional health center, numerous auto and trucking
     centers, point of sale warehouse/distribution, and a variety of other
     businesses. Residential development has grown tremendously in that period,
     particularly within the northwestern part of the City. The challenge for
     Fontana is to continue to create a socially and fiscally healthy balance of land
     uses.
     GOAL #1
     A sustainable balance of residential, commercial and industrial uses
     supports our City’s economy.
     Policies:
     1) The City’s pattern of development should balance revenue-consuming
         uses with revenue-generating uses.
     2) Land uses should be sought that can adapt to emerging market and fiscal
         conditions throughout the plan time horizon.
     3) The City should achieve a mix of land uses that capitalizes on
         transportation corridors, stimulates employment, offers a variety of
         housing types/lifestyle choices and can respond to market opportunities.
     4) The fiscal impacts of new development shall be monitored and
         appropriate project mitigation strategies shall be imposed.
     Actions:
     1) Require a fiscal impact report on all projects for which the preparation of
         an EIR is required.
     2) Establish criteria and procedures for reviewing the fiscal affect of zone
         changes, as well as new specific plans and site development plans.
     3) Develop and monitor an equitable impact fee program that ensures that
         one-time public improvement costs, including all related off-site
         improvements, are fully covered by the developer.

ISSUE #2: A DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL BASE
How can we build, improve and diversify the industrial base within our
City?
Discussion: Traditionally, Fontana’s employment has been generated by
major industrial sectors including steel manufacturing, trucking, distribution
and automotive industries. In order to maintain the City’s economic base,
the City must sustain and expand its economic development program as
necessary to identify and respond to market shifts and development
opportunities. To achieve this, collaboration with the private sector and with
economic development associations is essential. Also, careful attention must
be paid to the quality of industrial development so that business investments
are protected over time. Larger scale master plans or specific plans are an
excellent means of achieving the desired quality where land parcels are large
enough or where multiple properties can be covered by a single plan.
Quality development can only be achieved through time by persistent
insistence on high standards and attentive code enforcement.
The distribution industry will continue to be important in this market area but
should not be allowed to dominate the industrial base, as they are large
consumers of land and highway capacity and are low direct generators of
jobs. This can be offset through the clustering of interdependent industries
(for example, a machinery assembly operation that benefits from a nearby
parts supplier).
GOAL #2:
Fontana’s industrial/manufacturing employment base is expanding and
diversified.
Policies:
1) Balanced industrial development should be promoted that reflects a mix
     of manufacturing, research and development, storage and distribution,
     and office support.
2) The City should seek clusters of industries that reinforce each other and
     offer a diversity that can better withstand the negative effects of
     economic cycles.
3) More diversified and employee-rich businesses should be sought in the
     City to augment its already established presence as a major transportation
     and distribution hub.
4) The City shall use its redevelopment powers as a key means of targeting
     and attracting desirable industries.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                          7-11

     5) Close collaboration shall be sustained with the Chamber of Commerce
          and other economic development associations that promote industrial
          development in this and nearby communities.
     Actions:
     1) Establish, maintain and implement a list of targeted industries for
          location/relocation in Fontana.
     2) Join with the Cities of Colton, Rialto, Ontario and San Bernardino to
          devise ways in which the City and its neighbors can benefit from the
          Alameda Corridor East, including planning appropriate rail connections
          to the Jurupa Industrial Park.
     3) Identify and seek Public Utilities Commission priority for grade crossing
          improvements within Fontana.
     4) Continue and expand the Infill Development Incentive program to
          include targeted sites within key opportunity areas.
     ISSUE #3: REVITALIZED DOWNTOWN
     How can we most successfully revitalize Fontana’s downtown?
     Discussion: A revitalized, thriving downtown is a pillar of the new vision for
     the City, developed as part of this General Plan update. In order to achieve
     this vision, the City’s must continue its commitment to the downtown. In
     April 2000, a Downtown Revitalization Task Force was formed with the
     objective of guiding the transformation of the downtown into “a place that
     meets the needs of the community, encourages business growth and
     retention, and provides a clean, safe and pleasant environment for all to
     enjoy”.
     Surveys of merchants and residents highlighted benefits and problems with
     the current downtown. The results indicated that the downtown may not be
     realizing its shopping, residential, or entertainment potential, but also
     indicated its prime location and good flow of traffic as benefits. Residents
     were also asked what would motivate them to visit the downtown area. The
     most common responses were as follows:
               Greater variety and quality of shopping opportunities;
               Cleaner and safer environment;
               More attractive area with a coherent design theme;
               More entertainment uses such as restaurants and community
               functions;
               More convenient parking and traffic flow; and
               An improved pedestrian environment.

A key component of downtown revitalization is the new Civic Center
Conceptual Master Plan completed in February 2000. The plan includes a
new library, a new public plaza with fountains, improved parking, as well as
landscape and hardscape improvements.
GOAL #3:
Our downtown promotes civic pride and provides ample opportunities
for shopping, entertainment, recreation and community events, as well
as “close-in” residential development.
Policies:
1) Current efforts to achieve downtown revitalization shall continue and be
     expanded.
2) The main device for achieving the vision for the city’s downtown shall
     be a Downtown Strategic Plan, which implements the General Plan and
     provides the basis for coordinating public and private improvement
     actions.
3) Mixed and multiple use projects shall be sought in the downtown area to
     stimulate vitality in this key portion of the City.
4) Downtown successes should be a central ingredient in the City’s
     marketing outreach to potential businesses and investors.
Actions:
1) Adopt and implement a Downtown Revitalization Strategic Plan
     including a phasing, funding and evaluation timetable.
2) Establish an annual program for reviewing and updating the Downtown
     Revitalization Strategic Plan in preparation for each upcoming budget
     cycle so that it remains a living, contemporary guide that benefits from
     timely allocation of City resources.
3) In conjunction with the Downtown Revitalization Strategic Plan, conduct
     a focused survey of downtown businesses to determine how action
     priorities are working and possible modifications needed to stimulate
     desired change.
4) Set up a business assistance program to help interested downtown
     businesses make improvements in building appearance, market
     responsiveness or merchandising practices.
ISSUE #4: EDUCATION, JOB TRAINING AND
PLACEMENT
How can our City best strengthen its workforce through education, job
training and job placement?
City of Fontana General Plan                                                         7-13

     Discussion: Residents, businesses and city officials have consistently
     identified education as a key component in maintaining a strong local
     economy. The availability of a full range of educational programs including
     K-12 education, adult education, vocational/technical programs, retraining,
     and job placement insures a more flexible and skilled workforce. The City
     has recently attracted the Chaffey College (Ralph Lewis) Fontana Center to
     the downtown area, located at 16855 Merrill Avenue– a resource that can be
     utilized to benefit the city’s future. In addition, on an ongoing basis,
     Fontana’s Economic Development Center provides information to
     prospective businesses s as well as referrals for training, recruitment, and job
     opportunities.
     GOAL #4
     Our City, independently and in collaboration with school and
     community college districts, provides a comprehensive education,
     training and job placement program to develop and maintain a
     competitive workforce.
     Policies
     1) The City shall continue to support the job training and placement
          division within the Economic Development Center.
     2) The City shall support career education programs in public schools such
          as career academies, internships, Career Speaker Programs, job
          shadowing, Career Day, and the Regional Occupation Program.
     3) Opportunities to bring universities,
          community colleges and
          specialized technical training
          branch facilities into the
          community shall continue to be
          promoted.
     Actions:
     1) Establish an education and training
          consortium among the City, local
          school and community college
          districts, and local employers.
     2) Continue the City’s outreach to
          educational institutions seeking to establish branch locations in Fontana.
     3) Utilize the City profile developed by the Economic Development Center
          to promote educational branch locations.
                                                                     A community profile promoting

efforts, residents and city officials alike have expressed concern that the City
is losing significant shopping, entertainment and business opportunities to
neighboring areas. A market study conducted in 2002, as part of this General
Plan update, identified auto mall and automotive related retail uses as key
market areas for the City to pursue, in addition to community serving retail
uses. This issue has been recognized by the City and has become a major
focus of the City’s Department of Housing and Business Development and
Economic Development Center. To attract greater commercial development,
the City created an Economic Zone within the North Fontana Redevelopment
Project Area (north of Baseline Avenue). Within the Economic Zone, the
City is waiving city fees for sales tax revenue producing development of 20
acres or more, contingent upon the availability of Redevelopment Agency
monies. This program will be in effect through June of 2006.
GOAL #5:
Expanded commercial development at key locations throughout the City
serves the needs of the community and captures earlier revenue losses to
surrounding areas.
Policies:
1) A full range of retail uses that support the local and specialty consumer,
     without creating adverse impacts on other nearby uses, should be
     supported.
2) Resident-serving commercial development shall be a major priority in
     the City’s land use planning.
3) Neighborhood and community-serving retail centers shall be clustered at
     convenient areas throughout the City to enable one-stop shopping
     wherever possible.
4) The Boulevard Overlay District and Activity Center Overlay Districts
     should stimulate commercial development at key locations in the City as
     a means of stimulating successful commercial centers instead of
     marginal commercial strips.
Actions:
1) Track the City’s commercial development achievements, including
     successful strategies and associated fiscal implications, at least every two
     years.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                          7-15

     2) Conduct periodic surveys of business owners and residents about the
          City’s performance in meeting shopping and employment needs.
     3) Implement the provisions of the City’s Economic Zone (Ordinance 1400)
          in order to stimulate commercial development within the area north of
          Baseline Avenue.
     ISSUE #6: REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AREAS
     How can the City’s redevelopment powers be used to most effectively
     sustain economic development?
     Discussion: Fontana’s Redevelopment Agency has designated five
     Redevelopment Project Areas: the Downtown Project, the Southwest
     Industrial Park Project, the North Fontana Project, the Jurupa Hills Project,
     and the Sierra Corridor Commercial Project. The City’s revitalization efforts
     in the past thirty years have centered on the elimination of blight and the
     creation of viable, attractive and contributing neighborhoods within its
     Redevelopment Project Areas. (See Figure 3-1 in the Land Use Element for
     a depiction of the City’s Redevelopment Project Areas.) Over the years the
     City’s Redevelopment Agency has completed numerous redevelopment,
     development and infrastructure projects that have revitalized many properties
     in its Project Areas. The Agency has also participated in the development
     and maintenance of low and moderate income housing within the City. In
     administering and implementing these Project Areas the City seeks to:
         Practice sound fiscal management in all of the Agency’s activities;
         Promote economic development by enhancing and renovating
          businesses, encouraging private revitalization of properties, stimulating
          private investment in the Project Areas, assembling and marketing
          underutilized land, and supporting the installation of site improvements
          and public facilities to stimulate new commercial/light industrial
          expansion and employment;
         Invest in the City’s infrastructure by upgrading and maintaining
          roadways and circulation systems, providing public facilities such as
          water, storm drain, sewer systems, street lights, parking and signage, and
          enhancing the City’s educational, cultural, and residential resources, as
          well as other community resources; and
         Improve public safety in the community.

GOAL #6:
The City’s Redevelopment Project Areas are fiscally sound and
contribute significantly to the community’s economic vitality, public
safety, and the creation of its infrastructure.
Policies:
1) The City shall continue to promote new development, intensification and
     revitalization of properties within designated Redevelopment Project
     Areas.
2) Capital improvement strategies shall be used to reinforce the desirability
     of development and redevelopment within Redevelopment Project Areas.
3) Redevelopment funds shall continue to be invested directly in projects
     that offer affordable housing as part of the City’s diverse housing stock.
Actions:
1) Inventory and map vacant and underutilized properties in Redevelopment
     Project Areas and continue to use the City’s internet site as an
     information repository for the real estate sector.
2) Establish a partnership with local real estate professionals to develop and
     utilize a strategy for promoting and marketing properties in Fontana.
3) Establish an ongoing program for targeting funds for affordable housing
     projects, including contact with leading developers in the market area.
ISSUE #7: ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIC
PLANNING
How is the City planning for its Economic Development in the future?
Discussion: As economic change is inevitable, the City recognizes that a
pro-active approach is the best strategy to encourage a strong local economy.
On-going long-range planning as well as building partnerships with local,
regional and national business organizations are ways to plan effectively for
the future. As previously mentioned, the City has developed an Economic
Development Strategic Plan, which it updates periodically, and implements
continuously.

     GOAL #7:
     Fontana’s Economic Strategy continues to succeed in strengthening and
     diversifying our economic base, stimulating economic vitality, and
     making the City a net importer of dollars.
     Policies:
     1) Periodic market demand analysis shall be a key part of the City’s
         economic development strategy.
     2) Partnerships with the private sector, real estate and educational
         institutions shall continue to be a key component of the City’s economic
         development strategy.
     3) All City departments shall be involved in contributing to the City’s
         economic development program.
     Actions:
     1) Continue to update and implement the City’s Economic Development
         Strategy.
     2) Develop a version of the City’s Economic Development Strategy that can
         be used by all City departments in promoting economic development
         through their professional contacts.

INTRODUCTION
The Foundation of Sound Planning
The backbone of a growing community is its public facilities, services and
infrastructure. In fact, quality of life is often dependent not only on schools,
parks, libraries, and police and fire services, but also on the physical
infrastructure that sustains it – circulation systems, water, sewers, flood
control, electricity, communication, and waste management. Although many
people take these facilities for granted, high-growth cities such as Fontana
must proactively plan and budget for their provision to meet the needs of a
changing population. Given prevailing fiscal and economic constraints, this
is a challenging job.
This element covers two related areas: 1) Public Facilities and Services; and
2) Infrastructure. Public facilities and services address those basic services
typically provided by local government: police, fire protection, parks,
schools, libraries, community facilities, and health and social services. The
provision of parks and recreation programs, an important public function, is
addressed in Chapter 10 of this General Plan. Infrastructure addresses the
physical systems that sustain a community: water, roads, sewers, flood
City of Fontana General Plan                                                     8-1

    control, and power. Circulation, a crucial part of a City’s infrastructure, is
    addressed in Chapter 4 of this General Plan.
    Support for the General Plan
    This element is not a legally mandated part of the General Plan, but its
    inclusion demonstrates Fontana’s commitment to its citizens’ quality of life.
    It supports the Land Use Element by establishing the service standards
    necessary to support a growing population. In addition, it provides leaders
    and residents with an update of realistic standards to provide the highest
    possible levels of service to all segments of the community commensurate
    with fiscal realities.
    ACHIEVING THE VISION
    Facilities for a Growing Community
    An overriding goal of any General Plan should be to sustain and improve the
    quality of life for current and future residents of the community. As the City
    continues to grow, it is imperative that public facilities keep pace with
    demand. Through the Community Outreach process undertaken to update
    this General Plan, the following vision for Fontana’s public facilities and
    infrastructure emerged:
             An excellent educational system with high quality facilities;
             A safe community strengthened by police and fire facilities equipped
             with the latest technology and well-distributed throughout the City;
             High quality infrastructure, supportive of current and future
             competitive demands; and
             State-of-the-art communication technology linking public facilities,
             residents and business, in order to more effectively meet current and
             future needs.
    COMPONENTS OF THE PLAN &
    EXISTING CONDITIONS
    A City is much more than houses, streets and roads. Its public facilities and
    infrastructure provide the framework and support for day-to-day living. This
    Element seeks to answer the question, “What are the key components of
    Fontana’s public facilities and infrastructure, and what have the responsible
    authorities done to ensure their provision and continued improvement?” Key
    components of the City’s public facilities system are described and mapped
    below.

Public Facilities and Services
Schools
    Public Schools – Public education, Kindergarten through 12th grade, is
     the top priority for many Fontana residents. Although local school
     boards under the State Board of Education control schools, partnerships
     with cities are essential for purposes of facilities planning and
     coordination. The planning area is serviced by five school districts:
     Fontana Unified, Rialto Unified, Colton Joint Unified, and Etiwanda
     School Districts, as well as the Chaffey Joint Union High School
     District.
    Fontana Unified School District covers the largest portion of the City
     of Fontana and its sphere area to the west. It contains 35 schools, serving
     a pre-school through adult education population, with 26 elementary
     schools, seven middle schools, three high schools and three alternative
     programs.

          Growth Planning Factors – Student generation rates (SGR) are used
          to determine the average number of students produced by a new
          home. A rate of 1.36 per household is the current overall factor, with
          rates of 0.69 for elementary, 0.33 for middle school and 0.44 for high
          school.
          School Fee Program – As of March 2003, developer fees for the
          construction of schools are currently $6.36 per square foot for all
          residential developments. This fee is considered the Level II
          alternative fee as required by state law for hardship districts, and the
          district completes a fee analysis yearly.
          Plans for New Facilities, Projected Growth and Constraints –
          According to projections by the Southern California Association of
          Governments (SCAG), Fontana will experience rapid residential
          growth over the next twenty-five years. Combined with the fact that
          FUSD includes parts of other jurisdictions within its service
          boundaries, this projected increase in population is expected to exert
City of Fontana General Plan                                                         8-3

           even more pressure on an already burdened school system.
      For these reasons, Fontana Unified has expansion and modernization
      plans for the majority of its facilities. Acquiring new sites is constrained
      by lack of funding resources and development costs. FUSD is eligible as
      a financial hardship district with the Office of Public School
      Construction.
     Colton Joint Unified School District – This district’s facilities are
      located in the southeast portion of the planning area, serving over 21,000
      students with 17 elementary schools, four middle schools, two
      comprehensive high schools, one alternative high school, an adult
      education program and a child development center. This district serves a
      smaller student population than FUSD and, since residential
      development in the area is more static, has yet to reach capacity (see
      Table 8-2 below). However, urban growth in the as-yet undeveloped
      areas in South Fontana could test the capacity of this district as well.
                                             Table 8-2

             Source: Michael Brandman Associates, Fall 2001
           Growth Planning Factors – CJUSD also bases growth rates upon
           Student Generation and fee programs for new housing. Their rates
           per dwelling unit are as follows: K-6 - 0.59; middle school - 0.16;
           high school - 0.21 for a total of 0.96, slightly less than one student
           per dwelling unit and substantially less than figures for FUSD. The
           fee program standards (costs per square foot) consist of the
           following: $3.87 for new construction; $2.05 for additional space;
           and $0.33 for commercial uses.
           Plans for New Facilities and Expansion – CJUSD’s expansion
           plans include the construction of a 12-acre elementary school site
           near the Forecast Homes Tract 16074. The District is in the process
           of purchasing property for construction of two additional elementary
           schools.
     Etiwanda School District (ESD) – This district’s facilities, focused
      solely on elementary education and a forthcoming intermediate school,
      are located in the northwest portion of the planning area. As of Fall
      2001, the district served 2,945 students and had a capacity of 3,694.
8-4          PUBLIC FACILITIES, SERVICES & INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT

                     8. PUBLIC FACILITIES, SERVICES & INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
          Growth Planning Factors – ESD’s Student Generation Rate for
          single-family homes is 0.66 students for K – 8 and 0.21 for
          multifamily units. The fee program is $2.61 per square foot for
          residential plus a special tax of $2210.38 for commercial
          development assessed at $0.23 per square foot.
          Future Growth – As with other districts in the area, the student
          population of EDS is increasing and the district has completed plans
          for a new intermediate school.
    Chaffey Joint Union High School District (CJUHS) – This high school
     district serves students in the northern portion of the planning area. As
     of fall 2001 the District enrolled more than 20,000 students in the
     communities of Ontario, Montclair, Rancho Cucamonga and portions of
     Fontana, Upland, Chino and Mount Baldy. It contains 8 comprehensive
     high schools and two continuation schools and is currently operating
     above capacity.
          Growth Planning Factors – This district’s Student Generation Rate
          is 0.20 per residential unit. It collects developer fees of $0.64 per
          square foot for residential and $0.10 for commercial. These fees are
          31% of the State Statutory fee of $2.05 for residential and $0.33 for
          commercial.
          Future Planning – With the recent opening of two new high
          schools, attendance boundaries may change. The district continues
          to experience major growth.
    Rialto School District (RSD) –The District serves students in a fifty-
     five square mile area. Included in the boundaries are the City of Rialto,
     the western portion of the City of San Bernardino, small segments of the
     cities of Colton and Fontana, and some unincorporated county territory.
     The District was founded in 1891 and was unified in 1964.
    Summary of School Facilities Planning – All of the districts serving
     Fontana share one commonality: there are aggregate deficiencies in
     facilities to serve Fontana’s students. However, conditions among the
     districts seem to vary: there are cost differentials in fees charged by the
     Districts, locational “holes” in facilities, significant differences in the
     student generation rates used from district to district, and joint-use policy
     distinctions. School district boundaries and school facilities in the
     planning area are mapped in Figure 8-1.

                      service areas, although cooperation between them is required under the               Neighborhood watch
                      State Mutual Aid Pact and has been effectively undertaken.                           Police Cadets
                                                                                                           Explorer Program
                          Standards and Costs – Standards for police and staffing levels vary
                          by City and region due to budget constraints, land use and                       Community Emergency
                                                                                                            Response Team
                          demographics. Standards developed for the Western United States
                          call for 1.8 sworn police officers per 1,000 citizens. The Fontana
                          Police Department (FPD) believes that a more appropriate standard
                          for this City is 1.4 based on its law enforcement needs. The FPD has
                          also adopted a 33% free time standard for its officers to be able to
                          respond on demand, but it must be remembered that to maintain that
                          standard also requires the appropriate level of support staffing.
                          Future Planning and Financing – The Fontana Police Department
                          has developed plans to meet projected residential growth. Although
                          the current police facility is adequate for a City of 160,000, a new
                          contact station is being planned to complement the two existing
                          stations. These small local stations are designed to meet the needs of
                          residents in rapidly growing northern and western areas of the City.
                          Financing law enforcement operations is a very important
                          consideration. Fees are exacted on new development to pay for new
                          facilities. Funding for the operation and maintenance of existing
                          services comes from the General Fund.
                     Fire Protection – The City is served by the Central Valley Fire
                      Protection District (CVFPD) that is part of the San Bernardino County
                      Fire Department. The fire district operates seven stations within or
                      adjacent to the City and, in addition to responses to fires, conducts
                      paramedic and rescue services, hazardous materials handling, structure
                      inspection and education programs.
                          Standards and Costs – Fire departments’ ability to suppress fires has
                          traditionally been rated by the Insurance Service Office (ISO), Inc.,     Fire Station 72 protects the City
                          on a 10-point scale (“1” being the highest) which includes water          of Fontana and unincorporated
                                                                                                    areas of San Bernardino County.
                          supply, equipment, personnel and alarm and paging systems. The            It also serves as the
                          current “ISO” rating for Fontana is Class 3 that falls well above the     administrative headquarters of
                          average. With two additional facilities already planned, the ISO          the San Bernardino County Fire
                          rating may drop to an even more efficient rating of 2. The current        Department’s Valley Division.
                          average response time to any area of the City is 4 to 5 minutes.
                                                Future Planning and Growth – Continued
                                                growth will affect the fire protection services
                                                provided by CVFPD. Since the City pays some
                                                of the costs of fire protection, consistent funding
 on 74 is located in the
                City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                        8-9

                                      and planning is a high priority. In addition, of crucial importance is
                                      the provision of adequate water flows in newly developing areas of
                                      the City.
                                 Library Services – Library service in the City is provided by the San
                                  Bernardino County Library system. The original Fontana Branch
                                  Library, located east of City Hall, is a 13,000 square foot building
                                  constructed in 1963. This facility falls short of reaching the national
                                  minimum standard of two books per capita. The County also maintains
                                  5,500 square feet of part time library space at Kaiser High School via a
                                  joint use agreement with Fontana Unified School District. The facility is
                                  available to the public after school, evenings and Saturdays.
                                      Future Planning and Growth – In 2001, the design for a new and
                                      expanded City library to replace Fontana Branch library was
                                      approved. This 95,000 square foot facility is designated as a
                                      “Resource Center” within the San Bernardino County system. The
Illustration of proposed new          project is classified as Tier 1, First Priority in San Bernardino
City library “resource center.”       County’s Library Facilities Master Plan. Pending final funding and
                                      development, it is planned to contain over 300,000 volumes, a 350-
                                      room auditorium, homework, career and literacy centers and the
                                      latest in educational technology.
                                      To further serve a growing population, the City has expressed a
                                      desire to extend library services. The County’s Library Facilities
                                      Master Plan also incorporates a recommendation for a Tier 2, Second
                                      Priority, 8,500 facility in either northern Fontana or Rialto. The
                                      facility is envisioned as joint use with a high school, similar to the
                                      Kaiser High School Facility already in existence. The City is
                                      exploring alternative funding sources for additional library services
                                      (including City-imposed developer impact fees) in conjunction with
                                      the San Bernardino County Library system.
                                 Health Services – There are five major health care facilities within 12
                                  miles of the planning area that provide full health care and emergency
                                  coverage on a 24-hour basis. The only hospital facility within the City is
                                  the Kaiser Foundation Hospital that contains 465 licensed beds. This
                                  corresponds to almost 8 beds per 1,000 residents, well above the
                                  accepted standard of 4.5 beds. However, this is a private Health
                                  Maintenance Organization open only to members. As a result, some
                                  residents must travel outside of the City limits for health services. Other
                                  health facilities within the City include doctor and dentist offices,
                                  optometrists, health clinics, and nursing homes. A facilities analysis
                                  recently revealed the need within the City for a mental health center and
                                  a burn facility. The central valley fire protection district, a public agency
                                  under contract with the City, provides paramedic service.
                                  Public facilities, including police and fire stations, libraries and
                                  community centers and other City facilities, and utility corridors are

Infrastructure
Water Resources
The City’s water system is mapped in Figure 8-3. Water is provided to the
City primarily by three agencies: The Fontana Water Company (FWC),
Cucamonga County Water District (CCWD) and the West San Bernardino
County Water District (WSBCWD). Two other water agencies, the
Crawford Canyon Water District, and the Marygold Mutual Water Company
provide water for small portions of the planning area in the northern and
eastern portions of the planning area. Together, these companies can meet
the needs of the City and its sphere of influence areas. Though the
infrastructure of each company operates independently, their interface
provides uninterrupted service.
Wastewater
The City’s Sanitary Sewer System is mapped in Figure 8-4. The City
maintains more than 250 miles of 6’-42” sewer lines and six sewage pump
stations, as well as provides industrial wastewater permitting and
enforcement pursuant to the Clean Water Act of 1972. Regional domestic
wastewater treatment services are provided under the Regional Sewer
Service Contract in which seven agencies currently contract with the Inland
Empire Utilities Agency (IEUA). These agencies include Fontana,
Cucamonga County Water District, Montclair, Upland, Chino, Chino Hills
and Ontario.
New development within the planning area will affect four primary service
programs: regional domestic wastewater treatment, non-reclaimable waste
water collection and disposal, importation of supplemental water supplies
and water resources management with the Chino groundwater basin.

The IEUA owns and operates four regional wastewater treatment facilities
and has one under construction. In addition, the Agency owns a co-
composting facility and several domestic and industrial trunk interceptor
sewage lines. It also has four Regional Water Recycling Facilities as well as
the Carbon Canyon Waste Reclamation Facility.
         Growth Planning Standards - Growth planning is closely tied to the
         urban growth forecast put forth by IEUA’s contracting agencies. As
         part of the Regional Contract, member cities or agencies pay
         connection charges of $3,860 per equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) as
         well as monthly fees of $15.06 per EDU. The City also pays a
         capital cost of $770 per EDU. Commercial costs are based on type
         of use and number of fixtures, multiplied by use factor.
         Future Planning and Growth – IEUA began Phase 1 of its regional
         recycled water distribution system project which will ultimately loop
         together the two existing recycled water distribution systems in the
         northern and southern planning areas. Phase 1 will deliver recycled
         water to the largest customers first, helping to develop future project
         development. Major industries and groundwater recharge will be the
         biggest uses of recycled water in the beginning.
Solid Waste
                                                                                 The City of Fontana operates a

Solid waste disposal services for Fontana are provided by Burrtec Waste
Industries, a private company under franchise agreement with the City of
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                   8-19

     Fontana. Burrtec also operates the City’s curbside recycling (including
     greenwaste recycling) program. Currently, the Mid-Valley Landfill located
     adjacent to the City of Fontana, in Rialto, is the primary solid waste
     depository for the area. The landfill is projected to have approximately 40
     years of capacity left.
     The challenge for Fontana, as well as communities throughout the state, is to
     continue to find diversion, recycling and reuse strategies instead of relying
     on sanitary landfills as the primary method of managing solid waste. As the
     region grows, it becomes more difficult to site or expand landfills due to the
     unpopularity of these types of facilities.
     Flood Control
     Both the City and the San Bernardino County Flood Control District provide
     flood control facilities for Fontana. The Flood Control District agency is
     responsible for the construction of dams, containment basins, channels and
     storm drains to intercept and convey flood flows through and away from
     developed areas. The City implements construction and maintenance of local
     storm drains that feed into the County’s area wide system.
     The San Sevaine Creek Project traverses the western edge of the City,
     draining all lands west of Sierra Avenue. The De Clez Channel provides
     protection along the base of the Jurupa Hills in the Southridge Area. Land
     east of Sierra drains to the Rialto Channel. Channelization for the
     southeastern quadrant of the City is being planned. Flood control facilities
     are being built in Fontana north of the I-210 freeway as development
     progresses in that area.
     In addition to these efforts, water quality control mandates from the federal
     government under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
     (NPDES) require permits for storm water discharges from municipal storm
     sewer systems. As a permittee within the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality
     Control Board Basin Plan, the City of Fontana implements a Municipal
     Storm Water Management Plan (MSWMP), which prohibits and regulates
     specific types of discharges, mandates inspections and public education, puts
     controls on new development and redevelopment, and specifies site and
     construction site maintenance practices. The City’s flood control system is
     mapped in Figure 8-5.

Gas Services
Southern California Gas Company provides gas services within Fontana, and
supplies and services adequate and expandable to meet any foreseeable
demands imposed by future development. Extension of service is based on
the initiation of a service contract whose policies and extension rules are on
file with the California Public Utilities Commission.
    Current User Statistics – Typical yearly demand for residential units is
     based on System Area Average/Use Per Meter as follows:

Power
The Southern California Edison Company provides electric power for
Fontana. Service is provided to newly developed areas, as part of a service
contract, and generating capacity for the area is sufficient to accommodate
future growth. As a public utility, SCE is regulated by the state of California
through the Public Utilities Commission. Customer information and tips on
energy conservation are available at the company’s website at –
www.sce.com. Discussion of energy conservation strategies is discussed in
Chapter 9 – Open Space and Conservation – of this document.
Communication Technology
In this digital age, Fontana has made great strides in improving its
communication technology. Its City website at www.fontana.org has
numerous and informative links to City departments, community events and
contact information. Adelphia provides cable television services and some
cable modem service in the City. DSL access to the Internet is available in
the community on a limited basis.
ISSUES, GOALS, POLICIES, & ACTIONS
ISSUE #1: SCHOOL CAPACITY AND ENROLLMENT
How can adequate school capacity be provided as our student population
increases?
Discussion: While schools are not the direct responsibility of the City –
rather that of school districts that serve the community – the provision of
educational facilities is one of the most prominent public facilities challenges
City of Fontana General Plan                                                     8-23

     in a high-growth area that seeks to attract families. Especially since there is a
     separation of responsibility and authority regarding development approvals
     and school development, this requires an unusually active collaboration
     between the City and its supporting school districts.
     Most of Fontana’s students are served by the Fontana Unified School
     District, although portions of the City are within the service areas of
     adjoining districts. Almost every school is at or above capacity and, with the
     steady population growth projected for the area, it will be a challenge to
     build enough classroom capacity for growing student bodies. Although
     planning and construction of schools is the responsibility of local school
     districts, there is much that cities can do to assist this crucial effort.
     Funding for school construction is difficult to obtain, and changing fiscal
     constraints at the state level make it even more of a challenge. New
     development pays for part of school construction, with Fontana’s school fee
     program among the highest in the region at $6.36 per square foot for all
     residential development. It is important to remember that our goal is not just
     to add more portable classrooms, but to work together to build high-quality
     schools that are the pride of students, their families and the community.
     GOAL #1:
     High quality schools with adequate physical capacity are provided in all
     areas of our City.
     Policies:
     1) Planning and development in the City shall continue to be integrated
          with the needs of school districts for new facilities.
     2) Local school districts shall continue to be supported in their efforts to
          obtain additional funding sources, including special assessment districts
          and supplementary state and federal funding.
     3) Effective joint use agreements shall continue to be established and
          maintained with school districts serving the community to achieve
          optimum, cost effective use of school facilities.
     4) Building permits shall continue to be withheld until verification that
          applicable school fees have been collected by the appropriate school
          district.
     5) Collaboration with school districts should occur in designing adjacent
          school/recreation facilities to achieve maximum usability and cost
          effectiveness for both the City and the school districts.
     6) Collaboration with school districts should occur in expanding
          educational opportunities and programs that benefit from City facilities.

                    8. PUBLIC FACILITIES, SERVICES & INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
Actions:
1) Prepare and maintain a school/park facilities planning map and
     associated growth projection for the general plan area, jointly with the
     school districts, that enables consistent planning and implementation of
     schools and parks.
2) Identify forthcoming educational funding initiatives that the City should
     be aware of and support.
3) Review existing joint use agreements and cooperatively develop
     improved agreements where deficiencies are found.
4) Develop joint use agreements with districts where none presently exist.
5) Review the development approval process and verify appropriate
     safeguards for the collection of school fees prior to occupancy.
6) Evaluate and document the opportunities for City facilities to be treated
     as assets for the school system. Pursue opportunities thus defined.
7) Evaluate cooperative program opportunities for consideration as ways to
     provide additional community educational benefits through City/school
     districts collaboration.
ISSUE #2: LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRE
PROTECTION
How can our City continue to improve its police and fire protection
services?
Discussion: Law enforcement, and the related reality and sense of security
associated with superior protection of life and property from criminal activity
is a major factor in the quality of life attractions of the community.
Accordingly, adequate facilities effectively distributed throughout the
community staffed by a sufficient number of police officers and support
personnel remains a very high priority. The fact that the City has its own
police department provides an opportunity to focus attention on levels of
service and the means to sustain it or improve upon it as the community
evolves.
The Fontana police department (FPD) has continued to expand to meet the
needs of its growing population. Its current ratio of officers per 1,000
residents stands at 1.0, and its goal of 33% free time for patrol officers has
been met. The free time standard enables officers to respond to emergencies
and be out in the field. As the population grows, this free time percentage
can only be maintained if support staff positions are also added. Since the
City does not have its own fire department, emergency services and disaster
preparedness planning is the responsibility of the FPD. As it grows, the
City of Fontana General Plan                                                    8-25
     department must make important decisions on the location of new facilities
     and the best use of its budget.
     For fire protection, the City contracts with the central valley fire protection
     district, part of the San Bernardino County Fire Agency. Paramedics are
     provided and each station, and current response time to any area of the City
     is 4 to 5 minutes.
     GOAL #2:
     Our law enforcement and fire protection services meet our population’s
     public safety needs and contribute to a sense of safety and high quality of
     life in our community.
     Policies:
     1) Continue to work towards a ratio of 1.4 sworn police officers per 1,000
          residents in the City.
     2) Continue to achieve 33% free time for police patrol officers.
     3) The FPD’s area commander program shall continue to be expanded in
          order to more effectively serve specific areas of the City.
     4) The FPD’s contact stations program shall be expanded to more
          efficiently serve outlying areas.
     5) The FPD’s school resource officer program shall be continued on all
          current and future middle school campuses.
     6) The FPD’s extensive volunteer crime prevention programs, including
          citizen volunteers, explorers, and citizens on patrol, neighborhood watch,
          police reserves, and community emergency response team shall be
          continued.
     7) The FPD’s bilingual incentive program should be continued in order to
          more effectively serve the Latino community
     8) Adequate fire and police response times shall be maintained in the City.
     9) An “ISO” fire rating of class 3 shall continue to be maintained in the
          City.
     10) Ensure that new fire stations shall be built in areas of new development
          so that response times are not eroded.
     Actions:
     1) Incorporate appropriate staffing levels in the annual budget process
          keyed to City growth in population and employment.

                    8. PUBLIC FACILITIES, SERVICES & INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
2) Develop procedures for providing neighborhood contact stations as new
     areas in the City develop as well as for any portions of the City deemed
     deficient.
3) Prepare a planning map and action plan that identifies police/fire station
     development strategies to accommodate new growth patterns.
4) Evaluate the potential for combining new police/fire facilities where it
     can be demonstrated that public investment would best be served.
5) Prepare and maintain an action plan to achieve improvements that will
     maintain the class 3 ISO fire rating.
ISSUE #3: LIBRARY, CIVIC CENTER AND CIVIC
AUDITORIUM
How can our City best provide for civic functions, library services and
performing arts capabilities?
Discussion: The City’s civic center campus is our public “downtown.” Its
proximity to the historic commercial downtown reinforces the vitality of both
functions. To the extent that additional public serving functions can be
located here, the convenience factor and synergy with nearby private
commercial enterprise will improve. This also represents a stronger return
on the public’s investment.
The key component of Fontana’s downtown revitalization efforts is its re-
planned civic center campus, which could include a new state-of-the-art
library. Located on Sierra Avenue, the new facilities are planned to be
highly visible, accessible and attractive. By combining civic, educational
and cultural facilities in one convenient area, the City has taken an important
step in filling a key community need. The existing City-owned Fontana
Civic Auditorium on Sierra Avenue south of downtown Fontana is another
opportunity for quality improvements.
San Bernardino County’s Library Facilities Master Plan provides specific
direction for the enhancement and expansion of library services, including
new branch libraries in Fontana in new buildings and joint use facilities. It
will be critical for the City to work closely with the County and school
districts in implementing this Plan.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                    8-27

     GOAL #3:
     Our new civic center campus, along with the new Fontana library,
     fulfills its vision as a multi-use community focal point, providing civic,
     educational, entertainment and cultural uses.
     Policies:
     1) The public uses and quality of the civic center campus should seek to be
         strengthened, as this are becomes a major focal point for the community.
     2) A new library in the civic center shall be maintained in such a way that it
         functions as a key educational center and community gathering place.
     3) Library services should be provided in selected convenient locations in
         outlying sectors of the community, in coordination with school districts
         for joint use.
     4) A basic level of facility support for community arts performances should
         be maintained.
     Actions:
     1) Evaluate the potential for expanding/diversifying public uses in the civic
         center campus.
     2) Coordinate with San Bernardino County in implementing its library
         strategic plan for locating, funding and diversifying library facilities/
         services over the next 20 years, including methods of sustaining
         community library services support.
     3) Determine the extent to which the City is willing and able to facilitate
         continuing performing arts opportunities within the City. Options could
         include non-profit organization support, City partnerships, joint
         programs with school districts, scaled-back community theater
         operations, collaboration with regional arts foundations or some
         combination or phasing of these options.
     ISSUE #4: HEALTH CARE SERVICES
     How can our City improve the provision of health care services for all
     segments of the community?
     Discussion: Except for the provision of paramedic services, health care is a
     private sector activity. Yet, it is certainly a mark of community quality to
     have health care facilities conveniently located for City residents and
     workers. The City’s role, then, is to promote and support the location of
     appropriate health care facilities to serve the community, working with health
     care organizations that express an interest in serving this health care market.

                    8. PUBLIC FACILITIES, SERVICES & INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
As Fontana and the region around it continue to grow, there will be
increasing demand on health care facilities. Although the Kaiser foundation
hospital contains almost 500 beds, and will treat emergency patients who are
not members of the Kaiser HMO, it is a private facility, and the only hospital
within the City limits. There are several health clinics and nursing homes,
but the City is without a mental health clinic and a burn facility.
GOAL #4:
Health care services in our City are accessible and comprehensive,
meeting the needs of all segments of the population.
Policies:
1) Community paramedic service shall continue to be provided through the
     City’s contract with the Central Valley Fire Protection District.
2) Health care facilities capable of broadly serving the public’s needs shall
     be sought for location within the City, including facilities for specialized
     care, where there is a sufficient patient base.
Actions:
1) Form a public/private health care advisory committee to assess the health
     care services within the City with the goal of making recommendations
     for their continued improvement. This evaluation should include the
     need for general hospital services, emergency care, mental health
     services, burn treatment and medical services for low/moderate income
     residents.
ISSUE #5: INFRASTRUCTURE QUALITY AND
RELIABILITY
How will our City continue to provide adequate and high quality
infrastructure to serve existing and future residents?
Discussion: As the population within Fontana and the region has exploded,
the City has done a remarkable job building the infrastructure to support this
growth. Nevertheless, much more needs to be done. The City has adopted
the Seven-to-Ten Year Robert W. Weddle Capital Improvements Program,
named after esteemed City engineer Robert W. Weddle (who served the City
from 1990-2001), which consists of 27 separate projects to increase traffic
circulation, storm drainage, sewer facilities, and flood control improvements.
The City is working to improve its parks and recreation system (See Chapter
10, Parks and Recreation Element), water provision facilities, solid waste
reduction programs, and communications technology connectivity.
Determining funding strategies for infrastructure is an ongoing process, and
the City needs to employ a variety of strategies in its implementation
program.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                      8-29

     GOAL #5
     Careful planning ensures the timely, logical and cost-effective
     development of infrastructure facilities in our City.
     Policies:
     1) Development and supporting infrastructure shall be phased so that
          contemporary infrastructure is available concurrent with the occupancy
          of development projects.
     2) Development should be approved in a pattern that avoids the need to
          extend infrastructure excessive distances to provide service and support.
     3) Infrastructure installation shall be coordinated within public rights-of-
          way so that multiple disruptions are avoided.
     4) Sufficient financial support for infrastructure maintenance shall be
          devoted so that current levels of service, health and safety are sustained
          or improved.
     5) Development within the City’s sphere of influence shall be accompanied
          by infrastructure at the same standards as those imposed by the City.
     Actions:
     1) Review standard conditions of approval for development projects to
          determine if infrastructure requirements are sufficient or if they need to
          be modernized.
     2) Review the master plans of drainage and sewers to determine if their
          provisions or standards need to be modified.
     3) Include all aspects of infrastructure maintenance, including repair,
          upgrade and replacement, in the annual budget process, based on an
          assessment of infrastructure conditions throughout the City.
     4) Review county infrastructure standards and seek adoption of more
          stringent standards if necessary to conform to City requirements.
     5) Develop a full funding mechanism to provide for long term maintenance
          and replacement costs.
     ISSUE #6: WASTEWATER TREATMENT
     How can our City best manage its wastewater?
     Discussion: The City contracts wastewater treatment services as part of a
     joint utility agency, IEUA, and the City of Rialto. The City needs to dispose
     of its wastewater in a manner that is both cost-effective and environmentally
     sound. The goal is to recapture and treat as much wastewater as possible for
8-30             PUBLIC FACILITIES, SERVICES & INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT

                    8. PUBLIC FACILITIES, SERVICES & INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
selective use because water is and will continue to be an ever more precious
resource in our semi-arid environment. Finally, the City must also comply
with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and provide the highest quality
effluent for reuse.
GOAL #6
Our City manages its wastewater in an environmentally sound and cost-
effective manner.
Policies:
1) The City’s current Master Plan of Sewers shall be maintained as the basis
     for development of a sewerage system to serve the community.
2) The City’s local and trunk sewer system shall be designed and operated
     its in close collaboration with the Inland Empire Utilities Agency.
3) An aggressive water-recycling program shall be established and
     maintained in City.
4) Sufficient financial support for wastewater system maintenance (repair,
     upgrade, replacement, preventive maintenance) shall be devoted so that
     current levels of service, health and safety are sustained or improved.
5) Federal, State and local ordinances shall be enforced in order to comply
     with Clean Water Act/NPDES requirements.
Actions:
1) Review and update or schedule the update of the Master Plan of Sewers.
2) Effectively and efficiently maintain a sewage collection system that is in
     compliance with Clean Water Act standards and provisions.
3) Enforce all Clean Water Act regulations.
4) Prepare and implement a water-recycling program in conjunction with
     the IEUA.
ISSUE #7: REDUCING SOLID WASTE
How can the City best continue to reduce the amount of its solid waste and
dispose of it?
                       Discussion: The recycling and disposal of solid waste
                       has become an important state, regional and local       The City of Fontana is one
                                                                               of the 15, zero-waste
                       concern. The goal is to reduce the growing waste stream communities participating
                       generated by residences and businesses and to find      with the County of San
sufficient land for its disposal. The City of Fontana’s adopted Source         Bernardino to reduce solid
                                                                               waste by residents and

     Element (HHW) guide solid waste handling in the City in response to State
     legislative (AB949) mandates. In the year 2000, the City met its recycling
     goal of 50% diversion rate, achieving a total rate of 54%. Further gains in
     waste reduction are ever more challenging on a per-capita basis because of
     reductions already achieved. Absent new technological breakthroughs on
     solid waste reduction, the City’s main course of action is to incrementally
     and continuously seek further reductions in the waste stream its resident and
     business citizens generate.
     GOAL #7
     Our City has one of the most effective solid waste reduction and
     recycling records in the County.
     Policies:
     1) Where joint programs offer improved efficiency or reduced cost, the City
         shall collaborate with other entities in waste recycling efforts.
     2) Services shall continue to be provided to resident and business citizens
         that facilitate community cleanup, curbside collections and diversion of
         oil and other hazardous waste materials.
     3) An aggressive public education program shall be maintained to stimulate
         recycling, reuse and waste reduction by its resident and business citizens.
     Actions:
     1) Continue to implement the policies and programs identified in the City’s
         SRR and HHW, and annually evaluate their effectiveness.
     2) Review and evaluate the current waste hauling contract to determine if it
         can be improved upon with respect to cost and recycling effectiveness.
     3) Evaluate and update hazardous waste management programs and
         implement improvements based on current best practices.
     4) Evaluate and update community education programs on solid and
         hazardous waste disposal to insure that this information is as broadly
         available as possible, especially through the school system.
     ISSUE #8: IMPROVING FLOOD CONTROL
     FACILITIES
     How can our City most effectively finance and complete its flood control
     system?
     Discussion: The City is actively completing its flood control/storm drainage
     infrastructure. The master plan storm drains are those that collect run-off
     from local areas and drainage systems and discharge it to major drainage
     facilities. The County is planning improvements on the San Sevaine and

Etiwanda Channels while the City is concentrating on the channels and
storms drains that link to them. In most cases, master plan storm drainage
facilities are planned for the required 100-year flood protection.
The City has adopted a Master Storm Drainage Plan and a fee program to
finance it. Nevertheless, successful completion of the plan requires
continued cooperation with the San Bernardino County Flood Control
District and project-based exactions in compliance with the plan.
GOAL #8
Our City’s flood control and drainage system is equitably financed and
offers exceptional protection of lives and property over a full range of
minor to major floods.
Policies:
1) Maintain the City’s current Master Storm Drainage Plan as the basis for
     development of a flood control system to serve the community.
2) Drainage planning and implementation shall be coordinated with the San
     Bernardino Flood Control District and adjacent cities.
3) Dual use concepts should be applied to flood control design as a means
     of enhancing open space/habitat and conserving water.
4) Upstream runoff management and facilities should be influenced within
     the City’s sphere of influence and beyond.
Actions:
1) Review and update or schedule the update of the Master Storm Drainage
     Plan.
2) Condition development based on safety and environmental
     considerations related to flooding.
ISSUE #9: PUBLIC UTILITIES
How can our City best be served by public utilities that offer reasonable
cost and state-of-the-art services?
Discussion: We have assumed in the past that certain necessary utility
services such as electrical power, gas and telephone would always be
provided in response to growth. These are facilities and services provided by
private companies under some form of Public Utilities Commission
oversight. As our community continues to develop in previously vacant
areas, coordination with public utility companies to ensure seamless service
provision will be necessary.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                  8-33

     GOAL #9
     Public utility companies provide contemporary levels of service in our
     community at competitive rates.
     Policies:
     1) Growth projections should be provided to utility companies periodically
          as the basis for their projection of facility and service needs to support
          community development.
     2) The installation of utilities shall be coordinated so that disruption of
          public rights-of-way and private property is kept to a minimum.
     3) Collaboration with utility companies shall occur to achieve the maximum
          undergrounding of utility lines commensurate with available funds.
     Actions:
     1) Design and distribute annual estimates and projections of growth to
          utility providers in the City’s planning area.
     2) Establish and maintain a utility coordinating process to coordinate
          installation of utility pipes and lines in public rights-of-way and through
          private property. Include provisions for appropriately conditioning
          development projects.
     3) Establish and maintain a utility undergrounding program.
     ISSUE #10: ENHANCED COMMUNICATION
     TECHNOLOGY
     How can our City build an integrated telecommunications network that
     links homes, business, schools and local government?
     Discussion: More and more communities are becoming “wired”. This
     means they are building a community “Intranet” which connects homes with
     each other and with the myriad of public and private services available to
     them. A communications-based infrastructure has so many advantages
     beyond entertainment and education – it reduces excess vehicle trips,
     disseminates information on government and community events, provides a
     forum for interactive Town Hall meetings, and gives homes and business
     instant links to security.
     Fontana has already made great strides in communications technology, and it
     is positioning itself to do much more. Its “Fiber to the Community” program
     is envisioned as going far beyond high-speed Internet service; the City
     intends to develop and set into motion a comprehensive plan designed to
     bring an array of services to residents, businesses and local government,
     including phone services. The obvious challenge for the City is to link
     existing areas as well as rapidly growing areas to the north.

                    8. PUBLIC FACILITIES, SERVICES & INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
GOAL #10:
Our City uses the latest in communication technology to conveniently
link homes, businesses, schools and public facilities to a dynamic
community Intranet.
Policies:
1) Incentives shall be provided to developers of new residential areas to
     provide built-in communications infrastructure.
2) Local school districts should be supported in their efforts to provide
     connections to the Intra- and Internet.
3) Informational kiosks, with links to City departments, library resources,
     local events and local businesses should be placed in prominent public
     facilities and activity centers.
4) “Smart” home design, equipped with sensors for efficient heating and
     cooling, supports “green building” concepts of energy efficiency and
     should be encouraged by the City when approving new development.
5) Contemporary and forward looking communications and computer
     support systems, including both “wired” (fiber optics) and wireless
     modes, should be promoted.
6) Use the City’s evolving “Intranet” to facilitate participation in interactive
     neighborhood and Town Hall meetings.
Actions:
1) Adopt a five-year communications technology plan incorporating the
     needs of residents, business and public agencies.
2) Design and implement a telecommunications incentive plan for project
     review of new development.
3) Prepare a Citywide communications strategy to include initiatives for
     wired and wireless systems to provide leading edge communications
     access to residents and businesses.

Chapter 9.                  Open Space &
Conservation Element
INTRODUCTION
As the city continues to evolve from an agricultural and industrial base to a
modern bedroom community with a stable and varied employment base, the
pressure to convert the remaining natural and disturbed open land to a variety
of urbanized uses will increase. Without proper guidance and sound
management practices, the process of urbanization could eliminate or harm
natural land and water resources that provide important ecological, scenic,
and other environmental values that would be difficult, if not impossible, to
replace. To meet the growing need for outdoor recreation, it will be
important to plan for conservation and use of ‗built‘ open spaces that can or
do provide recreational opportunities, including parks, public utility
corridors, flood control channels, and trail networks. There will also be
pressure to redevelop older properties within the City‘s existing urban
pattern, including sites that contain important examples of the historical
development of the community. Preservation of its landmark structures and
sites provides an important linkage to the City‘s past, while maintaining the
cultural heritage that is an important aspect of the City‘s identity.
The purpose of this chapter is to define and establish an open space and
conservation system, together with conservation and management policies
and action programs that will preserve the highest priority resources, while
balancing the land needs of an ever-expanding population. Successful
achievement of this goal will thus enhance the quality of life for the citizens
of Fontana.
Adoption of a comprehensive open space plan is required before the City
may adopt zoning regulations to restrict land uses within the open space
framework, and to ensure that such zoning standards are consistent with the
open space plan. Furthermore, acquisition or disposition of open space lands
must be consistent with the adopted open space plan.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                  9-1

    Scope
    This element addresses the conservation, utilization and development of
    natural and cultural resources and a variety of open space uses, and satisfies
    the statutory requirements of Chapter 3, Articles 3 and 5, of the California
    Government Code with respect to the contents of both an Open Space
    Element and a Conservation Element. It has been prepared as a combined
    element and is hereinafter referred to as the Open Space/Conservation
    Element, or OS/C Element.
    Specifically, this element describes the natural, undeveloped but disturbed,
    and ‗built‘ open spaces found throughout the planning area, identifies areas
    where natural hazards occur, defines the land and water resources that
    warrant conservation or other protection, and sets forth the City‘s goals,
    policies and action programs for long-term management of an integrated
    open space network.
    The open space and conservation policies set forth in this element are closely
    linked to and either directly or indirectly affect several other general plan
    elements, including Land Use, Parks and Recreation, Safety and Community
    Design. Where appropriate, references to specific sections within those other
    elements are noted, particularly where additional details and more
    background information are presented in the linked element.
    Within the Land Use Element, for example, there are three types of open
    space or conservation designations that are consistent with the policies
    defined within this C/OS Element. These include:
       Open Space including publicly-owned land on steep slopes of the
        foothills in the northern and southern periphery of the planning area, and
        conservation or specific open space management strategies, are
        designated as Open Space. Land uses are restricted to quarries, flood
        control facilities, ground water recharge basins, and agriculture.
       Recreation Facilities including local and regional parks and any other
        recreational facility operated by a public or quasi-public agency.
       Public Utility Corridors where there are existing easements for public
        utilities.
    The Parks and Recreation Element contains additional information
    concerning the existing and future parks, trails, and other public outdoor
    recreation resources within the planning area, including the planning
    standards that will guide the location, size and level of improvements for
    those resources.
    A range of natural hazards are described in detail within the Safety Element,
    including their location within the planning area, history of occurrence, the
    nature, magnitude and potential level of damage associated with each kind of
    hazard, and specific strategies to limit exposure to these hazards, and to
9-2                                                      OPEN SPACE & CONSERVATION ELEMENT

                                                                            9. OPEN SPACE & CONSERVATION ELEMENT
minimize potential consequences to people, property and various critical and
essential facilities.
Through establishment of an open space framework, this Element supports
the overall community design themes, for example, by providing open space
buffers around and linkages through developed areas. This provides visual
relief from the intensity of urban living, as well as passive and active
recreational opportunities within a convenient distance of local residents.
ACHIEVING THE VISION
During the general plan visioning process, several themes were identified
with respect to conservation and open space values, including:
          Conservation of the open space character of the northern and
          southern foothills
          Expansion and linkage of recreational and visual open space
          throughout the developed community
          Preservation of the City‘s historical buildings and neighborhoods
          Creation of safe and attractive neighborhoods
This Open Space/Conservation Element addresses all of these community
values, and a variety of regulatory mandates falling under the City‘s local
government authority to implement. Examples of such mandates include:
          Conservation of endangered species and habitat
          Preservation of cultural and historic resources
          Protection of water resources
          Avoidance and mitigation of natural hazards
          Consideration of agricultural and mineral resources in land use
          planning decisions
Through sound conservation and management strategies, this plan provides
an open space and conservation framework that will enhance the quality of
life for existing and future city residents, visitors and businesses.
PLAN COMPONENTS
This section describes the range of natural and cultural resources, natural
hazards, and open space uses included in the Open Space/Conservation
Element.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                               9-3

    Cultural Resources
    Cultural resources included in this element include a variety of remnants or
    complete, intact examples of human settlement in the planning area,
    including the prehistoric or archaeologic era, the historical era, and
    contemporary culture. The prehistoric era involved occupation by semi-
    nomadic people who subsisted by hunting and gathering. The historic era
    spans hundreds of years, from the time of Spanish occupation, to the
    beginnings of what is now known as Fontana. Contemporary cultural
    resources include a range of unique sites and structures that have special
    meaning for Fontana residents, such as the old Kaiser Steel Plant site,
    eucalyptus tree rows, the Almenia Underpass on Foothill Boulevard, etc.
    Agricultural Resources
    Citrus orchards, vineyards livestock, and poultry farming have been the
    principal forms of agriculture found in Fontana. While prominent in the
    City‘s past, these agricultural practices have declined in response to
    population growth and land development pressures, and are no longer a
    significant element of the local economy. Remaining, undeveloped land
    considered suitable for farming purposes is planned for a variety of urbanized
    uses, including residential, commercial and industrial development. Given
    the minor level of investment in existing agricultural operations, limited
    supply of suitable farmland and the City‘s preference for accommodation of
    population growth and economic development, agricultural resources are not
    included as a component of the proposed open space and conservation plan.
    Biotic Resources
    While there are many forms of plants and wildlife that occur in this area, the
    focus of this element is on native species that have been reduced because of
    encroaching urbanization and competition with non-native and exotic species
    which out-compete the native species for the limited water and food base.
    This element discusses the natural habitats and sensitive species occurring in
    the San Gabriel foothills and the Jurupa Hills, along with other sensitive
    biotic resources that provide important ecological values. Given the dry
    climate and mostly flat valley topography, there are very few aquatic
    resources in the planning area. The few intermittent streams that do occur in
    the San Gabriel foothills are described in Appendix D, Biological Resources
    Survey Data.
    Mineral Resources
    Mineral resources include any form of natural rock materials that have
    commercial value. In the planning area, the most significant mineral
    resource consists of sand and gravel deposits in the alluvial fan that extends
    southward from the base of the San Gabriel foothills. Sand and gravel
9-4                                                     OPEN SPACE & CONSERVATION ELEMENT

                                                                                 9. OPEN SPACE & CONSERVATION ELEMENT
aggregates are essential ingredients in construction materials such as
concrete, plaster and mortar. Substantial sand and gravel deposits are also
found outside of the planning area, within the Lytle Creek alluvial wash.
There are no known deposits of precious gemstones, ores, or unique or rare
minerals in the planning area.
There are no active sand and gravel mining operations in the City limits, and
there is one active operation in the Sphere of Influence, south of the Fontana
Speedway in an industrial area. There are no pending proposals to establish
any new surface mining operations within the planning area, and it is likely
that any such proposals would be met with strong opposition, due to
anticipated conflicts with existing land use plans and established land use
patterns. Given these considerations, conservation of mineral resource lands
will not be included in the proposed open space and conservation plan.
Natural Hazards
Natural hazards included in this element involve earthquake faults and traces
of faults, areas of easily liquefiable soils during seismic ground shaking,
flood plains, flammable vegetation-covered hillsides in or adjacent to
development, steep topography susceptible to landslides, soils slips debris
flows and rock falls. These areas require development restrictions or special
management to avoid and/or minimize exposure of people, homes,
businesses, schools, hospitals, utility lines, etc. to the dangers associated with
these hazards. Natural and other hazards affecting the planning area are
addressed in much greater detail in the Safety Element, and are not included
in the proposed open space and conservation plan.
Open Space
Open space land is defined in Section 65660 (b) of the California
Government Code as ―…any parcel or area of land or water which is
essentially unimproved and devoted to an open space use…and which is
designated as such on a local, regional or state open space plan.‖ Within the
Fontana planning area, lands that fit this definition include:
          Plant and animal habitat, areas maintained for ecologic and other
          scientific study purposes; and streams and stream banks
          Land used for the managed production of resources, including
          farmland and other agricultural uses, mineral resource deposits, and
          ground water recharge
          Outdoor recreation areas, including areas of outstanding scenic,
          historic and cultural value; land currently used for or particularly
          suited for parks and recreation; and linkages between important
          recreation areas, including utility easements and trails
          Open space for public health and safety, including earthquake fault
          zones, unstable soil areas, flood plains, steep slopes, areas prone to
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                    9-5

             wild land fire hazards; and areas required for water storage and water
             quality protection
    The Fontana planning area encompasses natural, recreational, mixed-use,
    landscaped and undefined open spaces. Natural open spaces are limited to
    undeveloped land retaining natural vegetation that has been unaltered by
    human activities (San Gabriel foothills and Jurupa Hills). These areas
    support natural plant communities and a range of sensitive plants and animal
    species, and may contain a variety of natural hazards, such as highly
    flammable vegetation, steep and unstable slopes, and periodic flooding.
    Recreational open spaces are mainly developed parks where a variety of
    athletic and passive recreational activities occur. They also include passive
    recreational spaces and trails within a natural setting, such as the
    undeveloped portions of the Martin-Tudor-Jurupa Hills Regional Park.
    Mixed-use open spaces have a primary purpose other than recreation, but
    also provide a wide range of recreational and open space uses. For example,
    flood control channels, power, water and natural gas transmission corridors,
    quarries, can each be part of or a linkage to a recreational trail system. Other
    examples include an open space managed for its natural resource value, such
    as a ground water recharge basin, where public recreation uses are also
    allowed, or a quarry site that has been partially or fully reclaimed for public
    recreation or other open space uses.
    Landscaped open spaces in the planning area are the private and public
    ‗green belts‘ and golf courses found in the more recently developed master
    planned communities, such as Sierra Lakes.
    Undefined open spaces include vacant land beyond the existing urban limits
    that is not occupied with any structures, but which has been altered from its
    natural state, usually by past agricultural activities. Vacant lots in infill
    locations are not included in this element, unless they have been identified by
    the City for future park use.
    Outdoor Recreation
    Developed and passive parks, as well as linear trail systems along flood
    control channels and utility corridors, and any other open area under public
    ownership and available for recreation uses are included within the OS/C
    Element because of their important open space and recreation values. Parks
    and other recreation resources to meet the needs of existing and future
    residents are addressed in detail in the Parks, Recreation and Trails Element.
    Water Resources
    This component of the open space and conservation plan includes
    groundwater recharge basins and other water storage facilities, as well as
9-6                                                       OPEN SPACE & CONSERVATION ELEMENT

                                                                               9. OPEN SPACE & CONSERVATION ELEMENT
major water transmission and treatment facilities found in the planning area.
The City obtains its water supply from three water service agencies and does
not control any of the water sources, or any of the supply, storage and
distribution facilities. Information concerning the three agencies, their water
supply sources and current and projected future water demand for the
respective service areas are also discussed in the Existing Conditions section
of this Element. A reliable and safe drinking water supply is essential for
sustaining the City‘s growth and for maintaining the high quality of life
envisioned by this general plan. Since a majority of the City‘s water supply
is from local ground water sources, protection of those sources from
pollution is critical to the water resource management program. Urban
runoff from streets, rooftops, parking lots, industrial storage yards,
landscaped areas, lawns, drainage and flood control channels, etc. has
become the main source of water pollution affecting the region‘s ground
water supplies. This issue and the City‘s current water quality program are
discussed in the Existing Conditions section of this Element.
Open Space and Conservation Framework
Based on an evaluation of the natural and cultural resources that occur in the
planning area, and in consideration of the broader land use policies that are
described in the Land Use Element, an open space and conservation
framework has been defined, as shown in Figure 9-1. This framework
identifies those open areas with the highest priority for permanent
conservation and management for various open space, natural resource
protection, hazard avoidance, and recreation purposes.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
Water Resources
A reliable water supply is essential for the survival and sustainability of any
community. As the city grows, its demand for both potable and non-potable
water will increase, and in this arid climate, providing sufficient water supply
to satisfy the increased water demand is becoming more difficult every year.
Efficient use, protection and conservation of water resources are high
priorities in the Open Space/Conservation Element.
Local and Regional Water Supply Sources
Fontana is within the eastern/upper portion of the Chino Ground Water
Basin, one of the largest groundwater basins in southern California. With an
estimated supply of five million acre-feet throughout the basin, and roughly
1,000,000 acre feet of unused storage capacity, this basin is an integral part
of the regional and statewide water supply system.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                  9-7

    The Santa Ana River provides the primary drainage functions for the Chino
    Basin, flowing 69 miles across a watershed that originates in the San
    Bernardino Mountains and ultimately flows to the Pacific Ocean.
    There is limited surface water runoff within the planning area, primarily from
    canyon drainages in the northern sphere area, and from surface drainages
    flowing north from the Jurupa Hills, in the southern edge of the planning
    area. Surface flows from the northern canyons are intercepted by flood
    control channels, which flow south and ultimately discharge into the Santa
    Ana River system. Runoff from the southern drainages are also by local
    storm drainage systems, and conveyed to large channels that ultimately
    discharge to the Santa Ana River. Given the capture of the surface drainage
    flows by local and regional drainage facilities, surface water runoff is an
    insignificant water supply source within the planning area.

There are a number of flood control/ground water recharge basins found
within and adjacent to the planning area, as shown on Figure 9-1, Open
Space and Conservation Framework. These are owned and maintained by
other governmental agencies such as the San Bernardino County Flood
Control District. These basins are an important component of the overall
system of water supply. They provide storage for locally produced ground
water and could also provide storage for recycled water when recycled water
treatment and distribution facilities are developed and expanded throughout
this area.

The Inland Empire Utilities Agency (IEUA) distributes water, provides
industrial/municipal wastewater collection and treatment services, and other
related utility services throughout the Chino Basin. Its service area covers a
242 square mile area in the southwestern portion of San Bernardino County.
IEUA serves the cities of Chino, Fontana, Chino Hills, Montclair, Ontario,
Rancho Cucamonga, and Upland, as well unincorporated territory within San
Bernardino County.
Fontana Water Company (FWC), a division of the San Gabriel Valley Water
Company and a member agency of IEUA, serves most of the planning area,
as shown on Figure 9-2.
The Cucamonga County Water District (CCWD), a member of IEUA,
provides service to the Heritage community, in the area bordered by Baseline
Avenue, Cherry Avenue Foothill Boulevard and East Avenue.
West San Bernardino County Water District (WSBCWD) provides service to
two mostly undeveloped areas, one in the northern periphery along both sides
of I-15, extending south roughly to Summit Avenue, and the other in the
southeastern corner of the planning area. WSBCWD is currently not a
member agency of IEUA.
Two other water agencies serve small portions of the planning area. The
Crawford Canyon Water District provides water service to less than 20
connections in the northern part of the planning area, including some
residential and some agricultural users. The Marygold Mutual Water
Company provides potable water service to approximately 300 residential
and commercial connections in the fully urbanized area bordered by Sierra
Avenue on the west, Alder Avenue on the east, San Bernardino Avenue on
the north, and the I-10 Freeway on the south.

     Water Supply and Demand
Existing and projected future water supplies and demand estimates for the
three major water agencies serving the planning area are summarized below.
Information specific to the Fontana planning area was not available from any
of the three agencies.
     Fontana Water Company (FWC)
In 1999 FWC delivered 38,390 acre-feet of water to approximately 121,247
people and a variety of other water users through 34,150 service connections.
This compares to a total available supply of approximately 92,003 acre-
feet/year (af/yr), leaving a surplus of roughly 53,613 af/yr. Total water
demand within the FWC service area is projected to increase to 60,767 acre-
feet/year by the year 2020.
FWC produces water from seasonal stream flow from Lytle Creek and from
wells in the Lytle Creek Basin, Colton-Rialto Basin, the Chino Basin, and a
separate basin. The Company is also able to purchase treated water from
CCWD, as well as imported water from IEUA.
Over the next 20 years, FWC plans to rely more on ground water and to
reduce the need for purchased of imported water. Increased water supplies
will be achieved through drilling of new wells and conservation efforts.
According to FWC staff, sufficient water supply and system capacity are
available to produce two to three times current production quantities;
therefore available water supplies are expected to be sufficient to meet the
projected demand for the year 2020.
     Cucamonga County Water District
Cucamonga County Water District (CCWD) provides water to a service area
covering approximately 52 square miles, comprised mainly of the City of
Rancho Cucamonga. The District also provides water to small portions of
the cities of Upland, Ontario, Fontana and unincorporated areas of San
Bernardino County.
In 2000, the District delivered 48,000 acre-feet to about 140,000 people and a
variety of other water uses through 40,000 service connections. This
compares to a total available supply of approximately 51,800 acre-feet/year
(af/yr), leaving a surplus of roughly 3,800 af/yr. By 2020, the service area
population is forecast to reach approximately 214,000 and total water
demand is projected to increase to 70,310-acre feet/year.
Projected supplies for 2020, assuming average rates of precipitation, are
estimated at 80,400 af/yr, which would be more than enough to meet all of
the projected water demand. In multiple dry years, total water supplies
would be reduced; however total demand would also be reduced through a
variety of conservation measures.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                9-15
     CCWD obtains water from several sources, including groundwater from the
     Cucamonga Basin and the Chino Basin, imported State Project water, and
     local surface and sub-surface flows from four local canyon watersheds. In
     2000, over half of the District‘s water supplies were from purchases of
     imported water. Over the next 20 years, the District plans to rely more on
     ground water and to reduce the need for purchase of imported water.
     Increased water supplies will be achieved through drilling of new wells and
     conservation efforts.
          West San Bernardino County Water District
     West San Bernardino County Water District (WSBCWD) provides water
     service to a 31.7 square mile area, located in portions of southwestern San
     Bernardino County and northern Riverside County. Within the Fontana
     Planning Area, WSBCWD provides service to two mostly undeveloped
     areas, one in the northern periphery along both sides of I-15, extending south
     roughly to Summit Avenue, and the other in the southeastern corner of the
     planning area.
     In the year 2000, the District supplied approximately 18.3 million gallons a
     day to a total service area population of approximately 52,000, via 16,005
     service connections. Approximately 80% of the water demand was for
     residential uses. The District projects continued growth in water demand,
     with a forecast of more than 30,000 connections in the year 2020 to deliver
     nearly 28 million gallons per day.
     Water sources include Lytle Creek surface flows, ground water from the
     Lytle, Rialto, Bunker Hill, North Riverside and Chino basins, and imported
     water through the State Water Project. The District maintains approximately
     20 wells and one water filtration facility, with a total combined capacity of
     approximately 36.5 million gallons/day (mgd).
     In 2001, the District had 59.75 million gallons of reservoir storage capacity,
     with plans to construct two more reservoirs by 2004, to add nine million
     gallons of additional storage. They plan to drill additional wells to expand
     their water supplies, commensurate with increasing water demand. The
     District will continue to rely primarily on Lytle Creek surface flows and local
     groundwater to maintain its water supplies and meet increasing water
     demand.
          Water Source Reliability
     The imported water supplies available to Southern California are increasingly
     uncertain; therefore, the development and conservation of local, reliable
     water supplies and expanded water conservation programs are of critical
     importance to the future of the Fontana Planning area and the entire Chino
     Basin.
     Section 10631 of the State Water Code requires water agencies to address the
     reliability of their water supplies with respect to vulnerabilities involving

                                                                                9. OPEN SPACE & CONSERVATION ELEMENT
seasonal or climatic variations, as well as other legal, environmental, and
water quality factors. Drought planning occurs on a regional basis, by the
MWD, and locally, by the CCWD. MWD‘s Water Surplus and Drought
Management Plan addresses both surplus and shortage contingencies, which
is adjusted annually in accordance with the levels of water storage and
supplies available.
Water source reliability considerations for the three major water purveyors
are summarized below.
     Fontana Water Company
FWC‘s has indicated that there have not been regular or frequent water
supply deficiencies in recent years, and that they will not need to develop
new source capacity to meet current or projected demands, for ―normal‖
precipitation periods or during periods of drought.
     Cucamonga County Water District
CCD indicates the primary water reliability concerns involve water quality
problems, future droughts and the potential for a catastrophic event that
interrupts water service. CCWD will continue to develop additional
groundwater and recycled water supplies, along with water conservation
measures, to reduce the need for imported water supplies during dry year
periods.
     West San Bernardino County Water District
Key water source reliability considerations include:
          Extreme fluctuations in Lytle Basin groundwater levels
          Rialto Basin is affected by a perchlorate contamination plume that
          has reduced its annual water supply potential by more than one-half.
          This will continue until there is an economical and practical
          treatment process available for safely removing perchlorate from
          drinking water
          State Water Project water is considered unreliable, because it is not
          expected to be available during extended drought periods
          Riverside and Chino Basins do not appear to be affected by drought
          cycles
          Bunker Hill basin resources are substantial, and this source is
          expected to provide a reliable, long-term supply source, even during
          drought periods.
The District plans to install two additional wells in the Bunker Hill Basin as a
back-up water supply for its groundwater and surface flow in the Lytle Basin.
This would provide the ability to deliver up to an additional 5,000 acre-feet
per year. Additional water storage capacity is also planned.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                   9-17

          Water Shortage Contingency Plans
     Section 10632 of the California Water Code also mandates all urban water
     supplies prepare a water shortage contingency plan, to identify actions to be
     taken to prepare for and implement during a catastrophic interruption of
     water supplies as those that might occur as a result of a regional power
     outage, earthquake or other disaster. The contingency plan may include a
     variety of measures to reduce water consumption through specified water use
     practices, rationing of water supplies, and penalties for excessive water use.
     Each of Fontana‘s water agencies has adopted water shortage contingency
     plans, as discussed below.
          Fontana Water Company
     The FWC Contingency Plan is designed to provide at a minimum 50 percent
     of normal supply during a severe or extended water shortage. A four-stage
     action program is triggered by various levels of reduction in available water
     supplies. When such supply reductions occur, FWC may implement any one
     or more of several water conservation measures, including limits on
     consumption by nonessential or unauthorized water users, voluntary and
     mandatory supply rationing, and application of penalties for non-compliance
     with the conservation program.
          West San Bernardino County Water District
     The District has adopted a Water Conservation Plan and a Water Shortage
     Contingency Plan, which includes a four-stage rationing plan during a
     declared water shortage, similar to the program described for FWC.
          Cucamonga County Water District
     CCWD has developed a three-stage rationing plan to implement during
     declared water shortages. This includes voluntary rationing, increasing
     commodity rates, and due process measures to allow for relief from
     provisions of the plan. When available water supplies drop to less than 90%
     of water demand, an emergency will be declared triggering the three-stage
     rationing plan.
     Watershed Protection
     Since local groundwater is currently and will continue to be the primary
     water supply source for the planning area, prevention of water pollution is
     essential in protecting and conserving this critical water resource. Water
     pollution stems from both point and non-point sources. Point sources
     discharge wastewater directly into a receiving water at a discrete point
     (usually at the end of a pipe). Typical point sources include wastewater
     treatment plants and industrial facilities. Non-point sources, on the other
     hand, are diffuse in origin and variable in quality. These include urban
     nuisance flows and stormwater runoff.
     As noted earlier, the Fontana planning area is in the Chino Ground Water
     Basin, which is fed by runoff from various tributaries throughout the upper

                                                                                9. OPEN SPACE & CONSERVATION ELEMENT
Santa Ana River watershed. Water pollution controls for the Santa Ana
River watershed are administered by the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality
Control Board (SARWQCB), through a variety of means, in accordance with
its Basin Plan. The principal method is through waste discharge
requirements, which regulate the quality of wastewaters discharged, and in
other ways that control the discharge of wastes that could impact surface and
ground water quality. Regulatory tools enforced by SARWQCB include
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits, Waste
Discharge Requirements, Water Reclamation Requirements, Water Quality
Certification, and Waste Discharge Prohibitions. The regulations that most
directly affect the City of Fontana are the NPDES permit programs
pertaining to discharges from the City‘s municipal storm drainage system, as
discussed below. The other regulatory tools are, for the most part,
administered directly by SARWQCB, whereby individual dischargers are
responsible for compliance with the applicable waste discharge permitting
requirements. Private homeowners who need to dispose of wastewater
through an individual septic tank system must obtain permits from the
County of San Bernardino, Environmental Health Services Division.
     Urban Runoff Management
Urban runoff from the planning area flows into a network of open channels,
as well as along streets, into underground drainage systems and over
undeveloped land. A substantial amount of this runoff flows into regional
flood control channels, which eventually discharge into the Santa Ana River,
the major watershed in the region, and one of the largest sources of ground
water supplies in southern California. Urban runoff commonly contains a
variety of water pollutants, including elevated levels of pathogens, sediment,
trash, fertilizers, pesticides, heavy metals, and petroleum products. Storm
water can carry these pollutants to the eventual receiving waters, i.e. rivers,
streams, lakes, bays and the ocean. This polluted runoff can result in
exceeding the water quality standards for the receiving waters, as established
by the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board (SARWQCB) in
their Basin Plan.
A significant amount of the urban surface runoff that occurs in the planning
area is intercepted by the City‘s storm drainage system, which flows into San
Bernardino County Flood Control facilities, mainly the San Sevaine and
Declez Channels. These channels carry flows directly into the Santa Ana
River. Because the discharges from the municipal storm drainage system can
pollute the river, they are regulated by the SARWQB. Along with the
County of San Bernardino Flood Control District, the County of San
Bernardino and the other incorporated cities within San Bernardino County,
the City of Fontana is a co-permittee for the Area-Wide Urban Storm Water
Permit, issued by the SARWQCB, pursuant to the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System program under Section 402(p) of the federal
Clean Water Act. This permit is referred to as NPDES No.
CAS618036/Order No. R8-2002-0012. This order (permit) regulates urban
storm water runoff from areas under the jurisdiction of the permittees,
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                   9-19

     including storm water runoff, snowmelt runoff, and surface runoff and
     drainage that flow into the Santa Ana River and its tributaries. It applies to
     discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4), as well as
     other designated storm water discharges considered significant sources of
     water pollution. stormwater drainage system flows into
     To implement its obligations under the Area Wide Urban Storm Water
     Permit, the City has adopted a Municipal Storm Water Management Plan
     (MSWMP), which consists of a variety of measures, including prohibition or
     regulation of specific types of discharges, inspections, avoidance of sewage
     spills, public education, controls on new development and redevelopment,
     site maintenance practices, and construction site management practices.
     All new construction projects involving a ground disturbance of at least one
     acre in total area must comply with the terms of the programmatic General
     Construction Permit issued by the SARWQCB. This applies to private
     projects as well as projects undertaken by the City or other government
     entities. Specific construction site maintenance measures, spill prevention
     and response procedures, erosion control measures, etc. are required to be
     specified on a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan that must be approved
     prior to the issuance of a grading permit.
     Prior to the issuance of building permits, new development and
     redevelopment projects subject to the City‘s MSWMP restrictions are also
     required to submit and obtain approval of a Storm Water Quality
     Management Plan (SWQMP) that specifies the water pollution control Best
     Management Practices (BMPs) to be incorporated into the project design.
     Examples of common structural BMPs include control of impervious runoff,
     common area efficient irrigation and runoff minimization. Non-structural
     BMPs include educational materials, activity restrictions and common area
     catch basin inspections. The City provides a list of approved structural and
     non-structural BMPs to development applicants, to assist in the preparation
     of their SWQMPs
     The City regularly monitors its storm drain system to detect illegal or un-
     warranted discharges into the City stormwater drainage system. Monitoring
     is accomplished by water and soil sampling and spot inspections. Fines may
     be imposed on businesses or individuals who discharge illegal substances
     into the storm drain system.
          Ground Water Pollution
     Ground water quality in the planning area is generally good, with the lowest
     levels of total dissolved solids (TDS) of any of the groundwater basins in the
     Upper Santa Ana watershed.
     Perchlorates, a toxic substance commonly used in a variety of manufacturing
     processes, have been detected in well fields maintained by all three of the
     water districts that provide water service to Fontana; the contaminated wells
     are not in use. Efforts are underway by the Santa Ana Regional Water

                                                                              9. OPEN SPACE & CONSERVATION ELEMENT
Quality Control Board, together with the impacted water districts and a
number of cooperating private entities, to investigate the extent of the ground
water contamination and to obtain funding for the expensive treatment
system required to remove perchlorate from the well water. Presently, there
are no such treatment facilities for any of the contaminated wells serving the
Fontana planning areas. The total perchlorate impact to the viable water
supplies maintained by the three districts has not been determined; however,
as long as the contaminated wells remain off-line, the available supply is
reduced.
Water Conservation
Efficient allocation of water resources, avoidance of water waste (e.g. excess
irrigation runoff), using recycled water for irrigation, water conserving
technologies and site planning, where possible, will be increasingly
important elements of a water conservation strategy.
As a key element of a regional water conservation strategy, IEUA, in
cooperation with its member water agencies, is developing a recycled water
master plan to expand the supply of treated wastewater that can be reused as
irrigation water and to recharge portions of the ground water basin, to help
reduce stresses during droughts. The City of Fontana currently has
entitlements to 11 million gallons per day (mgd) of recycled water capacity,
through the IEUA, with projected annual capacity increases of 0.5 mgd,
commensurate with continuing growth. Along with its entitlement to IEUA-
produced recycled water, the City has intervention rights in the Chino Basin
and may sell its reclaimed water to other agencies, for example, to be used in
ground water recharge programs. Presently, there are no reclaimed water
supply or distribution facilities in the Fontana planning area; however, the
City is embarking on a master planning effort to lay the groundwork for
building a customer base and the facilities to deliver reclaimed water for
direct application in irrigation systems, and also to supplement local ground
water recharge.
In 1992, pursuant to Assembly Bill 325, the City adopted Ordinance 1087,
establishing water conservation standards to be applied to commercial and
industrial development, focusing on the use of xeric (drought tolerant/low
water usage) plant materials. Residential uses were exempted due to the
difficulty in enforcing such restrictions on private lots. The City‘s parks
were also exempted, since most parks require turf grass to support a variety
of active outdoor recreation programs.
Water Supply Planning – Regulatory Framework
Key legislative mandates focusing on the linkage between water supply and
land use planning are summarized below.
     Urban Water Management Plans
Since 1984, public water purveyors with 3,000 or more service connections,
or that deliver at least 3,000 acre-feet of potable water on an annual basis,
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                 9-21

     have been required to prepare an Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP).
     An UWMP provides a summary of the historical and projected water uses
     and demands within the water supplier‘s service area, identifies the existing
     and future water supply sources it relies upon, describes the purveyor‘s
     demand management programs, and sets forth a strategy for meeting water
     demands in its service area during normal years, dry years, and multiple dry
     years. All three of Fontana‘s water purveyors, as well as the IEUA, have
     recently adopted an UWMP.
          SB 901
     Senate Bill 901, signed into law in 1995, requires cities and counties to give
     greater consideration to water supply and demand issues when deciding
     whether to approve large development projects. If a project meets the criteria
     set forth in the legislation, the city or county responsible for the EIR must
     refer the project to the water purveyor who will supply water for the project.
     The water purveyor, in turn, must prepare a water supply assessment,
     indicating whether the purveyor can satisfy the water demands created by the
     proposed project. Specifically, this assessment must determine whether the
     total projected water supplies forecasted in its UWMP during normal, single-
     dry, and multiple-dry water years are sufficient to meet the project‘s water
     demands. The city or county must include the water supply assessment
     information in the EIR, and if the results indicate there will be insufficient
     water supplies, this determination must be included in the findings as
     required by CEQA. The city or county may still approve the project, if it has
     other information that indicates that sufficient water supplies will be
     available to support the project demand.
          SB 610 and SB 221
     On January 1, 2001, Senate Bill 610 (SB 610) became effective and
     strengthened the water supply assessment requirements under SB 901. The
     new provisions included expanding the definition of ―projects‖ that require a
     water supply assessment, and increasing the required content with respect to
     ground water supplies and the water purveyors future projects and programs
     that will increase the available water supplies. SB 610 also authorized the
     city or county to compel the preparation of a water supply assessment
     through the courts. If the city or county cannot identify a public water
     system that may supply water to the project, the city or county must prepare
     the water supply assessment.
     Also enacted on January 1, 2001, Senate Bill 221 (SB 221) requires
     verification of adequate water supplies for any residential development
     project of 500 or more units, or which will increase the number of service
     connections by more than 10 percent in a public water system with less than
     5,000 connections. Verification by the water supplier or the city or county
     must be formally approved by the governing body at a public meeting, and
     the final subdivision map may not be recorded until the verification has been
     formally adopted. This water verification procedure does not apply to very

low or low-income housing projects, or to projects located within an
urbanized area. Cities and counties may not approve a development
agreement for a residential project with 500 or more dwelling units unless the
agreement clearly states that compliance with the verification procedures in
SB 221 is required.
Plant and Animal Resources
A Biological Resources Survey Report, one of the technical background
reports prepared for this general plan update, provides a detailed list of plant
and wildlife species occurring within the City and the City‘s sphere of
influence. Specific issues to be addressed are biotic diversity, plant
communities, wildlife, wildlife movement corridors, and legal protective
status of sensitive species.
The City is currently developing a Multiple Species Habitat Conservation
Plan (MSHCP) for north Fontana to address possible impacts to federally
listed species potentially occurring on vacant lands in north Fontana.
USFWS, since the last update of the General Plan, has designated Critical
Habitat for SBKR and the California Gnatcatcher that includes portions of
north Fontana. The MSHCP will include most of the vacant lands north of
Summit Avenue, including lands designated as open space within the City‘s
Sphere of Influence north of the Coyote Canyon Specific Plan area. Other
conservation efforts will be addressed on a project-by-project basis.
Regulatory Framework
The Federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (FESA) defines an
endangered species as ―any species, which is in danger of extinction
throughout all or a significant portion of its range…‖ Threatened species are
defined as ―any species that is likely to become an endangered species within
the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.‖
Under provisions of Section 9(a)(1)(B) of the FESA, it is unlawful to ―take‖
any listed species. ―Take‖ is defined as follows in Section 3(18) of the Act:
―… harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or
to attempt to engage in any such conduct.‖
Section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act requires that critical habitat be
designated by the USFWS ―to the maximum extent prudent and
determinable, at the time a species is determined to be endangered or
threatened‖. Critical habitat is formally designated by USFWS to provide
guidance for planners/managers and biologists with an indication of where
suitable habitat may occur and where high priority of preservation for a
particular species should be given. Any project involving a federal agency,
federal monies or a federal permit that falls within an area designated as
critical habitat requires the project proponent to consult with the USFWS
regarding potential impacts to the listed species and conservation measures to
offset identified impacts.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                  9-23

     The City of Fontana falls with the Designated Critical Habitats of two
     federally listed species; the San Bernardino kangaroo rat (SBKR) and the
     California gnatcatcher (CAGN). Portions of Fontana also fall within the
     Jurupa Recovery Unit for the Delhi sands flower-loving fly (DSF) (USFWS
     1997). A Recovery Plan, although not a legally binding document, sets
     parameters for the successful recovery of a species. In the Delhi Sands
     Flower-loving Fly Recovery Plan, USFWS has defined four recovery units,
     one of which, the Jurupa Recovery Unit, occurs in south Fontana. Recovery
     Units are specific locations, which USFWS would like to preserve to
     encourage the continued survival and ecological recovery of the species.
     Critical habitat for the SBKR and Gnatcatcher, and the Jurupa Recovery Unit
     for the DSF, are illustrated in Figure 9-4. Areas within Fontana containing
     Delhi sands (potential habitat for the DSF) that are not developed and are not
     included in the Recovery Unit are also illustrated.
     The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) provides protection to all native
     birds, except for game birds managed by fish and game departments. It is
     illegal to harm or harass these birds, their parts or nests during nesting
     season. Non-native birds, e.g. English sparrows, European starlings, rock
     dove, are not included in this protection. This program is administered by the
     USFWS.
     California Endangered Species Act (CESA) defines an endangered species
     as ―…a native species or subspecies of a bird, mammal, fish, amphibian,
     reptile, or plant which is in serious danger of becoming extinct throughout
     all, or a significant portion, of its range due to one or more causes, including
     loss of habitat, change in habitat, overexploitation, predation, competition, or
     disease.‖ The State defines a threatened species as ―… a native species or
     subspecies of a bird, mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, or plant that, although
     not presently threatened with extinction, is likely to become an endangered
     species in the foreseeable future in the absence of the special protection and
     management efforts required by this chapter. Any animal determined by the
     commission as rare on or before January 1, 1985 is a threatened species.‖
     Jurisdictional Watercourses
     The City of Fontana contains at least five areas determined to be ―Waters of
     the U.S.‖. Discharges of dredge or fill material to such waters are regulated by
     the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), pursuant to Section 404
     of the Clean Water Act (CWA) Activities within or that affect Waters of the
     U.S. that require some form of federal permit or license are also subject to the
     Water Quality Certification regulations administered by the Santa Ana
     Regional Water Quality Control Board, pursuant to Section 401 of the CWA.
     Riparian resources also occur along these drainages; these are protected by
     regulations administered by the California Department of Fish and Game,
     pursuant to Section 1600 et seq. of the California Fish and Game Code. There
     are three main drainage features flowing from the foothills in the San Gabriel
     foothills and three small drainages in the south, which flow from the Jurupa

hills (see Figure 9-1). Within the developed area in the central portion of the
City are two main drainage features, which have been previously modified for
flood control measures.
Regional Connectivity/Wildlife Movement Corridor Assessment
Historically, the City provided movement in both a north-south and east-west
directions. The land within the City of Fontana property provided a
connection between the nearby San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains
to the Chino Basin, as well as movement along the foothills of these ranges
in the northern part of the planning area.
Currently, the City of Fontana is mostly developed, with most of the land
converted from open space areas to commercial, industrial, residential, and
recreational uses. Wildlife movement on a north-south regional basis has
ceased due the development of the valley floor.
Wildlife movement in an east-west orientation along the foothills north of I-
15 is still a viable wildlife corridor. Although the Jurupa hills provide habitat
for many species of plants and animals, it functions as an ecological island,
allowing no significant movement. The remaining portions of the City are
extensively developed and major wildlife movement within the City is not
likely to occur.
Plant/Habitat Communities
The City of Fontana contains eight different plant communities that range
from disturbed and ornamental plant communities in the developed portions
of the City to more diverse, native plant communities, mainly north of
Interstate 15 (I-15). A brief summary of each onsite natural community is
discussed below. A visual representation of the communities is illustrated in
Figure 9-3.
     Northern Mixed Chaparral
A mountainside community at an elevation of 1,700 to 6,000 feet, this
chaparral community is composed of fire-adapted, broad-leaved shrubs.
Dominant plants include manzanita, coast live oak, California lilac, toyon,
holly-leaved cherry, and Our Lord‘s candle. This community occurs in a
small area along the City‘s northern boundary (see Figure 9-3, Natural Biotic
Communities), which occurs more commonly in the San Bernardino National
Forest, just north of the City, at higher elevations and within some of the
higher drainages of the Jurupa Hills.
     Riversidean Sage Scrub
Riversidean sage scrub (RSS) is the most xeric expression of coastal sage
scrub in southern California. It is the driest, most inland expression of the
collection of sage scrub or coastal scrub series. This community consists
primarily as a semi-arid scrub community of the valley floor, dominated by
coastal sage, white sage, black sage, California buckwheat, and California
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                   9-25

     croton. There are a few areas within the City of Fontana with remnant stands
     of Riversidean sage scrub: in the northern section, particularly north of I-15
     and in the Jurupa Mountains (see Figure 9-3, Natural Biotic Communities). It
     gives way to northern mixed chaparral at about 1,700 feet elevation,
     approximately midway between Alta Loma and Etiwanda.
          Riversidean Alluvial Fan Sage Scrub
     Riversidean alluvial fan sage scrub (RAFSS) is a subtype of the more widely
     known Riversidean Sage Scrub, and is described as open vegetation adapted
     to alluvial fans and outwashes. It grows on sandy, rocky alluvia deposited by
     streams that experience infrequent episodes of flooding at the base of the
     San Gabriel Mountains. The community is composed of California
     sagebrush, California buckwheat, yerba santa, yucca, cholla cactus, white
     sage, and scalebroom. The RAFSS plant communities or habitats found
     within the City and its sphere of influence are considered a sensitive
     biological resource by several regulatory and conservation agencies
     including USFWS, CDFG and CNPS.

     California Walnut Woodland
The California walnut woodland community consists of California black
walnut trees with an understory of alluvial scrub species. The walnut
woodland generally appears as scattered walnut trees with an open canopy
growing with sycamores. This plant community was once extensive
throughout the foothills of Southern California, but is now greatly diminished
due to agriculture and urban development.
This plant community is found within the area north of the I-15 at the mouth
of Morse and Duncan canyons and at the southern portion of San Sevaine
Canyon and also just west of Neely‘s Corner. California walnut woodlands
are considered a sensitive habitat by CDFG.
     Southern Cottonwood-Willow Riparian Forest
Tall, open, broadleafed winter-deciduous riparian forests dominated by
Fremont cottonwood and several tree willows. Understories usually are
shrubby willows. This community occurs in sub-irrigated and frequently
overflowed lands along rivers and streams. Other common species include
mugwort, mulefat, wild cucumber, and stinging nettle. A single stand of this
community is found in the planning area, in the Fontana Business Center in
south Fontana, between Tamarind Avenue and Sierra Avenue, just south of
Slover Avenue.
     Southern Sycamore-Alder Riparian Woodland
This diverse community of riparian species is found along the streams beds
of San Sevaine Canyon, Duncan canyon, Morse canyon and various
unnamed creeks. These canyons contain the only native trees of the area.
Trees commonly seen in the streamside woodland include alder, big-leaved
maple, canyon oak, California bay, sycamore, ash, black cottonwood,
cottonwood, mulefat and black willow.
     Non-native Annual Grasslands
The non-native annual grassland areas are disturbed or graded areas that have
revegetated with opportunistic weedy species. These species include wild
oat, brome and Mediterranean schismus, as well as some native wildflowers,
such as popcorn flower and, fiddleneck.
Non-native grasslands are found in vacant lots throughout the City of
Fontana. This habitat is particularly valuable as foraging area, for raptors and
other avian species, such as Northern harriers, burrowing owls, horned larks,
red-tailed hawks, ferruginous hawks, loggerheaded shrikes and Western
tanagers.
     Ornamental Woodland
Ornamental woodlands are human created woodlands using non-native trees
and shrubs. Common species of trees found within ornamental woodlands
throughout the City of Fontana include various species of eucalyptus tree,
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                  9-29

     tamarisk and Peruvian pepper trees. Ornamental woodlands often provide
     excellent nesting habitat for raptors and other birds. Ornamental woodlands
     also provide shade, wind protection, erosion control and esthetic value to
     humans. Several scattered ornamental woodlands and windrows exist
     throughout the City.
          Development/Disturbed
     Although most of the land within the City limits supported coastal sage and
     alluvial communities at one time, much of the land today is either developed
     or has been extensively modified by human activity sometime in the recent
     past. Development includes any form of human disturbances, especially in
     cases of permanent impacts to natural communities. Disturbed areas would
     include dirt roads, off-highway use, pavement, concrete, buildings and
     structures, bridges, active agricultural activities, and permanent flood control
     measures.
     Fallow agricultural areas represent a substantial proportion of the
     undeveloped land in North Fontana. These areas are in various stages of
     succession and are covered with non-native grasslands, emergent native
     vegetation and exotics. These areas may provide suitable habitat for the San
     Bernardino kangaroo rat, a federally endangered species of rodent.
     In developed areas, native species have been replaced by landscaping or a
     variety of annual grasses. The non-native annual grass species found include
     a variety of bromes, Bermuda grass and the large Johnston grass also occur
     in the area. Forbs common to the area include: wild turnip, red-stemmed
     filare, annual bur ragweed and southern suncups.
     Several non-native tree clusters and windrows are located within the
     developed portions of the City, consisting of large blue-green eucalyptus,
     California pepper, olives and oleander.
     Wildlife Species
     The vegetation communities and location of the City of Fontana provide
     habitat for a wide variety of animal species.
     A complete list of occurring and potentially occurring species (including
     scientific names) and their respective habitats can be found in the Biological
     Resources Survey Report, in Appendix D. This list does not include all
     species of wildlife that could occur, but does provide a broad range of
     representative species. The highest concentrations are found in the alluvial
     fans and streamside woodlands. Although unique species are not known to
     occur, there are several populations of lizards with unique genetic forms.
     Common birds in the area include the roadrunner, horned lark, scrub jay,
     plain tit-mouse, verdin, wrentit, Bewick‘s wren, California thrasher,
     American goldfinch, Brown California towhee, lesser goldfinch, and song
     sparrow. Raptors and owls exist in some of the open areas of the City.

Within the City limits, common mammalian species are limited to those that
have adapted to or can coexist with humans, such as pocket gophers,
California ground squirrels, desert cottontails rabbits, striped skunk, and
opossum.
Smaller mammals still persist in the streamside woodland areas within the
northern limits of the City of Fontana and within the sphere of influence.
Pocket gopher, California pocket mouse, kangaroo rats, various white-footed
mice, California vole, black-tail jackrabbit, brush rabbit, and cottontail rabbit
are typically found in undisturbed areas containing RAFSS. Moderate size
mammals such as Spotted striped skunk, Gray squirrel, opossum, raccoon,
bobcat, and gray fox are typically found in the mixed chaparral habitat
located in the northern areas of the City‘s sphere of influence. Very few
large mammals, such as black bear, mountain lion, mule deer and bighorn
sheep occur within the City limits, but have been observed in the sphere of
influence north of the City during biological surveys. Occasional sightings
of kit fox, ringtail cat, and badger have been also reported historically.
Sensitive Species
     Sensitive Plant Species
Nine sensitive plant species are listed in the CNDDB as potentially occurring
in the vicinity of the City. Although there has been no observation of any of
these species, suitable habitat for five of these species occurs within the City
boundary; each species is described below.
     Plummer’s Mariposa Lily
This plant prefers dry, rocky areas in Riversidean Sage Scrub and chaparral..
It occurs below 5,000 feet elevation. Suitable habitat is present within the
northern portions of the City. There is a moderate potential for it to occur in
north Fontana.
     Parry’s Spineflower
Found on dry, sandy slopes and flats in Riversidean Sage Scrub and
chaparral, this plant has a moderate potential to occur within the northern
portion of the city limits.
     Lemon Lily
This small, rare lily occurs in wet riparian areas on shady edges of streams at
elevations of 3,900 to 8,370 feet. Suitable habitat for this species occurs
within the foothill portions of the City north of the I-15, within the riparian
woodlands. There is a moderate potential for it to occur within this area.
     Slender-horned Spineflower
This plant prefers sandy and gravelly soils on alluvial fans and old
floodplains; between 500 to 2,000 feet in elevation, within Riversidean
Alluvial Fan Sage Scrub habitat. Although the City of Fontana provides
some suitable habitat for this species occurs north of Summit Avenue. It has

     a low potential to occur because of flood control activities within the City
     have reduced the viability of remaining RAFSS habitat.
          Pringle’s Monardella
     The last observation of this plant is known from a museum specimen from
     1904 near the Jurupa Mountains. This plant grows on sandy hills of
     Riversidean Sage Scrub and has only been known to occur in Riverside and
     San Bernardino counties. There is a very low possibility that this species
     may still occur in the Jurupa Mountains.
          Sensitive Wildlife Species
     Twenty-two (22) sensitive wildlife species have been identified by the
     California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) as occurring in the vicinity
     of the City. (There is suitable habitat for 15 of these species within Fontana
     the and 10 of these species have been observed recently. Figure 9-4
     illustrates the distribution of the suitable habitat for the sensitive species that
     have been observed within the planning area.
          Delhi Sands Flower-loving Fly
     This relatively large insect occurred historically in an area approximately
     forty square miles in northwestern Riverside and San Bernardino counties.
     The habitat for this federally endangered fly is limited to areas containing
     Delhi fine sand, an aeolian (wind-blown) soil type (see Figure 9-4).
     Disturbances to the soils, such as agriculture and urban development are the
     primary causes of the decline of this species.
     The City of Fontana falls within the USFWS designated ―Jurupa Recovery
     Unit‖. This species was observed in 2002, south of Slover Avenue and east
     of Sierra Avenue, within the Jurupa Recovery Unit.

     Coastal California Gnatcatcher
The California gnatcatcher is a federally threatened species with restricted
habitat requirements, being an obligate resident of coastal sage scrub
habitats. Areas within north Fontana, (north of Summit Avenue) and south
Fontana (Jurupa Mountains) fall within the designated critical habitat for the
CAGN. The species has been sighted in the south end of Fontana at the base
of the Jurupa Mountains, but not in north Fontana. Designated Critical
Habitat for CAGN is shown on Figure 9-4.
     San Bernardino Kangaroo Rat
The San Bernardino kangaroo rat (SBKR) is one of several kangaroo rat
species that could occur within the remaining RAFSS habitat in north
Fontana that is no longer subject to the required fluvial processes. The
SBKR habitat is described as being confined to primary and secondary
RAFSS habitats, with sandy soils deposited by fluvial (water) rather than
aeolian (wind) processes. Burrows are dug in loose soil, usually near or
beneath shrubs. The historic drainage system in the northern portion of the
City has been historically altered as a result of flood control efforts. This has
resulted in a reduction in both the amount and quality of habitat available for
SBKR.
Although the northern part of the City contains some suitable habitat for the
SBKR and is within the designated Critical Habitat for the species (USFWS
2002—see Figure 9-4), it does not offer sufficient quantity and quality of
habitat needed for the long-term preservation of the species. Fontana, which
historically was subjected to alluvial processes, no longer receives
floodwaters. Flood control structures protect the area from the hydrological
processes of nearby fluvial systems. Currently, there is no evidence of any
active hydrologic processes in the area.
Protocol live-trapping surveys for SBKR have confirmed the presence of
SBKR in north Fontana, north of Summit Avenue between Citrus and Sierra
Avenues, south of I-15.
     Burrowing Owl
The Burrowing Owl is a small owl, active during daylight, which utilizes
existing burrow complexes built by other animals, such as ground squirrels.
Burrowing owls were once very abundant in California but have seen a
steady decline over the past one hundred years, especially in the last 20
years. Burrowing owls commonly nest in roadside banks and agricultural
areas. Burrowing owls are protected by CDFG as a species of special
concern, as well as by the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
Abandoned agricultural lands within the City of Fontana provide areas of
nesting and foraging habitat for the burrowing owl. The species has been
observed in south Fontana and along the southwest boundary of the City.

          Golden Eagle
     The Golden eagle is a year-round resident of southern California and prefers
     open habitats. The northern portion of the planning area provides suitable
     foraging habitat for golden eagles living in the San Bernardino Mountains.
     This species is a State Species of Special Concern and is also protected under
     the Federal Bald Eagle Act. Golden eagles have been observed foraging in
     the north end of the City, near the I-15.
          Cooper’s Hawk
     Cooper‘s hawks are often seen in wooded urban areas and native woodland
     communities. Preferred nesting habitats include oak and riparian woodlands
     dominated by sycamores and willows. Suitable foraging habitat for this bird
     can be found throughout Fontana. Cooper‘s hawks prey on small birds and
     rodents that live in woodland and occasionally scrub and chaparral
     communities. This species was observed foraging in the riparian areas in the
     foothills north of the I-15.
          Northern Harrier
     This species is a year-round resident of southern California. It nests on the
     ground in open areas such as grasslands and agricultural fields. It also
     forages in these habitats, but also forages in areas with low growing shrubs
     such as Riversidean sage scrub. This species was observed in 2002 and
     likely nests in Fontana, north of the I-15.
          Logger-headed Shrike
     This species of shrike hunts in open or grassy areas and nests in large
     chaparral shrubs such as ceanothus and lemonade berry. The extreme
     northern and southern portions of the City (foothills of the San Gabriel
     Mountains and the Jurupa Hills) provide suitable nesting and foraging habitat
     for this species. It has been observed in each of these locations.
          Bell’s Sage Sparrow
     This species is typically found in chaparral on alluvial fans and foothills.
     This species was observed in north Fontana in 2002, north of the I-15.
          Southern California Rufous-Crowned Sparrow
     Suitable habitat exists for the rufous-crowned sparrow in the northern
     portions of the City north of the I-15, which generally prefers rocky hillsides
     and steep bushy or grassy slopes. This species has been observed within
     Fontana.
          Los Angeles Pocket Mouse
     This species occupies similar habitats as the northwestern San Diego pocket
     mouse. This species was found during trapping efforts in north Fontana,
     north of Summit Avenue between Citrus and Sierra Avenues, south of I-15.

     San Diego Horned Lizard
This species generally occurs in grassland and RSS, and chaparral. It is
usually found in open sandy areas such as ridge tops and washes, especially
where harvester ants are found. This species was formerly common
throughout southern California west of the deserts, but has declined
substantially due to development and as a result of over-collecting for the pet
trade. This species has been observed in old vineyards throughout the City
and is considered present.
     Orange-throated Whiptail
The orange-throated whiptail occurs in RSS and chaparral where loose soils
and occasional rocky areas are found. Although no individuals have been
observed during recent project biological surveys, the City provides some
suitable habitat for this species, particularly in the north end, south of I-15
and in the Jurupa Mountains. The orange-throated whiptail has a moderate
potential to occur on vacant lands throughout the City.
     California Mastiff Bat
This bat forages in a variety of habitats including open arid habitats such as
RSS and grasslands as well as riparian woodlands. They generally roost in
crevices of cliffs, high buildings, trees and tunnels. A colony of California
mastiff bats was found in an elementary school in eastern Rancho
Cucamonga in 1992. There is a moderate potential for this species to occur.
Existing Conservation Areas
Currently, there is not a regional MSHCP in place to provide cities within the
Inland Empire a set mitigation program for offsetting potential impacts to
above sensitive plant and wildlife species. However, a few conservation
areas have been established in the last ten years in response to specific
projects, including the I-210 Freeway and sand and gravel operations within
the Lytle Creek/Cajon Creek washes. The Etiwanda Preserve is a 768
conservation area within unincorporated lands north of the City of Rancho
Cucamonga and was established by SANBAG in cooperation with San
Bernardino County in 1994 as mitigation for the development of the I-210
Freeway. The lands surrounding the Preserve have also been identified by
the County as part of the proposed North Etiwanda Open Space and Habitat
Preserve (NEOSHP). The NEOSHP conservation area and program have not
been formally adopted by the County. Within the Lytle Creek and Cajon
Creek wash system east of Fontana, the sand and gravel company, Vulcan
(formerly CalMat) has established a 1,378-acre conservation site and
mitigation land bank within the RAFSS habitat. Another 153 acres of
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                   9-37
     RAFSS habitat have set aside by CEMEX (formerly Sunwest) and a 150-acre
     Santa Ana River Woollystar Preserve at the southern tip of the San
     Bernardino County Sheriff‘s Training Facility have been set aside as
     conservation lands within the Lytle Creek/Cajon Creek wash area. In
     addition, the County of San Bernardino will be establishing a conservation
     area/mitigation bank in RAFSS habitat in the Cajon Wash on the east side of
     the Glen Helen Regional Park. Lands within and around these conservation
     lands and mitigation banks are available to offset impacts to sensitive
     biological resources in Fontana.
     Cultural and Historic Resources
     History of Fontana
     The planning area began to show clear evidence of human activities at least
     by the 1850s, but Euroamerican settlement and land development apparently
     did not began in earnest until the 1870s. Between 1852 and 1856, the only
     man-made features noted by U.S. land surveyors in the planning area were
     several winding roads, including a ―San Bernardino Road,‖ also identified as
     ―Los Angeles and San Bernardino Road,‖ traversing just to the south of
     present-day Baseline Road, and an ―Old San Bernardino Road‖ running
     along the foot of the Jurupa Mountains (Exhibit 3 in Appendix E, Cultural
     Resources Technical Report [TR]). The Old San Bernardino Road, in all
     likelihood, might have been used as a Native American trading route since
     ancient times, and was probably the western extension of the historic
     Cocomaricopa-Bradshaw Trail. The ―new‖ San Bernardino Road evidently
     represented the wagon road blazed by Mormon settlers in San Bernardino for
     freight transportation to the Los Angeles area after the founding of the San
     Bernardino colony in 1851.
     In 1874, the Sainsevain brothers, a family of French immigrants who had
     already established themselves among the leading viticulturists and vintners
     in California, began to move their grape cultivation and wine making
     operations from Los Angeles to the foothills in the northern portion of the
     planning area. Joining the Sainsevains in that area were several other early
     settlers, whose endeavors were reflected in subsequent land surveys by the
     observations of such features as ―[Thomas] Hawker‘s house,‖ ―Hawker‘s
     corn field,‖ ―M. R. Potter‘s fences,‖ ―Fuson‘s house,‖ ―Perdew‘s peach
     orchard‖ and, later in the early 1880s, Victor de Lor‘s house and vineyard
     (Exhibit 4 in Appendix E, Cultural Resources TR). All of these were situated
     around the mouths of Lytle Creek and San Sevaine Canyon, at the northern
     end of the planning area, while the balance of the planning area apparently
     remained largely unsettled up to at least the late 1880s.
     As mentioned above, the birth of Fontana can be traced to the subdivision of
     the Rosena townsite, located in today‘s downtown area, by the Semi-Tropic
     Land and Water Company in 1887. As a town, Rosena made little progress
     prior to 1913, but by the mid-1890s it had become one of the three noticeable
     centers in the area‘s rural settlement pattern, along with the community of
9-38                                                      OPEN SPACE & CONSERVATION ELEMENT

                                                                               9. OPEN SPACE & CONSERVATION ELEMENT
Grapeland at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains and the Declezville
quarry at the foot of the Jurupa Mountain (Exhibit 5 in Appendix E, Cultural
Resources TR). A number of buildings were noted in the planning area by
that time, scattered around these three locations, with the largest group in the
eastern portion of the planning area between Baseline Road and the Santa Fe
Railway.
Like many other communities in southern California, Fontana embarked on a
period of rapid growth in the early 20th century, especially after the
rededication of the townsite under its current name in 1913. By the 1930s,
virtually the entire planning area had been settled, although the southwestern
and southern rims remained only sparsely populated. The southern half of
the planning area, led by downtown Fontana, had begun to show early signs
of urbanization. In the meantime, the northern portion of the planning area,
around what was once known as Grapeland, continued to be dominated by
large agricultural enterprises, such as the Bullock Ranch, with only widely
scattered buildings present. This pattern of development, in fact, persisted
until the beginning of the current housing boom in the 1980s.
The establishment of the Kaiser Steel Mill in the western portion of the
planning area in 1942 had a profound influence on the growth of Fontana as
well as other surrounding communities. This momentous event marked the
end of Fontana‘s history as an agricultural settlement, and greatly escalated
the urbanization process in the planning area. Within a period of 10 years,
the density of buildings increased dramatically, particularly in the south-
central portion of the planning area between downtown Fontana and the
Kaiser Steel Mill, reflecting an equally dramatic increase in the town‘s
population. In 1952, Fontana incorporated as a city. Under current federal
and state historic preservation guidelines, all buildings and other features of
built environment dating to this period of rapid expansion—up to 1957—are
to be considered potentially historic, and as such require proper identification
and evaluation.
Regulatory Environment
     Federal Programs
The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended,
mandates that all federal agencies assume responsibility for the preservation
of historic properties owned or controlled by the U.S. government. Section
106 of NHPA requires federal agencies to take into account the effect of an
undertaking on any historic properties prior to approval of the undertaking.
When delegated the responsibility for Section 106 compliance, such as in
some programs funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), a local government agency may also take the lead in
the NHPA-compliance process.
In practice, many federal agencies recognize an enhanced role for Certified
Local Governments (CLG). The CLG program, a joint federal-state initiative
administered by the National Park Service and the State Historic Preservation
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                  9-39

     Officers (SHPO) of each state, provides technical assistance and small grants
     for historic preservation purposes to local governments that meet certain
     requirements. In California, CLGs are encouraged by the State Office of
     Historic Preservation (OHP) to play an active role in the Section 106 process
     within its jurisdiction. A CLG can benefit from historic preservation
     expertise, professional and technical assistance, information exchange, and
     statewide preservation programs coordinated by the OHP and, last but not
     least, special grants from the Historic Preservation Fund administered by the
     SHPO. A former CLG, the City of Fontana has chosen to withdraw from the
     CLG program due to local circumstances.
     Under the provisions of NHPA, the Secretary of the Interior has established
     the National Register of Historic Places, a nation-wide inventory of districts,
     sites, buildings, structures, objects, or other features of national, state, or
     local historical significance. According to statutory definition, any property
     listed in or determined to be eligible for listing in the National Register
     constitutes a ―historic property.‖ At present, two sites within the planning
     area, the Fontana Indian Pit and Groove Site (CA-SBR-716) and the Fontana
     Farms (P1073-32H), are listed in the National Register. Additionally, several
     of the recorded archaeological sites within the planning area have been
     evaluated as eligible for listing in the National Register, although not
     officially listed at this time.
          State Programs
     The California Register of Historical Resources, established in 1992, is the
     State of California‘s counterpart to the National Register of Historic Places.
     Its listings include all properties listed in or officially determined eligible for
     listing in the National Register. Together with the California Register, the
     Office of Historic Preservation (OHP) maintains two other registers to
     promote historic preservation in the state: California Historical Landmarks, a
     designation for properties of statewide historic importance, and Points of
     Historical Interest, for properties of county-wide or regional importance.
     Properties included in any of these registers are eligible for a number of state
     historic preservation incentives, such as property tax reduction, benefits
     provided by the California Heritage Fund, alternative building regulations
     under the State Historic Building Code, special historic preservation bond
     measures, and seismic retrofit tax credits
     Within the planning area, one property, the U.S. Experimental Rabbit Station
     (P1073-39H), has been designated a California Historical Landmark (CHL-
     950). Eleven others are currently listed as Points of Historical Interest,
     including the Fontana Indian Pit and Groove Site, the Fontana Farms,
     Baseline Road, Los Angeles to Sonora Road, Kaiser Steel Mill, Chaffey-
     Garcia House, Fontana Library, Declez Ranch/Quarry, Women‘s Club,
     Sinclair Commercial Block, and the site of the Community of Grapeland, at
     the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains.

     Regulatory Guidelines on Cultural Resources Management
Section 106 of National Historic Preservation Act mandates that federal
agencies or HUD-designated local agencies with jurisdiction over federal or
federally assisted undertakings take into account the effect of the
undertakings on any ―historic properties‖ during the planning process (16
USC 470f). For projects with no federal involvement, the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) similarly requires lead agencies to
consider whether their discretionary actions may cause substantial adverse
changes to ―historical resources‖ (PRC §21084.1). Although termed
differently in NHPA and CEQA, ―historic properties‖ and ―historical
resources‖ both refer to a special class of cultural resources that meet the
definitions set forth in the statutes and their implementation regulations.
A local register of historical resources, as defined by PRC §5020.1(k),
―means a list of properties officially designated or recognized as historically
significant by a local government pursuant to a local ordinance or
resolution.‖ In the City of Fontana, the Fontana Historical Society has
compiled a list of potential historical sites that were considered to be
significant to the local community, which is incorporated into the City‘s
existing General Plan (1990 version). In addition, Article XIII (Preservation
of Historic Resources) of the Fontana City Code provides that
The City Council may designate any improvement, natural feature or site as
an historical resource and any area within the City as an historic overlay
district if it meets the criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places or the following.
          It has a special historical, archeological, cultural, architectural,
          community or aesthetic value;
          It is identified with persons, a business use or events significant in
          local, state or national history;
          It embodies distinctive characteristics of a style, type, period or
          method of construction, or is a valuable example of the use of
          indigenous materials or craftsmanship;
          It has a unique location or singular physical characteristic that
          represents an established and familiar visible feature of a
          neighborhood or community or the city;
          Its integrity as a natural environment or feature strongly contributes
          to the well-being of residents or a neighborhood of the city; or
          It is a geographically definable area possessing a concentration of
          sites, buildings, structures or objects that are unified by past events
          or are unified aesthetically by plan or physical development. (§5-
          355, Fontana City Code: Historical Resources Designation Criteria).
Under CEQA, properties included in the city‘s existing list or otherwise
designated by the city should be ―presumed to be historically or culturally
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                     9-41

     significant unless the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates
     [otherwise]‖ (PRC §21084.1). Any property that meets one or more of the
     criteria listed above, thus, falls under the protection of NHPA and/or CEQA.
     Depending on the nature, significance, integrity, and current condition of the
     property, the proper form of protection may range from on-site preservation
     to project effect mitigation, such as in-depth documentation for historic
     buildings and data recovery excavation for archaeological sites.
          Cultural Resource Studies
     The northern half of the planning area, as delineated by Foothill Boulevard,
     within this area, and in the western and southern portions of the planning
     area—around the former Kaiser Steel Mill and along the Jurupa Mountains,
     respectively—more than 100 other cultural resources studies have taken
     place on various tracts of land and linear features, many of them intensive-
     level surveys.
     As a result of these previous studies, 79 archaeological sites have been
     identified and recorded within the planning area, along with a number of
     isolated artifacts. This total includes 14 prehistoric—i.e., Native American
     sites, 62 historic-era sites, and 3 sites with both prehistoric and historic-era
     components. One cluster of the prehistoric sites in the southern portion of
     the planning area has been interpreted by archaeologists to be the remains of
     an important Native American village of unknown antiquity, while a number
     of campsites and other habitation areas have also been identified. The
     majority of prehistoric sites, however, represent evidence of Native
     American food-processing activities, such as bedrock milling features, which
     are quite common in the Inland Empire region. All of these prehistoric sites
     have been found along the foothills of the San Gabriel and the Jurupa
     Mountains, at the northern and southern ends of the planning area.
     The historic-era sites consist mainly of residential areas, although irrigation
     systems, transportation features, and other types of resources are also
     represented. These sites are scattered virtually throughout the entire planning
     area. The historic U.S. Route 66 (now Foothill Boulevard), the former
     Kaiser Steel Mill, and the Boulder-Los Angeles power transmission lines are
     among the better known of these historic-era sites. The Southern Pacific
     Railway (now Union Pacific), completed in the 1870s, and the Atchison,
     Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (now Burlington Northern and Santa Fe),
     completed in the 1880s, have also been recorded as historic-era
     archaeological sites.
     In addition to the recorded archaeological sites, a total of 114 pending
     historic sites have been noted in the planning area by AIC records. This
     number includes mostly historic-era residences and other buildings, with
     structural remains, irrigation features, and roads comprising the other
     common resource types. The construction dates of the buildings range
     generally from the early 20th century to the 1940s, while some of the

irrigation features and roads in this group date to as early as the early to mid-
19th century, well before the birth of the present-day community of Fontana.
A number of these previously identified sites, either recorded or pending,
have been listed in various registers of heritage properties maintained by the
federal or state historic preservation agencies. In all, 2 National Register-
listed properties, 1 California Historic Landmark, and 11 California Points of
Historic Interest are located in the planning area, including the Fontana Pit
and Groove Site, the Fontana Farms, the U.S. Experimental Rabbit Station,
and the former Kaiser Steel Mill. In addition, several of the recorded
archaeological sites have been evaluated as eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places, although not officially listed at this time.
     Areas of Cultural Sensitivity
The foothills along the San Gabriel and the Jurupa Mountains are most
sensitive for possible archaeological remains from the prehistoric period. In
particular, moderately sloping fans with deep soil near the mouths of canyons
or springs are very likely to contain prehistoric archaeological sites of
potential significance. The rest of the planning area demonstrates a low to
moderate level of sensitivity in this respect. For buildings, structures,
objects, or archaeological remains dating to the historic period, essentially
the entire planning area shows a moderate level of sensitivity, with the
possible exceptions of certain areas in the northern and southern rims and
along some of the City‘s thoroughfares where large-scale redevelopment has
occurred during the more recent decades. Most notably, the downtown area,
bounded generally by Miller Avenue on the north, Cypress Avenue on the
west, Merrill Avenue on the south, and Tamarind Avenue on the east, hosts a
higher concentration of historic-era buildings, including many that are
considered significant by the local community. Please see the Cultural
Resources Technical Report in the attached appendices for a detailed listing
of historical sites. Figure 9-5 illustrates the historic era downtown area and
the northern and southern parts of the City where there is a likelihood of
discovering additional prehistoric resources.
ISSUES, GOALS, POLICIES & ACTIONS
This section defines the planning context for conservation and management
of the City‘s natural and cultural resources, in terms of the key issues that are
addressed by the Open Space/Conservation (OS/C) Element, and the policy-
level and programmatic strategies to achieve the vision described in this
chapter.
ISSUE # 1: PRESERVATION OF NATURAL OPEN SPACE
How can the City best preserve environmentally sensitive, natural open
spaces in the planning area?
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                   9-43

     Discussion: The lower San Gabriel Mountains, abutting national forest land
     along the northern edge and the Jurupa Hills, along the southern edge,
     contain the last expanses of natural open space in the planning area. These
     are also the most visually prominent topographic features, and provide a
     scenic vista from many mobile and stationary viewing locations throughout
     the community.
     Each of these hilly areas supports a range of sensitive plants and wildlife
     species, including federal and state listed bird species. Three natural stream
     courses in the northern area flow from the foothills down to the valley floor,
     and out of the Jurupa Hills. Riparian habitat occurs in each of these natural
     drainage courses.

The steep hillsides in the northern edge contain highly flammable chaparral
vegetation, which represents a high level of wildland fire hazard, particularly
when hot, gusty Santa Ana winds blow down through the Cajon Pass. Due to
the steep terrain, lack of access and absence of water facilities, a wildfire in
this area would be very difficult to suppress and could spread rapidly down
into existing residential development as well as vacant, grass-covered land on
both sides of the I-15 Freeway. The Jurupa Hills along the southern edge of
the planning area have high grasses and locally steep slopes; a major fire in
this area would also be difficult to suppress. Steep slopes in the northern and
southern hillsides are susceptible to potential instability; when saturated,
there could be small slides, slumps, or soil slips, which could generate
significant mud and debris flow through the canyons, possibly reaching the
valley floor at the base of the hills.
Given the scenic and ecological values, along with the geophysical and wild
land fire hazards that occur in the northern and southern hillsides,
preservation of these open spaces is a high priority in the City‘s open space
and conservation plan.
Sensitive wildlife species are also known to occur in disturbed lands, as well
as natural communities. Examples include:
          Suitable habitat occurs in northern and southern Fontana, for two
          federal-listed species, the coastal California gnatcatcher (CAGN) and
          the San Bernardino kangaroo rat (SBKR).
          The federal-listed Endangered Delhi Sands Flower-Loving Fly
          (DSF) has been found in a former vineyard and other disturbed open
          land in southern Fontana.
          Burrowing owl and a number of other raptor species are commonly
          found in disturbed areas supporting non-native grasslands.
Private and public development projects that would impact sensitive species
in these disturbed open spaces will be encouraged to preserve as much open
space as possible. If impacts would occur to federal or state listed species,
project proponents will be required to obtain state and/or federal approvals
prior to beginning construction. The City is responsible for monitoring local
projects to ensure that proper field surveys are conducted to determine
presence or absence of sensitive wildlife, and to ensure that if such species
are present, that measures are taken to avoid, minimize or compensate for
impacts to affected species.

5) Require site-specific surveys to identify the presence/absence of sensitive
     species and natural communities, for all projects located in areas
     identified in the Sensitive Biotic Resources database.
Actions:
1) Maintain an up-to-date Sensitive Biotic Resources database within the
     Planning Department. Information in the database will include the
     location, size, habitat characteristics, sensitive species, and pertinent
     federal and state regulations of the natural communities remaining in the
     planning area, as shown on Figure 9-3. The database will also identify
     areas outside of natural communities containing suitable habitat for
     sensitive wildlife species, as shown on Figure 9-4. Any critical habitat
     units designated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will be included in
     the database.
2) Use the Sensitive Biotic Resources database as an information resource
     to inform the City‘s decision-makers, City staff, and interested citizens.
3) Complete efforts to gain federal approval of development in north
     Fontana through the Multi-Species Habitat Conservation Plan (Section
     10a) or a Section 7 consultation under the federal Endangered Species
     Act.. Target species include the federal-listed Endangered San
     Bernardino Kangaroo Rat and the federal-listed Threatened Coastal
     California Gnatcatcher, as well as raptor species.
4) Work with the private landowners and USFWS to expand Mary Vagel
     Park to provide additional conservation land for the DSF, and thereby
     expand the City‘s open space resources.
ISSUE #2: PLANNING FOR MIXED-USE OPEN SPACE
How can the City best use mixed-use open spaces such as utility corridors,
easements, flood control channels, detention basins, quarries and
agricultural lands for recreational and other open space purposes?
Discussion: There are a number of established open, linear corridors in the
planning area, where communications, electrical, natural gas, water, sewer
and flood control facilities have been built, or where right-of-way for future
facilities has been reserved. The utility purveyor and flood control agency
control these corridors through easements or fee ownership, and thus they
are, in effect, permanent open spaces, although not necessarily free of
buildings or other above- or below-ground facilities. Some of these corridors
link directly to existing or planned parks. Others are on the edge of or
transect natural or disturbed open space lands, while others pass through
developed areas.
Where appropriate agreements can be reached with the right-of-way owners
or easement holders, there are opportunities for recreational uses, such as
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                  9-49

     bicycle and pedestrian pathways, equestrian trails, fitness courses,
     educational and cultural displays, etc. As such, the utility corridors can be
     useful elements of the City‘s open space and recreation system. Additional
     discussion of recreational open space opportunities associated with utility
     corridors, and related goals, policies and action plans is provided in the
     Parks, Recreation and Trails Element.
     Open space uses such as drainage detention basins, reclaimed quarries and
     farmland can also function for a variety of other open space uses. For
     example:
               Private or public detention basins can be used for active or passive
               recreational purposes during the majority of the year when they are
               dry and for ground water recharge during wet periods.
               Properly reclaimed quarry sites can be used for a variety of open
               space purposes, including flood control, ground water recharge,
               parks, golf courses, and wildlife habitat.
               Fallow farmland could be restored to some form of farming use as an
               example of the City‘s agricultural past, could be used for various
               forms of recreation, cultural and educational experiences, ground
               water recharge, flood control, etc.
     GOAL #2.1
     Provide public access to and allow joint recreational use of utility
     corridors, wherever feasible.
     Policies:
     1) Link multi-use utility corridors to other elements of the local and
          regional parks and trails systems wherever feasible.
     Actions:
     1) Evaluate all utility corridors and flood control channels with respect to
          opportunities for public access and joint recreational uses, and enter into
          joint use agreements to facilitate such joint uses, where feasible with the
          utility agencies and the San Bernardino County Flood Control District.
     2) Incorporate utility corridors and flood control channels where joint use
          agreements are in effect into the Master Plan of Parks and Recreation and
          the Parks, Recreation and Trails Element of the General Plan.
     3) Address design standards, financing plans, etc. for joint recreational use
          of utility corridors and flood channels within the Master Plan of Parks
          and Recreation.

GOAL #2.2
Expand the open space and conservation system, where feasible, to
include private and public lands that offer multi-use open space and
cultural resource opportunities.
Policies:
1) Evaluate opportunities for mixed-uses of private and public open space
     and utility rights-of-way and incorporate such mixed uses into the
     approved plan as part of the new development and public infrastructure
     planning process.
Actions:
1) Amend the zoning ordinance to add a provision within the specific plan
     standards that requires consideration and incorporation of mixed–use
     open spaces.
ISSUE #3: WATER RESOURCES
How can the City best conserve and prevent pollution of its water
resources?
Discussion: Fontana‘s water supply is obtained primarily from local ground
water sources, supplemented with purchases of more expensive imported
water from the State Water Project. Population and economic growth is
projected to rise rapidly and for a long period of time, throughout the basin.
The projected growth will place increasing pressure on the basin ground
water resources. Water conservation measures and production and
distribution of alternative water supplies will become increasingly important.
To the extent that polluted urban runoff is allowed to reach surface waters or
infiltrate into ground waters, the basin water supply will be adversely
impacted, requiring increased levels of treatment, with corresponding higher
treatment costs. Additional imported water supplies will also likely need to
be purchased, and it is likely that these supplies will become more costly
and/or more difficult to acquire.
Although the City does not directly control any water resources that
contribute to its water supply, there are measures it can take to ensure water
resources are used more efficiently, to provide and ensure use of alternative
supply sources, and to avoid and minimize pollution of surface and ground
waters by urban runoff and point source discharges.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                 9-51

     GOAL #3.1
     Maximize efficient allocation and water resource use for existing and
     future water consumers.
     Policies:
     1) Promote use of xeric (adapted to arid conditions) landscaping techniques
          in master planned communities, and other new land use plans. Provide
          public information concerning xeric plant palettes and low water usage
          irrigation systems.
     2) Replace existing turf areas and other high water consuming landscaping
          within City street medians and parkways with xeric vegetation and
          miscellaneous hardscape materials.
     3) Participate with the Inland Empire Utilities Agency, the Fontana Water
          Company, the Cucamonga County Water District, and the West San
          Bernardino County Water District to develop and implement water
          conservation programs and to encourage the use of water conserving
          technologies, for indoor and outdoor applications.
     Actions
     1) Complete and implement a Recycled Water Master Plan to include:
               A broad customer base
               A supply and distribution system to serve the entire customer base
               A long-term capital improvements financing plan
               Ongoing fee mechanism to recover the City‘s costs of developing
               and maintaining a recycled water system.
     2) Continue to enforce all provisions of Ordinance No. 1087, and update it
          periodically to reflect expanded conservation options as new technology
          is perfected.
     GOAL #3.2
     Protect water resources in the planning area from urban runoff and
     other potential pollution sources.
     Policies:
     1) Promote the use of structural and non-structural water quality best
          management practices (BMPs) in land planning and project-level site
          planning.
     2) Require structural and non-structural BMPs for all parking lots and
          paved storage areas within industrial and commercial zones, for the
          City‘s street network, and within the City‘s parks and other civic
          facilities.

1) Continue to implement and enforce the provisions of the Area Wide
     Urban Storm Water Runoff Program, pursuant to the countywide NPDES
     Permit for Storm Water Discharges.
2) Continue to update and implement a citywide Municipal Storm Water
     Pollution Management Program, including:
          Identification and monitoring of sources of pollutant in storm water
          runoff flowing into the City‘s municipal storm drainage system
          Update the MSWPM, when necessary, to be consistent with the
          county-wide MSWPM
          BMPs to be applied throughout the City‘s street network, parks, and
          other public facilities that produce runoff into the storm drain
          network
3) Develop a model set of BMPs that can be incorporated into new
     development plans, and make these available to prospective land
     developers and other interested or affected parties,
4) Seek state and federal funding to support a full-time water quality
     specialist in the Public Services Department, or retain an outside
     consultant. The specialist would review and approve runoff management
     plans, provide public information concerning urban runoff problems and
     prepare BMPs for various applications.
5) The Public Services Department will conduct regular inspections of
     industrial and commercial facilities to ensure there are no illegal waste
     discharges to the storm drainage system and no illegal waste discharges
     are allowed to run off as sheet flow.
6) Enact regulatory authority to issue fines or impose other penalties upon
     violators of the City‘s MSWPM, until violations are corrected.

     ISSUE #4: CULTURAL RESOURCES
     How can the City best preserve its cultural resources—historic buildings
     and sites and archaeological areas?
     Discussion: The present-day City of Fontana traces its roots to the small
     rural colony of Rosena, which was founded in 1887, shortly before the
     collapse of the great southern California land boom of the 1880s.
     Resurrected by A. B. Miller in 1913 and renamed Fontana, the town
     remained rural in character until the early 1940s, when the establishment of
     the Kaiser Steel Mill began to transform the Fontana area into a center of
     heavy industries. Starting in the 1980s, Fontana has been an important part
     of a new land boom that swept across the western San Bernardino Valley,
     dominated by residential and commercial development, as the region
     embarked upon yet another transformation to ―bedroom communities.‖ The
     outlying, formerly agricultural areas of the City, in particular, have seen
     rapid urban growth over the past few decades, while the historic downtown
     continues to be confronted with the necessity for redevelopment and urban
     renewal.
     Like many other older communities in southern California, virtually all areas
     within the City of Fontana now have to address issues arising from the
     changing characteristics of the community, as the ongoing wave of growth
     poses a continuous challenge to properly identify and preserve important
     historical aspects of the City‘s agricultural and industrial heritage. Salient
     among these issues is the preservation of key landmarks and revitalization of
     Fontana‘s historic era downtown, which is threatened both by new
     development within its perimeter and by competition from emerging
     commercial centers outside its perimeter. Also prominent is the issue of the
     preservation and adaptation of the City‘s cultural identity in the face of the
     changing demographics as the result of recent growth.
     Fortunately, these issues are by no means unique to Fontana. Since the mid-
     1960s, precisely for the purpose of meeting such challenges brought about by
     accelerating growth, both the federal and state authorities have created a
     number statutes, regulations, and programs to help local communities
     preserve their historical and cultural heritage. The City of Fontana has taken
     advantage of some of these opportunities, while others remain to be
     implemented.

Parks, Recreation
& Trails Element
INTRODUCTION
A Beautiful Context
The City of Fontana is striving to make its parks and trails system even
better. Surrounded on the north by the San Gabriel Mountains and on the
south by the Jurupa Hills, Fontana enjoys good access to abundant natural
open space. With a mixture of regional, community and neighborhood parks,
the City already has some fine recreational facilities. Situated at the head of
the San Bernardino Valley, Fontana has the opportunity to expand its multi-
use trail system and link it to the region.
                                                                                      Fontana residents enjoying one
Enhancing the General Plan                                                            of the City’s court facilities.
A Parks and Recreation Element is not a required element of the General
Plan by state law, but a desirable one at local option. By assessing what it has
and charting where it wants to go, the City of Fontana aspires to develop a
system of recreational opportunities that improves the quality of life of its
citizens by providing a variety of healthy activities. A vibrant and diverse
system of parks and trails is one of the finest amenities that a city can provide
for aesthetic, health and economic reasons.
A Background of Planning
The City of Fontana has historically planned for and promoted its park and
recreation system. In 1999, the City adopted a Parks, Trails and Recreation
Master Plan which documented existing facilities, noted deficiencies and
recommended additions to the system to meet current and future demand.
The City updated this Master Plan in 2008 to serve as the guidance document
in developing a Capital Improvement Program. It also provides significant
input to this element.
City of Fontana General Plan               Amendment No. 08-004 Resolution No. 2008-36                                10-1

                              ACHIEVING THE VISION
                              The citizens of Fontana are proud of their parks, bikeways, trails and
                              recreation facilities and see them as a way to connect different
                              neighborhoods to the entire City. As part of the community visioning
                              process in May 2007, citizens and city officials identified the following long-
                              term goals:
                                  A system of high quality recreation and community services for all
                                   segments of the population, especially youth and senior citizens.
                                  A substantial role for open spaces, bikeways and trails to connect
                                   individual neighborhoods into the fabric of the entire community
                                  More parks in the under-served Foothill, South, and West Fontana areas
                                   in the City.
                              COMPONENTS OF THE PLAN: ALL
                              ABOUT PARKS
                              There are many types of parks and recreational facilities in Fontana, and their
                              description provides the basis for setting future goals and standards. Below
                              is a description of the hierarchy of basic types of parks and trail systems.
                              Figure 10-1, Existing and Planned Future Parks, follows the descriptions.
                              Types of Parks
                                  Regional Parks – 40 acres or more with a wide range of amenities to
                                   attract the greatest range of users and interests within and beyond the
                                   city. Their typical service radius corresponds to a one-hour drive.
                                   Fontana’s regional park – Martin-Tudor-Jurupa Hills Regional Park - is
                                   located near the southern border of the City and features a lagoon,
                                   museum, trails, nature center and over 780 acres of open space.
                                  Community Parks –10 to 40 acres with a service radius of 1.5 miles;
Ralph M. Lewis Sports Complex      typical amenities include pool, lighted sports fields and courts, picnic
                                   facilities, play areas, restrooms and off-street parking. The City of
                                   Fontana currently has twelve (12) community parks.
                                  Neighborhood Parks – 1 to 10 acres; walk or bike-to parks which are
                                   located within the neighborhood they serve; include both active and
                                   passive designs; represent a separate property delineated by a fence and
                                   provide amenities determined by the neighborhood, often including
                                   picnic areas, informal fields, tot lots, court games, passive green space
                                   and off-street parking. The City currently has twenty three (23)
                                   neighborhood parks.

                                               Sub Neighborhood Parks – Typically less than 1 acre are often called
                                                mini-parks, pocket parks or play lots; serve built-up, urbanized areas;
                                                often developed in conjunction with specific plans. The City currently
                                                has eight sub-neighborhood parks
                                          Park Standards
                                          The General Plan calls for a park acreage standard of three (3) acres of
                                          developed park land and two (2) acres of open space per 1,000 thousand
                                          residents. This is one acre greater than the land required by the state’s
                                          Quimby Act, which requires developers to provide land and/or fees for new
                                          parks based on a standard of four acres per thousand residents.
                                                                                   Table 10-1

EXISTING CONDITIONS
Before establishing policies and programs for park needs, the planning
process dictates a careful look at what recreational resources the City
currently has and what types of facilities the citizens want for the future. As
the following section illustrates, the current demographics of the City suggest
a parks Master Plan that is well balanced and includes enhancements to
existing parks as well as the construction of new parks.
Community Opinion: Workshops, Surveys and
Interviews
The City of Fontana’s Community Services Department regularly conducts
surveys of its residents to better assess recreation needs. The Public Works
Department also conducts quarterly meetings and maintains a “parks hotline”
to stay on top of current park issues. A telephone survey of 400 residents
was conducted in May of 2007 to identify areas of most importance to
residents. The survey indicates that Fontana residents are generally pleased
with the current parks, open space, and recreational facilities inventory. The
opportunities for the greatest improvement are in the area of beautification,
lighting, restroom, increased safety through patrols and additional facilities.
Existing Parks and Recreation Facilities
The City of Fontana’s existing and planned parks are identified on Figure 10-
1, Existing and planned future parks. These facilities have a mixture of
passive and active recreational uses. Also, the City contains one regional
park – the Martin Tudor-Jurupa Hills Regional Park – that contains over 780
acres of natural open space.
Table 10-2, Summary of Park Facilities, details the park facilities in the City
of Fontana as well as the amenities they contain.

                Recreation Demand Analysis
                In 2007, as part of its Parks and Recreation Master Plan update, the City
                analyzed existing and future demand for various types of park facilities. The
                study uncovered a number of deficiencies and future needs, enabling the City
                to adequately plan for future facilities.
                   Community Parks – Due to the existence of a large youth population and
                    the popularity of organized sports, there is currently more demand for
                    community parks than neighborhood parks. The twelve existing parks
                    serve most of the incorporated City. Three of the most popular parks –
                    Veterans, Bill Martin and Jack Bulik– have been expanded.
                   Neighborhood Parks – The City will work with Developers to address
                    the need for Neighborhood Parks. In under-served areas, joint-use
                    agreements with the local school districts should be continued and
                    monitored.
                   Under-served Areas – Analyzing existing facilities and service area
                    analysis, the 2008 Master Plan underscored three areas that are under-
                    served by park facilities (depicted in Figure 10-3). The Jurupa North
                    area is a residential neighborhood south of the I-10 Freeway located
                    partially in the City and in the Sphere of Influence area. Foothill South
                    and West Fontana lie in County land and are under-served by both
                    community and neighborhood parks.

Planning for the Future
Determining future park and recreation demand is an on-going process that
considers changes in population growth, user preferences and city policy.
Current demographic trends favor more facilities for young people and
consequent demand for organized sports facilities within community parks.
The City takes a proactive role in park planning by collecting fees,
acquiring land and designing the parks themselves. Until decisions are
made about the unincorporated areas bordering Fontana to the west,
projecting demand accurately will be difficult. It is anticipated that with the
future growth within the city and the annexation of the west end, the city
will grow from the current population estimate of 184,000 to 255,055 at
ultimate buildout.

                ISSUES, GOALS, POLICIES & ACTIONS
                ISSUE #1: PARKS FOR DIVERSE NEEDS
                How can the City ensure that its parks and recreation facilities respond to
                the diverse and changing needs of its population?
                Discussion: As Fontana’s population continues to change, so will its needs
                for different types of parks and recreation programs. Currently, the
                demographics of the City underscore the need for large-scale, organized
                sports fields. Being a City with lots of young families and children, after-
                school programs and aquatics programs are also in demand. The challenge is
                to stay in touch with residents and use pro-active planning to be several steps
                ahead of them.
                GOAL #1.1:
                Our City’s parks and recreation facilities meet the diverse needs of all
                segments of our population.
                Policies:
                1) A wide variety of parks and recreation facilities, including regional,

  Tamarind Park
                2) The design of all parks should meet the particular needs of the
                     specialized populations they serve, such as seniors, young adults,
                     families and children.
                3) Cultural facilities, such as libraries, community centers, exhibit areas,
                     and performance areas, shall be included in the planning and design of
                     parks where feasible.
                4) Barrier-free access to all parks shall be provided.
                5) The City shall continue to operate and expand its After-School Program.
                Actions:
                1) Update the Parks, Trails and Recreation Master Plan every five years.
                2) Continue the periodic Community Outreach Program, incorporated into
                     the Master Plan, to evaluate resident recreation needs and opinions.
                3) Prepare a phased strategy for developing new facilities including an
                     indoor aquatics center, indoor basketball courts, lighted baseball fields,

     private, non-profit groups such as the YMCA, Boys’ and Girls’ Clubs,
     Boy and Girl Scouts, Pop Warner, Little League, churches and private
     sector interests as well.
ISSUE #2: PARK PLANNING IN NEWLY
DEVELOPED AREAS
What should the City do to ensure that newly developed areas meet or
exceed existing park standards?
Discussion: The undeveloped northern portions of Fontana provide the City
with an excellent opportunity in park planning. It is the City’s goal not only
to maintain existing standards for park acreage but also to design parks with
the type of facilities that meet the needs of surrounding development. In
addition, the City will strive to make sure that new parks and recreation
facilities are well connected to the existing and future bicycle and

      recreational trail network. To meet these goals, the City works with
      developers through the project review process.
      GOAL #2:
      Adequate parks, recreation facilities and after-school programs are
      provided in newly developed areas of our City.
      Policies:
      1) The city shall maintain a park standard of three (3) acres of developed
          park land and two (2) acres of open space per 1,000 thousand residents.
      2) Newly developed parks should be connected, wherever practical, to the
          existing and future bicycle and recreational trail system.
      Actions:
      1) Initiate a long-term program to correct park deficiencies.
      2) Continue to implement the local park ordinance through developer
          dedication of parkland or in-lieu fees.
      3) Ensure adequate provision of recreation facilities through the
          development review and approval process.
      ISSUE #3: PARK SAFETY AND MAINTENANCE
      What can the City do to ensure that its parks and recreation facilities are as
      safe and well maintained as possible?
      Discussion: Parks are among the most highly desired amenities that a city
      can provide, and their enjoyment depends, in large measure, on attention to
      detail. First and foremost, they must be safe places for the enjoyment of all
      members of the community. This means that facilities and equipment must
      be well maintained, that landscaping is carefully planned and maintained
      with security in mind, that organized activities are well supervised, and that
      ample lighting exists for night use. As park and recreation facilities are used
      many days of the year, their ability to provide enjoyment depends on the
      quality and care with which facilities are provided and maintained.

GOAL #3:
Our parks will be safe and well maintained.
Policies:
1) Parks shall be designed in accordance with contemporary safety
     standards and “CPTED” (Crime Prevention Through Environmental
     Design) principles.
2) Each park within the City shall be evaluated for safety and maintenance
     on an established schedule.
Actions:
1) Conduct evaluation of park improvements to test for safety compliance
     and effective maintenance.
2) Prepare and adopt a “CPTED” ordinance covering public spaces,
     including parks.
3) Continue to maintain a proper schedule of facility management.
4) Establish a volunteer program for park maintenance.
5) Continue to reinvest Capital Replacement funds into park infrastructure
     where identified.                                                         Heritage Neighborhood Center
ISSUE #4: JOINT-USE AGREEMENTS WITH
SCHOOL DISTRICTS
What is the most efficient way for the City and local school districts to
develop joint-use agreements for recreational facilities?
Discussion: The sports fields and other facilities of local schools provide
residents with additional opportunities for recreation and help cities meet
their recreation needs. Since this property belongs to the school district and
not the City, there are liability, maintenance and access issues to consider.
The City of Fontana currently has joint-agreements with the Fontana Unified
and Colton Unified School Districts for joint-use of fields, but demand is
greater than supply. About 25% of schools’ field time is serving community
recreation needs, primarily for after-school recreation programs.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                              10-15

                      GOAL #4:
                      Our parks are developed in conjunction with school facilities and other
                      agencies to maximize recreational facilities in our City.
                      Policies:
                      1) The City should enter into joint-use agreements with the appropriate
                          school district on all feasible school sites in the City.
                      Actions:
                      1) Every existing and planned school facility will be evaluated for the
                          potential of joint use/development with the City.
                      2) Develop a program to address the problems associated with the use of
                          school facilities – field conditions, lighting, availability of restrooms and
                          parking.
                      3) Establish agreements with the local school districts for the joint use of
                          school recreation areas and, where feasible, reciprocal use of City
                          parkland by schools.
                      ISSUE #5: PARK ACCESSIBILITY
                      What can the City do to ensure that parks are conveniently located and
                      accessible to all segments of the population?
                      Discussion: One of the most valuable attributes of parks is accessibility.
                      Neighborhood parks should be centrally located within residential areas,
Jack Bulik Skate Park community parks should be integrated conveniently in key points within the
                      City, and regional facilities should be visible and conveniently accessible
                      from major arterials. Fontana’s goal has been to connect community and
                      recreation facilities to each other and to adjoining development. This idea of
                      connectivity is reflected in the Parks Master Plan and in the design policies
                      for new residential development found in the Community Design Element.
                      GOAL #5:
                      Our parks and recreational facilities are conveniently located and
                      accessible to existing and future residents of our City.
                      Policies:
                      1) The City shall continue to locate parks and recreation facilities within
                          convenient walking and biking distance of all neighborhoods.
                      2) Parks and recreation facilities should be integrated with the Master Plan
                          for Trails and Bikeways.
                      3) City standards for park acreage shall be applied to future annexation
                          areas.

Actions:
1) Based on deficiency areas within the City, prepare a plan for acquiring
     additional park acreage/facilities to address the need.
2) Prepare templates for proper off and on-site signage for all parks.
3) Initiate a sign installation program.
4) Negotiate an agreement with the County of San Bernardino to provide
     parks meeting City standards within areas of eventual annexation into the
     City.
COMPONENTS OF THE PLAN: ALL
ABOUT TRAILS & BIKEWAYS
Just as there are different types of parks for which to plan, there are also
different types of trails and bike paths for different uses. The off-street
recreational trail system combines hiking, equestrian and Class 1 bike trails.
Such trails are primarily used for recreation, but can also be used for
commuting or to provide access to community facilities, such as the Metro
Link Station or schools. Dedicated bike lanes, or Class 2 bikeways, consist
of a dedicated lane along the pavement edge of streets and provide an
alternative to the automobile throughout the city. Pedestrian access and
recreation is provided through the City’s sidewalks and hiking trails. The
following trail standards generally apply:
    Equestrian/Hiking Trails – wide enough to allow two horses to pass;
     minimum 10’ wide and 12’ vertical clearance from overhanging
     branches.
                                                                               Pacific Electric Trail (Heritage)
    Class 1 Bicycle Trail -Hiking/Biking Trails – combined trail with
     improved surface of concrete or asphalt for the bike and an unimproved
     surface for jogging; minimum width for two bikes is 8’, 5’ for one bike,
     and 4’ for hikers.
    Class 2 Bikeway - for use along roadways in urban settings; minimum
     land width of 4’ between the gutter or parking lane and the auto travel
     lane.
    Joint-Use Trails – accommodates joggers, hikers, bicyclists, and
     equestrians using a separated trail; bikeway is asphalt or concrete
     (minimum 12’ for bikers and joggers); the riding/jogging section is
     separated from the bikeway by a 3’ landscaped median.
    Class 3 Bicycle Routes – connect Class 1 and 2 Bikeways; usually used
     only for a few blocks, often in developed areas.
More detail on all facilities and trails for these components is provided
below.

                       Bicycle
                       The bicycle is experiencing a substantial growth in popularity. Persons of all
                       age groups have taken to the riding of bicycles for recreation, exercise and
                       transportation, Many individuals are discovering that bicycle usage,
                       particularly for short and intermediate trips, provides a viable and economic
                       alternative to the automobile.
                       The Master Plan (Figure 10-5) promotes a safe and efficient network of bike
                       paths for recreation and commuter use in the City of Fontana. The Master
                       Plan illustrates the location of existing and proposed bikeways. Class I bike
                       paths have been constructed along the powerline rights- of-way through the
                       Southridge and Village of Heritage developments. Additional Class I bike
                       paths are planned in utility corridors at the southern and northern portions of
                       the City.
                       The planned bicycle network is not a continuous network. Efforts should be
                       made to expand the network and provide continuity so that bicyclists could
                       connect to the Class I bikeways via other on-street bicycle lanes or routes.
                       Due to the developed nature of Fontana and the cost involved in right-of-way
                       acquisition, a concentrated effort should be made to develop safe dual use of
                       existing roadways. The use of parks, drainage channels and utility easements
                       should also continue to be explored.
                       Bicycle Classifications
                       The State of California categorizes bicycle facilities into the following three
                       classifications according to the degree of exclusiveness with which the paths
                       are preserved for bicycle use. The designation of bikeways as Class I, II and
                       III should not be construed as a hierarchy of bikeways. Each class of
                       bikeway has its appropriate application.
Pacific Electric Trail
                       Class I Bikeways
                       A Class I Bikeway, referred to as a "bike path," is a separate travel-way for
                       bicyclists. They are typically used to serve corridors not served by streets
                       and highways or where wide rights-of-way exist, permitting such facilities to
                       be constructed away from the influence of parallel streets. They provide
                       opportunities not offered by a road system. The bike paths can either provide
                       a recreational opportunity, or in some instances, can serve as direct high-
                       speed commute routes if cross flow by motor vehicles can be minimized. The
                       most common applications for bike paths are along rivers, oceanfronts,
                       canals, and utility rights-of-way, within college campuses, or within and
                       between parks. They may also be provided as part of planned developments.
                       The minimum paved width for a two-way bike path should be 8 feet. The
                       minimum paved width for a one-way bike path should be 5 feet. A minimum
                       2-foot wide graded area should be provided adjacent to the pavement. It may
                       be necessary to install barrier posts at entrances to bike paths to prevent
                       motor vehicles from entering.

Class II Bikeways
Class II Bikeways, also referred to as "bike lanes," are intended to delineate
the right-of-way assigned to bicyclists and motorists, and to provide for more
predictable movements of each. Bike lane signs and pavement marking help
define the bikeway. A more important reason for bike lanes is to better
accommodate bicyclists through corridors where insufficient room exists for
safe bicycling on existing streets. This can be accomplished by reducing the
number of lanes, prohibiting parking on bike lane streets, or striping. The
striped bike lanes should have a minimum pavement width of 4-feet between
the gutter or parking lane and the auto travel lane and are separated from the
auto travel lane by a solid white stripe, which becomes dashed approaching
intersections where right-turning vehicles must cross into the bike lane.
Class III Bikeways
Class III Bikeways, also referred to as bike routes, are shared facilities that
serve either to provide continuity to other bicycle facilities, or designate
preferred routes through high demand corridors. Bike routes are normally
shared with motor vehicles on the street, or with pedestrians on sidewalks. In
either case, bicycle use is secondary.
There is no minimum width for Class III bikeways. Width is dependent upon
many factors including volume and character of vehicular traffic on roads,
typical speeds, vertical and horizontal alignment, sight distance, and parking
conditions. There are no special lane markings and the roadway is identified
as a bicycle facility only by Bike Route" signs placed on vertical posts.
Bicycle Parking
The provision of bicycle parking facilities at appropriate locations is an
integral part of the bikeway plan.
Consideration should be given to requiring businesses to provide bike
parking as well as motor vehicle parking and the installation of bicycle
stands in public and private parking lots. Service organizations and other
institutions should also be encouraged to provide bicycle racks in appropriate
locations as a public service.
Bicycle Safety Programs
Programs teaching safe bicycling practices that encompass both safety
education and information about the nature of bicycling should be
encouraged. A clarification of the rules and regulations governing bike riding
should be encouraged. Bicycle safety education is conducted in the Fontana
City School system. Bicycle regulation enforcement is conducted by the
Fontana Police Department.

                                     Pedestrian Facilities
                                     In the past, transportation in cities was primarily based on the convenience of
                                     walking. The advent of motorized transportation, first the train and then the
                                     automobile, has changed this perspective. Pedestrians are now in competition
                                     with automobiles for urban space in downtown areas. Walking is often the
                                     only means of transportation that can satisfy the many short dispersed trip
                                     linkages required in a city's central business district. Even in residential
                                     neighborhoods, pedestrians are finding it increasingly more difficult to cross
                                     streets safely. Safety to pedestrians as well as amenable pedestrian
                                     environments are important quality of life factors in a city. It is important to
                                     have a safe pedestrian system that links commercial residential and open
                                     spaces land uses. Such a system contributes to a sense of cohesiveness within
                                     a city.
                                     Pedestrian circulation and recreation in Fontana are primarily provided for on
                                     the sidewalk. Sidewalk access is sometimes reduced by the intrusion of
                                     various sidewalk impediments such as benches, newspaper boxes, signs,
                                     plantings, and garbage cans. Sidewalk furniture often appears in clusters at
                                     intersection corners, the most critical points in the pedestrian circulation
                                     system. Corners are where pedestrians wait for and potentially come in
                                     conflict with traffic.
                                     To help improve the safety of pedestrians and make all roadways user
                                     friendly, the following improvements could be made after studying site
                                     specific, and area wide problems:
                                              Sidewalk widening,
                                              Limit alleys for pedestrian use,
                                              Use of special paving or markings at pedestrian/vehicle interfaces,
                                              Improve sidewalk signing,
Pedestrian walkway (Heritage Circle)          Improve signal phasing and pedestrian flow patterns at intersections,
                                              Use turning restrictions on vehicles at intersections,
                                              Provide sidewalk curb cuts for the physically challenged,
                                              Use hearing impaired cross walk signals,
                                              Increase the number of street trees along sidewalks to provide shade,
                                              Provide for safe, well lighted rest areas such as shaded benches or
                                              planter boxes, and
                                              Construct landscape planter between sidewalk and street travel to
                                              enhance pedestrian safety.

In addition to improving the existing pedestrian system, the following
planning guidelines could be used in the development process to help insure
the future success of the pedestrian system:
         Provide auto-free pedestrian arcades, which are dedicated to
         pedestrian traffic and provide pedestrian-oriented adjacent uses, in
         new developments,
         Plan for ground floor land uses which enhance the pedestrian
         environment,
         Use colored and textured pavement treatments,
         Prepare a street furniture plan, e.g., transit stops, signs, trash
         receptacles, newspaper stands, and drinking fountains,
         Incorporate plazas in new development designs,
         Provide pedestrian pathways in large residential developments,
         Develop a standard for meandering walkways, and
         Vary the width of sidewalk and parkway dimensions to eliminate the
         monotony of one standard throughout the City.

EXTERNALLY
The planning and construction of an off-street, multi-use trail system is an
on-going process and a long-term planning objective. Trail improvements
and maintenance are costly and often under-funded since most of the capital
improvements come from the City’s general fund. The recreational trail
system, which includes equestrian, hiking and Class 1 bike trails, is separated
from automobile traffic and follows natural open space features, rail right-of-
ways, flood control channels, and utility easements. Although primarily
designed for recreational uses, the system, depicted in Figure 10-3,
Recreational Trails, can be used to provide safe access to schools and
regional transportation nodes such as the MetroLink Station, and other focal
points within the City. The Bikeway System depicted in Figure 10-4,
Existing and Proposed Bikeway System, consisting of Class 2 or dedicated
bike lanes, is used for small trips, recreation or commuting within the City.
City of Fontana trails are strengthened by integration into the San Bernardino
County system. Key components are described below.

             10. PARKS, RECREATION & TRAILS ELEMENT
       Active Trails within the San Bernardino County Trail Master Plan –
             Jurupa Hills Trail – a trail system that traverses the Jurupa Hills
             and connects the Martin Tudor Jurupa Hills Regional Park to the
             Santa Ana River Trail in Riverside County.
             Frontline Trail – provides an east-west connection along the base of
             the San Gabriel Mountains between San Antonio Creek Trail on the
             west and the Lytle Creek Trail that extends north from the City,
             providing linkage to the Pacific Crest Trail.
             Baseline Trail – an on-road trail that connects San Antonio Creek
             Trail on the west to the Cajon Creek Trail between Rialto and San
             Bernardino. Baseline Avenue borders a number of specific plans and
             is wide enough to accommodate a Class 2 bicycle trail.
       San Sevaine Creek Water Project – Located on the western edge of the
        City, this drainage basin received federal assistance for environmental
        enhancements and development of a multi-use trail. This portion of the
        system connects with the Frontline Trail to the north and runs south to
        the Riverside County line.
       Southern Pacific Railroad Right-of-Way (part of the Pacific Electric
        Inland Empire Trail) – A great opportunity for an extensive regional
        trail system exists within the abandoned Southern Pacific Railroad right-
        of-way, and a county-wide planning effort, headed by Rancho
        Cucamonga and SANBAG (Association of San Bernardino County
        Governments) is already underway. The Pacific Electric Inland Empire
        Trail Master Plan, a 21-mile right-of-way that runs west to east through
        Claremont, Montclair, Upland, Rancho Cucamonga, Fontana and Rialto,
        was adopted in November 2000. This regional trail would serve as a
        multi-use trail designed to provide recreational connections within the
        county and to celebrate the history of the famous Pacific Electric
        Railroad. Currently the city has developed two segments of the Pacific
        Electric Trail. The first segment was completed in 2004 and runs from
        Juniper to Palmetto. Segment 5A was completed in 2007 and spans from
        Cherry Ave to Baseline and segment 24 which is currently under
        construction will run from Juniper to Tokay.

                                               runs east/west between Highland and Baseline Avenues and connects a
                                               series of parks and schools.
                                          Opportunities for Connections
                                          Fontana’s strategic location as a regional transportation corridor provides
                                          opportunities and challenges. The economic opportunities offered by major
                                          freeways systems are obvious; the challenge is to maintain connectivity
                                          throughout a community intersected by major grid system of arterials. A
                                          well-maintained and integrated trail system plays a critical role in linking the
                                          community internally and to the region, providing residents with viable
                                          alternatives to the car and healthy options for recreation.
                                          The City of Fontana also has the opportunity to improve and enhance its off-
                                          street recreational trail system and link it with neighboring cities and the
                                          County. Not only will the improved Multi-Use Trail provide access to
                                          existing and future open space and community facilities, it will provide
Equestrian Trail along Duncan Canyon Road
                                          spectacular views of adjacent mountains and hills and may contribute to
                                          reduce air pollution.
                                          Consistent With Previous Planning Efforts
                                          The 2007 Circulation Element supports bicycle use by establishing specified
                                          routes and storage areas. The plan also seeks the separation of biking, hiking
                                          and equestrian uses from automobile traffic by calling for the use of
                                          easements, rail rights-of-way, creek channels and utility corridors to develop
                                          an integrated multi-use trail system.

ISSUES, GOALS, POLICIES & ACTIONS
Consistent with previous planning efforts, the City of Fontana will seek to
expand its recreation and bike trail system to improve access and mobility
within the City as well as to the regional trail system currently being
implemented.
ISSUE #1: SUPPORTING BICYCLE, EQUESTRIAN
AND PEDESTRIAN USE
How can the City most effectively support bicycle and trail use?
Discussion: Bicycle, equestrian, and pedestrian trail use is most successful
when routes are clearly marked, convenient and safe. The City has
designated an integrated network of bicycle and recreational trails set forth in
the Parks, Recreation and Trails Master Plan. This system functions
internally, by connecting neighborhoods to each other, and to community
facilities, and externally, to the County’s regional trail system.
For bike paths, routes have to be planned in tandem with new development
and, in some cases, retrofitted within existing development. For regional
recreation and multi-use trails, planning and funding have to be coordinated
with neighboring cities and the County. Where these paths cross existing
built-out areas, capital improvements for safety and flow must be completed.
GOAL #1:
There is extensive use of non-motorized transportation, such as bicycles,
equestrian, and pedestrian activity, throughout our City for recreation,
access to community facilities, and even local commuting.
Policies:
1) The City’s bikeways and trails network shall be phased as an integrated
     system that provides access to community facilities, commercial areas
     and the regional multi-use trail system.
2) All new developments on designated routes shall provide bicycle and
     pedestrian routes linked to adjacent facilities.
3) Routes accessible for disabled persons shall be provided that link public
     facilities and commercial areas to residential neighborhoods.
4) Adequate and secure bicycle storage facilities shall be provided for new
     institutional and non-residential development.
5) Bicycle racks shall be provided in all public facilities and in activity
     centers.

                                        Actions:
                                        1) Update the Existing and Proposed Bikeway System for the City at five-
                                            year intervals.
                                        2) Establish bikeway and trail guidelines for use in applying conditions of
                                            approval for all major new development.
                                        ISSUE #2: CONNECTING TRAILS TO THE REGION
                                        How can the City most effectively link its trail network to the regional
                                        system of bikeways and multi-use trails?
                                        Discussion: Fontana is an important link in the San Bernardino County Trail
                                        Master Plan. In the south, the Jurupa Hills Trail traverses the Jurupa Hills to
                                        connect the regional park with the Santa Ana River Trail in Riverside
                                        County. This trail then winds southwest all the way into Orange County,
                                        ending at the ocean in Huntington Beach. The Frontline Trail in the north
                                        provides an east-west connection along the base of the San Gabriel
                                        Mountains. The abandoned Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way that runs
                                        diagonally across the center of the City is part of the county-wide Pacific
                                        Electric Inland Empire Trail. The city also has many opportunities to
                                        develop trails within the Southern California Edison easements.
                                        These regional trail connections provide an excellent opportunity for the City
                                        to utilize its tremendous view corridors, provide its residents with better
                                        connections to the region and to coordinate its planning efforts with
                                        neighboring jurisdictions.
                                        GOAL #2:
                                        Bicycle and trail systems are connected to neighboring city facilities and
Bicycle lane along Sierra Lakes Parkway to the regional network of trails and bikeways.
                                        Policies:
                                        1) The City shall complete the planning for its portion of the regional
                                            network of trails and bikeways.
                                        2) The planning of bikeways and trail systems shall continue to be
                                            conducted in coordination with neighboring cities and the County of San
                                            Bernardino.
                                        3) Trail design should incorporate opportunities for scenic views and access
                                            to open space.
                                        Actions:
                                        1) Consider the improvement of the Jurupa Hills Trail for clearer access,
                                            environmental protection and connection to the Santa Ana River Trail.

2) Adopt a phased program for the completion of Fontana’s portion of the
     Pacific Electric Inland Empire Trail.
3) Coordinate the extension of the Rancho Cucamonga Trail
     Implementation Plan into Fontana.
4) Continue to pursue funding opportunities from state, federal and regional
sources for the long-term completion of Fontana’s portion of the regional
trail network.
ISSUE #3: TRAIL MAINTENANCE
How can the City best maintain its trail system to high standards without
undo strain on the General Fund?
Discussion: Bicycle and recreational trail construction and maintenance
continue to be an under-funded activity for several reasons. These types of
improvements are quite expensive and are often funded from the City’s
General Fund. As such, trail and bikeway improvements must compete with
other City priorities. There are no recurring funding sources to support long-
term trail maintenance and capital replacement. Finally, citizen surveys
indicate that parks and organized sports facilities are currently a higher
priority. The warm climate of the area much of the year makes biking and
hiking a somewhat less popular activity than park and aquatic uses.
This does not mean that bike and recreational trails planning should not be
completed and implemented. One of Fontana’s greatest strengths is its
access to open space and potential for regional links. The undeveloped
northern part of the City provides extensive opportunities for bike and trail
systems linking residential development to parks, activity centers and open
space. However, completing the entire trail system should be viewed as a
long-term, yet important, planning objective.
GOAL #3:
Proper design, development and maintenance standards for bikeways
and trails are used for all trails and bikeways within our City.
Policies:
1) Contemporary design standards for the various classes of bikeways as
     well as trails shall be incorporated into the City’s Parks, Recreation and
     Trails Master Plan and the Circulation Element of the General Plan.
2) The City Logo shall be placed at key entry points to and along the
     bicycle and trail system.
3) Installation and/or replacement of the bikeway and trail system should be
     carried out as part of the City’s Capital Improvement Plan.

                                                  10. PARKS, RECREATION & TRAILS ELEMENT
                                          4) Maintenance funding strategies should be secured prior to construction
                                              of new facilities.
                                          Actions:
                                          1) Adopt design guidelines and sign program for each class of bikeway and
                                              pedestrian trails.
                                          2) Apply City-adopted design guidelines for bikeways and trail through the
                                              development approval process.
                                          ISSUE #4: SAFE TRAIL USE
                                          What should the City do to ensure that its trail system is as safe as
                                          possible?
                                          Discussion: Safety is always a concern when planning and maintaining a
                                          City’s bikeways and trail system. The proposed recreation trail system
                                          primarily follows the utility and flood control corridors while the proposed
                                          bicycle plan provides for a system of safe routes using the existing street
                                          network. Of particular concern are areas where bicycle routes run along
                                          existing or future streets, where school children typically walk to schools or
                                          parks and where trails or bikeways must cross streets. Less costly solutions
                                          involve proper signage and delineation of access; more costly alternatives
                                          exist where grade separation must be constructed.
Meandering walkway and Bicycle Lane along
Baseline Avenue                           GOAL #4:
                                          Our City’s bikeways and trails are uniformly safe and accessible.
                                          Policies:
                                          1) Separation of the bikeway and trail system from traffic and roadways
                                              should be established wherever possible.
                                          2) Multi-use trails shall provide clear separation of hikers, joggers, and
                                              equestrians.
                                          3) Safety features for cyclists and pedestrians, such as separated grades,
                                              lighting, buffers, bollards, and landscaping should be used wherever
                                              necessary.

Actions:
1) Prepare schedule and budget for the capital improvements necessary to
     ensure the safe junction of current or future bike and trails with existing
     or proposed streets.
2) Develop a consistent sign program for the City’s bikeway and trail
     network.
ISSUE #5: USE OF UTILITY AND FLOOD CONTROL
CORRIDORS
How can the City most effectively use utility easements and flood control
channels to expand its trail network?
Discussion: For safety, enjoyment and aesthetic reasons, it is desirable to
separate bikers, joggers, hikers and equestrian users from cars. In this area,
Fontana has the good fortune to contain a number of abandoned railroad
rights-of-way, utility easements and flood control channels for this purpose.
In fact, the majority of the proposed recreational trails are planned along
these routes.
The City has already completed working drawings of the San Sevaine Creek
Bike and Recreational Trails that include typical channel sections, road
crossings at Baseline Avenue, West Liberty Parkway and North Heritage
Circle. Over time and as funding permits, the City will continue to
implement the proposed trail system for other areas. Major consideration
must be given to safety concerns related to slope changes, grade crossings,
and storm water.
GOAL #5:
Our system of bikeways and trails is benefited by efficient use of utility
easements, flood-control easements and railroad rights-of-way.
Policies:
1) The City should seek use of easements and rights-of-way from owners
     for use in the bike and trail network.
2) The City shall coordinate with neighboring municipalities and the
     County for the planning, acquisition and development of an expanded
     bikeway and trail system.
Actions:
1) Develop a long-term action plan for the phased completion of the
     bikeways and recreational trails master plan.

                                       2) Adopt and implement the San Sevaine Creek Bike and Recreation Trail
                                            as an important first step in the eventual completion of the City’s
                                            recreational trail network.
                                       3) Adopt safety design guidelines for use in each implementation phase of
                                            the trails network.
                                       ISSUE #6: FUNDING PARKS AND TRAILS
                                       How can we fund our parks and trails program?
                                       Discussion: Maintenance, operation and improvements to existing parks and
                                       trails, as well as developing new facilities, requires careful planning and a
                                       variety of funding methods. Managing recreation facilities over time is
                                       costly, and a sustained commitment to their improvement is important to
                                       keep the system intact. Building and maintaining trails can be especially
                                       costly since they often cover great distances and require special design
                                       attention at their intersection with roadways. Costs associated with parks and
                                       trails fall into four categories:
                                       1) Operation and maintenance;
                                       2) Facility upgrades/additions to existing parks;

                                       With regard to operations, maintenance, and upgrades, the bulk of funds
                                       come from the City’s General Fund. To augment this source, the City can
                                       also consider user fees, rental revenue, concession sales at selected facilities,
                                       landscape maintenance and community facilities districts, and volunteer
                                       programs. With regard to the development of new parks and trail systems,
                                       the City has a variety of funding sources at its disposal:
                                                 Land dedications and in-lieu fees as a condition of approval;
                                                 Federal, state and county grant programs;
                                                 Negotiated agreements with public, semi-public and private
                                                 corporations, such as utility companies and flood control districts for
                                                 use of easements; and
                                                 Use of general obligation and revenue bonds, which require a two-
                                                 thirds vote of approval from citizens.
                                       The critical ingredient is finding ways to keep these facilities “on the
                                       agenda” so that continuing progress can be sustained, even if only modest
                                       commitments can be made from time to time because of competition for
                                       limited funds.

INTRODUCTION
Setting the Stage
In the 1990s, the Fontana area was one of the fastest growing communities in
southern California. This trend is expected to continue for at least the first
two decades of the 21st Century. Unchecked growth can lead to development
in unsafe areas; therefore, the City of Fontana has embraced the updating of
its General Plan, including a complete overhaul of its Safety Element. The
Safety Element before you addresses some of the issues that pose a hazard to
the Fontana area, but more importantly, provides goals, policies, and actions
that the City has committed to implement to reduce its risk from these
hazards. [Risk is defined as the outcome of the interaction between a hazard
and the elements of the community, such as population, buildings, and
infrastructure that are vulnerable to such an impact.]
Some of the hazards of concern to Fontana include earthquakes, mudflows,
reservoir failure, wildland and structural fire, and the contamination of soil
and groundwater resources by hazardous materials associated with some of
the commercial and industrial facilities present in the city and its Sphere of
Influence. These hazards can impact the area’s residents, workers, and
visitors, and can cause the disruption of critical (hospital, schools, fire
stations) and essential (water, gas, sewage, electricity, communications)
facilities. Each of these hazards is described further in the following pages;
for a more detailed description of each of these conditions, refer to the
accompanying Technical Background Report.
Purpose and Scope of the Safety Element
The ultimate objective of the Safety Element is to improve the safety of the
community, and in the process make it more sustainable and prosperous. To
that end, the Safety Element describes the natural conditions that pose a
hazard, but most importantly, it presents goals, policies, and actions that if
City of Fontana General Plan                General Plan Amendment No. 10-003                11-1

     implemented can substantially reduce the risk these hazards pose to the city
     of Fontana and its residents. Goals are statements that describe the City’s
     purpose and direction in reducing its natural hazards. Policies are guidelines
     that can be implemented to reduce the City’s risk and maximize the
     community’s emergency preparedness. Actions are the specific measures
     that the City has committed to implementing over time to reduce its hazards.
     Safety Elements are by scope and definition, provisional. Although the
     ultimate goal of these types of documents does not change much over time,
     the information, tools and techniques available to assess the community’s
     risk to various types of hazards are continuously evolving. Policies and
     action plans should be considered within a framework that identifies
     priorities and timelines. As the more critical action items are achieved,
     emphasis is shifted to new priorities. Most of the data, relationships and
     processes that affect a community are spatial in nature, and multi-variant. As
     a result, manipulation of the data and assessment of the risk can be quite
     complex. Fortunately, geographic information systems (GIS) are
     increasingly being used for this purpose, and Fontana has already embraced
     the use of GIS-based mapping. The hardware and software available to
     manage the City’s risk using GIS will only get better with time.
     For effective emergency preparedness and response, communities need to
     know in advance what are the potentially hazardous conditions specific to
     their area. A major part of this effort requires mapping of the vulnerable
     areas in the community. This is covered in the Technical Background Report
     to the Safety Element. For example, the Technical Report identifies the fault
     zones that cross the city, areas of potentially unstable slopes, areas
     susceptible to wildfire and flooding, and locations of the facilities that use or
     generate hazardous materials. Computer simulations that estimate loss of life
     and damage to buildings and infrastructure (such as HAZUS, the software
     used for this study) are still in their infancy, but they have already proven to
     be of value in designing and prioritizing appropriate mitigation plans.
     Once this information is known, appropriate land use practices and
     management can be identified and implemented to reduce the hazards
     identified. These are the topics covered in this document.
     IMPORTANT TERMS AND CONCEPTS
     The following technical terms and concepts are used in the Safety Element to
     describe and discuss earthquakes and other geologic hazards, flooding, and
     hazardous materials conditions. For a more thorough list of terms, refer to
     the Glossary in the Technical Background Report.
11-2                                                               SAFETY ELEMENT

                                                                                11. SAFETY ELEMENT
Earthquakes and Other Seismic Hazards
A break or fracture between blocks of rock is called a fault. Sudden,
differential movement on a fault causes an earthquake. The strain energy
released during an earthquake makes the earth vibrate and shake. Scientists
typically use moment magnitude to measure the size of an earthquake,
which is based on the amount of energy released and is directly proportional
to the area of the fault plane that ruptured. A magnitude 6.0 earthquake
releases 32 times the energy of a magnitude 5.0, and a magnitude 7.0
earthquake releases about 1,000 (32 x 32) more energy than a magnitude 5.0
earthquake. Earthquake damage is typically measured relative to an intensity
scale. The Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale describes the observable effects
that an earthquake has on structures and people. An earthquake has only one
magnitude, but several intensities, because intensity effects vary with the
location. Typically (although not always), intensities decrease with
increasing distance from the epicenter of the earthquake.
In California, faults that have moved at least once in about the last 11,000
years are considered active and capable of generating earthquakes in the
future. Some faults generate earthquakes every few tens to hundreds of
years, while others only break every few thousand years. Faults with shorter
recurrence intervals (time between earthquakes) have higher slip rates, and
are generally considered to pose a greater seismic hazard. In southern
California, the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults have the highest
recurrence intervals, and are therefore considered to have a higher probability
of causing an earthquake in the future. The seismic risk posed by a fault is
also dependent on when a fault ruptured last. A fault with a recurrence
interval of five thousand years that has not caused an earthquake in as many
years may be near the end of its strain accumulation cycle, and may therefore
have a higher probability of rupturing than a fault that recently caused an
earthquake. If a fault breaks to the ground surface, primary ground
rupture occurs. This typically results in a relatively small percentage of the
total damage in an earthquake, but structures sitting directly on top of the
ruptured fault can be damaged extensively.
Earthquake-induced strong ground shaking causes most of the earthquake
damage. Damage to structures is usually caused by strong horizontal
ground acceleration, which is measured as a percentage of g, the
acceleration of gravity. The degree of shaking depends on several factors,
including earthquake size, location, depth of the focus, orientation and
movement of the seismic waves (source effects); the type of sediments or
rocks that the seismic waves travel through (path effects); and the interaction
between the structures and the sediments or rocks at a specific site (site
effects). Strong ground shaking can also trigger the destructive secondary
effects of liquefaction and slope failure (landslides). Liquefaction occurs in
soft, saturated sediments – when the ground shakes, the water that fills the
pores increases in pressure, causing the soil to lose strength and behave as a
liquid.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                   11-3

     Geologic Hazards
     Slope failure does not need to be triggered by an earthquake. Intense
     precipitation events, or long periods of sustained rainfall can saturate the
     soils even on a gentle slope, with the potential for the soils, and the
     underlying slope, to become unstable. If, in response to gravity, the saturated
     soils move down slope, they can form mudflows or debris flows. Mudflows
     can cause extensive damage to structures in their path. A slope can also
     become unstable and fail due to man-made modifications or stream erosion.
     Some of the most significant factors that contribute to slope failure include
     slope height and steepness, shear strength and orientation of weak layers in
     the underlying geologic units, and pore water pressures. Damaging debris
     flows frequently occur on slopes that were recently burned because there are
     few roots holding down the soil, and the surface is covered with ash and
     other debris.
     Although not sudden and catastrophic, there are other potential geological
     hazards that if not recognized and mitigated properly, can cause extensive
     damage to structures. These hazards are specific to the soils that serve as a
     foundation to buildings and infrastructure, and include collapsible and
     expansive soils. Collapsible soils undergo a rearrangement of their grains,
     and a loss of cementation, resulting in substantial and rapid settlement under
     relatively low loads. Expansive soils are fine-grained soils with variable
     amounts of clay minerals that can undergo significant volumetric changes as
     a result of changes in moisture content. The upward pressures induced by
     the swelling can have significant harmful effects upon structures and other
     surface improvements.
     Flood Hazards
     Rain in southern California is generally a welcomed event – it cleans the air
     we breathe, makes our hills and mountains green, and provides water for our
     recharge basins and reservoirs. Prolonged and intense rainfall however, can
     be a less than pleasant experience. Flood-prone communities can experience
     swollen river channels, flooded streets and basements, mudflows and debris
     flows at the mouths of canyons, and other similar conditions that can cause
     extensive damage to property, injuries, and, in some cases, loss of life.
     The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) defines the “base
     flood” or “100-year flood” as a flood that has a 1-percent or greater chance
     of being equaled or exceeded during any given year. A base flood has a 26-
     percent chance of occurring during a 30-year period, generally the length of
     most home mortgages. However, the recurrence interval represents the long-
     term average period between floods of a specific magnitude; major floods
     could occur at shorter intervals or even within the same year.
     The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) National Flood
     Insurance Program offers federally subsidized flood insurance to property

                                                                                   11. SAFETY ELEMENT
owners in those communities that adopt and enforce floodplain management
ordinances that meet minimum criteria established by FEMA.
Fire Hazards
The fire hazard severity of an area is determined based on the type and
amount of vegetation, termed fuel loading; slope gradient; and weather (fire
hazard increases in the summer and fall, when the weather is hot and dry –
and especially when there are Santa Ana wind conditions). The Bates Bill
Process also considers dwelling density, past fire hazard history, and local
building and fire codes in determining Very High Fire Hazard Severity
Zones. When a wildland fire encroaches onto the built environment,
multiple ignitions can develop as a result of “branding,” the term for wind
transport of burning cinders over long distances. If ignited structures sustain
and transmit the fire from one building to the next, a catastrophic fire can
ensue. Firestorms, especially in areas of wildland-urban interfaces can be
particularly dangerous and complex, posing a severe threat to public and
firefighter safety, and causing devastating losses of both life and property.
Non-federal unincorporated areas identified as having a fire hazard are
referred to as State Responsibility Areas (SRAs) because the State has the
primary financial responsibility of preventing and suppressing fires there.
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection is the agency
responsible for suppressing fires in SRAs. However, at the wildland
interface, where City boundaries abut federal land, the local fire agency is
responsible for suppressing fires.
Earthquakes have the potential to generate multiple structural fires that have
the potential to severely tax the local fire suppression agencies. The response
capability of the local fire agencies to wildfires or structural fires is dictated
by the distribution of fire stations relative to the high-risk areas; the response
efficiency of the companies as affected by traffic and road patterns; the
effectiveness of the response teams; the response reliability due to fire
companies being busy on other emergency calls; and the depletion of
available resources due to heavy call volumes.
Hazardous Materials
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines a
hazardous waste as a substance that 1) may cause or significantly contribute
to an increase in mortality or an increase in serious, irreversible, or
incapacitating reversible illness; and 2) poses a substantial present or
potential future hazard to human health or the environment when it is
improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of or otherwise managed.
Hazardous waste is also ignitable, corrosive, or reactive (explosive) (U.S.
EPA 40 CFR 260.10). A material may also be classified as a hazardous
material if it contains defined amounts of toxic chemicals. The EPA has
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                      11-5

     developed a list of specific hazardous wastes that are in the forms of solids,
     semi-solids, liquids, and gases.
     The State of California defines hazardous materials as substances that are
     toxic, ignitable or flammable, reactive, or corrosive. The State also defines
     an extremely hazardous material as a substance that shows high acute or
     chronic toxicity, is a carcinogen (causes cancer), has bioaccumulative
     properties (accumulates in the body’s tissues), is persistent in the
     environment, or is reactive in water.
     The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality
     Standards for pollutants considered harmful to public health and the
     environment. To that end, the EPA requires that the levels of five major air
     pollutants be measured on a daily basis. These Air Quality Indexes are
     reported daily in the local news media serving metropolitan areas with
     populations exceeding 200,000. Air Quality Indexes are reported using a
     numerical value between 0 and 500 that corresponds to a health descriptor
     like “good” or “unhealthful.” The local agency responsible for monitoring
     and enforcing air quality is the South Coast Air Quality Management
     District.
     The EPA’s National Primary Drinking Water Standard protects drinking
     water quality by limiting the levels of specific contaminants that are known
     to occur or have the potential to occur in water and can adversely affect
     public health. The EPA and the California Department of Health Services
     (DHS) set the Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for specific
     contaminants in ground water. These contaminants include organic and
     inorganic chemicals (minerals), substances that are known to cause cancer
     (carcinogens), radionuclides (such as uranium and radon), and microbial
     contaminants. Water purveyors are required to test their water for these
     contaminants on a fixed schedule, and report their results to the DHS.
     Leaking underground storage tanks (USTs) have been recognized since
     the early 1980s as the primary cause of groundwater contamination by
     gasoline compounds and solvents. In California, regulations aimed at
     protecting against UST leaks have been in place since 1983. California’s
     program is more stringent than the Federal program, requiring that all tanks
     be double walled, and prohibiting gasoline delivery to non-compliant tanks.
     The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) has been designated the
     lead regulatory agency in the development of UST regulations and policy.
     The SWRCB maintains an inventory of leaking underground storage tanks in
     a statewide database.
     Treatment of hazardous waste is defined as any process that changes the
     physical, chemical, or biological character of the waste to make it less of an
     environmental threat. Treatment can include neutralizing the waste,
     recovering energy or material resources from the waste, rendering the waste
     less hazardous, or making the waste safer to transport, dispose of, or store.

treated, disposed of, or stored at a different facility at the end of the storage
period. Disposal is the permanent placement of the waste into or on the land.
Disposal facilities are usually designed to contain the waste permanently and
to prevent the release of harmful pollutants to the environment.
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
There are several Federal and State programs and regulations pertaining to
public safety that provide the legal framework to Safety Elements of the
General Plan. These programs provide the minimum guidelines and criteria
that must be complied with – local jurisdictions can choose to go beyond the
Federal or State requirements and implement more stringent regulations.
Some of the specific plans and programs that apply to the city of Fontana are
discussed briefly below. This is not intended to be an all-inclusive list. For a
more detailed description of the programs described below, refer to the
Technical Background Report. For information regarding additional Federal,
State and City regulations, refer to the Federal and State Codes of
Regulations, and the City of Fontana Municipal Codes (all of these can be
found on the world wide web, using various search engines).
California Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault
Zoning Act
The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act was signed into law in 1972
with its primary purpose being to mitigate the hazard of fault rupture by
prohibiting the location of structures for human occupancy across the trace of
an active fault. The Act requires the State Geologist to delineate "Earthquake
Fault Zones" along faults that are "sufficiently active" and "well defined."
The Act dictates that cities and counties withhold development permits for
projects within an Earthquake Fault Zone within their jurisdiction until
geologic investigations demonstrate that the projects are not threatened by
surface displacements from future earthquakes. Projects include all land
divisions and most structures for human occupancy. State law exempts
single-family wood-frame and steel-frame dwellings that are less than three
stories and are not part of a development of four units or more. However,
local agencies can be more restrictive than the State.
California Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
The goal of the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 is to minimize loss of
life and property by identifying and mitigating seismic hazards. The act
addresses non-surface fault rupture earthquake hazards, including strong
ground shaking, liquefaction, and seismically induced landslides. The State
agency charged with implementation of the Act is the California Geological
Survey (CGS). The CGS prepares and provides local governments with
seismic hazard zone maps that identify areas susceptible to amplified
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                     11-7

     shaking, liquefaction, earthquake-induced landslides, and other ground
     failures. The seismic hazard zones delineated by the CGS are referred to as
     “zones of required investigation” because site-specific geological
     investigations are required for construction projects located within these
     areas.
     Real Estate Disclosure Requirements
     Pursuant to the Natural Hazards Disclosure Act, since June 1, 1998, sellers
     of real property and their agents are required to provide prospective buyers
     with a "Natural Hazard Disclosure Statement" when the property being sold
     lies within one or more State-mapped hazard areas, such as within an
     Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone or a Seismic Hazard Zone.
     California Environmental Quality Act
     The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was passed in 1970 to
     insure that local governmental agencies consider and review the
     environmental impacts of proposed projects within their jurisdictions. CEQA
     requires that an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) be prepared for projects
     that may have significant effects on the environment. EIRs are required to
     identify the geologic and seismic hazards specific to the project, and
     recommend potential mitigation measures, giving the local agency the
     authority to regulate private developments in the early stages of planning.
     California Building Code
     The California Building Code (CBC), which is included in Title 24 of the
     California Administrative Code, provides “minimum standards to safeguard
     life or limb, health, property and public welfare by regulating and controlling
     the design, construction, quality of materials, use and occupancy, location
     and maintenance of all buildings and structures” within the City of Fontana.
     These documents are historically updated every three years. The City of
     Fontana recently adopted the 2001 CBC, which is based on the 1997
     Uniform Building Code.
     Unreinforced Masonry Law
     The Unreinforced Masonry Law of 1986 requires all cities and counties in
     Seismic Zone 4 (CBC, 1998) to identify hazardous unreinforced masonry
     (URM) buildings in their jurisdictions. Owners of such buildings must be
     notified of the potential earthquake hazard, and mitigation must be
     performed. The mitigation method, which may include retrofitting or
     demolition, is left to the local jurisdiction. The Fontana area lies entirely
     within Seismic Zone 4. The City of Fontana has identified 85 unreinforced
     masonry structures in its jurisdiction; all of these are considered non-historic.
     The City has notified the owners of the buildings, but there are no mitigation

measures or standards in place, and mitigation of these structures is not being
required or enforced (Seismic Safety Commission, 2000).
National Flood Insurance Act and Flood
Disaster Protection Act
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is mandated by the
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and the Flood Disaster Protection Act
of 1973 to evaluate flood hazards and provide Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRMs) for local and regional planners to promote sound land use and
floodplain development. The Flood Disaster Protection Act requires owners
of all structures in identified Special Flood Hazard Areas to purchase and
maintain flood insurance as a condition of receiving Federal or federally
related financial assistance, such as mortgage loans from federally insured
lending institutions. The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994
further strengthened the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) by
providing a grant program for State and community flood mitigation projects.
The act also established a system (Community Rating System - CRS) for
crediting communities that implement measures to protect the natural and
beneficial functions of their floodplains, as well as managing the erosion
hazard. The City of Fontana has participated in the NFIP since 1987 (City
ID No. – 060274); however, Fontana is not currently listed in FEMA’s CRS
of cities.
Fire Regulations
Assembly Bill 337 (the Bates Bill, adopted September 29, 1992) was a direct
result of the great loss of lives and homes in the Oakland Hills “Tunnel Fire”
of 1991. The Bates Bill Process is used to identify Very High Fire Hazard
Severity Zones in Local Responsibility Areas. Government Code Section
51178 specifies that the Director of the California Department of Forestry
(CDF), in cooperation with local fire authorities, shall identify areas that are
Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones (VHFHSZs) in Local Responsibility
areas (LRAs), based on consistent statewide criteria and the expected
severity of fire hazard. State Responsibility Areas (SRAs) include all lands
regardless of ownership, except for cities and federal lands. Although the
State has financial responsibility for SRAs, it is not the State’s responsibility
to provide fire protection services to any building or structure located within
a wildland area, unless the CDF has entered into a cooperative agreement
with a local agency for those purposes pursuant to Public Resources Code
Section 4142. Under Assembly Bill 3819, passed in 1994 (AB 3819 –
Willie Brown), “Class A” roofing, minimum clearances of 30 feet around
structures, and other fire defense improvements are required in VHFHSZs.
Many communities require vegetation management zones far wider than 30
feet; in the northern part of Fontana, 300 feet is recommended.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                     11-9

      Government Code Section 51178 states that a local agency may, at its
      discretion, exclude from the requirements of Section 51182 an area identified
      as a VHFHSZ by the CDF. This requires a finding, supported by substantial
      evidence, that the requirements of Section 51182 are not necessary for
      effective fire protection within the area. Conversely, local agencies may
      include areas not identified as a VHFHSZ by the CDF, following a finding
      that the requirements of Section 51182 are necessary for effective fire
      protection. According to Section 51182, such changes made by a local
      agency shall be final and cannot be rebutted by the CDF.
      Wildland areas require disclosure for real-estate transactions. Specifically,
      Assembly Bill 6 (AB6) requires that both types of fire hazard areas (SRAs
      and VHFHSZs) be disclosed in real estate transactions. Civil Code Section
      1103(c)(6) also requires real estate sellers to inform prospective buyers
      whether or not a property is located within a wildland area that could contain
      substantial fire risks and hazards.
      Public Resources Code Section 4290 requires minimum statewide fire
      safety standards pertaining to:
               Road standards for fire equipment access;
               Standards for signs identifying streets, roads, and buildings;
               Minimum private water supply reserves for emergency fire use; and
               Fuel breaks and greenbelts.
      Wildland fire areas are also subject to Public Resources Code Sections
      4291 through 4299, which require property owners in such areas to conduct
      maintenance in order to reduce the fire danger.
      The California Emergency Services Act, Section 8568, states that “the
      State Emergency Plan shall be in effect in each political subdivision of the
      State, and the governing body of each political subdivision shall take such
      action as may be necessary to carry out the provision thereof.” The act
      provides the basic authorities for conducting emergency operations following
      the proclamations of emergencies by the Governor or appropriate local
      authority, such as a City Manager.
      The City of Fontana uses the California Fire Code with amendments and
      several other fire ordinances to further reduce the City’s vulnerability to
      structural and wildland fires. For example, since 1986, fire sprinklers and
      smoke detectors have been required for all new homes in Fontana.
      National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
      System (NPDES)
      The Clean Water Act of 1995 and its subsequent amendments give the U.S.
      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to regulate industrial
      and municipal discharges into public storm drains, sewer systems, and
11-10                                                              SAFETY ELEMENT

                                                                                 11. SAFETY ELEMENT
surface water bodies. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit program controls water pollution by regulating
point sources and non-point sources that discharge pollutants into waters of
the United States. EPA defines point sources as discrete conveyances such
as pipes or man-made ditches. Non-point source pollution refers to the
introduction of bacteria, sediment, oil and grease, heavy metals, pesticides,
fertilizers and other chemicals into our rivers, bays and oceans.
The City of Fontana is a co-permittee and the local enforcing agency for the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). The San
Bernardino County Stormwater program is the principal permittee in the
area. This program regulates and controls storm water and urban runoff into
the Santa Ana River and its tributaries and ultimately, the Pacific Ocean.
Local NPDES permits are filed with the California Regional Water Quality
Control Board, Santa Ana Region.
Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-
Know Act (EPCRA)
The primary purpose of the Federal Emergency Planning and Community
Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) is to inform communities and citizens of
chemical hazards in their areas. Sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA require
businesses to report to state and local agencies the locations and quantities of
chemicals stored on-site. Section 313 of EPCRA requires manufacturers to
report the release to the environment of any of more than 600 designated
toxic chemicals. These reports are submitted to the U.S. EPA and state
agencies and help communities prepare to respond to chemical spills and
similar emergencies.
EPCRA mandates that Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) reports be made
public. The TRI is a database that contains information on toxic chemical
releases and other waste management activities reported annually by certain
industry groups as well as federal facilities. This inventory was established in
1986 under the EPCRA and expanded by the Pollution Prevention Act of
1990.
Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act (CERCLA) of 1980 is a regulatory or statute law developed to protect
the water, air, and land resources from the risks created by past chemical
disposal practices. This act is also referred to as the Superfund Act, and the
sites listed under it are referred to as Superfund sites.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                    11-11
      Resources Conservation and Recovery Act
      The Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is the principal
      Federal law that regulates the generation, management, and transportation of
      hazardous materials and hazardous wastes. Hazardous waste management
      includes the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste. The EPA
      maintains lists of the facilities that generate or transport large quantities of
      hazardous materials.
      Hazardous Materials Disclosure Program
      As indicated previously, hazardous materials are extensively legislated by the
      Federal, State and City governments. Both the Federal government (Code of
      Federal Regulations, EPA, SARA and Title III) and the State of California
      (California State Health and Safety Code, Division 20, Chapter 6.95,
      Sections 25500–25520; California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Chapter 2,
      Sub-Chapter 3, Article 4, Sections 2729-2734) require all businesses that
      handle more than a specified amount of hazardous materials or extremely
      hazardous materials, termed a reporting quantity, to submit a business plan to
      its local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA). The CUPA with
      responsibility for the City of Fontana is the San Bernardino County Fire
      Department – Hazardous Materials Division.
      In 1986, Congress passed the Superfund Amendments and
      Reauthorization Act (SARA). Title III of this legislation requires that each
      community establish a Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This
      committee is responsible for developing an emergency plan that outlines
      steps to prepare for and respond to chemical emergencies in that community.
      Several California statutes require the emergency notification of a hazardous
      chemical release. These include: Health and Safety Codes §25270.7,
      §25270.8 and §25507; Vehicle Code §23112.5; Public Utilities Code §7673;
      Government Codes §51018, §8670.25.5(a); Water Codes §13271 and
      §13272; and California Labor Code §6409.1(b)10. The Safe Drinking
      Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, better known as Proposition
      65, and §9030 of the California Labor Code also has specific reporting
      requirements.
      GEOLOGIC, SEISMIC AND
      HYDROLOGIC SETTING
      The city of Fontana and its Sphere of Influence are located in the central part
      of the Upper Santa Ana River Valley, a region that has been referred to as the
      “Fontana Plain” (Dutcher and Garrett, 1963). This part of the valley is
      defined by the steeply rising range front of the eastern San Gabriel
      Mountains on the north, Lytle Creek Wash on the east, and the Jurupa
      Mountains on the south. Although small portions of the San Gabriel and
11-12                                                                SAFETY ELEMENT

                                                                               11. SAFETY ELEMENT
Jurupa Mountains are within city limits, nearly all of the past development
has occurred on the gently sloping valley floor. At the south end of the city,
a major portion of the Jurupa Mountains has been dedicated to park (Martin
Tudor-Jurupa Hills Regional Park) and open space areas. The northernmost
part of the city encroaches onto the base of the San Gabriel Mountains,
encompassing the lower reach of San Sevaine Canyon, and extending
eastward almost to the mouth of Lytle Creek. Elevations in the valley range
from about 850 feet above mean sea level at the southwestern corner of the
city to about 2,000 feet near the northernmost point. In the Jurupa
Mountains, the highest point within the city is approximately 1,740 feet
above mean sea level, and within the San Gabriel Mountains, the high point
is at an elevation of about 2,840 feet.
The city of Fontana straddles the junction between two major southern
California geologic provinces, the Transverse Ranges to the north, and the
Peninsular Ranges to the south, with the base of the San Gabriel Mountains
(and the Cucamonga fault zone) marking the boundary. The San Gabriel
Mountains are part of the Transverse Ranges province. The characteristic
features that define this province are a series of predominantly east-west
trending mountain ranges and their intervening valleys. The ranges
encompass the northern part of San Bernardino County, as well as parts of
Riverside, Los Angeles, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties. The Santa Ana
River Valley is considered a part of the Peninsular Ranges, a province
characterized by a northwest-trending geologic structural grain aligned with
the San Andreas fault system, and represented by northwest-trending
mountains and valleys stretching all the way to the Mexican border.
The San Gabriel Mountains are located in the central part of the Transverse
Ranges, where they rise abruptly to heights of more than 6,000 feet above the
valley floor. Bounded by the San Andreas fault system on the northeast and
the Cucamonga fault zone on the south, the mountains are essentially a large
block of the Earth’s crust that has been squeezed up and thrust over the
valley floor by north-south compression along the San Andreas tectonic plate
boundary. Tectonic forces that initiated the rise of the mountains are thought
to have started about 3.5 million years ago, at a time when scientists now
believe there was a change in the relative motion of the Pacific and North
American tectonic plates from strike-slip (slipping horizontally past one
another) to transpressive (oblique movement that is a combination of strike-
slip and compression). Uplift of the mountains accelerated in mid-
Pleistocene time, about 500,000 years ago, and continues today. The San
Gabriel Mountains are among the fasting rising, as well as the fastest
disintegrating, mountain ranges in the world.
Along the mountain front, the Santa Ana River Valley is shaped by
coalescing alluvial fans that have a range of ages coincident with the rise of
the San Gabriel Mountains. The city of Fontana is situated on geologically
young alluvium forming the Lytle Creek Fan. These young sediments are
underlain by older alluvial fan deposits, and at great depth, by crystalline
bedrock similar to that exposed in the nearby mountains. Scattered, slightly
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                  11-13

      elevated remnants of the older fans are exposed at the surface where they
      have not been buried by the younger sediments. Sediment transport and
      deposition on the Lytle Creek Fan now takes place largely within Lytle
      Creek Wash.
      Displacements on faults at the northern edge of the Santa Ana River Valley
      are mainly of the thrust or thrust-oblique type, causing older geologic units to
      be pushed up along a series of faults that dip northward beneath the
      mountains they form. In the Fontana area this is represented by the
      Cucamonga fault zone, which has thrust ancient crystalline rocks onto
      younger sediments filling the valley. Major strike-slip faults are also present
      in the vicinity, and where they have been most recently active, they have
      deformed the landscape and altered drainage patterns. Examples of such
      faulting in the Fontana vicinity are the San Jacinto and San Andreas faults,
      both predominantly right-lateral faults that are responsible for creating linear
      valleys and ridges, as well as offset stream channels. The relationship
      between the two styles of fault movement (thrust and strike-slip) is complex
      and not well understood. Consequently, it is currently one of the focus points
      in the ongoing research for a better understanding of earthquake hazards in
      the greater Los Angeles region.
      Three faults have been mapped at depth within the portion of the valley floor
      encompassed by the city of Fontana and its area of interest. Two of these
      were recognized many years ago because of disparities in water levels in
      pumping wells on either side of the faults (Eckis, 1934; Dutcher and Garrett,
      1963). The faults act to various degrees as impediments to the movement of
      ground water in the deep alluvial aquifers underlying the area. This is
      thought to be due to offset of the water-bearing layers, or to the presence of
      clay or cementation along the fault plane. Since the faults do not have
      surface expression and are only approximately located based largely on
      hydrological evidence, they are commonly referred to as groundwater
      barriers. The most effective of these barriers (Barrier H of Dutcher and
      Garrett, 1963) was originally named the Rialto-Colton fault by Eckis (1934).
      The second fault is known as Barrier J (Dutcher and Garrett, 1963). The third
      fault trends across the center of the city in a northeast direction. This fault
      (or set of faults) has been mapped at that location based on a pronounced
      concentration of microearthquakes (referred to as the “Fontana Seismic
      Trend”) that have been reported along this line for many years (Hadley and
      Combs, 1974; Cramer and Harrington, 1987; Sheridan, 1997). Micro-seismic
      activity also marks the approximate location of Barrier J (Burnett and Hart,
      1994). For additional information regarding these faults, refer to Chapter 1,
      Seismic Hazards, in the Technical Background Report.
      ISSUES, GOALS, POLICIES & ACTIONS
      In conformance with Section 65302(g) of the California Code of Regulations,
      the City of Fontana has updated its Safety Element of the General Plan. A
11-14                                                               SAFETY ELEMENT

comprehensive Safety Element addresses a variety of natural and man-made
hazards and provides goals and policies aimed at reducing the risk associated
with these hazards.
The Safety Element serves the following functions:
         Provides an assessment of the natural and man-made hazards in the
         city, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, fire, flood,
         dam inundation, and hazardous materials incidents;
         Provides a framework by which safety considerations are introduced
         into the land use planning process and the redevelopment process;
         Strengthens the City’s existing municipal codes, and provides
         guidelines that the City can use during the project review and
         permitting process to identify and mitigate hazards for new
         development and redevelopment;
         Provides policies directed at identifying and reducing hazards in
         existing development; and
         Strengthens earthquake flood, fire, and hazardous materials
         preparedness planning and post-disaster reconstruction policies
         particular to the city of Fontana.
Whether related to earthquakes, other natural or man-made hazards, or
disaster preparedness, Safety Element goals are guided by the City’s
responsibility to:
         Minimize fatalities and injuries;
         Minimize the burden on public and emergency response resources
         (police, fire, medical, etc.);
         Minimize public and private costs for cleanup, repair, and recovery;
         and
         Minimize long-term impacts caused by displaced households,
         business disruption, and reduced fiscal resources (with a consequent
         tax burden).
Policy statements address specific concerns believed to be of long-term
planning importance to the community. Actions, on the other hand, are
specific implementation measures selected to maintain or improve public
safety, and to satisfy the objectives of the policies and goals.
The following are recommendations for the Safety Element policy
framework for the city of Fontana based on findings presented in the
Technical Background Report.
ISSUE #1: SEISMIC HAZARDS
What can the City do to minimize its seismic hazards?
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                       11-15

      Discussion: The Cucamonga and San Jacinto faults, two of the most active
      faults in southern California, extend across the northern portion of the city of
      Fontana. Three possible faults have been mapped at depth under the city of
      Fontana and its area of interest. Two of these form groundwater barriers
      (Barrier H and Barrier J). The third feature (Fontana Seismic Trend) is
      delineated by a pronounced concentration of small earthquakes, and may be
      expressed at the surface by a series of northeast-trending lineaments that
      have not been investigated previously. See Figure 11-1, Fault Map, for a
      depiction of these seismic features. The city of Fontana also lies within a
      few miles of the San Andreas Fault. As a result, the entire study area is
      susceptible to very strong ground shaking, and some areas of the city can be
      impacted by surface fault rupture. Given that ground water may occur within
      40 feet of the surface in that portion of the Lytle Creek channel located
      within the city, the channel is considered susceptible to liquefaction. Other
      areas in the southern portion of the city may also have a moderate
      susceptibility to liquefaction due to seasonal saturation of the near-surface
      sediments. See Figure 11-2, Liquefaction Susceptibility Map, for a depiction
      of these areas.
      A maximum magnitude earthquake on any of the three faults close to the city
      (Cucamonga, San Jacinto and San Andreas faults) has the potential to
      generate significant damage to wood-frame, reinforced concrete and steel
      structures, and to mobile homes. Most of the casualties anticipated in the
      area as a result of any of these earthquakes are thought to be associated with
      collapse of reinforced concrete and steel structures common in the
      commercial and industrial sections of the city. Mobile homes are expected to
      suffer extensive to complete damage. In all, nearly 50 percent of the
      structures in the area are expected to experience at least moderate damage.
      Damage to the local hospital is expected to be significant; given the number
      of people in the Fontana area that are expected to require hospitalization after
      any of these earthquakes, the existing hospital, even if fully operational, is
      not expected to be able to handle the demand. The models suggest that the
      local potable water and electric power systems will be severely taxed during
      an earthquake on any of the major earthquake sources nearby. HAZUS
      estimates that 96 percent of the schools in the area will experience at least
      moderate damage, although none will be completely damaged. The model
      also estimates that none of the schools in the area will be more than 50
      percent functional one day after the earthquake. All police stations and fire
      stations are anticipated to suffer at least moderate damage, and none of these
      facilities are expected to be more than 50 percent functional one day after the
      earthquake.

City of Fontana General Plan                      11-21
      GOAL #1:
      Injury and loss of life, property damage, and other impacts caused by
      seismic shaking, fault rupture, ground failure, earthquake-induced
      landslides, and other earthquake-induced ground deformation are
      minimized in our City.
      Policies:
      1) The City shall monitor development or re-development in areas where
          faults have been mapped through the city.
      2) The City shall ensure that current geologic knowledge and peer (third-
          party) review are incorporated into the design, planning, and construction
          stages of a project, and that site-specific data are applied to each project.
      3) The City shall strive to ensure that the design of new structures and the
          performance of existing structures address the appropriate earthquake
          hazards.
      4) The City shall ensure to the fullest extent possible that, in the event of a
          major disaster, essential structures and facilities remain safe and
          functional, as required by current law. Essential facilities include
          hospitals, police stations, fire stations, emergency operation centers,
          communication centers, generators and substations, and reservoirs.
      5) The City shall ensure to the fullest extent possible that, in the event of a
          major disaster, dependent care and high-occupancy facilities will remain
          safe.
      6) The City shall ensure that all residents and business owners in the City
          have access to information regarding seismic hazards.
      7) The City shall continue earthquake strengthening and provisions for
          alternate or back-up essential services, such as water, sewer, electricity,
          and natural gas pipelines and connections throughout the city. First
          priority for this action plan should be for the essential services within or
          north of the identified fault hazard management zones.
      Actions:
      1) Require geological studies, such as fault trenching, if developments or
          redevelopments are proposed within the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault
          Zones for the Cucamonga or San Jacinto faults. The studies shall be
          conducted by State-certified engineering geologists following the
          “Guidelines for Evaluating the Hazard of Surface Fault Rupture”
          published by the California Geological Survey. The City Geologist shall
          review the fault studies to ensure that the studies were conducted with an
          acceptable level of effort to determine whether or not there are active
          faults through the proposed development, and if warranted, that suitable
          fault setbacks are defined.
11-22                                                               SAFETY ELEMENT

                                                                                  11. SAFETY ELEMENT
2) Require geological studies, such as trenching, of the northeast-trending
     lineaments for essential facilities proposed within 50 feet of any of the
     lineaments shown. The studies shall be conducted by State-certified
     engineering geologists following the guidelines published by the
     California Geological Survey (see Action 1). The City Geologist shall
     review the fault studies to ensure that the studies were conducted with an
     acceptable level of effort to determine whether or not there are active
     faults through the proposed development, and if warranted, that suitable
     fault setbacks are defined.
3) Retain on staff, or on a contract basis, a State-certified engineering
     geologist and a geotechnical engineer to review all geologic and
     geotechnical studies for proposed development or redevelopment,
     including fault studies, and to review grading operations. These
     individuals, whether on staff or under contract to the City, are referred to
     herein as the City Geologist and City Geotechnical Engineer,
     respectively.
4) Require geological and geotechnical investigations in areas of potential
     seismic or geologic hazards as part of the environmental impact and
     development review process. Do not approve proposals and projects for
     development or redevelopment that do not provide for mitigation of
     seismic or geologic hazards to the satisfaction of the reviewing
     departments and agencies.
5) Require preliminary geological investigations of tract developments by
     State-registered geotechnical engineers and certified engineering
     geologists (in accordance with the California Building Code).
6) Require liquefaction assessment studies in those areas identified as
     having a low to high susceptibility to liquefaction. The liquefaction
     studies need to be conducted in accordance with the guidelines published
     by the California Geological Survey (Special Publication 117) and the
     Southern California Earthquake Center’s recommended procedures for
     implementation of Special Publication 117 guidelines.
7) Modify the Fault Map as data obtained from the implementation of the
     action plans under Policy 1-1 become available. Modification of the map
     will be conducted by or under the direction of the City Geologist.
     Changes to the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones for the
     Cucamonga and San Jacinto faults first need to be submitted to the
     California Geological Survey for review and consideration.
8) Modify the Liquefaction Susceptibility Map as data obtained from the
     implementation of Action 4 above become available. Modifications to
     the map shall be conducted by or under the direction of both the City
     Geologist and City Geotechnical Engineer.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                     11-23

      9) Continue to enforce the seismic design provisions for Seismic Zone 4 of
          the California Building Code, including near-source seismic conditions
          for all new construction in the city.
      10) Establish seismic retrofit standards and adopt a mandatory strengthening
          program for the unreinforced masonry structures (URMs) in the city to
          reduce the risk to life posed by these structures.
      11) Identify other types of un-retrofitted, potentially hazardous buildings,
          including tilt-up construction, non-ductile reinforced concrete, and tuck-
          under parking and other soft-story construction, and develop a catalog of
          these buildings in the city.
      12) Prepare a plan for structural retrofit of such buildings identified under
          Action Plan 3 above. Mandatory strengthening shall be required for all
          high-occupancy and essential buildings in the catalog.
      13) Disclose to buyers the potential problems with unbolted foundations in
          pre-1960 residences and encourage voluntary seismic retrofit of these
          structures.
      14) Encourage the seismic retrofit of mobile homes in the city.
      15) Continue to encourage the participation of the Planning and Building &
          Safety Departments during the early, conceptual stages of an essential
          facility project to assess its feasibility, with emphasis on issues such as
          ground shaking, surface fault rupture potential, liquefaction
          susceptibility, and flooding potential.
      16) Encourage compliance with the 1974 Hospital Facilities Seismic Safety
          Act, the 1986 California Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act, and Senate
          Bill 1953. Work with Kaiser Permanente Hospital and state agencies to
          ensure that the hospital buildings will remain operational following a
          maximum magnitude earthquake on the Cucamonga, San Jacinto, or San
          Andreas faults.
      17) Seek cooperative agreements with regional hospitals outside City limits
          that can provide medical assistance in the event that Kaiser Permanente
          Hospital does not have sufficient beds to accommodate all of the
          casualties resulting from an earthquake or other disaster. Open areas,
          such as parks and school fields, from which victims could be airlifted to
          regional hospitals if necessary will be identified as part of this action
          plan.
      18) Conduct seismic analysis of essential infrastructure such as water, sewer,
          electricity, and natural gas lines and make any structural changes
          necessary to withstand seismic activities. This may include additional
          strengthening, shoring and/or flexible pipelines in areas that cross fault
          hazard zones.
11-24                                                               SAFETY ELEMENT
                                                                                11. SAFETY ELEMENT
19) Review the aboveground water storage tanks in the city to determine
     their expected seismic performance. Seismic upgrade of these facilities,
     including the use of flexible joints and baffles will be conducted as
     necessary.
20) Encourage the Fontana Unified School District to strengthen or replace
     those school buildings that are not anticipated to perform well during an
     earthquake.
21) Review existing and proposed projects to ensure that stairways and
     elevators in high-occupancy buildings are adequately strengthened.
22) Develop an effective system for communicating information about risk
     and loss reduction strategies to City staff in all departments responsible
     for implementing the action plans defined in the Safety Element.
23) Educate the public on the hazards that can pose a risk to the City and its
     residents, and describe loss reduction strategies that can be used to
     mitigate the specific hazards identified, including the value of securely
     anchoring computers, shelving, and other non-structural elements that
     can cause significant harm if they fall as a result of ground shaking.
24) Use the City’s web site to communicate to the City’s residents, workers
     and visitors the hazards specific to the City, and, most importantly, to
     describe the loss reduction strategies that homeowners and workers can
     implement at home and the work place to reduce their risk.
ISSUE #2: GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
How can the City minimize its geologic hazards?
Discussion: The city of Fontana is largely situated on the surface of young
alluvial fans emanating from the San Gabriel Mountains. The valley is
underlain by thick deposits of alluvium consisting primarily of poorly to
crudely stratified sand, gravel, and boulders.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                   11-25

      The northern and southern edges of the city encroach onto or near hillside
      areas consisting of dense crystalline bedrock. See Figure 11-3, Slope
      Distribution Map, for a depiction of these areas. These hillsides are
      vulnerable to slope instability due primarily to the fractured, crushed and
      weathered condition of the bedrock, and the steep terrain. See Figure 11-4,
      Slope Instability Map, for a depiction of these areas. Oversteepened slopes,
      such as those along quarry excavations, are also locally susceptible to failure.
      The probability of large bedrock landslides occurring is relatively low, as
      indicated by the very few landslides that have actually been mapped in the
      area. Therefore the source of potential losses due to slope instability arises
      primarily from the occurrence of smaller slope failures in the form of small
      slides, slumps, soil slips, debris flows, and rockfalls. The potential for such
      failures can be enhanced by wildfire, heavy winter storms, seismic activity,
      or man’s activities.
      Development has reached the base of the San Gabriel and Jurupa Mountains
      in recent years. Without protection, portions of these developments may be
      susceptible to run-off, sedimentation, and small slope failures from the
      adjacent hills. Under the right climatic and geological conditions, mountain
      drainages can also produce destructive debris flows, especially in winters
      following wildfires.
      The soils that underlie most of the city and its area of interest are not
      considered potentially collapsible. However, the alluvial and wind-blown
      deposits on the valley floor may be susceptible to collapse. Therefore, in
      areas proposed for development, site-specific studies need to be conducted to
      evaluate the settlement potential of the underlying soils. These geotechnical
      studies should evaluate the collapse potential of the entire soil column within
      the effective depth of infiltration of irrigation water, instead of only the near-
      surface soils.
      Most of the sediments that blanket the valley area are coarse grained and
      generally have a very low potential for expansion. However, finer-grained
      components that are moderately to highly expansive may be present locally.
      These units are more likely to be present in the southern part of the city,
      where finer-grained sequences within the alluvial fans are present. These
      fine-grained units may not be present at the surface but may be exposed
      during grading. The presence of potentially expansive soils should be
      assessed for every project, on a lot-by-lot basis, with engineering solutions
      implemented as needed.
      Regional ground subsidence as a result of groundwater extraction has not
      been reported in the Fontana area but it is known to be occurring in other
      nearby regions. Careful management of the regional ground water basin that
      underlies the area can help avoid this hazard.

      Grading and construction operations are necessary to correct for unstable
      soils, soil erosion, landsliding and flooding (debris and/or mudflows) in
      hillside areas. This is sometimes in conflict with the desire to preserve the
      aesthetic or natural conditions of the existing topography. Whenever
      possible, mitigation of geologic hazards should be conducted without
      violating the property owners’ rights to modify or improve their investment,
      along with preserving the aesthetic or natural conditions of the area through
      minimal grading. When these goals are in conflict, however, protection of
      life and property will take precedence.
      GOAL #2:
      The risk to life or limb, and property damage resulting from geologic
      hazards is minimized in our City.
      Policies:
      1) The City shall take actions to minimize grading and otherwise changing
           the natural topography, while protecting public safety and reducing the
           potential for property damage as a result of geologic hazards.
      2) The City shall continue to participate in regional programs designed to
           protect the groundwater resources and to protect the area from the hazard
           of regional ground subsidence. Careful management of the regional
           ground water basin that underlies the area can avoid this hazard.
      Actions:
      1) In the areas of Fontana susceptible to slope instability, require
           geotechnical investigations that include engineering analyses of slope
           stability, surface and subsurface drainage specifications, and detailed
           recommendations for fill placement and excavation.
      2) Discourage any grading beyond that which is necessary to create
           adequate and safe building pads. Conduct regular inspection of grading
           operations, by the City Geologist and the Geotechnical Engineer, to
           maximize site safety and compatibility with community character.
      3) In the hillside or mountainous areas of Fontana, discourage excessive
           grading of slopes with gradients steeper than 3:1 (horizontal:vertical),
           and encourage varied slope ratios on design slopes to reduce the visual
           impact of grading.
      4) Prohibit cut or fill slopes steeper than 2:1.
      5) Do not permit the reconstruction of structures meant for human
           habitation that were damaged or destroyed by failed slopes unless the
           applicant can prove that the remedial measures proposed will improve
           the unstable slope conditions and make the site suitable for
           redevelopment.

6) In the valley portions of the city, require geotechnical studies to evaluate
     the potential for soil collapse and seismically induced settlement.
7) For all potential building sites, require geotechnical studies to evaluate
     the potential for damage from expansive soils.
8) Continue to encourage water conservation through public education.
9) Develop and implement a ground water monitoring program to ensure
     that ground subsidence as a result of groundwater withdrawal remains a
     non-issue.
ISSUE #3: FLOOD HAZARDS
How can the City minimize the damage caused by flooding?
Discussion: The city of Fontana sits primarily on alluvial sediments shed
from the San Gabriel and Jurupa Mountains, and carried downslope onto the
valley floor by a series of ephemeral streams, including Duncan, San
Sevaine, Morse, and Henderson Creeks, and several smaller unnamed
streams. Any rainwater that does not infiltrate the valley sediments makes its
way as runoff into the East Etiwanda Creek Channel or the Etiwanda – San
Sevaine Channel. Except for the Santa Ana River, most of the streams in the
valley have significant flow only during the wet winter months, when they
may carry large amounts of runoff for short periods of time. Average yearly
precipitation in the Fontana area is 26.6 inches. However, rainfall is
extremely variable from year to year.
The city of Fontana is not vulnerable to flooding associated with the Santa
Ana River and its larger tributaries. However, the smaller channels and
alluvial fans within or immediately adjacent to the city do pose a flooding
potential. The most current flood maps prepared by FEMA show that several
sections in the study area are subject to 100- and 500-year flooding (see
Figure 11-5, Firm Flood Zones). Several existing critical facilities are
situated within these flood boundaries, as well as numerous hazardous
materials sites.

City of Fontana General Plan                      11-35
      The City has undertaken a significant capital improvement program that
      includes the construction and retrofitting of storm drains and other flood
      control structures throughout the area. These structures are anticipated to
      reduce the flood boundaries as presently shown on the FIRM maps. Once
      documentation has been submitted to and has been reviewed by FEMA, new
      FIRM maps for this area will most likely be issued. Nevertheless, although
      this area has not seen a 100-year flood in many years, the smaller 10-year
      and 25-year storms that have occurred did strain the area’s flood control
      system. To compound this, the area has experienced tremendous growth in
      the last few years, and many more developments are currently in the
      construction or design phases. These projects will increase the amount of
      impervious surface area and place more people and structures within the
      floodplain, with a resultant increase in the flood risk.
      There is no major dam located upstream from the Fontana area, therefore, the
      city is currently not susceptible to dam inundation. However, other smaller
      flood control improvements, such as canals, culverts, levees, and retention
      basins may crack and suffer some structural damage during an earthquake,
      especially in areas prone to ground failure.
      GOAL #3:
      Injury, loss of life, property damage, and economic and social disruption
      caused by flood and inundation hazards are minimized in our City.
      Policies:
      1) The City shall discourage new development in flood hazard areas and
           implement mitigation measures to reduce the hazard to existing
           developments that are located within the 100- and 500-year flood zones.
      Actions:
      1) Continue to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program and
           encourage property owners in and near the 100-year flood zone to
           purchase flood insurance.
      2) Discourage development in the northern and central portions of the city
           where flood hazards pose a threat, unless the applicant can prove to the
           satisfaction of the reviewing agency(ies) that the proposed development
           will not be impacted by flooding, or that remedial measures to reduce the
           hazard of flooding will be implemented in the design.
      3) Continue to encourage the development of parks and recreational
           facilities along streams draining the San Gabriel and Jurupa Mountains.
           These improvements will be consistent with the natural environment of
           the area and help preserve open space.
      4) Assess the potential environmental impacts that new construction in
           upstream areas will have on existing development down-gradient.
           Require hydrological studies for all new construction to determine the
11-36                                                             SAFETY ELEMENT

                                                                                 11. SAFETY ELEMENT
     impact that new development will have on the County storm drain
     system and privately owned debris basins downstream from new
     development. Require storm drain improvements if the analyses indicate
     a potential hazard. Fees to pay for the improvements may be assessed to
     the developers, as appropriate.
5) Continue to maintain the culverts and storm drain system to prevent the
     accumulation of debris or other obstructions that would hamper the
     effectiveness of the system during rainy days.
ISSUE #4: FIRE HAZARDS
How can the City minimize the threat from urban and wild fire and provide
adequate fire suppression for a fast growing city?
Discussion: Many major vegetation fires have occurred historically in the
Fontana area; some of these destroyed homes and other structures. These
fires have occurred mostly in the northwesterly area of the city, but a few
fires have also occurred in the Jurupa Mountains. In fact, the fire history
indicates that a major fire occurs approximately once every ten years in the
area. In all fires where structures were lost, the structures were unprotected
buildings without fire sprinklers and without vegetation management zones
around them.
The northwestern corner of the city has high hazard chaparral vegetation and
steep slopes. This area is also subject to high, hot Santa Ana (or Santana)
winds that blow from the north-northeast down the Cajon Pass. Fire models
indicate that a fire in this area can have a major impact on the fire-fighting
forces in Fontana and neighboring communities. The Jurupa Mountains have
high grasses and locally steep slopes. A major fire in this area also has the
potential to tax the fire forces of Fontana and adjacent communities, and to
result in major traffic congestion as residents attempt to evacuate while
onlookers try to enter the area. In addition to the two areas identified above,
flat, grassy vacant properties in the city are also susceptible to vegetation
fires.
Most structural fires occur in residences, and most fatalities in fires occur in
residences. Residential developments located next to high fire hazard areas
are at high risk of being impacted by fire, especially if the structures are not
properly protected and there is inadequate vegetation management. Since
1986 all new homes in Fontana have been equipped with fire sprinkler
systems and smoke detectors, and homes constructed since 1980 have proven
to withstand fires better than older homes. In the older, low-income
residential neighborhoods, however, structural fire is a concern because the
houses are not protected with sprinklers, the buildings are often in a state of
disrepair, and it is not uncommon for multiple families, or several unrelated
persons to share a home together. An analysis of historical fires in the
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                    11-37
      Fontana area indicates that the city’s risk to structural fire can be classified as
      low probability / high consequence.
      Similar comments can be made about the older commercial facilities in the
      city. These are also lack fire sprinklers, and where several buildings adjoin
      each other, there is the potential for a multi-occupancy fire that could destroy
      several buildings due to lack of fire separations. Older portions of the Kaiser
      Permanente Hospital and associated buildings are not fitted with sprinklers.
      Given the large patient population, many of them non-ambulatory, a fire in
      the hospital can be considered the worst-case scenario for a structural fire in
      the city, with the potential for major loss of life. Structural fires in several of
      the large industrial facilities in the city are a concern, especially in facilities
      that use or store hazardous materials.
      Public water supply for fire flow in the city is reportedly adequate. The
      water is supplied from 20 interconnected reservoirs that feed six supply
      zones using 16-inch diameter water mains. In the event of an earthquake on
      a nearby fault, however, water lost from damaged tanks could significantly
      reduce the water resources available to suppress earthquake-induced fires.
      Damaged tanks and water mains could also limit the amount of water
      available to residents. Furthermore, groundwater wells can be damaged
      during an earthquake, also limiting the water available to the community
      after an earthquake. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that the water
      storage tanks in the area retain their structural integrity during an earthquake,
      so water demands after an earthquake can be met. In addition to evaluating
      and retrofitting water reservoirs to meet current standards, this also requires
      that the tanks be kept at or near full capacity at all times.
      GOAL #4:
      Threats to public and private property from urban and wildland fire
      hazards are reduced in our City.
      Policies:
      1) The City shall require residential, commercial, and industrial structures
           to implement fire hazard-reducing designs and features.
      2) The City shall ensure to the extent possible that fire services, such as fire
           equipment, infrastructure, and response times are adequate for all
           sections of the city.
      3) The City shall require all new development in areas with a high fire
           hazard to provide fire retardant landscaping and project design to reduce
           their fire hazard, and the City shall take measures to reduce the risk of
           fire at the Wildland Urban Interface.
      Actions:
      1) Continue to enforce the Uniform Fire Code and Municipal Fire Code
           Amendments for new construction in fire hazard areas, including the use
11-38                                                                SAFETY ELEMENT

                                                                                  11. SAFETY ELEMENT
     of fire sprinklers in all new construction more than 200 square feet in
     area, and encourage existing building owners to install fire sprinklers.
2) Continue to require that all new roofing materials be fire resistive and
     preferably Class A rated. This applies to both new construction and
     replacement roofs. Encourage residents with existing wood-shingle or
     unrated roofing materials to upgrade to fire resistive construction,
     including fire resistive eves and awnings.
3) Require input by the San Bernardino County Fire Department regarding
     needed fire protection, access, fire department apparatus, and staffing
     before approval of any proposed high-rise building over 75 feet in height.
4) Require intensified construction features on all new structures in the
     Urban Wildland Interface areas of the city in and at the base of the San
     Bernardino Mountains and in the Jurupa Mountains. Such features
     should include 1-hour rated exteriors, non-flammable wood or plastic
     materials on exteriors, double pane or tempered glazing, solid core doors,
     non-wood garage doors, no non-fire rated plastic or vinyl window
     frames, proper screening and orientation of vents, non-combustible/ non-
     plastic decking and patio covers, no plastic and no combustible rain
     gutters.
5) Encourage the incorporation of ponds in new developments, including
     golf courses, in the wildland interface area, for use by helicopters.
6) Require the continued involvement of the City and County Fire
     Departments in the planning of all new development, beginning at the
     Environmental Impact Report phase, to reduce to acceptable levels the
     fire hazards to developments near the Urban Wildland Interface. Require
     as a condition of project approval the incorporation of fire safety
     mitigation measures recommended by the Fire Departments.
7) Establish, with assistance from the San Bernardino County Fire
     Department, a fee schedule, based on risk, for new development and for
     areas annexed to the City, which will assist in providing adequate
     funding for additional staffing, stations, and equipment.
8) Continue to ensure that there is adequate spacing between new
     structures.
9) Aid the San Bernardino County Fire Department in improving response
     times to the northern and southern portions of the city.
10) Study the feasibility of constructing and staffing an additional fire station
     with a four-person engine company in the northwestern portion of
     Fontana, north of the I-15, in the area of Duncan Canyon Road, as that
     area annexes into the City.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                     11-39
      11) Conduct a focused Fire Station location study prior to construction of
          any new fire stations.
      12) Evaluate the feasibility of placing an additional Ladder-Truck Company
          in service. There should be one Ladder Company below (south of) the I-
          10 freeway, and one above (north of) the I-10. Both companies should be
          dedicated Ladder Truck Companies, rather than performing double duty.
      13) Install traffic signal pre-emption devices at critical intersections and in
          all fire apparatus.
      14) Enter into an automatic aid agreement with the Rancho Cucamonga Fire
          District, for response from Rancho Cucamonga’s planned fire station in
          the northeastern part of Rancho Cucamonga (near the Hunters Ridge
          area).
      15) Conduct, in association with the local water providers, annual fire flow
          tests, especially in areas of high fire hazard. Address deficiencies in the
          system as soon as possible.
      16) Study the availability of secondary water supplies for fire flow needs in
          an emergency.
      17) Encourage San Bernardino County to acquire a water-dropping
          helicopter and have at least one hand crew on duty during the fire season.
      18) Identify High Fire Hazard Severity Zones in vegetation areas.
      19) Develop and enforce a vegetation ordinance to reduce the risk in high
          fire hazard areas. The ordinance shall include Vegetation Management
          Zones around structures. The recommended Vegetation Management
          Zones around structures are as follows: in the northern area of the city,
          300 feet wide; in the Jurupa Mountains, 200 feet wide. Zones elsewhere
          should be a minimum of 30 to 100 feet wide depending upon the risk.
          Proposed plantings and vegetation in such zones shall be approved by the
          Fire Department.
      20) Require management plans for all new development in areas subject to
          wildfire.
      21) Require Landscape Maintenance Districts or Vegetation Management
          Zones around new developments. All ornamental shrubbery and
          vegetation around all structures and on roadways within 5 miles of any of
          the identified vegetation areas must be strictly controlled. Roadsides in
          all vegetative areas should have a 10-foot wide clearance from
          flammable vegetation on each side.
      22) Encourage residents to plant and maintain drought-resistant, fire-
          retardant landscape species on slopes to reduce the risk of brush fire and
          soil erosion in areas adjacent to canyons; and develop stringent site
11-40                                                               SAFETY ELEMENT

     design and maintenance standards for areas with high fire hazard or soil
     erosion potential.
23) Consider the installation of fuel breaks around the city perimeter in high
     fire hazard areas (for example, along the front of the Jurupa Mountains).
24) Require utility companies to conduct annual vegetation management in
     power-line right-of-ways.
25) Continue the door-to-door engine company fire prevention program in all
     Urban Wildland interface areas by the San Bernardino County Fire
     Department.
26) Consider making the detonation of fireworks illegal in the city, in order
     to help prevent structural and/or vegetation fires caused by fireworks.
ISSUE #5: HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
How can the City provide a healthy environment for its residents and
visitors, and minimize the potential for contamination from hazardous
materials?
Discussion: The unhealthful effects of certain chemicals and substances have
led to extensive regulation of hazardous materials. Nevertheless, there is still
the potential for hazardous materials to be released into the environment,
whether as a result of an accident, carelessness, or intentionally. Two major
freeways (I-10 and I-15) extend across portions of the city of Fontana, and
several railroad spurs extend across the study area. Both freeways and many
of the railroad spurs are used to transport hazardous materials, posing a
potential for spills or leaks from non-stationary sources to occur within city
limits.
In addition to these non-stationary sources, the EPA has identified fifteen
Superfund sites in the Fontana area; thirteen of these are “archive” or No
Further Remedial Action Plan (NFRAP) sites, while two are still on the
active list (see Figure 11-6, Distribution of Hazardous Materials Sites By
Census Tract). The archive sites have been cleaned to levels below the
National Priority List levels, and the EPA has determined that no immediate
or long-term risks to human health or to the environment are associated with
these sites. The two active sites are not on the National Priority List (NPL);
one is still being investigated to assess the extent of contamination, while no
further site assessment work is reportedly necessary at the second site.
The EPA data available also indicate that there are eighteen large quantity
generators, about 130 small quantity generators, and three transporters of
hazardous materials in the Fontana area. Twenty-seven facilities in the study
area were listed in the Toxic Release Inventory for the year 2000 because
they have had at least one release of toxic chemicals into the air or water, or
onto the soil. Many of these TRI sites are located in the Sphere of Influence
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                    11-41

      rather than in the city of Fontana, while several others are located in the
      southwestern, industrial portion of the city. According to data from the State
      Water Resources Control Board, fifty-four leaking underground storage tank
      facilities have been reported in the Fontana area. It appears that all cases
      involved only soil contamination, with no impact to the ground water,
      presumably because ground water in most of the Fontana area occurs at
      depths of more than 100 feet.
      The Riverside-San Bernardino area experienced good air quality only
      approximately 40 percent of the time in the year 2000. In fact, the data
      indicate that this is the metropolitan area in the United States with the highest
      number of days with ozone levels above the Federal standards. However, the
      data also show that there has been substantial improvement in this area in the
      last 10 years. EPA records indicate that there are approximately 130 facilities
      in the Fontana Area that have a permit to release emissions into the air.
      These facilities include restaurants, dry cleaners, and other small businesses.
      The South Coast Air Quality Management District has enforcement oversight
      and closely monitors the emissions from these facilities to ensure that their
      annual limits are not exceeded.

      Five different water companies or agencies provide drinking water to the
      Fontana area: Crawford Canyon Water, Cucamonga County Water District,
      Fontana Union Water Company, Marygold Mutual Water Company, and
      West San Bernardino County Water District. Only three of these agencies
      were listed on the EPA Safe Drinking Water Violation Report. None of the
      three agencies for which there were records have had a health violation since
      1993, the earliest date for which records are available. The Cucamonga
      County Water District was cited twice in 1992 for not taking sufficient water
      samples in the required time period, but they have been in conformance with
      the EPA sampling requirements since 1993.
      The City of Fontana adopted in 1991 a Household Hazardous Waste (HHW)
      Element in accordance with the California Integrated Solid Waste
      Management Act of 1989.
      GOAL #5:
      The potential for hazardous contamination is reduced in our City.
      Policies:
      1) The City shall strive to reduce the potential for residents, workers, and
          visitors to Fontana to being exposed to hazardous materials and wastes.
      Actions:
      1) Require that new proposed facilities involved in the production, use,
          storage, transport or disposal of hazardous materials be located a safe
          distance from land uses that may be adversely impacted by such
          activities. Conversely, do not allow new sensitive facilities, such as
          schools, child-care centers, and senior centers, to be located near existing
          sites that use, store or generate hazardous materials.
      2) Assure the continued response and capability of the San Bernardino
          County Fire Department to handle hazardous materials incidents in the
          city and along the sections of freeways that extend across the city.
      3) Continue to encourage residents and businesses to reduce or eliminate
          the use of hazardous materials. This includes encouraging residents to
          buy toxic substances in only the amount needed to do the job, or better
          yet, to use safer non-toxic alternate products that do not pose a threat to
          the environment.
      4) Continue to require all businesses that handle hazardous materials above
          the reportable quantity (refer to Chapter 4 of the Technical Report) to
          submit an inventory of the hazardous materials that they manage to the
          San Bernardino County Fire Department – Hazardous Materials
          Division.
      5) Identify City roadways along which hazardous materials are routinely
          transported. If essential facilities, such as schools, hospitals, child care

     centers or other facilities with special evacuation needs are located along
     these routes, identify emergency response plans that these facilities can
     implement in the event of an unauthorized release of hazardous materials
     in their area.
6) Continue to support the operation of recycling centers that take
     hazardous substances, such as paint, paint thinner, and used waste oil.
ISSUE #6: DISASTER RESPONSE PLANNING
What can the City do to be better prepared in the event of a disaster?
Discussion: Planning issues pertaining to emergency response, disaster
preparedness, and disaster recovery require an assessment of the hazards,
identification of functions and resources to handle short-term response, and
development of recovery procedures. Earthquakes pose the greatest
challenge because they occur with little or no warning, and can set into
motion a number of linked events.
The data reviewed indicate that the city of Fontana is susceptible to strong
ground motions given its proximity to three active seismic sources. When a
disaster occurs, the first few moments are absolutely critical in terms of
reducing loss of life and property. First responders must be sufficiently
trained to understand the nature and the gravity of the event to minimize the
confusion that inevitably follows catastrophic situations. The first responder
must then put into motion relevant mitigation plans to reduce further human
and property damage and communicate with the public. According to the
State’s Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS), local
agencies have primary authority regarding rescue and treatment of casualties,
and making decisions regarding protective actions for the community. This
on-scene authority rests with the local emergency services organization and
the incident commander. As such, the City of Fontana’s Local Hazard
Mitigation Plan (HMP) describes the type, location, and extent of all natural
hazards that can affect the City. The HMP describes the City’s vulnerability
to these hazards; includes a mitigation strategy that provides the City’s
blueprint for reducing potential losses; and contains a plan implementation
process.
In addition, the Federal Government’s National Incident Management
System (NIMS) provides a systematic, proactive approach to guide
departments and agencies at all levels of government, nongovernmental
organizations, and the private sector to work seamlessly to prevent, protect
against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the effects of incidents,
regardless of cause, size, location, or complexity, in order to reduce the loss
of life and property and harm to the environment.
NIMS works in conjunction with the National Response Framework (NRF).
NIMS provides the template for the management of incidents, while the NRF
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                    11-47

      provides the structure and mechanisms for national-level policy for incident
      management.
      Thus, depending on the type of disaster, several different agencies and
      disciplines may be called in to assist with emergency response. Agencies
      and disciplines that can be expected to be part of an emergency response
      team include medical, health, fire and rescue, police, public works, and
      coroner. The challenge is to accomplish the work at hand in the most
      effective manner, maintaining open lines of communication between the
      different responding agencies to share and disseminate information, and to
      coordinate efforts.
      Emergency response is to be handled in accordance with SEMS, with
      individual city agencies and personnel taking on their responsibilities as
      defined by the City’s Emergency Plan. This document describes the
      different levels of emergencies, the local emergency management
      organization, and the specific responsibilities of each participating agency,
      government office, and individuals.
      GOAL #6:
      Plans for emergency response and recovery from natural and urban
      disasters are prepared for our City.
      Policies:
      1) The City shall prepare for emergency response and recovery from natural
          and urban disasters, especially earthquake hazards.
      2) Use the City of Fontana’s Emergency Disaster Plan as the guide for
          disaster planning in the Fontana Planning Area.
      3) Aim for City-level self-sufficiency in emergency response.
      4) Use the City of Fontana’s Hazard Mitigation Plan as the guide for
          identifying hazard risks and vulnerabilities, identifying and prioritizing
          mitigation actions, encourage the development of local mitigation and
          provide technical support for these efforts.
      Actions:
      1) Continue to update and revise the Emergency Disaster Plan as needed, to
          reflect changes in the Planning Area and changes in emergency
          management techniques.
      2) Continue to maintain and update the City’s emergency response
          organization consisting of representatives from all City departments and
          divisions, County agencies, private businesses, citizens, and other

INTRODUCTION
Purpose of the Element
The General Plan Noise Element provides a systematic approach to
identifying and appraising noise problems in the community, quantifying
existing and projected noise levels, addressing excessive noise exposure, and
community planning for the regulation of noise. This element includes
policies, standards, criteria, programs, diagrams, a reference to action items,
and maps related to protecting public health and welfare from noise.
State Law Requirements
The Noise Element is a mandatory component of the General Plan pursuant
to the California Planning and Zoning Law, Section 65302(f). The element
must recognize the guidelines adopted by the Office of Planning and
Research pursuant to Section 46050.1 of the Health and Safety Code. It also
can be utilized as a tool for compliance with the state’s noise insulation
standards.
ACHIEVING THE VISION
The Citizens of Fontana are concerned about the effects of noise on their
health and serenity and that of future residents. As a part of the Community
Visioning Process that shaped this general plan update, citizens and city
officials identified goals for the future relating to balancing land uses in our
community in order to minimize incompatibilities and provide the range of
uses needed to support a high quality of life in the community. These goals
are related to the policy direction in the Noise Element of this General Plan.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                  12-1

     COMPONENTS OF THE NOISE
     ELEMENT
     Definitions
     Following is a list of commonly used terms and abbreviations that may be
     found within this element or when discussing the topic of noise. This is an
     abbreviated glossary to be reviewed prior to reading the element. It is
     important to become familiar with the definitions listed in order to better
     understand the importance of the Noise Element within the City of Fontana
     General Plan. Since the disbanding of the State Office of Noise Control in
     the mid-1990, the State of California Office of Planning and Research
     General Plan Guidelines can offer further information on other noise-related
     resources.
        Ambient Noise – The composite of noise from all sources near and far.
         In this context, the ambient noise level constitutes the normal or existing
         level of environmental noise at a given location.
        CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent Level) – The average equivalent
         A-weighted sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of
         five decibels to sound levels in the evening from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.
         and after the addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in the night from
         10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
        dB (Decibel) – The unit of measure that denotes the ratio between two
         quantities that are proportional to power; the number of decibels
         corresponding to the ratio of the two amounts of power is based on a
         logarithmic scale.
        dBA (A-weighted decibel) – The A-weighted decibel scale
         discriminates against upper and lower frequencies in a manner
         approximating the sensitivity of the human ear. The scale is based on a
         reference pressure level of 20 micropascals (zero dBA). The scale
         ranges from zero for the average least perceptible sound to about 130 for
         the average pain level.
        Intrusive Noise – That noise which intrudes over and above the existing
         ambient noise at a given location. The relative intrusiveness of a sound
         depends upon its amplitude, duration, frequency and time of occurrence,
         and tonal or informational content as well as the prevailing noise level.
        L50 – The A-weighted sound level that is exceeded 50% of the sample
         time. Alternatively, the A-weighted sound level that is exceeded 30
         minutes in a 60 minute period. Similarly, L10, L25, etc. These values
         are typically used to demonstrate compliance with noise restrictions
         included in the City noise ordinance.
        Leq (Equivalent energy level) – The average acoustic energy content of
         noise during the time it lasts. The Leq of a time-varying noise and that
12-2                                                               NOISE ELEMENT

                                                                                  12. NOISE ELEMENT
     of a steady noise are the same if they deliver the same acoustic energy to
     the ear during exposure, no matter what time of day they occur.
    Ldn (Day-Night Average Level) – The average equivalent A-weighted
     sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of 10 decibels
     to sound levels in the night from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. Note: CNEL
     and Ldn represent daily levels of noise exposure averaged on an annual
     or daily basis, while Leq represents the equivalent energy noise exposure
     for a shorter time period, typically one hour.
    Lmax (Maximum energy level) – The greatest root-mean-square noise
     value obtained over the measurement period.
    Micropascal – The international unit for pressure, similar to pounds per
     square inch. A value of 20 micropascals is used as the standard for the
     human hearing threshold (zero dBA).
    Noise Contours – Lines drawn around a noise source indicating equal
     levels of noise exposure. CNEL and Ldn are the metrics used in this
     document to describe annoyance due to noise and to establish land use
     planning criteria for noise.
Regulating Noise
The intent of the Noise Element is to set goals to limit/reduce the effects of
noise intrusion and to set acceptable noise levels for varying types of land
uses. To this end the City has the authority to set land use noise standards
and place restrictions of private activities that generate excessive or intrusive
noise. However, it should be recognized that the City does not have the
authority to regulate all sources of noise within the City and various other
agencies may supercede City authority. Furthermore, various types of
project funding (e.g., State Highway projects, HUD redevelopment, etc.)
could be subject to standards that differ from the City’s.
Federal Guidelines and Standards
     Federal Highway Administration
Two State Routes, Highland Avenue (SR-210) and Foothill Boulevard (SR-
66), bisect the City of Fontana. Additionally Interstate Routes 10, 15, and
210 run through the City. These routes are subject to federal funding and as
such are under the purview of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).
The FHWA has developed noise standards that are typically used for
federally funded roadway projects or projects that require either federal or
Caltrans review. These noise standards are based on Leq and L10 values.
(Note that L10 is typically about 3 dBA greater than the Leq value.)
The FHWA values are the maximum desirable values by land use type and
area based on a “trade-off” of what is desirable and what is reasonably
feasible. These values recognize that in many cases lower noise exposures
would result in greater community benefits. The FHWA design noise levels
are included in Table 12-1.

      1 Either Leq or L10 (but not both) design noise levels may be used on a project.
           U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
     In addition to FHWA standards, the United States Environmental Protection
     Agency (EPA) has identified the relationship between noise levels and
     human response. The EPA has determined that over a 24-hour period, an
     Leq of 70 dBA will result in some hearing loss. Interference with activity
     and annoyance will not occur if exterior levels are maintained at an Leq of 55
     dBA and interior levels at or below 45 dBA. While these levels are relevant
     for planning and design and useful for informational purposes, they are not
     land use planning criteria because they do not consider economic cost,
     technical feasibility, or the needs of the community.
     In addition to the Leq limitations discussed above, in accordance with Page
     2-3 24 CFR, Part 51, Subpart B “Noise Abatement and Control,” (US
     Department of Housing and Urban Development, August 1984), the EPA set
     55 dBA Ldn as the basic goal for exterior residential noise intrusion.
     However, other federal agencies, in consideration of their own program
     requirements and goals, as well as difficulty of actually achieving a goal of
     55 dBA Ldn, have settled on the 65 dBA Ldn level as their standard. At 65
     dBA Ldn, activity interference is kept to a minimum, and annoyance levels
     are still low. It is also a level that can realistically be achieved.
           U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
     The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) first issued
     formal requirements related specifically to noise in 1971 (HUD Circular
     1390.2). These requirements contained standards for exterior noise levels
     along with policies for approving HUD-supported or assisted housing
     projects in high noise areas. In general, these requirements established three
     zones. These include:
12-4                                                                                        NOISE ELEMENT

                                                                                        12. NOISE ELEMENT
             65 dBA Ldn or less - an acceptable zone where all projects could be
            approved,
            exceeding 65 dBA Ldn but not exceeding 75 dBA Ldn - a normally
            unacceptable zone where mitigation measures would be required and
            each project would have to be individually evaluated for approval or
            denial. These measures must provide 5 dBA of attenuation above
            the attenuation provided by standard construction required in a 65 to
            70 dBA Ldn area and 10 dBA of attenuation in a 70 to 75 dBA Ldn
            area, and
             exceeding 75 dBA Ldn - an unacceptable zone in which projects
            would not, as a rule, be approved.
HUD’s regulations do not include interior noise standards. Rather a goal of
45 dBA Ldn is set forth and attenuation requirements are geared towards
achieving that goal. HUD assumes that using standard construction, any
building will provide sufficient attenuation so that if the exterior level is 65
dBA Ldn or less, the interior level will be 45 dBA Ldn or less. Note that
HUD regulations were promulgated solely for residential development
requiring government funding and are not related to the operation of other
sensitive land uses such as schools or churches.
      Federal Railroad Administration
The EPA is charged with the regulation of railroad noise under the Noise
Control Act.
No federal regulations specify absolute levels of acceptable noise that apply
directly to railroad noise and compatible land uses along rail lines. Table 12-
2 summarizes the EPA railroad noise standards that set operating noise
standards for railroad equipment and set noise limit standards for new
equipment. (Note that these values are in terms of the Lmax, and can be
considerably greater than the Leq typically used in the measurement of
obtrusive noise.)

      State Guidelines and Standards
            California Department of Health Services
      The California Department of Health Services' (DHS) Office of Noise
      Control studied the correlation of noise levels and their effects on various
      land uses. As a result, the DHS established four categories for judging the
      severity of noise intrusion on specified land uses.
      Figure 12-1 presents a land use compatibility chart for community noise
      prepared by the California Office of Noise Control and adopted by the City
      of Fontana to demonstrate land-use compatibility. While the chart is
      presented in terms of the Ldn or CNEL, the City prefers the use of the CNEL
      descriptor, as it is slightly more conservative (i.e., restrictive), in protecting
      sensitive land uses. It identifies “normally acceptable,” “conditionally
      acceptable,” “normally unacceptable,” and “clearly unacceptable” exterior
      noise levels for various land uses. A “conditionally acceptable” designation
      implies new construction or development should be undertaken only after a
      detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements for each land use is
      made and needed noise insulation features are incorporated in the design. By
      comparison, a “normally acceptable” designation indicates that standard
      construction can occur with no special noise reduction requirements. Note
      that there is some overlap between the various categories.

Figure 12-1 Land Use Compatibility
While this land use compatibility chart is based on a 24-hour value, the City
is aware that some land uses are not occupied on a 24-hour basis, and a
descriptor (such as Ldn or CNEL) may be overly restrictive in siting these
types of sensitive land uses. Such uses may include, but are not limited to,
schools, libraries, and churches. In these cases, a more appropriate standard
would consider the time of occupancy of the land use. Here, the City
recommends the use of a 65 dBA, 12-hour Leq (Leq(12))that includes those

     hours of actual use. (If a facility is to be used in excess of 12 hours per day,
     the CNEL standard should be used.)
     Table 12-3 includes the State interior and exterior noise standards for varying
     land uses. Note that the exterior noise levels are to be attained in “habitable”
     exterior areas and need not encompass the entirety of a property.

     Vibration
     Another community annoyance related to noise is vibration. As with noise,
     vibration can be described by both its amplitude and frequency. Amplitude
     may be characterized by displacement, velocity, and/or acceleration.
     Typically, particle velocity (measured in inches or millimeters per second)
     and/or acceleration (measured in gravities) are used to describe vibration.
12-8                                                                                             NOISE ELEMENT

Vibration can be felt outdoors, but the perceived intensity of vibration
impacts are much greater indoors, due to the shaking of the structure. Some
of the most common sources of vibration come from trains and/or transit
vehicles, construction equipment, airplanes, and large vehicles. Several land
uses are especially sensitive to vibration, and therefore have a lower
vibration threshold. These uses include, but are not limited to, concert halls,
hospitals, libraries, vibration-sensitive research operations, residential areas,
schools, and offices.
Table 12-4, Human Reaction to Typical Vibration Levels, presents the
human reaction to various levels of peak particle velocity. Typical
construction vibrations fall in the 10 to 30 Hz range and usually occur around
15 Hz. Traffic vibrations exhibit a similar range of frequencies. However,
due to their suspension systems, city buses often generate frequencies around
30 Hz at high vehicle speeds. It is more uncommon, but possible, to measure
traffic frequencies above 30 Hz.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
As modern transportation systems continue to develop and human
dependence upon machines continues to increase, the general level of noise
in our day-to-day living environment rises. In the City of Fontana,
residential areas near airports, freeways, and railroads are being adversely
affected by annoying noise levels. Other activities such as construction,
operation of household power tools and appliances, and industry, also
contribute to increasing background noise.
The City of Fontana is a developing community that relies heavily upon the
modern technological conveniences of American society to thrive and
succeed as a pleasant and desirable place to live and work. Without such
necessities as air-conditioning, heating, and cars, living in an urban
environment becomes difficult, if not impossible. Fortunately, these
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                     12-9
      amenities are available to the residents of Fontana and are used everyday,
      often all day long. Unfortunately, these technological advances can come at
      a high price to residents’ and visitors’ ears.
      Noise, which may be perceived by some as being annoying, may not be
      noticed at all by others. It is also important to note that people who move
      into an area where a noise source already exists (such as near an existing
      highway) are often more tolerant of that noise source than when a new noise
      generator locates itself in an established area that may be noise-sensitive
      (such as a factory that is constructed near an established residential
      community).
      Noise within the City of Fontana is generated by numerous sources, the
      foremost of which is vehicle travel on public roadways. Aircraft operations
      associated with the operation of Ontario International Airport and the Rialto
      Airport also add to the ambient noise as do railroad operations conducted
      along both the Metrolink and Union Pacific Railroad lines. The City also
      includes stationary noise sources including factories, the California
      Speedway, and various school sites.
      The City is also subject to temporary noise during its growth. As the various
      properties within the City are developed, or redeveloped, construction will
      temporarily raise the ambient noise levels above the prevailing background
      noise. These sources have the potential to affect noise-sensitive receptors
      such as residences, schools, and hospitals. Figure 12-2, Common Noise
      Sources and Noise Levels, illustrates some noise producers that can be found
      within the City of Fontana, as well as their corresponding noise
      measurements. The following sections contain a discussion of the various
      noise sources within the City.

Mobile-Source Noise
Traffic Noise
The most prevalent source of noise within the City of Fontana is from the
operation of on-road motor vehicles that operate on City streets and the local
freeways. Traffic noise varies in how it affects land uses depending upon the
type of roadway, and the distance of the land use from that roadway. Some
variables that affect the amount of noise emitted from a road are speed of
traffic, flow of traffic, and type of traffic (e.g. heavy trucks versus
automobiles). Another variable affecting the overall measure of noise is a
perceived increase in sensitivity to vehicular noise at night. Appendix G
contains tables and figures that illustrate existing and forecasted noise from
major roadways throughout the City. The data are presented in terms of the
CNEL. The existing noise contours are based on computer modeling and
were derived from 2003 traffic levels. Future conditions represent build-out
under the General Plan. Future noise contours are also mapped on Figure 12-
3, Future Noise Contours.

The traffic noise levels were modeled using the Caltrans Sound32 version of
the Highway Noise Model (FHWA-RD-77-108). The model uses traffic
volume, vehicle mix, vehicle speed, and roadway geometry to compute Leq
noise levels. A computer code has been written that uses data generated by
the EMFAC2002 Air Emissions Model distributed by the California Air
Resources Board to determine the hourly breakdown of the daily traffic. The
total average daily traffic (ADT) for each roadway was then converted into
24 hourly values and these values were weighted for the evening and
nighttime periods and summed for provide a CNEL value. The traffic mix
was based on field observation during 14 noise measurements obtained
within the City over a period of two days. The noise monitoring locations
are mapped in Figure 12-4. Where state highways and freeways are
modeled, the published Caltrans traffic mix was retained. Methodology is
discussed further in Appendix G.
Aircraft Noise
The City of Fontana is located in the flight path of Ontario International
Airport (ONT) located to the west of the City of Fontana. The flight path
follows Santa Ana Avenue. First quarter noise contours for the year 2002 are
included in Figure 12-5. Note that the airport’s 65 dBA CNEL follows Santa
Ana Avenue and lies within the City of Fontana just east of Etiwanda
Avenue. The area within this 65 dBA CNEL is zoned for general industrial
and the land use is compatible with airport operations.
The "new" Ontario International Airport opened September 27, 1998 and
includes two new terminals totaling of 530,000 square feet. The new
terminals are eight times larger than the former terminal and can
accommodate up to 10 million passengers a year. When passenger traffic at
ONT reaches 10 million in two consecutive years, a third terminal is to be
constructed. As the airport is further utilized and developed, additional
flights will be added. This would then be expected to extend the 65 dBA
CNEL further into the City of Fontana. On the other hand, as more stringent
aircraft noise regulations are promulgated and jets become quieter due to
technological advancements, noise contours could remain similar or even be
reduced from existing contours.
In addition to ONT, Fontana is over-flown by operations associated with the
Rialto Municipal Airport. The Art Scholl Memorial/Rialto Municipal
Airport (formerly Miro Field) is located on Linden Avenue north of Baseline
Road. Portions of the runway lie immediately north of Fontana City area
proposed for residential development.

The current Airport Master Plan (adopted in 1992) estimated the number of
operations to be 190,000 in 1990. The number was projected to grow to
286,000 in the year 2010. However, the best estimate of total operations
during 1996 (the last year counted) was 128,000. Noise contours prepared
for the year 1990 show the entirety of the 65-dBA CNEL contour to lie
within the City of Rialto. The 60 dBA CNEL protrudes into the City of
Fontana just west of Encinitas Court between Baseline Avenue and Whatley
Avenue. These noise contours are mapped on Figure 12-5 as well.
Railroad Noise
Another prevalent source of noise in the City is from railroad operations.
Both the Metrolink and Union Pacific have rail lines running through the
City. Currently, daily train traffic produces noise that may disrupt activities
in proximity to railroad tracks. For example, trains are required to sound
their horns at all at-grade crossings and the sound of train horns is a common
occurrence within the City. Additionally, trains may also be required to slow
their speed through residential areas. These types of noise disturbances can
interfere with activities conducted on noise-sensitive land uses.
Railroad noise is dependant on a number of factors including the number of
operations per day, the times these operations occur, the numbers of engines
and railcars, the speed, the type of rail (i.e., continuous or bolted), and
whether there exist at grade crossings that require the engineer to sound a
warning horn. Based on routing schedules, Metrolink currently has 29 daily
operations. Union Pacific averages approximately 32 daily operations
through the City (John Bromley, Union Pacific Director of Public Affairs,
May 15, 2003). Noise contours for both the Metrolink and Union Pacific
operations were calculated in accordance with HUD procedures using the
“Wyle” Method. Although the “Wyle” Method calculates Ldn rather than
CNEL noise levels, CNEL values would be only slightly (less than 1 dBA)
greater than those presented.
The data indicate that for Metrolink, the 60, 65, and 70 dBA Ldn values fall
at distances of 172, 80, and 37 feet, respectively, from the centerline of the
rails. These distances are extended to 683, 317, and 147 feet, respectively,
near at-grade crossings where the engineer is required to sound a warning
horn. The 60, 65, and 70 dBA Ldn noise contours along the UP fall at
distances of 796, 370, and 172 feet, respectively in the absence of at-grade
crossings. These crossings would extend these contours to 2,719, 1,262, and
586 feet, respectively.
Rail transportation may become more popular in the future if a mass public
transportation system is implemented within San Bernardino County.
Additionally, augmented operations associated with the Alameda Corridor
could increase freight traffic through the City. Finally, as the City increases
the level of industrial use, new rail trips could be brought into the City to
accommodate the import of raw materials and export of finished goods and
products.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                 12-21

      Stationary Source Noise
      A stationary noise producer is any entity in a fixed location that emits noise.
      Stationary noise producers are common in many noise-sensitive areas.
      Motors, appliances, air conditioners, lawn and garden equipment, and power
      tools are often found in residential neighborhoods, as well as on or near the
      properties of schools, hospitals, and parks. Furthermore, school playground
      activities represent a source of stationary noise that is often situated adjacent
      to residential properties. Industrial and manufacturing facilities are also
      stationary noise producers that may affect sensitive land uses. Furthermore,
      while noise generated by the use of motor vehicles over public roads is
      preempted from local regulation, the City considers the use of these vehicles
      to be a stationary noise source when operated on private property such as at a
      truck terminal or warehousing facility.
      At the present time, the City has well demarked general industrial areas.
      These areas are buffered from residential uses through land use zoning that
      places either light industrial or commercial uses between the major
      manufactures involved in heavy industrial uses and local residents, and noise
      intrusion on conforming land uses in not a problem at this time.
      California Speedway
      One major attraction in the City is the California Speedway located in the
      industrial area north of San Bernardino Avenue and west of Cherry Avenue.
      The County operating permit requires that the racetrack adhere to County-
      mandated noise levels for an industrial area. The track is not allowed to
      exceed a noise level of 70 decibels during any day or night operation.
      However, the noise level cannot exceed 45 decibels in any neighboring
      residential area from the hours of 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. The racetrack is
      allowed to exceed the noise levels only during six scheduled races
      throughout the year. The County-issued permit bars any racing during the
      l0:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. period.
      Schools
      While considered as a sensitive land use, schools can be a source of nuisance
      noise on neighboring residential uses. Noise produced by children at play in
      a schoolyard can be on the order of 74 dBA Leq as measured at a distance of
      50 feet. High schools may include stadiums used for athletic events. These
      may or may not include night lighting as well as the use of public address
      systems and can generate substantial noise levels during the day and/or
      evening. Noise produced on school grounds is typically exempted from
      regulation under a city’s municipal code, but the City of Fontana has no such
      exemption. (The City’s noise ordinance does prohibit the creation of any
      excessive noise adjacent to any school while the premises are in use.) As
      further development occurs within the City, more schools would be
      constructed and existing schools could be expanded further elevating this
      potential problem.

A series of land uses have been deemed sensitive by the State of California.
These land uses require a serene environment as part of the overall facility or
residential experience. Many of these facilities depend on low levels of
sound to promote the well being of the occupants. These uses include, but
are not limited to; schools, hospitals, rest homes, long term care facilities,
mental care facilities, residential uses, places of worship, libraries, and
passive recreation areas. Activities conducted in proximity to these facilities
and/or the placement of new sensitive facilities must consider the noise
output, and ensure that they don’t create or expose sensitive uses to
unacceptable noise levels.
Noise Compatibility
The Noise Element of the General Plan is closely related to the Land Use
Element because of the effects that noise has on sensitive land uses. Noise-
producing land uses must be compatible with adjacent land uses in order for
the Land Use Plan to be successful. If existing land uses emit noise above a
certain level, and are not compatible with one another, noise attenuation
devices or measures must be used to mitigate the noise to acceptable levels
both indoors and outdoors. In cases of new development, the placement of
noise-sensitive land uses is integral to a successful community.
Relationship to other General Plan Elements
Noise is a direct result of vehicle travel on the roadways, as well as from off-
road sources, including aircraft and railroad operations. As such, the Noise
Element has a direct relationship with other elements included in the General
Plan. When integrated with the Noise Element, the Land Use Element will
show land uses in relation to future projected noise contours. In this way,
compatible and incompatible land uses may be identified. Furthermore, the
Noise Element relates to the Circulation Element since the circulation system
is the primary source of noise throughout the City. Noise exposure will be a
factor in the location and design of new arterials, and the mitigation of noise
from existing arterials in relation to existing and planned land uses.
Since residential land uses are noise sensitive, the information provided in
the Noise Element must also be considered in the planning of future housing
developments, as discussed in the Housing Element. The Noise Element also
relates to the Open Space/Conservation/Recreation Element since excessive
noise may have a detrimental effect on the enjoyment of open spaces.
Additionally, open space areas may be used as buffers to reduce noise levels
at more noise sensitive areas.
The following policies protect noise-sensitive land uses from noise emitted
by outside sources, and prevent new projects from generating adverse noise
levels on adjacent properties.

      ISSUES, GOALS, POLICIES & ACTIONS
      ISSUE #1 NOISE AND LAND USE PLANNING
      CONNECTION
      How can the City ensure that its sensitive areas and land uses are not
      subject to excessive noise?
      Discussion: As the City becomes more developed over time, more traffic
      will be generated from its internal land uses. Furthermore, many areas that
      are currently undeveloped will receive new, sensitive uses. As build-out
      continues and “prime” real estate used up, development would be expected to
      occur in less favorable areas (from a noise perspective). Additionally,
      residential infill will place sensitive uses more proximate to roadways and
      transportation corridors. Impacts associated with this development may be
      mitigated through those measures that reduce vehicle-generated noise
      (discussed below), but proper land use planning is also crucial.
      GOAL #1
      Our City protects its sensitive land uses from excessive noise through
      diligent planning.
      Policies:
      1) New sensitive land uses shall be prohibited in incompatible areas.
      2) Noise-tolerant land uses shall be guided into areas irrevocably committed
          to land uses that are noise-producing, such as transportation corridors or
          within the projected noise contours of the adjacent airports.
      3) The following uses shall be considered noise-sensitive and discouraged
          in areas in excess of 65 dBA CNEL:
               Residential Uses;
               Hospitals;
               Rest Homes;
               Long Term Care Facilities; and
               Mental Care Facilities;
      4) The following uses shall be considered noise-sensitive and discouraged
          in areas in excess of 65 Leq(12):
               Schools;
               Libraries;
               Places of worship; and
               Passive Recreation Uses
12-24                                                               NOISE ELEMENT

                                                                                12. NOISE ELEMENT
5) Where sensitive uses are to be placed along transportation routes,
     mitigation shall be provided to ensure compliance with State mandated
     noise levels.
6) The State of California Office of Planning and Research General Plan
     Guidelines shall be followed with respect to acoustical study
     requirements.
7) Noise spillover or encroachment from commercial, industrial and
     educational land uses shall be minimized into adjoining residential
     neighborhoods or noise-sensitive uses.
Actions:
1) Review all development applications for consistency with the standards
     and policies of the Noise Element of the General Plan as well as the City
     noise ordinance.
2) Discourage the development of new sensitive land uses (unless
     mitigatable) within 200 feet of any freeway or Metrolink corridor and
     within 500 feet of the Union Pacific rail corridor. (Note that this
     measure would also mitigate any potential vibration impacts as feasible.)
3) Install as feasible noise mitigation features (e.g., sound walls) where rail
     or freeway operations impact existing and new adjacent residential or
     other noise-sensitive uses.
4) Enforce the California Building Standards that sets standards for building
     construction to mitigate interior noise levels to the tolerable 45 dBA
     CNEL limit. These standards are utilized in conjunction with the
     Uniform Building Code by the City’s Building Department to ensure that
     noise protection is provided to the public. Some design features may
     include extra-dense insulation, double-paned windows, and dense
     construction materials.
5) Require developers to consider the composite noise from all sources
     (e.g., on-road vehicles, aircraft, and railroad) when siting new sensitive
     development.
6) Encourage developers to use the build-out, on-road noise contour map to
     protect noise-sensitive land uses from high levels of noise for sensitive
     development in excess of 0.5 mile from any railroad corridor or within
     0.5 mile of the 65 dBA CNEL from any airport operations.
7) Within 0.5 mile of any railroad corridor or 65 dBA CNEL from aircraft
     operations, require developers to perform and submit site-specific noise
     studies. Noise level measurements should be of at least 15 minutes in
     duration and should include simultaneous vehicle counts on adjacent
     roads so that more accurate vehicle ratios may be used in modeling
     ambient noise levels. Actual 24-hour CNEL noise measurements may be
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                 12-25

          obtained in lieu of modeling, but must ultimately consider future growth
          within the City.
      8) Ensure that sensitive use developers are using the most current airport
          land use compatibility noise contour maps in the environmental review
          process.
      9) Encourage sensitive-use developers to utilize natural barriers such as
          hills and berms to assist in noise reduction, to reduce noise in habitable
          exterior areas through building design that provides acoustical shielding,
          and to consider the potential impacts from schoolyard activities and
          provide adequate mitigation.
      10) Where development is to occur in areas in excess of 65 dBA CNEL,
          ensure that developers attain a 65 dBA CNEL in habitable exterior areas
          through the use of 1) noise buffers such as extended setbacks (preferred)
          or 2) berms and/or block walls.
      ISSUE #2 NOISE AND TRANSPORTATION
      CONNECTION
      How can the City reduce the effects of transportation-related noise on its
      residents/occupants?
      Discussion: Within the City of Fontana are a number of transportation-
      related noise sources including freeways, major arterials, collector roadways,
      aircraft overflights, and railroad operations. These sources are the major
      contributors of noise in Fontana. Cost effective strategies to reduce their
      influence on the community noise environment are an essential part of the
      Noise Element.
      Local government has little direct control of transportation noise at the
      source. These levels are set by State and Federal agencies. However, the
      City does have some control over transportation noise that exceeds State
      and/or federal standards (such as from a defective muffler or an excessively
      loud car stereo).
      The most effective method the City has to mitigate transportation noise is
      through reducing the impact of the noise onto the community through noise
      barriers and site design review. The effect of a noise barrier is critically
      dependent on the distance between the noise source and the receiver. A
      noise barrier effect occurs when the barrier penetrates the “line of sight”
      between the source and receiver. The greater the penetration the greater the
      noise reduction.
      Another way in which the City can control vehicle noise is through speed
      reduction. A change of just 5 mph can change the resultant noise by
      approximately one to two dBA. The difference in noise associated with a
12-26                                                               NOISE ELEMENT

                                                                                 12. NOISE ELEMENT
reduction of 10 mph reduction could be roughly equivalent to reducing the
traffic volume by one-half.
The City also has some control over traffic-generated noise through weight
limitations. Medium trucks, (i.e., those with a gross vehicle weight between
5 and 13.25 tons) produce an much acoustical energy as approximately 5 to
16 automobiles depending on the speed with slower speeds demonstrating
the greater differential. Similarly, heavy trucks (i.e., those with a gross
vehicle weight in excess of 13.25 tons) produce as much acoustical energy as
10 to 60 automobiles again with slower speeds resulting in the greatest
differential.
Finally, the City can reduce traffic-generated noise by ensuring that street
paving is maintained and bumps and dips are eliminated. Poor paving causes
vehicles to bounce and this bouncing exacerbates the noise due to the rattling
of the vehicle. This is especially important along those routes that realize
augmented volumes of truck traffic.
GOAL #2
Our City has a diverse and efficiently operated ground transportation
system that generates the minimum feasible noise on its residents.
Policies:
1) All noise sections of the State Motor Vehicle Code shall be enforced.
2) On-road trucking activities shall be regulated in the City to ensure noise
     impacts are minimized.
3) Roads shall be maintained such that the paving is in good condition and
     free of cracks, bumps, and potholes.
4) Noise mitigation measures shall be included in the design of new
     roadway projects in the City.
5) Development that generates increased traffic and subsequent increases in
     the ambient noise level adjacent to noise-sensitive land uses shall provide
     appropriate mitigation measures.
6) Noise mitigation practices shall be employed when designing all future
     streets and highways, and when improvements occur along existing
     highway segments. These mitigation measures will emphasize the
     establishment of natural buffers or setbacks between the arterial
     roadways and adjoining noise-sensitive areas.
Actions:
1) Work with local and neighboring law enforcement officials and the
     California State Highway Patrol to ensure enforcement of the State
     Motor Vehicle noise standards. Issue “fix it” citations to vehicles
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                  12-27

          observed to create excessive noise due to modification or mechanical
          failure.
      2) Develop local legislation to cite those vehicles observed to operate
          excessively loud car audio systems.
      3) Develop local legislation to promote the citing of unmanned vehicles
          observed idling at the roadside.
      4) Disallow/discourage the use of “Jake brakes” adjacent to residential
          areas.
      5) Place a 5 ton gross vehicle weight limit on through traffic in residential
          and sensitive areas.
      6) Post and enforce residential speed limits at 25 mph.
      7) Post and enforce a speed limits at 25 mph or the lowest practical speed
          adjacent to other sensitive uses (e.g., hospital zone).
      8) Require that new road projects consider the efficacy of using the most
          current “quiet” asphalt.
      9) Work with City staff and Caltrans to ensure that all roadways are
          adequately maintained and paving is free of cracks, bumps, and potholes.
      10) During the environmental review process, require that industrial and
          commercial projects adequately consider the percentage/number of
          trucks added to the road (as opposed to just the total daily traffic
          volumes).
      11) Require that new road projects mitigate noise to within 5 dBA of existing
          levels if the noise level remains within the goals of the General Plan
          Noise Element (Figure 12-1) or 3 dBA of existing levels if the noise
          exceeds or would exceed these goals at any existing sensitive land uses
          or any vacant areas slated for subsequent sensitive development.
      12) Encourage the development and use of alternative transportation modes
          including bicycle paths and pedestrian walkways to minimize vehicular
          noise within and adjacent to sensitive receptor areas.
      13) Actively participate in the development of noise abatement plans for
          freeways and rapid transit.
      14) Restrict the use of motorized trail bikes, mini-bikes, scooters,
          skateboards, and other off-road vehicles in areas of the City except where
          designated for that purpose. Enforce strict operating hours for these
          vehicles in order to minimize noise impacts on sensitive land uses
          adjacent to public trails and parks. Cite users of these vehicles who use
          them on designated bike paths.

ISSUE #3 NON-TRANSPORTATION NOISE AND
LAND USE CONNECTION
How can the City ensure that its sensitive areas and land uses are not
subject to excessive “spill-over” noise?
Discussion: The City currently has a diverse wealth of land uses, most of
which generate their own noise. Industrial facilities generate noise through
various processes that involve the use of heavy equipment and machinery.
However, even commercial facilities and residential units can generate noise
from the use of heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) units.
Restaurants, bars, and entertainment establishments may also use sound
reinforcement equipment that operates well into the night. Residential areas
are also subject to noise from the use of pool and spa pumps, as well as
landscape maintenance equipment. Schoolyard activities, barking dogs, and
residential parties can also be sources of nuisance noise.
Mixed use areas that place more sensitive residential uses alongside
commercial uses can present their own problems. A mixed-use structure
could simultaneously serve as both a commercial and residential land use.
This then presents a disparity and it is difficult to determine an appropriate
standard. Requiring that the commercial aspect meet a residential standard
could make commercial operations difficult and offers an unfair competitive
advantage to a similar operation that is placed in a dedicated commercial
zone. Alternatively, applying a commercial standard to a mixed-use project
could result in unacceptable noise levels at the residential portion of the
structure/site. Still, mixed-use projects offer several advantages from both an
air quality and transportation perspective, and should be encouraged.
Another source of “non-transportation” noise comes from the operations of
trucks and trains within the City. As previously mentioned, the operation of
railroad trains and heavy trucks is preempted from local noise regulation
while operating on public roads and dedicated right-of-ways. However,
noise is also generated by operations (e.g., idling, loading, and unloading)
that occur at the facility. Once on private property, these sources are no
longer considered preempted and the City has authority to regulate this noise
if it “spills” into the adjacent areas.
Finally, construction in all land use zones will temporarily elevate noise.
The City recognizes that construction is a necessity and noise control for
construction is limited. Still, various measures are available to reduce this
nuisance (and potentially hazardous) noise when necessary.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                 12-29

      GOAL #3
      Our City’s residents are protected from the negative effects of “spill
      over” noise in our community.
      Policies:
      1) Residential land uses and areas identified as noise sensitive shall be
         protected from excessive noise from non-transportation sources
         including industrial, commercial, and residential activities and
         equipment.
      2) Projects located in commercial areas shall not exceed stationary-source
         noise standards at the property line of proximate residential or
         commercial uses, as appropriate.
      3) Industrial uses shall not exceed commercial or residential stationary-
         source noise standards at the most proximate land uses, as appropriate.
         (Industrial noise may spill over to proximate industrial uses so long as
         the combined noise does not exceed the appropriate industrial standards.)
      4) Non-transportation noise shall be considered in land use planning
         decisions.
      5) Construction shall be performed as quietly as feasible when performed in
         proximity to residential or other noise sensitive land uses.
      Actions:
      1) Establish and enforce a new community noise ordinance that clearly
         defines allowable levels of noise intrusion on adjoining land uses.
      2) Ensure that the new noise ordinance considers the State-mandated
         exterior and interior noise level standards.
      3) Require that on-site truck and railroad traffic for existing and new
         facilities be subject to stationary source noise regulations to be included
         in the ordinance.
      4) Ensure that existing facilities comply with the new ordinance through
         Code Enforcement.
      5) Continue to recommend that the County of San Bernardino enforce the
         current noise restrictions imposed on the California Speedway.
      6) Require that detailed and independent acoustical studies be conducted for
         any new or renovated land uses or structures determined to be potential
         major stationary noise sources.
      7) Require major stationary noise-generating sources to be located within
         500 feet of any zoned residential areas to install additional noise
         buffering or reduction mechanisms within their facilities to reduce noise
12-30                                                               NOISE ELEMENT

                                                                                 12. NOISE ELEMENT
     generation levels to the lowest extent practicable prior to the approval
     and/or issuance of new Conditional Use Permits for said facilities.
8) Require that new industrial and commercial land uses consider the noise
     from on-site operations (including unloading/loading activities) and its
     potential impacts on vacant land slated for subsequent sensitive use
     development during the environmental review process.
9) Require that new industrial and commercial land uses design their sites
     so as to route truck/train traffic as far as possible from adjoining, more
     sensitive uses. Alternatively, require these facilities to provide acoustic
     shielding (e.g., sound walls) to protect more sensitive land uses from on-
     site vehicle movement.
10) Require that new industrial and commercial land uses orient their loading
     docks so as to maintain the maximum distance from adjoining, more
     sensitive land uses. Alternatively, require these facilities to provide
     acoustic shielding (e.g., sound walls of enclosed docks) for on-site
     loading operations.
11) Require schools to meet the stationary noise standards for the zoned land
     use any proximate sensitive land uses. This may require that schools
     include sound walls or in the case of new facilities, orient their athletic
     fields away from sensitive adjoining land uses.
12) Require that schools terminate any outdoor athletic or social events (e.g.,
     graduation ceremony) prior to 10:00 p.m. if conducted within 500 feet of
     any sensitive land uses. Alternatively, require that the school obtain a
     noise variance for these activities.
13) Establish acceptable standards for residential noise sources such as, but
     not limited to, leaf blowers, audio equipment, and boisterous conduct.
14) Require that new residential development include the most current and
     quiet stationary noise sources such as air conditioners and swimming
     pool equipment.
15) Require that commercial and residential mixed-use structures minimize
     the transfer or transmission of noise and vibration from the commercial
     land use to the residential land use.
16) Minimize the generation of excessive noise level impacts from
     entertainment and restaurant/bar establishments into adjacent residential
     or noise-sensitive uses through compliance with the noise ordinance.
17) Include and enforce provisions for such things as residential parties,
     barking dogs, boisterous conduct, etc. in the noise ordinance.
18) Ensure that construction activities are regulated to established hours of
     operation to be included in the noise ordinance.

      19) Condition subdivision approval within 500 feet of developed/occupied
          noise-sensitive land uses by requiring the developer to submit a
          construction-related noise mitigation plan to the City for review and
          approval prior to issuance of a grading permit. The plan must depict the
          location of construction equipment and how the noise from this
          equipment will be mitigated during construction of this project, through
          the use of such methods as:
          a. Temporary noise attenuation fences;
          b. Preferential location of equipment; and
          c. Use of current noise suppression technology and equipment.
      20) Require that all construction equipment utilizes noise reduction features
          (e.g. mufflers and engine shrouds) that are no less effective than those
          originally installed by the manufacturer.
      21) To mitigate both noise and vibration, require that any pile driving within
          1,000 feet of any developed/occupied sensitive land use be subject to
          those construction requirements set for construction within 500 feet of
          these land uses.

Chapter 13.                               Air
Quality Element
INTRODUCTION
Purpose of the Element
Adverse air quality is a critical environmental concern in Fontana. In the
past, pollutants from the former Kaiser Steel Mill (now California Steel)
greatly contributed to Fontana’s air quality problems. However, the
increased urbanization in the surrounding region has brought new problems.
Fontana is at the hub of several major transportation facilities and as such
high volumes of automobile and truck traffic –with their associated
emissions – flow through and around the City. The General Plan recognizes
the importance of air quality within the city, in part by the inclusion of this
element in the General Plan.
State Law Requirements
The air quality element is not a required chapter of the general plan.
However, by the inclusion of this element in the updated General Plan, the
City is acknowledging the existing condition of the quality of the air, and the
City’s commitment to the improvement the city’s residents’ quality of life.
Air Quality Mandates
There are a series of governing bodies that monitor air quality as well as
enforce and develop policies and standards for the improvement of air
quality. The Clean Air Act of 1990 is a federal law that is enforced by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Though the EPA is a part of the
federal government, much of the permitting and enforcement for emissions is
done at the state and regional level.
In California, regional boards called Air Quality Management Districts have
Air Quality Management Plans (AQMPs) that are updated every three years.
The City of Fontana falls within the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB or Basin),
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                       13-1

     which includes all of Orange County and the non-desert portions of Los
     Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. Air quality conditions in
     the SCAB are under the jurisdiction of the South Coast Air Quality
     Management District (SCAQMD).
     ACHIEVING THE VISION
     The Citizens of Fontana are concerned about their health and the health of
     future residents. As a part of the Community Visioning Process that shaped
     this general plan update, citizens and city officials identified goals for the
     future relating to the control of traffic in the City, broadening of the City’s
     economic base to diversify away from industrial uses as a job base,
     minimization of incompatibilities between adjacent land uses, and
     preservation of the City’s views (which can at times be obscured by air
     pollution.) All of these goals are related to the policy direction in the Air
     Quality Element of this General Plan.
     COMPONENTS OF THE AIR QUALITY
     ELEMENT
     Regulating Air Quality
     Federal Clean Air Act Requirements
     Air quality in the Basin is regulated by federal, State, and regional control
     authorities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is involved in
     local air quality planning through the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA), as
     amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The CAA requires
     plans to provide for the implementation of all reasonably available control
     measures “as expeditiously as practicable,” including the adoption of
     reasonably available control technology for reducing emissions from existing
     sources. The CAA explicitly encourages emission control innovations in the
     form of market-based approaches. The SCAQMD is the first local agency in
     the country to adopt a market-based approach for controlling stationary
     source emissions of oxides of nitrogen and sulfur and, in accordance with the
     pending revisions, is proposing additional market-based control measures.
     Other federal requirements addressed in the revision include mechanisms to
     track plan implementation and milestone compliance for ozone and carbon
     monoxide.
     In addition, the 1990 amendments to the CAA require the SCAQMD to
     develop the following demonstrations or plans addressed in the 1994 Air
     Quality Management Plan (AQMP) (discussed below): (1) an ozone
     attainment demonstration, (2) a post-1996 rate-of-progress demonstration,
     and (3) a PM10 State Implementation Plan (SIP) (required in 1996) that
     incorporates best available control measures for fugitive sources.
13-2                                                           AIR QUALITY ELEMENT

                                                                               13. AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
California Clean Air Act Requirements
In addition to federal requirements, the 1994 AQMP meets the California
Clean Air Act (CCAA) requirements. According to the CCAA, air pollution
control districts must design their air quality attainment plans to achieve a
reduction in basin-wide emissions of 5% or more per year (or 15% or more
in a 3-year period) for all non-attainment pollutants and their precursors. For
emission reduction accounting purposes, the CARB has established a 7-year
initial reporting period (1988 to 1994) with reporting intervals every 3 years
thereafter. Consequently, the 1994 AQMP was to achieve a 35% reduction
for the initial period and a 15% reduction for every subsequent interval.
The CCAA also required that the 1994 AQMP control measures reduce
overall population exposure to criteria pollutants, with a 40% reduction due
by the end of 1997 and a 50% reduction by the year 2000. This provision is
applicable to O3, CO, and NO2 in the SCAB. The CCAA further requires the
SCAQMD’s Governing Board to determine that the 1994 AQMP was a cost-
effective strategy that will achieve attainment of the State standards by the
earliest practicable date. In addition, the 1994 AQMP must include an
assessment of the cost-effectiveness of available and proposed measures and
a list of the measures ranked from the least cost-effective to the most cost-
effective. In addition to cost-effectiveness, other factors must be considered,
including technological feasibility, emissions reduction potential, rates of
reduction, public acceptability, and enforceability.
1997/1999 AQMP
At the time this Air Quality element is being prepared, the SCAQMD is in
the process of preparing a comprehensive plan update – the Proposed 2003
Air Quality Management Plan for the South Coast Air Basin. The 2003
AQMP seeks to demonstrate attainment with state and federal air quality
standards and will incorporate a revised emissions inventory, the latest
modeling techniques, and updated control measures remaining from the
1997/1999 SIP and new control measures based on current technology
assessments. In the interim, the 1997/1999 AQMP still serves as the fully
approved submission into the State Implementation Plan (SIP).
The AQMP is a dynamic document that is to be updated every 3 years. With
recent findings by nationally recognized health experts, the new Plan puts
greater emphasis on PM10 particulate matter (described further below.) In
fact, the 1997 Plan is the first Plan required by federal law to demonstrate
attainment of the federal PM10 ambient air quality standards. The 1997 Plan
also updates the demonstration of attainment of ozone and carbon monoxide.
Additionally, because the Basin came into attainment of the federal nitrogen
dioxide standard since the prior AQMP was prepared, the new Plan includes
a maintenance plan to assure continued compliance.
Expanding on the control strategies included in the 1994 AQMP, the 1997
Plan projects sufficient emissions reductions to meet all federal criteria
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                      13-3

     pollutant standards within the time frames allowed under the federal Clean
     Air Act.
     Highlights of the 1997 Plan are noted below.
              Use of the most current air quality information (1995), including
              special particulate matter data from the PM10 Technical
              Enhancement Program;
              Improved emissions inventories, especially for motor vehicles,
              fugitive dust, and ammonia sources;
              A similar, but fine tuned overall control strategy with continuing
              emphasis on flexible, alternative approaches including intercredit
              trading;
              A determination that certain control measures contained in the 1994
              AQMP, are infeasible, most notably the future indirect source
              measures;
              Enhanced modeling for particulates;
              A Maintenance Plan for nitrogen dioxide, and
              An attainment demonstration and State Implementation Plan
              Revision for PM10.
     On January 12, 1999, the U.S. EPA proposed partial approval/disapproval of
     the 1997 Ozone SIP revisions citing concerns with the ozone control strategy
     provided in the 1997 AQMP. To address these concerns, the AQMD staff
     prepared the 1999 Amendment.
     The 1999 Amendment provides revisions to the ozone portion of the 1997
     AQMP that was submitted to the U.S. EPA as a revision to the South Coast
     Air Basin portion of the 1994 California Ozone SIP. Specifically, the 1999
     Amendment:
              Includes new short-term stationary source control measures,
              Revises the adoption/implementation schedule for 13 short-term
              volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx)
              stationary source control measures from the 1997 Ozone SIP
              Revision,
              Provides further VOC emission reductions in the near-term, and
              Revises the emission reduction commitments for the long-term
              control measures in the 1997 Ozone SIP Revision long-term
              stationary source control measures that the SCAQMD is responsible
              to implement.
     The 1999 Amendment does not revise the PM10 portion of the 1997 AQMP,
     emission inventories, the mobile source portions of the 1997 Ozone SIP
     Revision, or the ozone attainment demonstration. However, with the new
     short-term stationary source control measures, additional emission reductions
     are projected to occur in the near-term.

                                                                                 13. AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
Pollutant Types
Pollutants emitted into the air from stationary and mobile sources affect the
quality of the air around us. Stationary sources can be divided into two
major subcategories: point sources and area sources. Point sources consist of
one or more emission sources at a facility with an identified location and are
usually associated with manufacturing and industrial processing plants. Area
sources are widely distributed and produce many small emissions.
Mobile sources refer to emissions from motor vehicles, including tailpipe and
evaporative emissions, and are classified as either on-road or off-road. On-
road sources are a combination of emissions from automobiles, trucks, and
indirect sources. Indirect sources are sources that by themselves may not
emit air contaminants; however, they indirectly cause the generation of air
pollutants by attracting vehicle trips or consuming energy. Examples of
indirect sources include an office complex or commercial center that
generates commuter trips and consumes energy resources through the use of
natural gas for space and water heating. Indirect sources also include actions
proposed by local governments, such as redevelopment districts and private
projects involving the development of either large buildings or tracts. Off-
road sources include aircraft, ships, trains, and self-propelled construction
equipment.
Federal and State law regulates the air pollutants emitted into the ambient air
by stationary and mobile sources. These regulated air pollutants are known
as “criteria air pollutants.” Primary criteria air pollutants are those that are
emitted directly from sources. Carbon monoxide (CO); reactive organic
gases (ROG); nitrogen oxides (NOx); sulfur dioxide (SO2); and most fine
particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), including lead (Pb) and fugitive dust; are
primary criteria air pollutants. Secondary criteria air pollutants are those
pollutants formed by chemical and photochemical reactions in the
atmosphere. Ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are the principal
secondary pollutants. Primary pollutants’ concentrations decrease as they
dissipate, but secondary pollutants reach maximum concentrations at a
distance downwind from the original source. Each of these primary and
secondary criteria air pollutants and their known health effects is described
below.
Carbon Monoxide
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, toxic gas produced by incomplete
combustion of carbon substances (e.g., gasoline or diesel fuel). The primary
adverse health effect associated with CO is the interference of normal oxygen
transfer to the blood, which may result in tissue oxygen deprivation.
Particulate Matter
Particulate matter consists of finely divided solids or liquids such as soot,
dust, aerosols, fumes, and mists. Two forms of fine particulate are now
recognized. Course particles, or PM10, include that portion of the particulate
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                        13-5

     matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns (i.e., ten one-millionths
     of a meter or 0.0004 inch) or less. Fine particles, or PM2.5, have an
     aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 microns (i.e., 2.5 one-millionths of a meter or
     0.0001 inch) or less. Particulate discharge into the atmosphere results
     primarily from industrial, agricultural, construction, and transportation
     activities. Both PM10 and PM2.5 may adversely affect the human respiratory
     system, especially in those people who are naturally sensitive or susceptible
     to breathing problems.
     Fugitive Dust
     Fugitive dust poses primarily two public health and safety concerns. The
     first concern is that of respiratory problems attributable to the suspended
     particulates in the air. The second concern is that of motor vehicle accidents
     caused by reduced visibility during severe wind conditions. Fugitive dust
     may also cause significant property damage during strong windstorms by
     acting as an abrasive material agent (much like sandblasting.)
     Lead
     Lead in the atmosphere occurs as particulate matter. Sources of lead include
     the manufacturing of batteries, paint, ink, ceramics, and ammunition, and
     secondary lead smelters. With the phase-out of leaded gasoline, secondary
     lead smelters and battery recycling and manufacturing facilities are becoming
     lead emission sources of greater concern.
     Nitrogen Oxides
     Nitrogen oxides serve as integral participants in the process of photochemical
     smog production. The two major forms of NOx are nitric oxide (NO) and
     nitrogen dioxide (NO2). NO is a colorless, odorless gas formed from
     atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen when combustion takes place under high
     temperature and/or high pressure. NO2 is a reddish-brown irritating gas
     formed by the combination of NO and oxygen. NO2 acts as an acute irritant
     and, in equal concentrations, is more injurious than NO. There is some
     indication of a relationship between NO2 and chronic pulmonary fibrosis.
     Some increase in bronchitis in children (2 and 3 years old) has also been
     observed at concentrations below 0.3 part per million (ppm). NO2 absorbs
     blue light; the result is a brownish-red cast to the atmosphere and reduced
     visibility. NO2 also contributes to the formation of PM10 and PM2.5.
     Ozone
     Ozone (O3) is one of a number of substances called photochemical oxidants
     that are formed when reactive organic compounds and NOx (both by-
     products of the internal combustion engine) react with sunlight. O3 is present
     in relatively high concentrations in the SCAB, and the damaging effects of
     photochemical smog are generally related to the concentrations of O3. O3
     may pose a health threat to those who already suffer from respiratory
     diseases as well as healthy people.

Reactive Organic Gases
Reactive organic gases are compounds comprised primarily of atoms of
hydrogen and carbon. Internal combustion associated with motor vehicle
usage is the major source of hydrocarbons. Adverse effects on human health
are not caused directly by ROG but rather by reactions of ROG to form
secondary pollutants.
Sulfur Dioxide
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a colorless, pungent, irritating gas formed by the
combustion of sulfurous fossil fuels. Fuel combustion is the primary source
of SO2. At sufficiently high concentrations, SO2 may irritate the upper
respiratory tract. At lower concentrations and when combined with
particulates, SO2 may do greater harm by injuring lung tissue.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
According to the 1997 Air Quality Management Plan, the South Coast Air
Basin (SCAB) had the worst air quality in the nation. The City of Fontana
faces a particularly difficult challenge in improving local air quality due to
the concentration of heavy industrial uses in the City and its Sphere. A brief
summary of the major contributors to diminished air quality is provided
below.
Wind Patterns & City Location
The distinctive climate of Fontana and the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB) is
determined by its terrain and geographical location. The Basin is located in a
coastal plain with connecting broad valleys and low hills, bounded by the
Pacific Ocean in the southwest quadrant with high mountains forming the
remainder of the perimeter. Fontana is located toward the northeast portion
of the Basin at the foot of the Cajon Pass that separates the San Gabriel
Mountains to the west and San Bernardino Mountains to the east.
Wind patterns across the south coastal region are characterized by westerly
and southwesterly on-shore winds during the day and easterly or
northeasterly breezes at night. Winds are characteristically light although the
speed is somewhat greater during the dry summer months than during the
rainy winter season. Between the periods of dominant airflow, periods of air
stagnation may occur, both in the morning and evening hours. Whether such
a period of stagnation occurs is one of the critical determinants of air quality
conditions on any given day.
On most spring and early summer days, the daily air pollutants produced
within the SCAB are moved out of the air basin through mountain passes or
are lifted upward by the warm, vertical currents produced by the heating of
mountain slopes. In those seasons, pollutants within the SCAB are dispersed
and transported (often to a distance of 60 miles or more) by ocean air
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                        13-7
     currents during the afternoon. From late summer through the winter months,
     this flushing is less pronounced because of lighter wind speeds and the
     earlier appearance of offshore winds.
     Because of expansional cooling, temperatures usually decrease with altitude.
     A reversal of this atmosphere condition, where temperature increases with
     altitude, is termed an inversion. The inversion effectively keeps the cooler
     air below from rising. Coupled with the proximity of the mountains, these
     inversions serve as a cap that hinders pollutant dispersion. Upwind pollution
     sources, local industry, and high traffic volumes bring pollutants into the
     City, and when coupled with local meteorological conditions result in some
     of the worst air quality in the country.
     During the winter and fall months, surface high-pressure systems over the
     Basin, combined with other meteorological conditions, can result in very
     strong, downslope Santa Ana winds. These winds normally have a duration
     of a few days before predominant meteorological conditions are
     reestablished. Within the project area Santa Ana winds have a decidedly
     distinct pattern. Santa Ana winds from a northerly direction pour through the
     Cajon Pass then follow the Santa Ana River in a southwestward motion
     direction to the coast. The highest wind speeds typically occur during the
     afternoon due to daytime thermal convection caused by surface heating. This
     convection brings about a downward transfer of momentum from stronger
     winds aloft. While the maximum wind speed during Santa Ana conditions is
     undefined, sustained winds of 60 mph with higher gusts are not uncommon
     in the Fontana area.
     Major Sources of Pollution Located Within the
     City
     While much of the poor air quality in the City of Fontana and Inland Empire
     in general, is due to the transport of pollutants from upwind sources;
     primarily Los Angeles and Orange Counties, the City also includes some
     major emissions sources, the foremost of which is from on-road motor
     vehicles. Area source emissions associated with the trappings of urban life
     (e.g., space and water heating, landscape maintenance, consumer products,
     etc.) also add to these emissions. Table 13-1 estimates the emissions
     associated with both mobile and stationary sources as predicted by the
     URBEMIS2001 computer model distributed by the SCAQMD.1 The model
     addresses only those emissions produced by residents and businesses that
     operate within the city and does not account for vehicles that only pass
     through the city. Furthermore, the model does not present the emissions
     associated with point sources (e.g., factory exhaust stacks) or industrial
     processes subject to SCAQMD permitting.

 emissions and summer conditions for area source emissions.
In addition to mobile and area-source emissions, the City contains a
diversified listing of industrial and non-industrial sources, many of which
produce vast quantities of air emissions. The appendix for the 2003 AQMP,
currently under preparation by the SCAQMD, includes the top 300 producers
of NOx and ROG within the Basin as of 1997.
California Steel Industries
California Steel Industries (CSI) is located on 450 acres of the former Kaiser
Steel facility. CSI has been in business since 1984, and employs upwards of
1000 people.
California Steel Industries (CSI) does not manufacture steel; rather they
specialize in Slab Steel Processing. CSI obtains steel from other sources, and
uses powerful equipment to roll, anneal, pickle, and/or galvanize steel slabs.
Though CSI does not manufacture steel, there are emissions that result from
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                                                 13-9
      the processes listed above. CSI has worked with the SCAQMD to meet or
      exceed emissions standards for slab steel processing.
      Slag Pile
      The Kaiser Steel Mill created a slag pile, located along the south side of San
      Bernardino Avenue east of Etiwanda Avenue, during its time of operation.
      This area consists of a mound of slag and solid wastes comprised of non-
      metallic by-products of steel processing and consists mainly of calcium,
      magnesium, and aluminum silicates. Slag is currently being extracted for use
      in roofing, railroads, concrete, highways, mineral wood insulation, glass
      manufacture, asphalt manufacture, and as fill. The extraction process may
      cause fugitive dust situations that could lead to elevated particulate
      concentrations in the direct vicinity of the slag pile.
      Trucking Facilities
      The trucking industry is a major contributor to Fontana’s economic base as
      well as to air pollution within the City. Truck retail sales facilities can be
      found along Valley Boulevard and warehousing and distribution centers are
      concentrated in pockets in the City near Interstates 10 and 15 and at Baseline
      Road. Additional areas along Interstate 15 and Sierra Avenue in north
      Fontana are planned to allow industrial development. The presence of these
      businesses attracts trucks that emit a considerable number of air pollutants
      including nitrous oxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur oxides (SOX),
      and reactive organic compounds. Individually, the trucks and businesses are
      required to comply with federal, state, and regional air quality management
      plans, however the cumulative effects of emissions could be of concern.
      California Speedway
      The California Speedway, located within the City’s sphere of influence off
      San Bernardino Avenue and Cherry Avenue, is a host on the NASCAR and
      CART racing circuit. Approximately 12 races are held at the Speedway each
      year, and these races are a major regional attraction. The major contributor
      to air quality deficiencies during racing events does not stem from the race
      cars themselves, so much as from the heavy traffic generated by race fans.
      FUTURE CONDITIONS
      As the City continues to grow under the General Plan, so will the number of
      emissions sources. As with the existing setting, the foremost source of these
      emissions is from on-road motor vehicles. However, the number of area
      source emissions will also increase over time. Table 13-2 estimates the
      emissions associated with both mobile and stationary sources as predicted by
      the URBEMIS2001 computer model distributed by the SCAQMD. As with
13-10                                                         AIR QUALITY ELEMENT

the analysis of the existing setting, the model addresses only those emissions
produced by residents and businesses that operate within the city and does
not account for vehicles that only pass through the city. Furthermore, the
model does not present the emissions associated with point sources (e.g.,
factory exhaust stacks) or industrial processes subject to SCAQMD
permitting. Note that most emissions show a dramatic reduction from the
existing values even though local growth could add considerably to the
overall land use and daily vehicle trips. This is due to increased vehicle
emissions standards coupled with the continual replacement of older, higher
polluting vehicles with newer, cleaner units. On the other hand, PM10
emissions show a marked increase over time. This is because the vast
majority of PM10 emissions are created by the suspension of entrained road
dust into the atmosphere. Additionally, even though vehicle engines become
more efficient, some of the PM10 is produced from abrasion of such things as
brake and clutch linings and tire wear, none of which are subject to vehicle
exhaust emissions regulations.

      ISSUES, GOALS, POLICIES & ACTIONS
      ISSUE #1 COST/BENEFIT OF IMPROVED AIR
      QUALITY
      What is the cost/benefit of Improved Air Quality?
      Discussion: At the surface it would seem that a reduction in emissions and
      corresponding improvement in air quality requires a large outlay on the part
      of the City, its residents, and industries with little or no monetary benefit.
      The Draft 2003 AQMP estimates that the cost-effectiveness for stationary
      source measures ranges from $2,000 to as high as $20,100 per ton of
      pollutant reduced.
      However, the quality of the air we breathe directly affects our health,
      environment, economy, and our quality of life. Just as we are affected by air
      pollution, so too are plants and animals. There are also numerous impacts to
      our economy including lost workdays due to illness, a desire on the part of
      business to locate in areas with a healthy environment, and increased
      expenses from medical costs. Pollutants may also lower visibility and cause
      damage to property.
      In conformance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments, the
      USEPA has prepared a monetary cost/benefit analysis related to
      implementation requirements. By the year 2010, the USEPA estimates that
      it’s emissions reductions programs would cost approximately $27 billion
      dollars. However, the programs are estimated to result in a savings benefit of
      $110 billion dollars for a net benefit of $83 billion dollars. While these
      values are for the nation as a whole, a net benefit ratio of about 4:1 is noted
      and a similar ratio could be expected for the City of Fontana and it’s
      residents.
      Another direct cost/benefit issue relates to federal funding. Areas that do not
      meet the federal air quality standards my lose eligibility for federal funding
      for road improvement and other projects that require federal or California
      Department of Transportation approval. Cleaner air also yields benefits to
      ecological systems.
      GOAL #1:
      Air quality improvements are achieved in our City while continued
      economic growth has been sustained.
      Policies:
      1) Support the Air Quality Management District in implementing cost
           effective measures that enhance surrounding jurisdictions ability to meet
           or exceed adopted air quality standards.
13-12                                                           AIR QUALITY ELEMENT

                                                                                13. AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
2) Preferential treatment or permit streamlining shall be provided for those
     industrial/commercial projects that go beyond BACT or emissions
     reduction measures that go beyond those required by the SCAQMD for
     permitting.
3) Preferential treatment or permit streamlining shall be provided for those
     residential projects that incorporate emissions reduction measures that go
     beyond those suggested by the SCAQMD for residential development.
4) Educate the public on the economic benefits of reduced air pollution.
Actions:
1) Seek the placement of a city staff member on an Air Quality
     improvement committee as a means of influencing SCAQMD policies
     and programs.
2) Create permit streamlining procedures relating to conformity with
     emissions standards.
3) Ensure that City Planning Staff that review environmental studies are
     aware of current air quality reduction methods and are open to new
     technology. Make a conscience effort to facilitate those projects that go
     beyond the requisite rules and regulations to reduce air emissions.
4) Participate in creating a multi-jurisdictional air quality plan that works in
     concert with the existing air quality management plans, in order to jointly
     improve air quality without unduly burdening individual jurisdictions.
5) Establish a City air quality advisory committee that works to educate the
     public on air quality issues and stimulate local businesses to reduce
     emissions and contribute to overall air quality.
ISSUE #2: AIR QUALITY AND THE LAND USE &
TRANSPORTATION CONNECTION (REDUCING
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED)
How can the City promote emissions reductions through land use and
transportation strategies?
Discussion: The largest source of pollution in the City is from the vehicles
trips that both emanate from within and pass through the City. If these trips
are reduced in either number or length (or both), emissions are reduced
accordingly.
In the past, the SCAQMD pushed for a jobs/housing balance as a measure to
reduce mobile source emissions. Projects located within the Basin should be
consistent with the goals and projections included in the AQMP. The 1991
AQMP stressed a balance of job and housing within each subarea of the
Basin with the understanding that if there was a balance, local residents could
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                       13-13
      fill local jobs thereby reducing the need for extended travel consistency
      analysis. Ideal ratios were as projected in the Growth Management Plan
      (1989) and an area was considered to be in balance if the projected
      jobs/housing ratio was projected at 1.22 in 2010. (The west San Bernardino
      Valley area was considered to be among the more jobs poor/housing rich
      urban areas with a projected jobs/housing balance of 0.99 in the year 1984.
      The area was expected to improve on this ratio was expected to reaching 1.16
      in the year 2010.) The jobs-housing ratio that could be achieved based on the
      mid-point capacity of this General Plan land use plan is 1.93 jobs per
      household.
      Ideally, each city in the greater Southern California area would attain the
      optimal balance that would reduce the need for extended commuter trips. In
      reality, market forces dictating housing and job development may or may not
      allow this balance to be achieved. Furthermore, even a balance of jobs to
      housing in a given jurisdiction does not ensure that local residents fill those
      jobs.
      The 1994 AQMP recognized this and focused on reduction in vehicle trips
      through transportation control measures, alternatives to vehicle use, and
      desirability of mixed land use areas. Transportation Demand Management
      (TDM) can help unclog freeways and reduce commute times, thereby
      improving air quality.
      TDM strategies help reduce work-related trips by encouraging individuals
      who now drive alone to form carpools and vanpools, and to take the bus or
      light rail. Alternatively, workers may work longer hours and so eliminate a
      trip to the office once or twice a week. Two other TDM strategies that
      eliminate work trips are telecommuting and work-at-home programs. When
      individuals must drive, TDM calls for changes in their work schedules to
      avoid peak traffic periods. A similar TDM strategy encourages large trucks
      to operate at night. TDM strategies for reducing trips that are not work
      related are also important. TDM alone, however, is not the answer. Transit
      improvements and facility development must accompany these changes.
      Changing transportation demand also requires facility development, such as
      that already in place at Fontana’s Metrolink station, including park-n-ride
      lots, bus turnouts, off-site parking, and facilities for bicycles and pedestrians.
      As the automobile is the major source of air pollution in the region, the City
      recognizes the importance of reducing the number of vehicle trips and miles
      traveled. Policies in this section are not intended to create additional
      regulation, but to create incentives to reduce vehicle trips, encourage
      alternative schedules, and conform to policies created by regional
      governments.

GOAL #2
Our City has a diverse and efficiently operated ground transportation
system that generates the minimum feasible pollutants.
Policies:
1) The City shall seek to integrate land use and transportation planning to
     the maximum extent practical.
2) Mixed-use development should be planned for and incentivized to
     develop in our City.
3) Employers locating in our City should be encouraged to develop trip
     reduction plans to promote alternative work schedules, ridesharing,
     telecommuting, and work-at-home programs, employee education and
     preferential parking.
4) Incentives, regulations, and Transportation Demand Management
     systems shall be developed in cooperation with surrounding jurisdictions
     to eliminate vehicle trips that would otherwise be made.
5) Merchants in our City should be assisted in getting their customers to
     shift from single occupancy vehicles to transit, carpools, bicycles, or
     foot.
6) Developers in our community shall work to reduce vehicle trips and total
     vehicle miles traveled in projects that are approved here.
7) The City should manage parking supply to discourage auto use, while
     ensuring that economic development goals will not be sacrificed.
8) Efforts to expand bus, rail, and other forms of transit in the portion of the
     South Coast Air Basin within San Bernardino County shall be
     cooperatively pursued with Omnitrans, MTA and other transit providers.
9) The City should invest in clean fuel systems on new local government
     fleet vehicles as their service life ends, and promote similar actions by
     other units of government.
10) The City shall manage traffic flow through signal synchronization, while
     coordinating with and permitting the free flow of mass transit vehicles,
     as a way to achieve enhanced mobility.
11) Traffic signals should be synchronized throughout the City and with
     those of adjoining cities and the California Department of
     Transportation.
12) Traffic signals shall be constructed and improved with channelization
     and Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control systems at appropriate
     intersections.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                      13-15
      13) Traffic hazards, delays, and idle time should be diminished through
          highway and roadway maintenance, rapid emergency response, debris
          removal, and elimination of at-grade railroad crossings.
      14) Heavy trucks shall be discouraged from excessive idling both at the
          roadside and during unloading/loading operations.
      15) The City should provide incentives for business owners to schedule
          deliveries at off-peak traffic periods.
      Actions:
      1) Establish and administer mixed-use development standards and
          guidelines, especially for combining residential, office, and commercial
          uses.
      2) Establish performance standards for clustering residential areas near
          commercial services where mixed use is not feasible.
      3) Work with SANBAG to develop guidelines for the location and design
          of land uses that are sensitive to air pollution.
      4) Zone or rezone properties so that sensitive land uses (e.g., residential,
          educational) are not located within 200 feet of any freeway.
      5) Establish procedures to ensure that developers disclose vehicle emissions
          concentrations (i.e., CO) during the environmental review process for all
          development proximate to intersections that are to operate at level of

ISSUE #3 ENERGY CONSERVATION AND
EMISSIONS
How can the City reduce emissions associated with energy consumption?
Discussion: While mobile sources and industry are the greatest sources of
pollution in the City, other all sources of pollution should be reduced as
feasible if the Basin is to attain compliance with the air quality standards in
the requisite time frame. One way to reduce these emissions that does show
tangible economic benefits is through recycling and conservation. Efforts to
recycle wastes can reduce the amount of pollutants emitted from the
production of new materials while preserving raw materials. Energy efficient
design and conservation measures minimize the impacts of not only the
consumption of, but also the production of energy sources.
GOAL #3:
A concerted effort to reduce energy consumption in our City results in
reduced emissions.
Policies:
1) Source reduction, recycling, and other appropriate measures to reduce
     the dependence on and processing of new raw materials shall be
     promoted.
2) Energy conservation shall be achieved through a combination of
     incentives and regulations for private and public developments.
3) The City shall promote and provide incentives for the incorporation of
     energy-efficient design elements, including appropriate site orientation
     and the use of shade and windbreak trees to reduce fuel consumption for
     heating and cooling.
4) The City shall promote and provide incentives for the use of energy
     efficient building materials/methods that reduce emissions.
5) The City shall promote and provide incentives for the use of efficient
     heating equipment and other appliances, such as water heaters,
     swimming pool heaters, cooking equipment, refrigerators, furnaces, and
     boiler units.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                       13-17
      6) Centrally heated facilities to utilize automated time clocks or occupant
          sensors to control heating shall be required in facilities of a size and
          character to yield a positive return on investment.
      7) The City shall require residential building construction to comply with
          energy use guidelines detailed in Title 24 of the California
          Administrative Code and shall promote and provide incentives for
          residential building construction that goes beyond the guidelines detailed
          in Title 24.
      8) Stationary pollution sources shall be managed to prevent the release of
          toxic pollutants through:
              Design features
              Operating procedures
              Preventive maintenance
              Operator training and
              Emergency response planning.
      9) Stationary air pollution sources shall comply with applicable air district
          rules and control measures.
      10) Any project that exceeds allowable emissions, as established by the
          SCAQMD, shall mitigate its anticipated emissions to the extent
          reasonably feasible.
      11) Alternative energy sources development shall be promoted in Fontana.
      Actions:
      1) Work with the SCAQMD to develop cost effective energy conservation
          standards to be incorporated into new development.
      2) Work with alternative energy source providers to provide services in
          Fontana.
      3) Establish a process, including identification of priorities, to phase in
          energy conservation improvements through the annual budget process.
      4) Adopt incentives and regulations to enact energy conservation
          requirements (e.g., energy efficient appliances) for private developers.
      5) Adopt building codes amendments to require that all new single-family
          residential units include front and rear exterior outlets to facilitate the use
          of electric landscape maintenance equipment.
      6) Adopt incentives and regulations to reduce emissions from commercial
          and residential space and water heating equipment.

7) Adopt incentives and regulations to require the use of energy efficient
     swimming pool equipment (heaters and pumps).
8) Review the City’s waste recycling program to determine if further energy
     conservation features are feasible. Pursue those so identified.
9) Establish procedures for City staff to specify the use of recycled
     materials (e.g., paper) both for in-house projects and for submittal by
     contractors when engaged in City’ projects.
ISSUE #4 PARTICULATE EMISSIONS AND
FUGITIVE DUST
How can the City reduce particulate emissions associated with the
generation of fugitive dust?
Discussion: The SCAB exceeds both the PM10 and PM2.5 standards. While
much of this particulate is associated with exhaust emissions, dust generated
by both on- and off-road travel adds substantially to these emission values.
Table 13-1 includes an existing estimate of 9,059.8 pounds per day of PM10
associated with on-road travel. Of this value, 8,332.5 pounds per day are
associated with entrained road dust that is “kicked-up” from vehicle tires.
While most vehicle emissions decrease over time due to more stringent
tailpipe standards, by the year 2030, PM10 emissions are expected to increase
to 15,626.5 pounds per day. Of this value, 14,477.1 pounds are directly
attributed to entrained road dust, which is not a function of vehicle emissions
controls. Additionally, construction activities that involve demolition or soil
movement can raise particulate matter. Because the Basin fails to achieve
the requisite particulate standards, all sources of particulate pollution should
be reduced as feasible. This is particularly significant for the City of Fontana
because of the significant land area in the City and its sphere that remains to
be developed.
City of Fontana General Plan                                                                        13-19

      GOAL #4:
      The minimum practicable particulate emissions are released in our City
      from construction and operation of roads and buildings.
      Policies:
      1) Particulate emissions from roads, parking lots, construction sites and
          agricultural lands shall be kept at the minimum feasible level.
      2) Emissions from building materials and construction methods that
          generate excessive pollutants shall be kept at the minimum feasible level.
      Actions:
      1) Incorporate the provisions of SCAQMD Rule 403 (Dust Control) into
          City land use administration rules and procedures.
      2) Establish grading and building permitting procedures so that all
          construction involving demolition or earth movement reduces fugitive
          dust emissions through the appropriate techniques (e.g., wetting).
      3) Establish grading permit and field management procedures to ensure that
          large-scale earth movement (e.g., over 10 acres per day) performs at
          levels more demanding than required by SCAQMD Rule 403.
      4) Establish and budget for a rotating street maintenance program so that all
          City streets are adequately maintained and damaged paving is repaired as
          soon as possible.
      5) Establish permitting procedures and field supervision practices to ensure
          that roadway construction/repair does not force vehicles onto unpaved
          surfaces either through alternate routing or through pre-paving of off-
          road surfaces.
      6) Establish land use administration and building permit procedures, which
          ensure that all proposed permanent parking areas are paved.
      7) Ensure that all City streets are adequately maintained. Repair damaged
          paving as soon as possible.
      8) Establish grading permit and field monitoring procedures that require
          large-scale construction (e.g., over 10 acres) to pave or place gravel on
          un-paved parking surfaces during the construction effort.
      9) Pave all roadway shoulders where vehicles may park or wait.
      10) Adopt, schedule and fund a street-sweeping program in those areas of the
          City in which such a program does not exist.
