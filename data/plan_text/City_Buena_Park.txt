Chapter 2 Land Use and Community Design Elemen
2.1         INTRODUCTION
The Land Use and Community
Design Element provides the
primary policy foundation for the
entire General Plan, as it
establishes the desired vision for
future land use decisions in the
City.      The Land Use and
Community Design Element
directs development patterns by
identifying     and     describing,
through diagrams and text, the
location and distribution of
existing and future land uses
throughout the City. The General
Plan Land Use Map (Exhibit LU-
1) describes land use designations
and identifies the geographic
distribution of land uses that will
help guide future growth and change, consistent with the City’s vision. The Land Use Map is a
graphical representation of the City’s official land use policy, providing the primary policy
guidance for future land use decision-making. The Land Use and Community Design Element
articulates City goals and policies that address community character and identity, as well as
future growth and change, preservation, enhancement of existing resources, and community
safety.
2.2         AUTHORITY FOR THE ELEMENT
California Government Code Section 65302(a) requires that the General Plan include: “...a Land
Use Element that designates the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of
the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space including agriculture, natural
resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings and grounds,
solid and liquid waste disposal facilities and other categories of public and private uses of land.
The Land Use Element shall include a statement of the standards of population density and
building intensity recommended for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan.”
The Land Use and Community Design Element has the broadest scope of the seven state-
mandated Elements of the General Plan. In addition to Government Code requirements, it has
been legally established that while the location of a particular land use may be expressed in
general terms, a property owner must be able to identify the General Plan designation for his/her
parcel from the land use diagram contained in the Land Use and Community Design Element.
                                                                                                2-1

While community design is not a State-mandated Element of the General Plan, the City of Buena
Park has chosen to include land use and community design under one element.
2.3         SUMMARY OF EXISTING CONDITIONS
As of June 2009, the City’s approximately 6,751.90 acres were mostly built-out, with only 117.69
acres (1.74 percent) of vacant land remaining. Existing land uses within the City include 24,705
dwelling units and 18,014,425 square feet of non-residential uses. Single-family residential uses
represent the largest land use within the City at 34.34 percent. Multiple-family residential uses
comprise 7.51 percent, commercial uses comprise 8.25 percent, and industrial uses comprise
11.05 percent of the City. Smaller percentages of the City include office, flood control, public
use, lake, open space, railroad, school, tourist entertainment, utility, and right-of-way; refer to

2.3.1       Specific Plans
In general, specific plans are designated to implement General Plan goals and policies by
designating land uses, densities, and development and design standards in more specific detail.
This is accomplished by designating specific locations and intensities for land uses, and specific
development standards and design guidelines. A specific plan is able to address smaller areas that
have unique qualities and require focused planning attention. A specific plan may be designed to
implement any element of a General Plan.
A specific plan is a comprehensive planning and implementation tool of the General Plan.
Currently, there are three adopted specific plans within the City of Buena Park. For each of these
designated areas, development and land use are regulated by the respective specific plans.
BEACH BOULEVARD ENTERTAINMENT CORRIDOR SPECIFIC PLAN (ECSP)
The Beach Boulevard Entertainment Corridor Specific Plan encompasses approximately 147
acres located along Beach Boulevard (Highway 39), roughly between Orangethorpe and La Palma
Avenues. The Specific Plan was adopted in August 1987, was updated in January 2000, and
amended in August 2008. This plan is a comprehensive and cohesive planning guide and
implementation tool, providing a strategy for responsible economic growth and a superior
physical image for the Beach Boulevard Entertainment Corridor. It was formulated in response
to the area’s unique conditions and opportunities as a tourist/commercial area. The land use
designation in the area is Tourist Entertainment. The current General Plan allows for tourist
entertainment uses with a FAR of 2.5.
AUTO CENTER SPECIFIC PLAN (ACSP)
The Auto Center Specific Plan, amended in October 2010, encourages a concentration of auto
dealers in Buena Park, primarily along the Interstate 5 Freeway (I-5) and Auto Center Drive. The
Specific Plan comprises approximately 131 acres including Commercial and Commercial Services
land use designations.
BEACH AND ORANGETHORPE MIXED-USE SPECIFIC PLAN (BOMUSP)
The Beach and Orangethorpe Mixed-Use Specific Plan encompasses approximately 12.75 acres,
located on the northeast corner of Beach Boulevard and Orangethorpe Avenue. The Specific
Plan, adopted in 2008, allows for a mixed-use development with a maximum of 1,000 dwelling
units, 355,000 square feet of retail space, 195,000 square feet of office space, a 300-room hotel,
and 350,000 square feet of open area amenities.
                                                                                               2-3

2.3.2         Redevelopment Areas
Adoption of redevelopment plans by cities is allowed by the State Legislature under the
Community Redevelopment Law of the State of California. Redevelopment plans are intended to
revitalize and rehabilitate blighted areas. Government assistance is provided initially with the
intent to encourage private investment. Because redevelopment projects must be in
conformance with the General Plan, these plans are one of the more powerful means cities have
to implement the goals and policies set forth in their General Plan.
The City of Buena Park
Community         Redevelopment
Agency was formed in 1972 to
rehabilitate     and    revitalize
blighted and deteriorated areas
in         the       Consolidated
Redevelopment Project Area.
The Project Area is 3,940 acres
in size and is comprised of four
project areas that were merged
in May 2002 by adoption of
Ordinance         No.       1422.
Amendment 2007 created the
Merged,         Amended,      and
Restated Redevelopment Plan
(Amended         Plan),    which
incorporates the provisions of
the      redevelopment      plans
previously adopted for the
Consolidated Project Area.
The Amended Plan establishes a
process and framework for
implementation. The Amended
Plan also establishes several
goals       for    redevelopment
activities       within        the
Consolidated Project Area.

2.4          LAND USE PLAN
2.4.1        Overview of Land Use Plan
The graphic description of the City of Buena Park’s official policy relative to land use is presented
on Exhibit LU-1, General Plan Land Use Map. This diagram illustrates the general location and
distribution of various land uses in Buena Park. The majority of change and growth associated
with the General Plan is anticipated to occur over an assumed 25-year period primarily within
the identified Focus Areas; refer to Exhibit LU-2, Focus Areas.
2.4.2        Focus Areas
The City has identified key areas for policy focus. These are areas that the City anticipates will
have the highest likelihood of change through redevelopment and new development over the life
of the General Plan. These Focus Areas have unique characteristics or opportunities that are
addressed in the General Plan’s policies. New and revised Land Use Designations included in this
General Plan occur only within ten Focus Areas identified in this General Plan.
       Central Buena Park                                      Civic Center
       Orangethorpe Corridor East                              Commonwealth Corridor
       Orangethorpe Corridor West                              North Beach Commercial

Note: The 2035 buildout projections assume full utilization of land to the maximum potential allowed by the General Plan policy. It is understood that
        the assumed buildout projections may not be fully realized during the life of the General Plan. The total acreage does not include the acreage
        associated with roadways/freeways.

2.5         GENERAL PLAN LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
State law requires the Land Use Element to identify a quantifiable measure of residential densities
and non-residential building intensities allowed in the City. General Plan Land Use Designations
descriptions are supplemented by a quantification of the type and intensity of development
allowed in each Land Use Designation. While terms like “residential,” “commercial” and
“industrial” are generally understood, State law requires a clear and concise description of each
land use depicted on the General Plan Land Use Map (Exhibit LU-1) found in this Element.
2.5.1       Residential Density
The term “density” in a land use context is a
measure of the desired population or residential
development capacity of the land. Residential
density is described in terms of dwelling units per
gross acre (du/ac). Thus, the density of a
residential development of 2.0 dwelling units
occupying 1.0 gross acre of land is 2.0 dwelling
units per acre (du/ac). A dwelling unit is a
building or a portion of a building used for human
habitation and may vary considerably in size, from
small apartments to large single-family homes. Residential acreage is defined as the area
developed for residential use, exclusive of local serving streets, alleys, or arterials.
BASE LAND USE DENSITY
The base land use density refers to the maximum number of units per acre permitted under the
corresponding zoning district. The base densities for the Low Density Residential category is a
maximum of 7.2 units per acre. The base densities for the Medium Density Residential and High
Density Residential categories are 10 units per acre and 20 units per acre, respectively.
SITE AREA BONUS
The City promotes the assembly of parcels to encourage larger multiple-family developments. In
areas designated Medium Density Residential, up to six additional units per acre (over the
number permitted by the base land use density) may be granted as a site assembly bonus. The
site area bonus for the High Density Residential category is four additional units per acre.
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY BONUS
The City provides for the development of affordable housing for lower-income households
through its affordable housing density bonus program in accordance with State law. The specific
provisions of the affordable housing density bonus program are outlined in the City’s Municipal
Code. When utilizing the affordable housing density bonus program, the allowable density is
increased by up to 100 percent for senior housing and 35 percent for non-senior housing,
consistent with State density bonus law, as amended.
                                                                                               2-11

HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES OVERLAY
To provide for affordable housing opportunities consistent with the City’s identified remaining
housing growth need in the Housing Element and AB 2348, the 2035 General Plan includes a
Housing Opportunities Overlay designation. Target sites to increase affordable housing
opportunities are included in the overlay. The base density for the overlay designation is 30
du/ac.
2.5.2       Non-Residential “Intensity”
The term “intensity” refers to the degree of non-residential development based on building
characteristics such as height, bulk, floor area ratio, and percentage of lot coverage. Floor Area
Ratio (FAR) is a common expression of non-residential land use intensity. The FAR is calculated
by dividing the total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot by the total area of that lot. For
example, a building with a gross floor area of 5,000 square feet on a 10,000 square foot lot would
have an FAR of 0.5 while a building with 20,000 square feet of floor area on the same lot would
yield an FAR of 2.0. Higher FARs generally indicate larger amounts of building square footage
and/or increased building heights.
Allowing all parcels to be developed to the maximum FAR or density allowed is not the intention
of this General Plan. The intention is to reflect a maximum development envelope or density
range under appropriate conditions, and in accordance with applicable detailed zoning
regulations found within the City’s Municipal Code and other applicable regulatory documents.
There are many factors that may limit, or affect a development’s ability to achieve the maximum
density or FAR on a specific parcel, resulting from the parcel’s physical limitations, the City’s
zoning standards, and how a owner/developer chooses to address the function and design of the
development. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:
       Parcel size and configuration;
       Height limits;
       Lot coverage allowed;
2-12

       Requirements for setbacks, landscaping amenities, and open space;
       Development standards and design guidelines;
       Type of parking provided (surface, below-grade, or structured);
       Adjacency to sensitive land uses, such as single-family neighborhoods; and/or
       Location in regards to proximity to airport and flight patterns.
2.5.3        Residential Land Use Designations
Residential land use is classified into three categories, which
begin with low density, single-family residential and then
continue through residential areas of increasing density.
Residential land use density is calculated on the basis of net
acres (i.e., only land occupied for dwelling purposes is
measured; streets and other public facilities are not
included).
LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL
The Low Density Residential designation provides for                      Low Density Residential
single-family detached homes on individual lots. The
typical lot size for this category is 6,000 square feet, though larger lot and estate development is
also included in this residential category. Future development within the Low Density
Residential designation should maintain and enhance the existing neighborhood character and be
configured as a single unit on a parcel. The designation also allows for compatible uses such as
neighborhood parks, schools, and other small-scale civic or institutional uses.
The base development density standard is up to 7.2 du/ac. Densities up to 14.4 du/ac are allowed
with an Affordable Senior Housing Bonus and densities up to 9.0 du/ac are allowed with an
Affordable Housing Bonus.
MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL
The Medium Density Residential designation provides for
single-family attached housing and smaller scale multi-
family housing. The designation is a transition between
detached single-family areas and higher-density multiple
family areas and includes duplexes, triplexes,
condominiums, and apartments.
The base development density standard is a maximum of
10 du/ac. Densities up to 16 du/ac are allowed with the
Site Area Bonus. The development intensity may be
increased from 20 to 30 du/ac with the application of the
Affordable Senior Housing Bonus and 12.5 to 20 du/ac                    Medium Density Residential
with the application of the Affordable Housing Bonus.
                                                                                                   2-13

HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL
Development in the High Density Residential designation
is characterized by condominium and apartment
development. Development at this density requires
consideration of internal and external circulation, the
relationship of buildings and units to each other, and the
provision of common open space and private outdoor
living areas.
The base density standard for the High Density
Residential designation is 20 du/ac. The density standard
may increase to 24 du/ac with the application of the Site
Area Bonus. The Affordable Housing Area Bonus may                   High Density Residential
further increase the density to 30 du/ac and the
Affordable Senior Housing Area Bonus may increase the
density to 48 du/ac.
2.5.4       Mixed-Use Land Use Designations
There are five mixed-use land use designations included in the
Land Use and Community Design Element. These designations
provide for a horizontal or vertical mix of uses. Three of the
designations provide for a mix of residential and non-residential
uses and utilize both residential density and non-residential
intensity standards. These standards are intended to be applied
separately from one another. In other words, a mixed-use
designation that allows a base density of 30 du/ac and an intensity
of 1.0 FAR allows for development of residential units at 30 du/ac
on the same site with 1.0 FAR non-residential development. There
is no equivalency calculation required.
GENERAL MIXED-USE
This designation provides for a horizontal or vertical
mix of high-density residential and neighborhood
commercial uses along major arterials. Floor area
ratios up to 1.0 are permitted and the base density is
32 units per acre.
CENTRAL BUENA PARK MIXED-USE
The Central Buena Park Mixed-Use Designation
encourages the addition of higher-density residential
and/or office uses above existing commercial and
office uses in a pedestrian-friendly setting that                   General Mixed-Use
respects the adjacent residential uses. Floor area
ratios up to 1.0 are permitted and the base density is 45 du/ac.
2-14
ENTERTAINMENT MIXED-USE
The Entertainment Mixed-Use Designation provides for a mix of higher-density residential,
entertainment and commercial uses that support entertainment and tourism uses within the City.
Floor area ratios up to 3.0 are permitted and the base density is 80 du/ac.
COMMERCIAL OFFICE MIXED-USE
The Commercial Office Mixed-Use Designation encourages the addition of higher-intensity
commercial and office uses within existing commercial and industrial areas. Floor area ratios up
to 0.5 are permitted.
                                                    Left to Right:
              Central Buena Park Mixed-Use, Entertainment Mixed-Use, and Commercial Office Mixed-Use
BEACH AND ORANGETHORPE MIXED-USE SPECIFIC PLAN
The Beach and Orangethorpe Specific Plan supports a
world class mixed-use development comprised of
commercial retail, full service hotel, office, and multiple-
family units in high-rise buildings with multi-level
parking that is unique and distinctive from conventional
land use patterns of independent and unrelated activities.
The amount of potential development in this area is
defined in the Specific Plan.
                                                                            Beach and Orangethorpe Mixed-Use
2.5.5       Commercial Land Use Designations
Land use designations in this category apply to most of the established commercial districts in the
City. The types of development included in the commercial land use designations consist of
freestanding commercial development and smaller neighborhood or community retail centers
located along major roadways, with the exception of strip commercial development. There are
three commercial land use designations provided in the Land Use and Community Design
Element. The development intensity standards for the commercial land use designations are
defined using a floor area ratio (FAR) standard discussed previously.
                                                                                                             2-15
COMMERCIAL
This land use category includes a wide range of general
commercial land uses characterized by convenience,
neighborhood, and community shopping centers, as well
as freestanding and highway commercial uses, which
may include grocery stores, drug stores, convenience
stores, a wide variety of retail stores and services,
restaurants and specialized food stores, gas stations, and
offices. Floor area ratios of up to 0.3 are permitted.
                                                                 Commercial
OFFICE PROFESSIONAL
This land use designation provides for offices for
professional, medical, and business purposes and limited
retail sales and services that serve those businesses. The
Office Professional designation is used to specify
particular locations within the City where office uses are
more desirable compared to other types of general
commercial development. This designation does not
preclude the placement of office uses in other areas
where they are permitted under the General Plan,
Specific Plans and Zoning. Floor area ratios of up to 1.0   Office Professional
are permitted.
TOURIST ENTERTAINMENT
The General Plan provides for a land use category that
focuses on the entertainment and tourist-related land
uses that are unique to Buena Park. This land use
designation includes areas of the City which provide
tourist and entertainment-related services and
supporting retail and service uses. Floor area ratios of
up to 2.5 are permitted.
                                                           Tourist Entertainment
2-16
2.5.6       Industrial Land Use Designations
The Land Use Plan provides for continuation of industrial land uses and development in the City
which range from small light industrial uses to large scale, heavy industrial operations. Three
designations occur in this land use category.
OFFICE MANUFACTURING
This designation provides for seamless integration of
office and manufacturing uses with supportive single-
purpose retail uses. Development may occur in the form
of business parks with campus-style layouts or single
tenant, stand-alone layouts with individual tenants.
Manufacturing uses are intended to be low impact and
compatible with office uses. Floor area ratios up to 1.5
are allowed.                                                          Office Manufacturing
LIGHT INDUSTRIAL
Industrial and manufacturing activities included in the
Light Industrial designation may range from business
parks to smaller multi-tenant developments. Other light
industrial activities may include contractor’s yards,
research and development, limited light manufacturing,
warehousing, distribution, assembly, and laboratories.
Limited retail and offices affiliated with the primary
industrial and manufacturing activities are allowed. Floor
area ratios up to 0.6 are allowed.
                                                                           Light Industrial
INDUSTRIAL
This land use designation is reserved for larger, more
intensive      activities     involving      manufacturing,
warehousing, and/or distribution. Land designated as
industrial is mostly confined to an area west of Knott
Avenue and north of Orangethorpe Avenue. The
applicable floor area ratio for the Industrial designation is
1.0.
                                                                           Industrial
                                                                                            2-17

2.5.7        Open Space Land Use Designation
The Open Space designation assumes that land so
designated will remain as open space for recreational uses
or for purposes of conservation and/or safety. The area of
Buena Park designated as Open Space include the City’s
parks, the Ralph B. Clark Regional Park, open space land
dedicated as part of development agreements, open space
land included within the Los Coyotes Country Club, a
number of utility easements, storm drain channels, and
freeway rights-of-way.
2.5.8        Planned Development Land Use                                    Open Space
             Designation
The Planned Development designation provides for land uses and development standards to be
tailored to individual sites. This land use designation assumes that a master plan will be prepared
for each area so designated. The master plan must discuss development phasing, development
intensities, amenities, design, and how the development is going to conform with the principles
and policies included in the General Plan. It is intended to preclude incremental development
which may be detrimental to the whole.
Table LU-5, General Plan Land Use Summary, summarizes the allowable density/intensity by land
use designation.
2.6          GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING RELATIONSHIP
Table LU-6, Relationship of Zoning Districts to General Plan Land Use Designations, shows the
relationship between the General Plan land use designations and the intended implementation of
zoning districts. This table indicates how properties should be zoned to be consistent with the
General Plan Land Use Map.

2.7           FOCUS AREA VISION AND URBAN FORM
Districts are areas of the City that have a certain identifiable character due to land use,
neighborhood design, architecture, streetscape, etc. A district has common characteristics that
make it unique from the larger urban area. The principal districts in Buena Park are the Focus
Areas, previously identified. Refer to Exhibit LU-2 for the location of the Focus Areas. For each
Focus Area, the distinct vision and desired urban form for each of the 10 districts or focus areas is
described in this section. Architectural design guidance for each focus area can be found in
Section 2.8, Building Typologies, while streetscape design guidance for major streets in the focus
areas can be found in Section 2.9, Public Realm Design. Combined, Sections 2.4, 2.5, 2.7, 2.8 and
2.9 of the General Plan are intended to serve as building blocks for the development of a form-
based code.
  What is a Form-Based Code?
  Form-based codes foster predictable built results and a high-quality public realm by using physical form
  (rather than separation of uses) as the organizing principle for the code. These codes are adopted into city
  law as regulations, not mere guidelines. Form-based codes are an alternative to conventional zoning. Form-
  based codes commonly include the following elements:
          Regulating Plan. A plan or map of the regulated area designating the locations where different
           building form standards apply, based on clear community intentions regarding the physical
           character of the area being code.

2.7.1        Central Buena Park Focus Area
The Central Buena Park Focus Area historically represents the commercial heart of the City and
is located along Beach Boulevard, a major arterial. Existing uses in the area include smaller-scale
commercial and office uses along Beach Boulevard and low-density residential uses to the east
and west of Beach Boulevard. There are a number of non-conforming uses in the area. The
development pattern includes small parcels and alleys that are unique to Central Buena Park.
Central Buena Park has a number of opportunities to integrate housing with retail and other job-
creating uses.
The Central Buena Park Focus Area is envisioned as a complementary mix of retail, high-density
residential, and office providing local residents the opportunity to shop, work, and live in the
historical heart of Buena Park. Central Buena Park shall provide an enhanced pedestrian-friendly
environment, with a variety of amenities such as wide sidewalks, outdoor dining, public plazas,
and other features to establish a vitalized environment during daytime and evening hours.
Specific design characteristics include:
       Ground Floor Retail and Dining with                 Public Gathering Spaces

2.7.2         Orangethorpe Corridor East Focus Area
The Orangethorpe Corridor East Focus Area is a key entry area to the City. The Focus Area is
centered on Orangethorpe Boulevard at the intersection of the I-5 and SR-91 freeways. Its
proximity to the freeways provides high visibility from regional circulation routes. The Focus
Area is generally characterized by underutilized industrial buildings. Included in the Focus Area
is the former City Yard. There are a number of opportunities for streetscape and design
enhancements.
The Orangethorpe Corridor East Focus Area is envisioned as the eastern gateway into the City.
The focus area shall establish a thriving manufacturing and office center with a regional draw. A
unified streetscape invites the pedestrian from the City entry into the Entertainment Corridor
North. Mixed-use development complements existing single-family residential areas by
providing local neighborhood services. Key design and form characteristics include:
         Mixed-Use Ground Floor Retail with Residential Units Above

2.7.3       Orangethorpe Corridor West Focus Area
The Orangethorpe Corridor West Focus Area includes areas north and south of Orangethorpe
Boulevard, generally between Pelican Drive and Western Avenue. While this is a major corridor
transversing Buena Park, many of the strip commercial and light industrial sites in this Focus
Area are underutilized and there is a non-cohesive mix of land uses. There is a need to buffer the
adjacent residential uses from the light industrial uses in the Focus Area. There are also a
number of opportunities to improve the visual quality of the area through streetscape
improvements.
The Orangethorpe Corridor West Focus Area is envisioned as a commercial, office, and
manufacturing business node. Establishment of a unified streetscape with landscaping,
sidewalks, and street furniture will provide for an attractive place to work or visit. High-density
residential uses adjacent to the Orangethorpe Corridor will complement adjacent lower-density
residential uses and provide a transition from commercial to residential uses. Office and light
manufacturing uses west of Knott Avenue will encourage additional job opportunities along the
Corridor. Key character defining features include:
      Integrated open space
      Mix of residential densities
      Attractive office, commercial and light industrial architecture
      Minimal or no parking lots fronting Orangethorpe

   2.7.4        Entertainment Corridor Focus Area
   The Entertainment Corridor Focus Area is the primary tourist-oriented area within the City and
   includes Knott’s Berry Farm and Soak City, Medieval Times, Pirates Dinner Adventure, and the
   Buena Park Mall. The Entertainment Corridor Focus Area is generally located along Beach
   Boulevard and is the major City gateway from the south. Expanding tourism is a priority for the
   City. Opportunities for improvements in this area include improving connectivity between the
   Buena Park Mall and Knott’s Berry Farm, as well as maximizing utilization of the Mall property.
   The Entertainment Corridor is envisioned as a pedestrian-friendly and tourist-oriented
   destination that connects Knott’s Berry Farm to the Mall and other visitor serving uses along
   Beach Boulevard. The mix of entertainment, world-class shopping, excellent dining, and civic
   spaces are envisioned to create a regional destination where visitors can patronize local
   attractions without leaving the Entertainment Corridor. With uses that attract both residents
   and visitors, the Entertainment Corridor is considered the “heart” of the City. Unique urban
   design features, including landscaping, streetscape, and signage enhancements along Beach
   Boulevard provide the area character and identity.

2.7.5       Entertainment Corridor North Focus Area
The Entertainment Corridor North Focus Area is located along Beach Boulevard, north of the 91
Freeway. Its location between the I-5 and SR-91 Freeways provides access and regional draw
opportunities. The area is currently transitioning into a higher-density entertainment center and
a number of hotel and visitor-serving uses support the entertainment core to the south. The
Beach/Orangethorpe Mixed-Use Specific Plan sets precedent for change in this Focus Area.
The Entertainment Corridor North Focus Area is envisioned as a “world-class” entertainment
mixed-use center that functions as a central gathering place for residents and visitors.

2.7.6        Northwest Focus Area
The Northwest Focus Area is located in the northwest corner of the City, adjacent to Valley View
Avenue. A number of existing manufacturing uses in the area are in transition. Orangethorpe
Avenue at Valley View Street is the west entry into the City. The area is influenced by higher
density office development located west of Valley View Avenue in the City of La Palma. The
focus area generally consists of large parcels with opportunities for increased utilization and
intensification of a range of uses.
The Northwest Focus Area is the center of industrial employment in the City. As larger
warehousing becomes obsolete, the area is envisioned as transforming to more viable office and
manufacturing uses. As underutilized warehousing buildings transform into viable research and
office spaces, limited supportive retail development will be encouraged. Well-integrated dining
and service oriented retail will help create the Northwest Focus Area as an ideal place to work.

2.9         PUBLIC REALM DESIGN
A City’s physical identity is clear if people can readily perceive it in images that differentiate it
from surrounding communities. Buena Park can differentiate itself as a unique place with a
desirable quality of life, in part, through an enhanced public realm.
2.9.1       Gateways
Gateways are significant points of entry
into a community – the community’s
doorstep. They help shape identity and
provide a clear sense of boundaries.
Because they often provide the first
impression of a community or area,
gateways     represent       an     important
opportunity to convey a positive and
lasting image. They are excellent places
for welcome signs, special landscaping
treatments or public art.               Private
development at gateway locations should
be attractive and well maintained. There
are two types of gateways identified in
Buena Park. “City Gateways” function as                            City Gateway Signage (Primary)
focal points of identity between Buena
Park and adjacent cities. “District Gateways” function as focal points of identity at the transitions
into special districts or areas in the City (such as focus areas). Exhibit LU-3, Buena Park
Gateways, identifies the locations of both types of gateways and provides a hierarchy of
significance. Primary are the most prominent gateways. Secondary and tertiary gateways, while
still important, are not as significant and may be at points where there is less vehicular and/or
pedestrian traffic.

2.9.2        Streetscape
Buena Park’s streetscape—the view from the road—is a powerful and immediate indicator of the
community’s image. The view from the road consists of many elements installed in public rights
of way, including trees, landscaping in parkways and medians, street furniture (benches, trash
receptacles, etc.) lighting, and utilities. Exhibit LU-4, Streetscape Improvement Corridors,
identifies the priority corridors for streetscape improvements within the City.
                                                        For many people who pass through Buena
                                                        Park, but are not residents, the view from
                                                        the road (or potentially even from a
                                                        bikeway) is often their primary impression
                                                        of the City. For residents, the quality of the
                                                        street environment has a more direct impact
                                                        on their daily lives. Roads are a valuable
                                                        public space asset and should be treated as
                                                        such. People are touched daily by the
                                                        quality, or lack thereof, that the streetscape
                                                        presents. Additionally, the quality of the
                                                        street environment affects property values
throughout the City and sets a tone for special districts.
Physical features within the public right-of-way are controlled by the City, including their design,
installation, and maintenance. This is an important responsibility considering how the quality of
the street environment affects the City’s image. Great care should be exercised in the evaluation
of streetscape elements in terms of their aesthetic appeal and contribution to a positive
community image and identify of focus areas.
This section looks at the City’s streetscape image from the public realm—what people see from
the street and sidewalk that is located in the public right-of-way. The following provides a
description of the some of the various elements that comprise a vibrant public street
environment. Recommended street sections that showcase the various elements for prominent
corridors are included on pages 2-80 and 2-81.
STREET TREES
Street trees humanize the otherwise hard edge
of the urban street environment. They help
unify and identify an area, enhancing the
public environment by creating comfortable
outdoor spaces, shade for pedestrians, energy
conservation benefits, spatial definition, traffic
calming and focal breaks in streetscape
monotony. They also contribute to fresher air
and reduce reflected heat from buildings and
pavement.                                            Street trees are essential to highlighting a unique identity
                                                         and creating a comfortable walking environment.
2-76

The visual characteristics of street trees are important in their selection. Trees can be effective in
strengthening the City’s form by emphasizing major roadways and important districts, and by
identifying neighborhoods and gateways. Street trees should be chosen based on the scale and
importance of the roadway. Generally, larger trees are used for major roadways and smaller,
pedestrian-scale trees are used within neighborhoods. Trees are also chosen for their water
conserving, drought resistance, and maintenance qualities.
In neighborhoods, broad spreading, deciduous trees are preferable. These trees create an
attractive canopy and provide shade in the summer while admitting sun in the winter. In
commercial districts, it is important that street trees be both deciduous and evergreen, and
provide a canopy that does not obscure business signage. Industrial districts are the most flexible
in terms of compatible varieties.
                                     Medians can serve as both aesthetic and safety
                                    elements in Buena Park’s primary and secondary
                                                      corridors.
MEDIANS
Landscaped medians serve many different functions. Medians help distinguish the City’s most
significant circulation routes and gateways and contribute to the City’s image. Overall, medians
can make streets more attractive and motorists more comfortable by reducing the perceived road
width. Medians also increase safety by separating oncoming cars and offering pedestrian refuge
areas where appropriate.

STREET FURNISHINGS
Street “furniture” consists of the hardware items typically found along sidewalks for the
convenience of the pedestrian and transit user. Items of street furniture include benches, trash
receptacles, drinking fountains, bus shelters, shade structures, newspaper racks, information
kiosks, and similar items aimed at creating a friendly, functional and aesthetically pleasing
environment for pedestrians. The selection and appropriate placement of street furnishings,
including special paving plays an important role in establishing a quality street environment and
should strengthen the identity of the City and/or special district.
                                                                                                  2-77

                                              Streetscape furniture and materials can contribute to the distinct
                                                        character of the City and its special districts.
PUBLIC ART
Public art can capture the aspirations of the community and express the City’s cultural and social
heritage. Because of this, works of art in public places can contribute significantly to Buena
Park’s identity. Public art can stimulate creativity and imagination while adding a unique human
dimension to the outdoor environment. Opportunities for public art in Buena Park include
street furniture, infrastructure, signage, and freestanding art in public spaces or large open space.
                     Public art can help develop a strong sense of place that is uniquely “Buena Park”.

Ingredients of an Attractive, Pedestrian-Friendly Street
While not all Buena Park streets and corridors can be designed exclusively for the pedestrian,
including the following streetscape considerations should be evaluated in an effort to develop
streets that respect and support pedestrians.
                           Separate Zones for Pedestrians and Automobiles
                          Buffer between Pedestrians and Moving Vehicles
                                   Pedestrian Amenities and Comfort
                                    Frequent, Safe Pedestrian Crossings
                            Active Storefronts and Dining Along Sidewalks
                                                                                             2-79

2.10       PRINCIPLES, GOALS, AND POLICIES
PRINCIPLE:    BALANCING COMMUNITY CHANGE WITH THE EXISTING ENVIRONMENT
The principle of balancing community change with the existing environment is of great
importance to the City of Buena Park. As Buena Park is a built-out community, change will
occur on previously developed land. Therefore, this will require a strong connection in the
relationship between future development and existing development. Future change should
acknowledge the City’s existing built and natural environment as well as provide a means to
harmonize future needs with existing needs.
Goal LU-1:        A complementary balance of land uses throughout the
                  community.
                  Policy LU-1.1:     Establish land use policies that encourage a balance of jobs
                                     and housing in Buena Park.
                  Policy LU-1.2:     Ensure future development provides for a variety of
                                     commercial, industry, and housing that serve the spectrum
                                     of incomes within the region.
                  Policy LU-1.3:     Establish a wide range of residential density and non-
                                     residential intensities to encourage a wide range of
                                     development opportunities.
                  Policy LU-1.4:     Provide for the development of complementary land uses,
                                     such as open space, recreation, and civic/service uses for all
                                     future residential and non-residential development.
                  Policy LU-1.5:     Encourage the establishment of high-end retail and
                                     restaurants within the City.
Goal LU-2:        Integration of open space resources with existing and future
                  land uses.
                  Policy LU-2.1:     Preserve public and private open space for active and
                                     passive recreational opportunities to enhance connectivity
                                     with neighborhoods.
                  Policy LU-2.2:     Seek opportunities to improve and enhance Buena Park
                                     flood control facilities to protect the public health, safety,
                                     and welfare, while providing additional opportunities to
                                     connect various land uses throughout the City.

                                     properties for open space and recreational opportunities for
                                     local residents.
                    Policy LU-2.4:   Seek opportunities to expand the use of easements for
                                     walking, biking, and recreation to enhance connectivity
                                     between a variety of land uses.
Goal LU-3:          Effective management of growth and change.
                    Policy LU-3.1:   Ensure that development activities acknowledge the
                                     protection and enhancement of quality of life in the City’s
                                     neighborhoods.
                    Policy LU-3.2:   Ensure environmental and fiscal impacts are evaluated to
                                     minimize impacts to the physical environment and fiscal
                                     obligations of the City.
                    Policy LU-3.3:   Ensure land use decisions           consider   impacts    to
                                     infrastructure and service needs.
PRINCIPLE:      NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION THROUGH FOCUSED DEVELOPMENT
The City of Buena Park values its existing neighborhoods. Therefore, growth and change must
respect the value of existing neighborhoods and provide opportunities for growth that consider
neighborhood integrity. A policy establishing nodes of focused urban growth within Focus Areas
will ensure existing neighborhood integrity.
Goal LU-4:          Higher-density and intensity of development in designated
                    focus areas.
                    Policy LU-4.1:   Identify specific focus areas for transition and change to
                                     provide explicit policy guidance for land use, site and
                                     building design, and development in these areas.
                    Policy LU-4.2:   Ensure future development addresses the preservation and
                                     enhancement of existing single-family neighborhoods when
                                     adjacent to areas of anticipated growth.
                    Policy LU-4.3:   Promote the clustering of development adjacent to
                                     transportation facilities including amenities to encourage
                                     transportation and service nodes.
                                                                                             2-83

PRINCIPLE:    RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
Residential development is the primary land use in the City of Buena Park. Policies and
programs in the Land Use Element should be consistent with the Housing Element, which is
updated more frequently pursuant to state law.
Goal LU-5:        Compliance with state and regional housing mandates.
                  Policy LU-5.1:    Ensure Buena Park is in compliance with applicable state
                                    and regional housing mandates.
                  Policy LU-5.2:    Provide for required monitoring of residential development
                                    activity.
                  Policy LU-5.3:    Provide for monitoring of state housing legislation to
                                    ensure City compliance or to ensure the City’s interest is
                                    represented.
Goal LU-6:        A housing stock that meets the diverse needs of Buena Park’s
                  existing and future residents.
                  Policy LU-6.1:    Provide for housing opportunities that address the needs of
                                    those who currently live or desire to live in Buena Park.
                  Policy LU-6.2:    Preserve and enhance existing, viable single-family
                                    residential neighborhoods by prohibiting the intrusion of
                                    incompatible uses.
                  Policy LU-6.3:    Locate affordable housing adjacent to jobs, retail, schools,
                                    open space, and public transportation.
                  Policy LU-6.4:    Monitor the housing needs of the existing and future labor
                                    force and engage the business community to attract
                                    employees and new businesses to Buena Park.
                  Policy LU-6.5:    Encourage integration of residential uses within mixed-use
                                    development.
                  Policy LU-6.6:    Provide a wide range of housing options for Buena Park
                                    residents, including owner and rental housing adjacent to
                                    jobs, shopping, and transit.

                                         single-family housing.
                     Policy LU-7.3:      Encourage home ownership.
Goal LU-8:           Affordable housing supply in the City is maintained.
                     Policy LU-8.1:      Encourage a variety of creative methods for supplying
                                         affordable housing.
PRINCIPLE:       INDUSTRIAL AND MANUFACTURING USES
Industrial and manufacturing uses have experienced significant change due to innovation,
market competition, and regional factors such as land values and changes in regional logistics.
Therefore, the City acknowledges that future land use policy should respond to a rapidly
changing marketplace by providing flexible, market-responsive land use policy that maximizes
the City’s ability to capture jobs for the local workforce.
Goal LU-9:           Promotion of quality industrial development that provides
                     local employment opportunities.
                     Policy LU-9.1:      Support redevelopment and transition of obsolete
                                         industrial and manufacturing sites for commercial, flex-
                                         tech, and/or mixed-use development, reflective of current
                                         market demand.
                     Policy LU-9.2:      Promote quality design and development practices that
                                         reduce environmental impacts.
                     Policy LU-9.3:      Encourage the consolidation of smaller industrial
                                         properties and the cooperation of individual property
                                         owners in order to provide opportunities for larger,
                                         integrated development, including reconfiguration of
                                         public streets where possible and appropriate, reducing
                                         fragmentation of design, access, circulation, parking, and
                                         signage within industrial areas of the City.
                     Policy LU-9.4:      Discourage additional disaggregation of larger industrial

 PRINCIPLE:    COMMERCIAL AND JOB-CREATING USES
 A robust and diverse economy will increase the need for retail, office, and other job-creating
 uses that employ the local population and provide access to needed services. The City places
 strong emphasis on its ability to attract new commercial uses and promote the expansion of
 existing commercial uses.
Goal LU-11:      Existing commercial areas that are preserved and enhanced

Strip Commercial Centers
  Strip commercial centers became very prominent throughout the United States as
  popularity of the automobile grew. With auto-independence, suburban neighborhoods
  had the ability to develop on the outskirts of a community. Major arterial thoroughfares
  lined with strip commercial uses provided the connection between residential suburbs and
  job centers located in a downtown district.
  Strip commercial centers are clusters of small retail and/or office uses isolated from other
  uses along a major corridor. Their low-intensity development pattern results in single-
  story stores typically located at the rear of the property. Strip commercial is typically
  characterized by mundane building and site design and configuration, as well as minimal
  landscaping. Often, the scale of strip commercial centers is intended for customers seeking
  the goods or services of only one store, resulting in more total number of parking spaces
  needed along the entire strip than if parking were shared by a mix of uses. Major surface
  parking lots are generally located between the stores and the street-edge, reducing
  pedestrian and bicycle accessibility. Due to their vehicular-oriented characteristics, strip
  commercial centers have a significant number of driveways accessing the arterial that
  intersect with sidewalks. Their configuration also tends to provide few pedestrian
  connections to surrounding residential neighborhoods.
                                                AUTO-ORIENTED CHARACTERISTICS
                                                                                               2-87

                                     new automobile dealerships to locate within the Auto

                                   amenities.
 PRINCIPLE:    COMMUNITY IDENTITY
 The “view from the road” is one powerful indicator of the City’s image. Opportunities exist to
 improve the City’s street environment and public realm to create and enhance the sense of
 place.
Goal LU-21:      Distinctive and attractive design of the public realm that
                 promotes a positive image and identity.
                 Policy LU-21.1:   Focus on improving the appearance of corridors in the City
                                   by implementing landscaping, enhanced paving, unique
                                   streetscape amenities, appropriately-scaled lighting, and
                                   placement of utility connections underground.
                 Policy LU-21.2:   Support the development of a comprehensive gateway
                                   program, including a hierarchy of entry monuments and
                                   wayfinding signage throughout the City.
                 Policy LU-21.3:   Support landscaping treatments that complement a
                                   comprehensive streetscape program and that maximize
                                   water conservation through plant species and irrigation
                                   techniques.
                 Policy LU-21.4:   Strive to develop a system of key landmarks that contribute
                                   to the character and image of the City, and encourage new
                                   buildings and/or monuments to function as neighborhood
                                   or district markers.
Goal LU-22:      New development and redevelopment that contributes to a
                 positive visual image of the City.
                 Policy LU-22.1:   Support development in focus areas that encourages a mix
                                   of land uses, central gathering spaces, walkable streets,
                                   interesting architecture, and public art.
                 Policy LU-22.2:   Promote good quality design that considers site and
                                   building scale and mass that enhances the experience of
                                   employees and customers.
                                                                                            2-99

                  Policy LU-22.3:    Support the use of form-based codes in special districts and
                                     corridors to ensure that new development and
                                     redevelopment is consistent with the desired identity of the
                                     City.
                  Policy LU-22.4:    Ensure that commercial signs do not detract from the City’s
                                     high-quality image, while recognizing the need for effective
                                     business identification.
                  Policy LU-22.5:    Continue to preserve historically-significant buildings and
                                     neighborhoods.
 PRINCIPLE:    SOCIAL INTERACTION
 The physical character of a City can support or hinder social interaction. Opportunities exist
 in Buena Park to encourage social interaction by improving connectivity between uses,
 providing public gathering areas and spaces, and encouraging pedestrian-oriented
 development.
Goal LU-23:       New development and redevelopment that fosters social
                  interaction, connectivity, and sense of place.
                  Policy LU-23.1:    Encourage connectivity between focus areas, nodes, and
                                     neighborhoods through visually-interesting and logical
                                     networks of paths that provide access for pedestrians,
                                     bicyclists, motorists, and transit patrons.
                  Policy LU-23.2:    Encourage the development of a variety of public gathering
                                     places, such as community centers, mixed-use plazas or
                                     courtyards, and parks and open space, which meet the
                                     needs of residents and visitors.
                  Policy LU-23.3:    Encourage new commercial development and remodeling
                                     of existing commercial buildings to provide maximum
                                     window exposure for passers-by and minimize “blank wall”
                                     exposure.
 PRINCIPLE:    ATTRACTIVE NEIGHBORHOODS
 Neighborhood aesthetics contribute to overall resident satisfaction and community livability.
 Opportunities exist in Buena Park to enhance and protect existing neighborhoods, as well as
 ensure new neighborhoods are well-designed.

Goal LU-24:        Existing and new neighborhoods that are attractive, well-
                   maintained, and promote unique identities.
                   Policy LU-24.1:    Promote public gathering spaces or community centers,
                                      recreational opportunities, and social programs within
                                      existing neighborhoods.
                   Policy LU-24.2:    Continue to emphasize maintenance of the City public
                                      right-of-way, including street resurfacing, landscaping,
                                      lighting, and removal of litter or graffiti.
                   Policy LU-24.3:    Support development and implementation of a uniform
                                      street tree program in residential neighborhoods and main
                                      boulevards that will ultimately provide shade canopies
                                      across roadways and provide inviting and walkable
                                      parkways.
                   Policy LU-24.4:    Encourage homeowners’ associations and neighborhoods
                                      to maintain existing housing tract entrance signs in an
                                      attractive manner and encourage the placement of new
                                      signs at the entrance of developments that do not have
                                      identification.
 PRINCIPLE:     COMMUNITY SAFETY
 The physical design of a project can have a profound effect on public safety by addressing
 potential for associated criminal activity. Projects can enhance user safety through design to
 reduce opportunities for criminal activity.
Goal LU-25:        A safe place to live, work, and play.
                   Policy LU-25.1:    Incorporate public safety considerations into community
                                      design.
                                                                                            2-101
