sidering amendments and revisions, the Town recog-
nizes that the General Plan is a policy document for
the entire community and that it may only be amend-
ed “in the public interest” (Government Code Section
65358). Additionally, amendments must be found
consistent with the goals and policies of the General
Plan, and will be subject to environmental review as
required by the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA).
Regular Updates — Periodic review of the entire Gen-
eral Plan is not required by State law; however, review
of the Housing Element is required every 5 years. In
Windsor, a review of the entire General Plan shall oc-
cur every 5 years to consider substantive new infor-
mation that may trigger new policy direction and to
assess the continuing validity of the General Plan poli-
cies. Such review shall include, but not be limited to
the Housing Element, traffic levels of service (LOS)
and safety, and wastewater treatment, storage and
disposal capacities. The 5-year periodic updates of the
General Plan (or more frequently as deemed necessary
by the Town Council should a public safety concern be
identified through on-going monitoring of this inter-
section) shall assess the traffic level of service (LOS)
during p.m. peak periods at the intersection of Old
Redwood Highway/U.S. 101 Northbound off-
ramps/Lakewood Drive. The General Plan review
may or may not involve major revisions to the Plan.
The review will allow the Town to amend the Plan to
meet unforeseen changes to internal or external condi-
tions, to utilize better information as it becomes avail-
able, and to respond to changes in community values.

c.    To limit the extension of water and/or sewer ser-

      finds, based on substantial evidence in the record
      before it, that the extension is necessary to replace
      failing septic and/or water systems and that the
      capacity of the extension does not exceed that re-
      quired to serve development existing in the area
      receiving the extension as of October 2, 1997.

B.6.1 The Town should encourage higher intensity
uses where they would:
a. provide market support, within a reasonable walk-
    ing distance, for Old Town;
b. take advantage of excellent access to U.S. 101 and
    the Town’s crosstown streets;
c. take maximum advantage of existing and future
    public transit stops, specifically bus and rail service;
    or
d. take advantage of existing and future public uses.
These areas plus other special areas are generally illus-
trated in Figure 4-2.
B.6.2 A diverse range of parcel sizes should be avail-
able to afford existing and future Windsor residents a
choice of lifestyles. New residential development
should emphasize smaller single-family parcels (gen-
erally less than 7,000 square feet) to support walkable
neighborhoods, create more efficient and cost-effective
infrastructure, maximize the use of underutilized par-
cels within the Town, and minimize the loss of open
space.
B.6.3 The Town should create a more balanced com-
munity by supporting new residential and business
opportunities on the west side of U.S. 101, without
compromising the viability of existing businesses on
the east side of U.S. 101. These new uses should be
concentrated within one mile of Old Town to support
the commercial revitalization of this area.
B.6.4 The Town shall assign lands within its Sphere of
Influence a particular use and intensity, based on those
categories presented in Table 4-1, taking into account
the goals and objectives of this Plan, the existing de-
velopment pattern, the availability of community ser-
vices and utilities, the desire to preserve sensitive
natural resources and minimize environmental im-
pacts, and the desire to avoid conditions that may in-
crease risks to public health and safety.               The
assignment of various land use categories is presented
in the Town’s Land Use Plan Map (see Figure 4-3) and
an acreage summary is provided in Table 4-2.

IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
D.1 Level of Service Standards. The Town shall
adopt a level of service standard D for Crosstown
Streets and signalized intersections (except at intersec-
tions noted below). The Town shall recognize that
reducing congestion must be balanced against im-
provement costs and community character concerns.
The standard shall be used for planning new facilities
and for monitoring proposed changes to the General
Plan. A leve of service standard of E shall be adopted
for the intersections of Old Redwood Hwy/U.S. 101
Northbound off-ramps/Lakewood Drive, Old Red-
wood Highway/U.S. 101 Southbound Ramps, and Old
Redwood Highway/Conde Lane/Windsor River
Road. (Planning, Engineering)
D.2 Prioritizing Complete Street Upgrades. The
Town shall conduct a study of the existing street net-
work to identify streets that would benefit from mul-
timodal improvements, including identification of
gaps and barriers in the transportation and transit
networks. Based on findings from the study, the Town
shall prepare and submit recommendations to the
Town Council on a priority list of complete streets im-
provements.
D.3 Utilizing Underutilized Rights-of-Way. The
Town shall conduct a study to identify underused
rights-of-way, such as street lanes, open drainage facil-
ities, and railroad corridors, to convert to bikeways,
pedestrian ways, trails, and/or landscaping improve-
ments. Based on findings from the study, the Town
shall prepare and submit recommendations to the
Town Council on priorities to maximize the use of un-
derused right-of-way for non-motorized facilities or
landscaping improvements.
D.4 Traffic Mitigation Fee. The Town shall contin-
ue to collect Traffic Mitigation Fees from new devel-
opment to finance transportation improvements.
Periodically or when there is a major change in land
use forecasts or infrastructure improvements, the
Town shall review the assumptions and formula used
to derive the traffic mitigation fee and update them as
necessary.(Engineering)

Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
SECTION 4.1                 INTRODUCTION
Purpose of Housing Element
The Housing Element is one of seven General Plan Elements
required by the State of California. Per State Housing Element law,
the document must
         Outline a community’s housing production objectives;
         List policies and implementation programs to achieve local
          housing goals;
         Examine the need for housing resources in a community,
          focusing in particular on special needs populations;
         Identify adequate sites for the production of new housing
          serving various income levels;
         Analyze potential constraints to production; and
         Evaluate the Housing Element for consistency with other
          components of the General Plan.
Updated every eight years, this document serves as the guide for residential development and addressing
housing needs in the Town of Windsor.
General Plan Consistency
The California Government Code requires internal consistency among the various elements of the General
Plan. Section 65300.5 of the Government Code states that the various elements of the General Plan shall
provide an integrated and internally consistent and compatible statement of policy. Upon adoption, this
Housing Element will become part of the Town’s General Plan. The Town is currently (2014) in the process
of preparing a comprehensive update of the General Plan. Town staff has reviewed the other elements of the
2015 General Plan (adopted in 1996 and amended in January 2013) and has determined that this Housing
Element provides consistency with the other elements of the General Plan. Adoption of the new General
Plan may necessitate revisions to the Housing Element to maintain internal consistency. The Town will
maintain this consistency as future General Plan amendments are processed by evaluating proposed
amendments for consistency with all elements of the General Plan, including the Housing Element.
Community Outreach
Recognizing the need and value of public participation in the Housing Element planning process, the
following steps were taken to solicit input from community members and other stakeholders: Advertising of
the meetings included announcements placed on the Town’s website and email notifications and phone calls
to a list of over 70 local stakeholders, including several developers and housing advocate groups. Both
meetings were advertised for two weeks prior to the meeting date on the Town-owned electronic reader
board located on Old Redwood Highway at the 101 northbound off-ramp. Both meetings were also
announced during televised Town Council meetings held prior to the meeting date.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                Page 4-1

Stakeholder Workshop
On June 19, 2014, the Town of Windsor held a Housing Element Stakeholder Meeting from 3:00 pm to 5:00
pm at the Town Hall. At the meeting housing stakeholders heard a presentation about the Town’s Housing
Element Update and discussed housing challenges in Windsor. As described above, over 70 stakeholders
were invited to the meeting; six people attended. The input received at the meeting, which is summarized in
Appendix B, was incorporated into the Housing Element where applicable. The existing policies and
programs were evaluated with the input in mind and new policies and programs we added based on this
input.
Community Workshop
On July 9, 2014, the Town hosted a workshop to engage the community in the planning process. Town staff
and the consultants made a presentation describing housing needs to initiate a discussion on local housing
needs for the community at large and special needs populations. Ten participants discussed housing issues
and offered input on potential policies and programs to address these needs. The input received at the
meeting, which is summarized in Appendix B, was incorporated into the Housing Element where applicable.
The existing policies and programs were evaluated with the input in mind and new policies and programs we
added based on this input.
Planning Commission and Town Council Study Sessions
The Planning Commission and Town Council reviewed the Draft Housing Element in separate study
sessions on August 12, 2014, and September 17, 2014. Both meetings included a public hearing, providing
members of the public opportunity to comment on the Draft Housing Element. The Commission and
Council authorized Town staff to submit the Housing Element to HCD for the State-mandated review.
The Town will continue to make a committed effort to include all economic segments of the community
throughout the revision, adoption, and implementation of the Housing Element.

   and Mobile Home Park Rent Stabilization Ordinance is difficult to quantify, but the two ordinances serve to protect
   mobile homes as a source of affordable housing in the community.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                               Page 4-3

Goal H-1: New Housing Development
                   To provide adequate housing sites and encourage the availability of housing types for all
 GOAL H-1          economic segments of the community.
Policies
1.1     The Town shall ensure that sufficient land is available to accommodate Windsor’s share of regional
        housing needs, including land needed to accommodate extremely low-, very low-, low-, and
        moderate-income housing.
1.2     The Town shall encourage development of a range of housing types affordable to various income
        groups, including single family and multifamily dwellings, “move-up” housing, senior housing,
        secondary and other smaller units, and special needs housing.
1.3     The Town shall facilitate the construction of units affordable to extremely low-, very low-, low-, and
        moderate-income households.
1.4     The Town shall strive to ensure new housing is provided to meet the needs of the local workforce
        that work and serve the community (e.g., teachers, police officers, fire fighters, nurses and hospital
        workers, retail and service workers).
1.5     Consistent with “no-net-loss” density provisions contained in Government Code Section 65863, the
        Town shall consider the potential impact on the Town’s ability to meet its share of the regional
        housing need when reviewing proposals to downzone residential properties, reclassify residentially-
        designated property to other uses, or develop a residential site with fewer units than what is assumed
        for the site in the Housing Element sites inventory.
1.6     The Town shall continue to require the provision of very low-, low-, and moderate-income housing
        within residential development projects that are subject to the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance and
        continue to provide flexibility to allow developers to satisfy inclusionary housing requirements
        through methods that may include payment of an in-lieu fee, land donation, or off-site construction.
1.7     The Town shall continue to require inclusionary housing units to be dispersed throughout the
        development, constructed simultaneous with market-rate housing, and designed to be similar to
        market-rate units to achieve a balance of housing in neighborhoods and minimize opposition to
        affordable housing.
1.8     The Town shall continue to implement its Housing Density Bonus Ordinance consistent with State
        law.
1.9     The Town shall continue to permit second units on single family residential lots and encourage the
        development of second units.
1.10    The Town shall continue to permit manufactured housing in the residentially-zoned districts of the
        town.
1.11    The Town shall explore new and innovative approaches to funding affordable housing.

        development of affordable housing.
1.13    The Town shall support the Community Land Trust model of providing affordable homeownership
        for the local workforce.
Implementation Programs
1.A     Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. The Town shall continue to implement the Inclusionary
        Housing Ordinance and require new residential developments of 10 or more units to set aside either:
             a) 10 percent of units for moderate-income households;
             b) 7.5 percent of units for low-income households; or
             c) 5 percent of units for very low-income households.
        The Town shall also continue to allow developers to satisfy their inclusionary housing requirement
        through various options, which may include payment of an in-lieu fee, land donation, or off-site
        construction. The Town shall investigate the feasibility of conducting a nexus study to determine an
        appropriate in-lieu fee, and based on the findings of the study, the Town may adopt an updated in-
        lieu fee or eliminate the in-lieu fee option. The Town shall establish a dedicated fund for the
        inclusionary housing in-lieu fee and a program for distributing the funds for the development of
        affordable housing.
        The Town shall facilitate partnerships between developers of market-rate units and affordable
        housing developers to assist developers in meeting inclusionary requirements, including partnerships
        with non-profit and for-profit developers of affordable rental housing and organizations employing
        the Community Land Trust model (e.g. Housing Land Trust of Sonoma County).

Demographic Trends
                                                      The town of Windsor is a moderately-sized community
                                                      in suburban Sonoma County and currently (2014) has an
                                                      estimated 27,104 residents and 9,048 households (see
                                                      Table 4.2). Since its incorporation in 1992, Windsor has
                                                      expanded rapidly, outpacing growth in both Sonoma
                                                      County and the Bay Area. The town’s population
                                                      increased by 19.2 percent between 2000 and 2014. This
                                                      is compared to a 6.9 percent and 9.4 percent increase in
                                                      the county and Bay Area, respectively.
                                                      Windsor has been and remains a family-oriented
                                                      community. In 2010 families represented approximately

Table 4.3 shows the household income distribution from the 2007-2011 American Community Survey (ACS).
In line with the town’s high homeownership rate, Windsor households have higher incomes than households
countywide and in the Bay Area as a whole. Windsor had a median household income of $77,157 in 2011,
approximately 17 percent higher than the median household income countywide ($64,343) and 20 percent
higher than in the State of California ($61,632). Over half of Windsor’s households (52.5 percent) earn over
$75,000, whereas only 42.5 percent of households countywide and 51.6 percent of Bay Area households fall
into this income category. At the other end of the spectrum, 29.9 percent of Windsor households make under
$50,000 annually, compared to 39.2 percent of households countywide and 32.8 percent of Bay Area
households.

Table 4.4 shows per capita income for Windsor, Sonoma County, and the Bay Area from the 2008-2012 ACS.
Although the high median household income may suggest that Windsor is more affluent than households
countywide and in the Bay Area, the town actually has a lower per capita income than either the county or
region as a whole. Windsor has a 2012 per capita income of $31,885, compared to $32,898 countywide and
$38,106 in the Bay Area. Given Windsor’s relatively large household sizes, a smaller per capita income
suggests that less discretionary income is available for many Windsor families.

had a median age of 37.0, compared to 39.9 years countywide and 35 years in California. The town’s large
average household size and large share of families also point to the presence of a large number of children. In
fact, minors under 18 years represent 31 percent of Windsor’s population, while only 24.8 percent belong to
this age group countywide and 18.8 percent in the Bay Area. At the same time, the elderly population (65 and
older) makes up only 11 percent of the population of Windsor, a slightly lower portion countywide (13.9
percent) and in the Bay Area (12.2 percent).

Employment Trends and Projections
Windsor benefits from a relatively modest, but expanding economy, with rising employment and growing
industry diversification. As shown in Table 4.6, as of 2011, Windsor had approximately 13,000 employed
residents. These were concentrated in educational, health and social services (22.6 percent), manufacturing
(14.3 percent), retail (11.2 percent), and professional, scientific, management, administrative, and waste
management services (9.4 percent). Countywide employment was similar to that in Windsor with
concentrations in educational, health, and social services (20.5 percent), retail (12.9 percent), professional,
scientific, management, administrative, and waste management services (11.4 percent), and manufacturing
(9.8 percent).
Employment in Windsor has grown rapidly in comparison with the county. Between the second quarters of
2000 and 2011, Windsor added an estimated 1,840 jobs. This represents a 16.4 percent increase, well above
job growth in the county, which only grew by 1.6 percent over the same period. The industries in Windsor
experiencing significant gains during the study period include arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation,
and food services (71.2 percent); educational, health, and social services (51.5 percent); wholesale trade (22.8
percent); and finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing (22.8 percent).
Employment trends show a large concentration of people employed by the educational, manufacturing, and
retail trades within Windsor. These jobs typically offer a lower wage scale, suggesting the need for moderate-
and lower-income housing in Windsor.

Population and Household Projections
Table 4.8 shows population projections for Windsor, Sonoma County, and the Bay Area. The Association of
Bay Area Governments (ABAG) projects Windsor’s population to increase from 26,787 to 33,600 between
2010 and 2040, a 24.5 percent increase over 30 years. This is a slower growth rate than the Bay Area, but only
slightly faster than the countywide rate.

        Household growth is expected to be even greater, rising from 8,962 households to 10,880 a gain of 21.4
        percent, as shown in Table 4.9. These projections reflect the growing need for residential development in
        Windsor. This growth rate is faster than the countywide rate, but slower than the Bay Area.

        Housing Characteristics
        Housing Stock Conditions
        A shown in Table 4.10, Windsor has a fairly young housing stock. Almost one quarter of the town’s housing
        units are less than 30 years old, with the highest percentage of homes built between 1990 and 1999. A quarter
        of the Town’s housing units are 40 years or older, and therefore may require more regular maintenance and
        repair. In particular, the southeastern corner and the northern most section of Windsor, east of Highway 101,
        feature high concentrations of housing built before 1960.

Table 4.11 illustrates that virtually all of Windsor’s housing units contain complete plumbing and kitchen
facilities. The 2010 Census indicates that less than one percent of the town’s units lack these facilities.
Windsor’s Planning Department reports that the town’s housing stock is generally in good condition with
very few houses or apartment buildings in need of major maintenance or repair. The Town’s 2007 Annual
Housing Report confirms this, stating that a physical inspection of the town’s affordable stock revealed that
most of its units were well-maintained and in good condition.
Based on a windshield survey conducted as a part of the previous Housing Element, the Town’s Planning
Department staff estimates that approximately 35 units, or about five percent of the town’s older housing
stock, are in need of repair. This estimate is similar to the number of housing units lacking complete
plumbing and/or kitchen facilities, as demonstrated in Table 4.11 below.

As shown in Table 4.12, the number of housing units in Windsor grew by 25 percent from 2000 to 2010,
more than twice the growth countywide (12 percent) and in the Bay Area (9 percent). During this period,
Windsor saw a notable surge of new multifamily homes. The number of units in complexes with five or more
units grew 82 percent. Single family attached and detached both increased by about a quarter. The number of
mobile homes decreased by 13 percent. In comparison to Windsor, the county as a whole and the Bay Area
have not seen the same rate of growth among either single family or multifamily homes (see Table 4.12).
Even with this recent spike in the number multifamily units, detached single family units still comprise the
majority of Windsor’s homes, representing 79 percent of the Town’s housing stock. In contrast, only 69
percent of units countywide and 54 percent of the units in the Bay Area are single family homes.

Table 4.13 shows building permit trends (not including second units or mixed use developments). Although
Windsor experienced a significant addition of both single family and multifamily homes from 2000 to 2007,
new residential development slowed in 2007 during the recession. In the eight year period between 2000 and
2007, the Town issued 1,344 building permits for single family homes, compared to only 138 permits for all
duplex and multifamily units combined. Between 2007 and April 2014, there were only 61 single family
permits and 77 multifamily permits.

Table 4.14 presents housing vacancy conditions in Windsor, per the 2010 Census. A low vacancy rate
indicates that the demand for housing exceeds the available supply, typically resulting in higher housing
prices. As of 2010, Windsor had a 6.1 percent vacancy rate, lower than the 9.2 percent rate countywide but
similar to the 6.4 percent rate in the Bay Area region. Housing economists generally consider a five percent
rental vacancy rate as sufficient to provide adequate choice and mobility for tenants. Rental units, in
particular, had a particularly low vacancy rate (2.6 percent) compared to countywide (5.1 percent) and Bay
Area rates (5.6 percent). These data point to a relatively constrained housing market in the Town.
Stakeholders also noted that there is a lack of rental housing in the town.

Windsor has historically been thought of as a relatively affordable place to live in Sonoma County, but prices
are increasing and the average family would have difficulty affording housing in the town.
Windsor’s high quality of life and relative proximity to employment centers such as Santa Rosa and northern
Marin County have helped the town rebound from the housing slump. In addition, population, household,
and job growth projections point to significant future demand for housing in Windsor. These factors point to
the importance of planning for local affordable housing needs in upcoming years.
Rental Market Overview
An internet search in 2014 showed a lack of available rentals in Windsor. Only nine properties were found.
Prices depended on location, size, and amenities, but ranged from $1,500 to $2,000 for a two-bedroom unit,
$1,800 to $3,000 for a three-bedroom unit, and $2,150 to $3,650 for a four-bedroom unit. Most of these
rentals were single family homes.

Cassidy Turley North Bay conducted a survey of the apartment market in Sonoma County in the first quarter
of 2014. Although countywide data will exhibit slightly different rents than Windsor, these findings still speak
to general trends in the area. Figure 4.4 shows how average rents by bedroom have increased since 2012. As
of 2014, studio apartments average $898 per month, one-bedroom units average $1,242 per month, and two-
bedroom one-bath units average $1,432 per month.

In response to falling home values and tightening credit standards, many households are remaining in the
rental market, thereby driving up rents. According to the 2008-2012 ACS, the median rent in Windsor was
$1,597. The 2005-2007 ACS gave the median rent as $1,657. ACS is a sample of the population, however, and
has a large margin of error, however, especially for small geographic locations. The median rent in 2000,
according to the Census, was $889. At the same time, occupancy rates have decreased in recent years, from
95.3 percent in 2008 to 93.3 in 2012.
Based on the analysis of rents, very few affordable options may be available for very low- and low-income
renters (who can afford $961 and $1,154 respectively). Lower-income families may be limited to smaller units
that result in overcrowded living conditions. The rental market is generally affordable to moderate-income
households, who can afford $2,468.

Overpayment
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) establishes that a household is “cost-
burdened” (i.e., overpaying for housing) if it spends more than 30 percent of gross income on housing-related
costs. A “severe housing cost burden” occurs when a household pays more than 50 percent of its income on
housing costs. The prevalence of overpayment varies significantly by income, tenure, household type, and
household size. The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data provides detailed
information in this regard for different types of households.
Table 4.16 shows overpayment by tenure. In 2010, 43.6 percent of all Windsor households overpaid and 17.5
percent severely overpaid for their housing. This is lower than the countywide rate of 46.5 percent of all
Sonoma County households and slightly higher than the Bay Area rate (42.6 percent). Renters experienced
particularly high overpayment rates, with 55.9 percent of households being cost-burdened and 25.7 percent of
households being severely cost-burdened. Countywide and in the Bay Area, renters experienced a higher cost
burden than owners, but the rate was lower (41.9 percent) than that in Windsor.

In general, overpayment disproportionately affects lower-income households. Table 4.17 shows the
relationship between low-income households and the varying degrees of cost burden. The data show that
generally, homeowners in Windsor have lower cost burden rates compared to renters overall. In 2010, 55.4
percent of low-income homeowners were cost-burdened. At the same time, 72.6 percent of low-income
                                 1
renters were cost burdened.

        The larger number of households in the Median and Above income group is responsible for bringing up the average
     overpayment rate for owners. As a result, homeowners have a lower overpayment rate overall compared to renters, while
     having a higher overpayment rate in each income group.

Ability to Purchase/Rent Homes
Table 4.18 shows affordability scenarios for very low-, low-, and moderate-income households in Sonoma
County (including Windsor) by the number of persons in the household. The table shows maximum
affordable monthly rents and maximum affordable purchase prices for homes. The affordable sales prices
were calculated using household income limits published by the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD), conventional financing terms, and assuming that households spend 30
percent of gross income on housing costs Households earning the 2014 area median income for a family of
four in Windsor ($76,900) could afford to spend up to $1,923 per month or $23,076 per year on housing
without being considered “overpaying.” For renters this is a straightforward calculation but homeownership
costs are less transparent.
A household can typically qualify to purchase a home that is 2.5 to 3.0 times the annual income of that
household, depending on the down payment, the level of other long-term obligations (such as a car loan), and
interest rates. In practice, the interaction of these factors allows some households to qualify for homes priced
at more than three times their annual income, while other households may be limited to purchasing homes no
more than two times their annual incomes. These factors - interest rates, insurance, and taxes - are held
constant in the table below in order to determine maximum affordable rent and purchase price for
households of each income category. It is important to note that this table is used for illustrative purposes
only. The information provided in Table 4.18 realistically reflects the difficulty in affording rent and purchase
prices in the town of Windsor.

  2014 State Area Median Income for Sonoma County $76,900
 Source: California Department of Housing and Community Development, 2014, Mintier Harnish, 2014
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                   Page 4-37

According to DataQuick, the median sale prices is currently (2014) $420,000. This price is not affordable to
any of the households shown in Table 4.18 except for moderate-income households. Condominiums remain
somewhat more affordable, but generally fall out of reach for these buyers as well. This analysis indicates that
very low- to moderate-income households would likely encounter difficulty in purchasing an affordable home
in Windsor, and would have to direct a larger share of income towards principal, interest, taxes, and
insurance, or assemble a larger down payment to reduce mortgage costs.
For rental housing, the analysis suggests that low-income households would encounter difficulty finding an
affordable home in Windsor. These households can afford a monthly rent of $1,154 for a four-person
household, which is not enough for the average unit available currently. Moderate-income households can
afford monthly rents that approximate or exceed average market-rate rents. As such, these households would
have less difficulty finding an affordable rental unit in Windsor.
As shown in Table 4.19, many of the jobs in Windsor and the region have salaries within the low-income
range. In many cases, even the combined wages of two workers result in a lower income household. These
households might have trouble finding affordable housing.
The analysis shows that the lowest household incomes among the selected occupations are in the service
sector, such as waiters, cooks, room cleaners, and food preparation workers; in the retail sector, such as sales
clerks; and in professional jobs such as teachers and firefighters. A significant portion of construction
workers would also have difficulty in locating affordable housing, particularly in the for-sale market.
The majority of households with police officers, and nurses have moderate- or above moderate-incomes and
would therefore have greater chances of locating affordable rental units, assuming units were available, but
would have difficulty purchasing an affordable home.

Overcrowding
As a result of the lack of affordable housing in the town, many Windsor households are compelled to live in
overcrowded conditions. The U.S. Census defines an “overcrowded” household as 1.01 or more persons per
room, excluding bathrooms, porches, balconies, foyers, halls, and half-rooms. “Severe overcrowding” occurs
in households with more than 1.5 persons per room. Table 4.20 indicates overcrowding rates among renters
and owners in Windsor. In 2010 4.5 percent of all households in Windsor lived in overcrowded conditions,
with 1.1 percent living in severely overcrowded homes. Windsor’s renters suffered greater overcrowding rates
than owners; 6.2 percent of renter households were overcrowded, and 1.6 percent were severely
overcrowded. By comparison, only 3.9 percent of Windsor’s owners were overcrowded, and 1.0 percent were
severely overcrowded. The rate of overcrowding is slightly higher in Windsor than in Sonoma County or the
Bay Area.

Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Special Needs Populations
This section evaluates the housing needs of sub-sections of
the population that have distinct economic, social, and
physical conditions that lead to particular housing concerns.
Elderly
Elderly households face a unique set of circumstances that affect their needs for housing, primarily due to
physical disabilities/limitations, fixed incomes, and health care costs. Unit size, accessibility, affordability, and
proximity to health care, transit, and other services represent key housing concerns for the elderly. Often
Social Security Income (SSI), even when supplemented by a pension and savings, does not cover the cost of
living, requiring seniors to either continue to work or apply for the State Supplementary Payment (SSP).
Identified Needs and Available Resources
Table 4.21 shows the elderly population in Windsor, Sonoma County, and the Bay Area. Windsor’s elderly
population is proportionally smaller than the elderly population countywide and in the Bay Area. In 2010,
10.9 percent of Windsor’s population and 20.3 percent of Windsor’s householders were over the age of 65. In
Sonoma County, 13.9 percent of the population was over the age of 65 and 22.6 percent of householders
were seniors.

Table 4.22 shows elderly households by tenure. Elderly households have higher rates of homeownership. Of
the Windsor elderly householders, 79.7 percent were owners and 20.3 percent were renters, compared to 75.8
percent owner and 24.2 percent renter for all households. Countywide, 76.1 percent of elderly householders
were owners and 23.9 percent were renters, compared to 60.4 percent owner and 39.6 percent renter for all
households.

Table 4.23 shows the incomes of elderly households. In 2011, 42 percent of Windsor elderly householders
had an annual income under $30,000, compared to 34.9 percent countywide and 33.5 percent in the region.
Householders with a lower income may find it difficult to find affordable housing.

Generally, elderly households tend to pay a larger portion of their income to housing costs. Elderly renters in
Windsor are particularly affected by this trend. In 2010, among elderly renters in Windsor, 3.3 percent paid
within 30 and 50 percent of their income on housing and 43.5 percent severely overpaid for housing, paying
more than 50 percent. In comparison, 26.5 percent of elderly homeowners overpaid, and 10.8 percent of
elderly homeowners severely overpaid for housing, as shown in Table 4.24.
Low-income elderly renters had the highest rates of overpayment, with 75 percent directing more than 30
percent of their income towards housing. At the same time, only 36.8 percent of very low-income elderly
renters and 60.6 percent of extremely low-income elderly renters overpaid. This pattern suggests that eligible
income limits for subsidy programs like Section 8 may be too low for a portion of elderly renters. In addition,
Section 8 waiting lists can have as long as an 18-month wait, making it difficult for elderly renters to receive
subsided housing.

The need for elderly housing is addressed through a variety of sources in Windsor and Sonoma County.
Windsor has five facilities for seniors. Brooks Creek offers market-rate independent living units for seniors
aged 55 and above. Chancellor Place of Windsor is an assisted living facility with a variety of amenities.
Apartments are market-rate, from $1,882. Terene Manor is a residential care facility. In addition, Burbank
Housing manages two affordable independent-living communities, currently (2014) with open waiting lists.
These include Bell Manor, with 95 units renting between $492 and $900 per month, and Vinecrest, which has
60 units and charges 30 percent of adjusted gross income for rent. Vinecrest has a two-year waitlist; waitlists
for Bell Manor are highly variable depending on income of the applicant and other factors.
Staff at the Windsor Senior Center report that there is a need for additional low-cost senior housing in
Windsor. They provide an average of three housing referrals per month, and generally refer people to
Vinecrest and Bell Manor. In terms of assisted living facilities, Senior Advocacy Services (SAS) operates a
Residential Care Counseling program to educate families on their options for assisted living care in Sonoma
County. SAS maintains an updated profile of assisted care facilities, which includes costs, services, and
vacancies that they provide to families seeking care. Staff from SAS reported a growing demand for assisted
living homes serving low-income seniors and for smaller affordable apartments that are centrally located and
wheelchair accessible. Currently, Windsor has 14 homes with a total of 153 assisted living beds that provide
24-hour assisted care. Thirteen of these homes have six or eight beds, and one (Chancellor House) has 84
beds. According to SAS staff, the median monthly cost for assisted care is currently (June 2014) $3,500 for
accommodations in Sonoma County. SAS staff also stated that these costs fall out of reach of lower-income
elderly households who depend on SSI as well as other elderly households with a limited income. Often
smaller apartments are not accessible to seniors with wheelchairs and they may be forced to live in assisted
living.

Staff from the Sonoma County Housing Authority reported that a total of 2,391 households including a
family member age 62 or older are currently on the waiting list for the Section 8 Voucher program. As about
five percent of the County’s Section 8 Voucher holders live in Windsor, one could assume that five percent
of 2,391 senior households on the County’s waiting list reside in Windsor. This suggests that approximately

Strategies and Programmatic Responses to Meet Projected Needs
As noted in the Housing Plan section, the Town can address the local need for elderly housing, particularly
for very low- to moderate-income households, by supporting affordable housing developers through
applications for State and Federal funding, design review workshops, site location assistance, and direct
financial assistance. Implementation programs that address Design Review, parking standards, and impact
fees also facilitate the production of senior housing by allowing for more financially feasible development.
In addition, adopting the Universal Design Code established by the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) as a voluntary component of the Town Building Code would increase
accessibility of new residential development to seniors.
Finally, ongoing support of the Town’s Senior Center also offers residents a portal to affordable housing and
other services.

                                                               Persons with Disabilities
                                                               A disability is a physical or mental impairment that
                                                               substantially limits one or more major life activities.
                                                               This segment of the population often needs
                                                               affordable housing that is located near shopping,
                                                               services, and public transit. In some cases, persons
                                                               with disabilities require units equipped with
                                                               wheelchair accessibility or other special features that
                                                               accommodate physical or sensory limitations.
                                                               Depending on the severity of the disability, people
                                                               may live independently with some assisted care in
                                                               their own homes, or may require assisted living and
                                                               supportive services in special care facilities.
Many persons with disabilities tend to have a small fixed income and rely on Social Security Disability
Insurance (SDI), Social Security Insurance (SSI), State Supplementary Payment (SSP), or Social Security Old
Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI), which rarely covers the cost of housing. In addition,
persons with disabilities have the highest rate of unemployment relative to other groups and often experience
discrimination in hiring and training.
Identified Needs and Available Resources
SB 812, which took effect January 2011, amended State housing element law to require an evaluation of the
special housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities. A "developmental disability" is defined as a
disability that originates before an individual becomes 18 years old, continues or can be expected to continue
indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. This includes Mental Retardation,
Cerebral Palsy, Epilepsy, and Autism.
The North Bay Regional Center, a contractor for the California Department of Rehabilitation, provides
family support, crisis intervention, referral, and other services to clients with developmental disabilities
including people with mental retardation, cerebral palsy, autism, and epilepsy. According to the California
Department of Developmental Services, as of January 2014, a total of 196 consumers with developmental
disabilities were served by the North Bay Regional Center. Of these, 54.6 percent were under 18. Most (154
clients) lived in their own home. Less than 20 lived in a foster home or supportive housing situation.
Developmental disabilities by type are shown in Table 4.26. Center staff echoed comments from the
Department of Mental Health, and indicated that many of their clients would prefer to live independently in
unrestricted housing. However, due to long Section 8 waiting lists (9,290 households in Sonoma County) and
competition for affordable housing, they often have no choice but to live in care facilities.

Table 4.30 breaks down the disability type by age group and type. According to the 2010-2012 ACS,
ambulatory disabilities represented the most pervasive disability for people aged 18 to 65, accounting for 29.7
percent of all disabilities and affecting 1,538 Windsor residents; 1,074 residents reported a condition that
prevented them from living independently. Self-care disabilities affected 640 Windsor residents, comprising
the third most pervasive disability. For those residents between the ages of 5 and 17, most disabilities were
cognitive. For residents over 65, the incidence of disabilities was a lot higher (38.5 percent compared to 6.7
percent) and the most common disability was ambulatory.

The housing coordinator from the Sonoma County Department of Behavioral Health reported that 130 of
their clients reside in Windsor, a 30 percent increase from 2010, not accounting for the mentally ill homeless
population. He also reported that approximately 95 percent of their clients seeking housing desire to live
independently in standard small one-bedroom and studio apartments. The Department’s housing coordinator
reported that most of these clients are unemployed and receive SSI, qualifying them for units affordable to
households at 30 percent of AMI. He also reported that Windsor generally lacks these units, and that
vacancies remain scarce due to high demand from the general low-income population. People with mental
health disabilities often rely on the Department of Mental Health or their contracted agencies (e.g.,
Community Support Network, Buckelew, Progress Foundation, and Telecare) to assist in getting on housing
waiting lists, talking to landlords, and securing appropriate rental assistance.

Housing
Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
There is a significant demand for accessible housing, especially at the lower income levels, as evidenced by the
high proportion of disabled persons on the waiting list for the Section 8 housing assistance program; 3,406
out of 9,290 households on the waiting list in Sonoma County have a member with a disability.
According to the California Department of Social Services Community Care Licensing Division, Windsor has
eight adult residential facilities (ARF), with a total capacity for 40 adults that provide 24-hour non-medical
care for adults ages 18 through 59 who are unable to provide for their own daily needs. These facilities, listed
in Table 4.31, cater to adults that are physically handicapped, developmentally disabled, and/or mentally
disabled.

Strategies and Programmatic Responses to Meet Projected Needs For Disabled and Elderly
Many of the strategies and programmatic responses that address elderly housing also apply to disabled
persons’ housing needs. The Town can support housing developers through applications for State and
Federal funding, design review workshops, site location assistance, and direct financial assistance.
Implementation programs in the Housing Objectives, Policies, and Programs section that address Design
Review, parking standards, and impact fees also allow for more financially feasible development.
In addition, adopting the Universal Design Code established by HCD as a voluntary component of the Town
Building Code would increase accessibility of new residential development to disabled persons.
Large Households
The U.S. Census Bureau defines large households as having five or more persons. Large households often
encounter difficulty in finding adequately-sized, affordable housing due to the limited supply of large units in
many jurisdictions. In addition, large units generally cost more to rent and buy than smaller units. For larger
families with low-incomes, this can result in overcrowded conditions and/or overpayment for housing.

Identified Needs and Available Resources
Table 4.32 shows household size by tenure. In 2010, large households accounted for 16 percent of all
households, or 1,436 households in Windsor, compared to 10.6 percent in Sonoma County. Owners and
renters represented 950 or 66.2 and 486 or 33.8 percent, respectively, of the large households. Renters
comprised only 24.2 percent of all Windsor households, indicating that large households were more likely to
rent than the Town’s population as a whole.

Housing
Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Large households tend to have a lower household income (as shown in Table 4.33) than smaller households.
However, even if large households have the income of a smaller household, it is split between more people.
This means that less income is available to be spent on housing. In addition, large houses generally cost more,
if they are even available.

In 2000, just over 10 percent of Windsor’s rental housing stock and over 34 percent of ownership housing
had four bedrooms or more. This limited number of larger units suggests that a significant number of large
renter households may live in overcrowded situations. When planning for new multifamily housing
developments, the provision of three- and four-bedroom units is an important consideration due to the likely
demand in Windsor for affordable, larger multifamily rental units. As shown in Table 4.34, large housing units
are still hard to find. 27.9 percent of stock has more than four bedrooms, and only 2.7 percent of Windsor’s
housing stock has more than 5 bedrooms, much less than 4.7 percent of homes in the Bay Area.

Table 4.35 shows large households who overpay for housing by tenure. Large households that own their
homes suffer from slightly higher overpayment rates. Of all large renter households in Windsor, 35.5 percent

Strategies and Programmatic Responses to Meet Projected Needs
The Town’s efforts to facilitate the development of second units can assist large multi-generational
households. For example, the Town permits second units by right on single family residential lots. In 2003
the Town reduced the parking standards to require only one uncovered off street space for second units.
As another strategy, the Town, in its discussions with developers producing affordable housing units under
the Inclusionary Housing Program or development agreements, can also encourage the provision of larger
units.

Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Female-Headed Households
In Windsor, female-headed single-parent households made up 13.5 percent of total families, compared to
16.8 percent in Sonoma County and 17.4 percent in the Bay Area, as shown in Table 4.37, 63.7 percent of
these female-headed households had children under the age of 18. Single-parent households, with only one
wage earner, can experience low-incomes and have difficulty finding housing. Single mothers have a greater
risk of falling into poverty than single fathers due to factors such as the wage gap between men and women,
insufficient training and education for higher-wage jobs, and inadequate child support. Households with
single mothers also typically have special needs related to access to day care/childcare, health care and other
supportive services.

Strategies and Programmatic Responses to Meet Projected Needs
Access to affordable and convenient day care services can prove a significant challenge to single working
mothers. To help address this need, the Town allows projects that include an on-site child day care center to
receive (a) a density bonus of residential space that is equal to or greater than the amount of space in day care
center; or (b) an additional incentive that contributes significantly to the economic feasibility of the day care
center construction.
Town support for affordable cooperative housing developments, where child care and chores are shared
among several families, could also help respond to the needs of single mothers.
                                         Farmworkers
                                         Farmworkers form a critical part of Sonoma County’s wine industry,
                                         with many living in the county for short periods of time during the
                                         peak harvest. Farmworkers encounter special housing needs because
                                         of their limited income, the often unstable nature of their employment
                                         (i.e., having to move throughout the year from one harvest to the
                                         next), concerns around immigration issues, and the difficulty in
                                         building farmworker housing due to due to lack of resources and
                                         community support. Many farmworkers live in unsafe, substandard,
                                         and/or crowded conditions, including garages, sheds, barns, and
                                         temporary structures. Housing needs for farmworkers include both
                                         permanent and seasonal housing for single men and women, as well as
                                         permanent family housing.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) categorizes farmworkers into three groups: 1) permanent, 2)
seasonal, and 3) migrant. Permanent farmworkers are typically employed year round by the same employer. A
seasonal farmworker works an average of less than 150 days per year and earns at least half of his/her earned
income from farm work. Migrant farmworkers form a subset of seasonal farmworkers, and include those who
have to travel to their workplace, and cannot return to their permanent residence within the same day.
Identified Needs and Available Resources
The USDA 2012 Census reported a total of 13,710 permanent and seasonal farmworkers in Sonoma County.
Seasonal and permanent workers represented 7,810 (57 percent) and 5,900 (43 percent) of the County’s
farmworkers, respectively. This is a decrease from the count in the 2002 Census of 15,467 seasonal and
permanent workers, with 9,870 (64 percent) seasonal workers and 5,597 (36 percent) permanent workers. The
biggest decrease is in the number of seasonal workers, which decreased by over 2,000 workers from 2002 to
2012.
The 2007-2011 ACS estimates 296 Windsor residents employed in agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, and
mining. However, it is not known how many of these are farmworkers. In addition, the Census often
undercounts farmworkers.

Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
The Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Enumeration Profiles Study provides information at the county level
for migrant and seasonal farmworkers and the number of children living in those households in 2000. The
study reported 15,717 migrant and seasonal workers, with an additional 12,252 non-farmworkers living in
farmworker households in Sonoma County. The study also reported that children under the age of 18
represented 55 percent of the non-farmworker population in migrant and seasonal farmworker households in
California. These findings indicate a need for affordable single family and multifamily units that provide
sufficient space for migrant and seasonal farmworker households and their families.
The California Institute for Rural Studies at UC Davis estimated in 2000 that 12,864 farmworkers find work
each year in Sonoma and Napa counties - slightly more than half of those in Sonoma County - pruning,
tending, and harvesting a wine-grape crop that in 1999 was valued at a combined $491 million, an increase of
almost 40 percent since 1994.
The California Human Development Corporation (HDC) reports that affordable housing for farmworkers
remains in very short supply in the county. Farmworkers are often homeless, especially at peak harvest times.
Laluz is a research center that acts as a first step for immigrants seeking social services, including food, rental
assistance, public utilities assistance, Medi-Cal, food stamps, employment, or facing discrimination or abuse in
the workplace. They also offer ESL classes and computer literacy courses in Spanish. According to Laluz
Center, originally there were a lot of migrant workers coming from the Central Valley, but with increased
border control, the number of migrant workers went down. The number of permanent farmworkers, who are
more likely to have families with them, has increased. They require permanent affordable housing situated
near the farmland but with access to transportation, shopping, and other services. Many, even if they have
papers, are forced to live in high-cost apartments or with two families together. They may collect
unemployment, but it is not enough to cover the rent.
Compounding this housing need, immigration concerns and a lack of familiarity with housing resources can
often impact farmworkers’ willingness and ability to contact agencies who might offer assistance. A recent
report based on a 2003-2004 survey of 2,344 California farmworkers found that 42 percent of farmworkers in
                                                        2
California earned less than $10,000 per year. Yet, two different surveys indicated that only four to five
                                                                                3
percent of farmworkers used public housing subsidies in the state.
HDC offers a number of services for farmworkers in Sonoma County, including temporary housing
assistance for eligible farmworkers, emergency support services, and the Day Labor Center, which assists
farmworkers with finding jobs and housing. In March 2010, the Healdsburg Day Labor Center helped
connect 65 laborers to 217 hours of work. In April 2010, 78 laborers worked 346 hours. In 2011, there were
52 day laborers from the center who were placed in permanent jobs, according to the director. In 2012, there
were 66 who got such work. In the six-month period through the end of March 2014, 791 individuals came to
the center and typically received some form of services, whether help with employment, housing, or food.
Burbank Housing of Sonoma County operates two developments in Sonoma County for farmworkers, but
these cater only to permanent and legally documented families. The projects include Harvest Grove in
Healdsburg with 44 units and Sonoma Valley in the city of Sonoma with 16 units.

Vineyard Worker Services was another nonprofit organization dedicated to assisting farmworkers and their
families with housing needs as well as with translation services, job placement, ESL classes, and referrals. The
Executive Director of Vineyard Worker Services reported that Sonoma County severely lacks affordable and
safe housing, with several thousand farmworkers in the county insufficiently housed. Vineyard Worker
Services offered two seasonal migrant worker camps during the grape harvest season in the Sonoma Valley.
The camps have a total of 60 beds, offered at five dollars each, including meals and limited health care
services. However, these camps were closed in 2008 when Vineyard Worker Services merged with Laluz.
According to the Executive Director of Vineyard Worker Services, given the lack of affordable housing in the
area, Sonoma County farmworkers often seek housing in Napa County, which currently has three camps
operated by the Napa Valley Housing Authority. These facilities have a capacity for approximately 180
seasonal farmworkers.
Strategies and Programmatic Responses to Meet Projected Needs
In Windsor, Agricultural Worker Housing is defined in the Town’s Zoning Ordinance as “residential housing
whose occupancy is restricted to persons who are employed in, raising or harvesting any agricultural
commodities. Prior to construction of such housing, the developer shall enter into an agreement with the
Town that ensures occupancy by qualified residents only.” It is allowed in Community Commercial, Light
Industrial, and Heavy Industrial zoning districts.
The Town also works with housing developers to expand the supply of affordable housing for both migrant
and resident agricultural workers. Where available, the Town cooperates with housing developers to secure
additional funding for farmworker projects from sources administered by HCD, the State Office of Migrant
Services, and the Federal Farmers Home Administration.
                                                          Homeless
                                                          The homeless population has a wide variety of needs
                                                          that impact access to housing, including physical and
                                                          mental disabilities, HIV, and substance abuse.
                                                          Depending on an individual’s circumstances, these
                                                          needs may be addressed via emergency shelters,
                                                          transitional housing, or supportive housing. Emergency
                                                          shelters are defined as housing offering minimal
                                                          supportive services, with occupancy limited to up to six
                                                          months. Transitional housing is configured as rental
                                                          housing, and operates under program requirements
                                                          that call for the termination of assistance and
                                                          recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible
tenant after six months. Supportive housing puts no limit on the length of stay, and offers on- or off-site
services that assist residents in retaining their housing, improving health, and maximizing their ability to live
and work in the community.
Identified Needs and Available Resources
The Sonoma County Community Development Commission (SCCDC), the staff of various homeless services
programs, and a total of 76 homeless persons and 97 community volunteers conducted a point-in-time count
of homeless in Sonoma County in 2013. The 2013 Sonoma County Homeless Census and Survey included both
unsheltered homeless (those living on the streets and in open spaces in the county) and sheltered homeless
(those receiving temporary shelter or services). Key findings of the homeless count include:

Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
         There were 3,309 individuals identified as unsheltered homeless; a 1.7 percent decrease from the
          2011 count.
         There were 971 persons staying in shelters, transitional housing, or receiving services; a significant
          17.2 percent decrease since 2011.
         There were 152 families homeless with children, 277 unaccompanied homeless children, and 851
          unaccompanied homeless individuals.
         Survey respondents most frequently cited loss of job or unemployment (34 percent) as the primary
          event or condition that led to their current episode of homelessness. Other common causes of
          homelessness were alcohol or drug use (16 percent), an argument with family or friends who asked
          them to leave (8 percent), and domestic violence (7 percent).
         Whites/Caucasians comprised 66 percent of Survey respondents. In comparison with the overall
          population of Sonoma County, there were a disproportionate number of Black/African American
          and multi-ethnic persons experiencing homelessness. No Asian or Pacific Islander or Other Races
          were identified. The mean age was 39 years old.
Seven people claimed to have become homeless in Windsor (1.4 percent of the total homeless population)
and 15 people were counted as homeless in the Town of Windsor in 2013, 5 more than were counted in
2011. Of these 15, all were unsheltered.
In addition to the number of Sonoma County agencies that provide homeless services, the county has a
network of 14 housing shelters and over 40 service programs. The Sonoma County 10-Year Homeless Action
Plan (2007) identifies a total of 953 beds for individuals and 667 beds available to people in families. An
additional 334 permanent supportive housing beds are available for individuals, and 74 are available for
people in family households. While it may appear that a sufficient number of beds exist for the 897
individuals counted as homeless, the number of beds for the 840 people in families was severely lacking at the
time of the count. Additionally, the need for beds is difficult to assess, as the net homeless population grows
each year, and point-in-time counts often underestimate the number of homeless as people tend to move in
and out of homelessness over time.

   Sonoma County’s 10-Year Homelessness Action Plan, 2007
Beyond emergency shelters, interviews with area homeless advocates, including staff from Catholic Charities
and Community Housing for Sonoma County, also indicate that the county suffers from a lack of supportive
housing. There are a limited number of local organizations with the capacity to develop and operate
supportive housing. These service-enriched units, while often effective at addressing chronic homelessness,
are costly to operate.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                 Page 4-57

Service providers report that homeless people generally locate in communities where assistance is readily
available. Due to the lack of services and homeless shelters in Windsor, the Town appears to have a relatively
small homeless population. Catholic Charities, located in Santa Rosa, operates a Homeless Service Center that
serves about 2,000 people each year. Their six homeless shelters have a total of 298 beds and received 3,000
visits from chronically homeless people in 2007. Staff estimated that in an average year they provide housing
for 15 individuals and three families that self-identify from Windsor. Staff said since 2008, they have increased
services, but were unable to provide exact counts.
Other homeless facilities in the vicinity include the National Guard Armory in Santa Rosa, operated during
the winter months by Catholic Charities. The Armory shelter has a capacity of approximately 170. Users of
the shelter are allowed a shower, dinner, and breakfast. In 2004 the Committee on the Shelterless (COTS)
completed construction of the Mary Isaak Center in Petaluma, which offers 100 emergency shelter beds and
30 transitional housing beds for adults. COTS also runs the Kids First Family Shelter (15 beds for families)
and the Center for Homeless Children and their Families (35 beds for children and adults). The Redwood
Gospel Mission in Santa Rosa houses between 70 and 80 men each night; the Redwood Gospel Mission also
operates “The Rose,” a women’s shelter, which houses about 12 women each night. The Manna Home, also
run by Redwood Gospel Mission, provides emergency shelter for women and children. The Women’s
Emergency Shelter (operated by the YWCA) provides emergency shelter for women and children who are
victims of domestic violence.
Strategies and Programmatic Responses to Meet Projected Needs
The Town can address local homeless housing needs by providing assistance to developers of transitional and
supportive housing through applications for State and Federal funding, design review workshops, site
location assistance, and direct financial assistance.
To facilitate the provision of homeless housing in Windsor, in 2005, the Town added the definition of
“supportive housing” to the Zoning Ordinance and allowed supportive housing developments with up to six
clients in all residential zoning districts, except the CR (Compact Residential) district. A minor use permit was
required for supportive housing projects with seven or more clients in all residential zoning districts, except
the CR district, in which it was not permitted. While this change was intended to facilitate the development of
affordable housing, State law changed in 2008 related to supportive housing and transitional housing,
requiring that these housing types be treated the same as other residential uses of the same type in the same
zone. The Town is updated its Zoning Ordinance in 2014 to comply with State law. The Town added a
definition of “transitional housing” to the Zoning Ordinance and made the necessary zoning changes to treat
transitional and supportive housing, regardless of the number of people served, as a residential use subject to
the same restrictions and permitting processes as other housing types in the same zones.
In addition, the Town amended the Zoning Ordinance to allow emergency shelters as a permitted use in the
CC (Community Commercial) District; a use permit was required in the past.

Housing
Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Assisted Affordable Housing Units
Units At-Risk of Conversion
“At-risk units” are defined as multifamily rental housing developments that receive government assistance
under Federal, State, and/or local programs, and which are eligible to convert to market-rate due to
termination of a rent subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or other expiring use restrictions within the
current and subsequent five-year planning period of the housing element. According to HCD, thousands of
publicly assisted housing units in California are eligible to change from low-income to market-rate housing
during the next decade.
According to the Town of Windsor’s 2010 Annual Housing Report, four market-rate units were lost due to
demolition in 2010. Other affordable units are eligible for conversion in 2024 and beyond.
Jurisdictions are required by law to analyze government assisted housing that is eligible to convert from low-
income to market-rate housing over the next 10 years (until 2025).
Table 4.40 shows the affordable housing units in the Town of Windsor along with their deed restriction
expiration dates. There are a total of 485 affordable units, with 141 reserved for seniors. Twin Oaks, a self-
help for-sale development, is not considered an “assisted housing development” per Housing Element
requirements since it is not rental housing. Thus, there are no properties at risk of converting to market-rate
in the 10-year period following the beginning of the housing element planning period (i.e., through 2025).
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                               Page 4-59

California Government Code Section 65863.10 requires that owners of Federally-assisted properties provide
notices of intent to convert their properties to market-rate 12 months prior and again at 6 months prior to
the expiration of their contract, opt-outs, or prepayment. Owners must provide notices of intent to public
agencies, including HCD and the local public housing authority, as well as to all impacted tenant households.
The six-month notice must include specific information on the owner’s plans, timetables, and reasons for
termination. Under Government Code Section 65863.11, owners of Federally-assisted projects must provide
a Notice of Opportunity to Submit an Offer to Purchase to Qualified Entities, non-profit or for-profit
organizations that agree to preserve the long-term affordability if they should acquire at-risk projects, at least
one year before the sale or expiration of use restrictions. Qualified entities have first right of refusal for
acquiring at-risk units. HCD keeps a current list of all of the qualified entities across the state. The qualified
entities that HCD lists for Sonoma County are found in Table 4.41.

SECTION 4.4                   PROJECTED HOUSING NEEDS
Regional Housing Need Allocation
Housing Element law requires a quantification of Windsor’s share of the regional housing need as determined
by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) in its Regional Housing Need Plan (RHNP). The
Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) for Windsor represents the minimum projection of housing
units needed to accommodate household growth of all income levels during the RHNA projection period
(January 1, 2014 to October 31, 2022). As shown in Table 4.42, the Town must demonstrate that it can
accommodate a total of 440 new dwelling units distributed among four income categories by October 2022.

To enable the Town of Windsor to meet RHNA goals, the Town must evaluate its capacity to provide
available sites to meet projected future housing needs. The Town must demonstrate it has or will make
available adequate sites with appropriate zoning and development standards and with services and facilities to
accommodate the RHNA. This section demonstrates Windsor’s ability to meet its identified housing need for
this planning period. Windsor will meet this need through approved and proposed projects, vacant and
underutilized land, and new second units. This section also identifies environmental and infrastructure
constraints applicable to identified sites and discusses Windsor’s ability to accommodate a variety of housing
types for all income levels.
Housing Needs for Extremely Low-Income Households
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines an extremely low-income household as
earning less than 30 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI). These households encounter a unique set of
housing situations and needs. Often, these households include any combination of special needs populations
and/or often represent families and individuals receiving public assistance, such as social security insurance
(SSI) or disability insurance.
Table 4.43 shows the HCD household income limits based on the 2014 AMI in Sonoma County for different
income categories. The 2014 AMI in Sonoma County was $82,600. For extremely low-households, this results
in an income of up to $24,800 for a four-person household.

To estimate housing need for extremely low-income households, 50 percent of Windsor’s 120 very low-
income RHNA units are assumed to be needed to serve extremely low-income households. Based on this
methodology, the Town has a projected need of 60 units for extremely low-income households.

Housing
Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
As shown in Table 4.44 below, in 2010, there were 610 extremely low-income households in Windsor, or 14
percent of the town’s total households. Approximately 22 percent of the town’s renter households and 8
percent of owner households were extremely low-income.
Extremely low-income renters experienced housing problems at a slightly higher rate (66.7 percent) than their
homeowner counterparts (40.8 percent).5 However, the percentage of households who experienced housing
problems has decreased since 2000 (81 percent of extremely low-income renters and 78 percent of extremely
low-income homeowners). Extremely low-income renters also had higher rates of overpayment, with 16.4
percent being cost-burdened and 15.1 percent reporting a severe cost burden, compared to 7.6 percent of
extremely low-income homeowners being cost-burdened and 6.1 percent being severely cost-burdened.

Extremely low-income households often rely on supportive housing as a means of transitioning into stable,
more productive lives. Supportive housing typically offers services such as childcare, after-school tutoring,
and career counseling. In 2005, the Town added the definition of “supportive housing” to the Zoning
Ordinance, allowing the use in all residential zoning districts. In 2014, the Town is making additional
amendments to fully comply with State law requirements for supportive housing.
To further address the housing needs of extremely low-income households, in 2008 the Town adopted a
policy that encourages studio apartment or Single-Room Occupancy units (SRO). This policy allows pairs of
studio apartments of 500 square feet or less to be counted as one unit for the purposes of calculating density
bonuses. Additionally, the Town is currently (2014) in the process of amending the Zoning Ordinance to
allow SROs in all zones allowing multifamily.

SECTION 4.5                SITES INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS
Inventory of Approved and Planned Projects
Since the Housing Element planning period begins January 1, 2014, Windsor’s RHNA can be reduced by the
number of new units approved or planned as of January 1, 2014. Town staff compiled an inventory of all
residential projects with a housing component that are (as of January 1, 2014) approved or planned and
anticipated to be built by the end of the current Housing Element planning period. For approved and
planned projects, deed-restricted affordable units are inventoried as lower-income.
Approved Projects and Entitled Units
Approved projects and entitled units are either fully entitled or are units considered approved due to a
Development Agreement, Housing Agreement/Density Bonus Agreement, or other zoning action (e.g.,
subdivision, conditional use permit, variance). These projects are all market rate units inventoried as either
above moderate-income or moderate-income based on anticipated unit types and sizes and the current
housing market. There are 141 units in approved and entitled projects. Two of the larger approved projects
are Esposti Park Apartments and Town Green Village Buildings R and S. Esposti Park Apartments contains
36 market-rate apartment units, all of which are inventoried as moderate-income units. Environmental
Review was completed in May, 2014 and construction is anticipated to begin early in the planning period.
Construction on Buildings R and S within the Town Green Village began in 2009 but was soon abandoned
due to the national economic downturn. Both building sites have sat partially completed since that time. Both
properties were purchased by a new owner and developer in 2014, and Town staff has been working closely
with them to develop new plans for the site that substantially comply with the previous approvals. All
outstanding issues have been resolved, and the developer has stated that they will submit building plans for
Town review by October 1, 2014. Building R will contain 13 residential townhomes on the upper floors,
similar to other buildings within the Village. Building S will contain five commercial spaces on the ground
floor and five residential townhomes on the upper floors. In total, Town Green Village Buildings R and S are
anticipated to result in 18 small, townhome units, all of which are inventoried as moderate-income units
based on unit sizes.
There are an additional 87 units on scattered lots or small subdivisions, most of which are single family
homes. 86 of these units are inventoried as above moderate-income and one unit, a manufactured home, is
inventoried as lower-income based on the permit valuation data. Approved projects and entitled units are
included in Table 4.45 and shown in Figure 4.5A. More details on the entitled units can be found in Appendix
D.
Planned (Pending) Projects
Planned projects are projects that have submitted applications, but have yet to receive final project approval.
There are three planned projects, totaling 827 units, in the Town that will be counted towards the 2014-2022
RHNA: Bell Village, Windsor Mill, and Victoria Oaks (Hembree Village). Of the 827 total units, 224 are
inventoried as moderate-income units and 603 are inventoried as above moderate-income units. Planned
projects are summarized in Table 4.45 and shown in Figure 4.5B.

Housing
Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Bell Village
The Bell Village development is designated Compact Residential in the General Plan and zoned Compact
Residential. The site is currently (2014) occupied by the Windsorland RV Park and vacant land. The current
property owner is in on-going consultation with the Town regarding redevelopment of the site. In February
2008, the property owner submitted a Conversion Impact Report to the Town to close down the Mobile
Home Park. The site was approved in December 2011 for 387 rental apartments and townhomes, 40 percent
of which were reserved for lower- and moderate-income tenants. Since that time, the developers have sought
changes to the type of units and are no longer planning to build the affordable units originally included in the
application, but instead, pay an inclusionary housing in-lieu fee for the 77 low-income units and build the 77
deed-restricted moderate-income units on site. The site is still planned for higher-density rental housing.
As described earlier, rental units in Windsor are generally affordable to moderate-income households (see
Table 4-18). Therefore, even as a market-rate rental project, many of the units that are not deed-restricted in
Bell Village will likely be affordable to moderate-income households. However, since the units will be new
and in a desirable location, the Housing Element conservatively estimates that about 30 percent (116 units)
will be moderate-income units and 271 units (70 percent) will be above moderate-income units.
Windsor Mill
The Windsor Mill development is designated Compact Residential in the General Plan and zoned Compact
Residential. It was first approved in 2005 for a 200 lot residential development and was subject to a
Development Agreement, which was then modified over time. After being granted an extension in 2009, the
Development Agreement was subsequently cancelled by the Town Council in 2014 based on a request by the
new developer for a Priority Development Area waiver under the newly adopted Downtown/Station Area
Specific Plan. The new developer has proposed significant revisions to the site plan and housing type but
plans to build the same 360 market-rate rental units. A Priority Development Area Waiver Agreement has
been executed for the proposed project, but an actual application has not yet been submitted for staff review.
The developer has indicated that he plans to pay in-lieu fees to cover the affordable housing requirement for
the project.
As described earlier, rental units in Windsor are generally affordable to moderate-income households (see
Table 4-18). Therefore, even as a market-rate rental project, many of the units included in Windsor Mill may
be affordable to moderate-income households. The Housing Element conservatively estimates that about 30
percent (108 units) will be moderate-income units and 252 units (70 percent) will be above moderate-income
units.
Victoria Oaks
Victoria Oaks (Hembree Village) is located within General Plan “Special Area G” and is currently designated
and zoned High Density Residential, which allows up to 16 units per acre. The developer originally submitted
a 208-unit proposal in 2011 that consisted of a three-story, 120-unit senior apartment complex and 88 units
of duets and single family residences. The applicant then submitted a request to modify the project to include
80 to 90 units. The request was granted tentative approval by the Town Council in 2013, but requires a
rezone to Village Residential before the project can begin construction. The Victoria Oaks (Hembree Village)
development is still in process, but is anticipated to result in 80 single family homes, all of which are
inventoried as above moderate-income units.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                   Page 4-67

Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Vacant and Underutilized Land
In accordance with the requirements of Government Code Section 65583.2, the Town conducted an
assessment of the vacant and underutilized sites suitable for residential development within the town of
Windsor. All parcels (or portions of parcels) in the residential sites inventory were reviewed by Town staff
and the Consultants to confirm vacancy status, ownership, adequacy of public utilities and services, possible
environmental constraints such as flood zones and steep slopes, and other possible constraints to
development feasibility.
The sites inventory uses the following assumptions:
        Type of sites. All of the sites in the inventory are vacant or underutilized sites zoned for residential
         or mixed use and meet the classification in State law (Government Code Section 65583.2(a)) as “land
         suitable for residential development.”
        Relation of density to income categories. The following assumptions were used to determine the
         income categories according to the allowed densities for each site:
                   Lower-Income Sites. Sites that allow at least 20 units per acre were inventoried as feasible
                    for lower-income (low-, and very low-income) residential development in accordance with
                    the “default density standard” set forth in Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)4. This
                    includes sites with the Zoning/General Plan Designations below:
                                   Sites that are designated Boulevard Mixed Use and zoned Boulevard
                                    Commercial (up to 32 units per acre);
                                   Sites designated/zoned Compact Residential (24 - 32 dwelling units per net
                                    acre); and
                                   Sites designated Town Center/Mixed Use and zoned Town Center (assumed to
                                    develop at 22 dwelling units per acre in the Station Area/Downtown Specific
                                    Plan).
                   Moderate-Income Sites. Sites that are zoned High Density Residential have a density range
                    of 12-16 dwelling units per net acre. Sites that are zoned Medium Density Residential have a
                    density range of 8-12 units per net acre. The Town’s Zoning Ordinance states that both the
                    High Density Residential district and the Medium Density Residential district are intended
                    for areas appropriate for multi-family housing. Typical dwelling units include townhouses,
                    apartments, row houses, and small apartment complexes. These areas were inventoried as
                    feasible for moderate-income residential development.
                   Above Moderate-Income Sites. All other sites, which allow only single family homes at
                    lower densities, were inventoried as above moderate-income units.
        Realistic Development Potential. The inventory assumes build-out of 85 percent of the maximum
         permitted by the Zoning Code for all sites except those zoned for Town Center and Boulevard
         Commercial (see Assumptions for Mixed Use Zoning below).

      Default density standard is the density “deemed appropriate” in State law to accommodate housing for lower-income
    households given the type of the jurisdiction. Windsor is considered a “suburban jurisdiction” with a default density
    standard of 20 units per acre. HCD is required to accept sites that allow for zoning at this density as appropriate for
    accommodating Windsor’s share of the regional housing need for lower-income households.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                                     Page 4-71

        Assumptions for Mixed Use Zoning. Mixed-use zoning allows for both residential and
         commercial uses. The following assumptions were used to account for non-residential uses on the
         sites:
                  Town Center. The maximum FAR in the Town Center zoning district is 2.5, inclusive of
                   housing. All sites zoned Town Center are located within the Windsor Station
                   Area/Downtown Specific Plan. In the Specific Plan, the Town used average FARs to
                   estimate that the Town Center zoning district will likely develop at roughly 22 units per acre
                   for mixed-use projects that include a residential component. This estimate takes the
                   commercial component into account and is in line with the density of a recent project
                   proposal in the area. The inventory relies on this estimate to derive total realistic
                   development potential in sites zoned Town Center.
                  Boulevard Commercial. The Boulevard Commercial zoning district allows up to 32 units
                   per acre. Projects may include commercial/office, commercial/residential, and
                   office/residential vertical mixed use. To account for the allowed commercial uses, the
                   inventory assumes build-out of 75 percent of the maximum residential density permitted by
                   the Zoning Code for sites zoned Boulevard Commercial. This estimate is in line with the
                   density of a recently approved project in this district.
Table 4.46 identifies vacant and underutilized sites that are available for residential development in Windsor.
The locations of these sites are shown in Figure 4.5. The sites identified in Table 4.46 can accommodate an
estimated 1,153 units. Of these units, 563 are affordable for lower-income households, 143 for moderate-
income households, and 447 for above moderate-income households. All of these sites are presently zoned
for residential or mixed uses and suitable for residential development. There are three sites that have
environmental constraints that could limit the development potential on the sites: Oak Park Street, Emery
Property, and Old Redwood Highway/South of Poole Creek. These biological constraints have been
accounted for in the capacity analysis and are discussed below. The descriptions below include information
on land use characteristics (existing uses, General Plan designation, and zoning) and the realistic development
capacity for each site.
Pleasant Avenue
This 17-acre site is designated Surrounding Residential in the General Plan and zoned Surrounding
Residential., which allows 3 to 6 units per acre. The site is currently in agricultural use, and contains one two-
story single family house with secondary buildings accessed by a driveway to the south of the site. The site is
suitable for development because it is large, primarily vacant, and flat. Assuming 85 percent of the maximum
capacity, this site can accommodate 87 single family homes, all of which are inventoried as above moderate-
income units.

Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Vinecrest Road
This 44-acre site is designated Surrounding Residential in the General Plan and zoned Surrounding
Residential, which allows 3 to 6 units per acre. The site is currently in agricultural use and contains one
accessory structure. Realistic development potential on a site of this size is 224 units, conservatively assuming
that 85 percent of the maximum capacity will occur. These units are inventoried as above moderate-income
units.
Windsor Road at Redwood Highway
This 3.9-acre site, made up of four adjacent parcels under common ownership, is designated Compact
Residential in the General Plan and zoned Compact Residential. The site is located within the Windsor
Station Area/Downtown Specific Plan and is a prime area for redevelopment. There are some marginal
industrial structures on the site, and there have been multiple applications for mixed-use projects on this site.
The site was included in the 2010 Housing Element as the Windsor Gateway project. The Windsor Gateway
project originally submitted an application to the Town in 2006, and after resubmitting a redesigned project,
the Town entered into an Allocation Agreement for the project in January 2010, requiring recordation of
maps and commencement of construction within two years. In 2011, the applicant requested, and was
granted, a two-year suspension for application processing due to economic conditions. In 2013, the applicant
was granted an additional 18-month suspension of time due to the changes in the economy and the need to
complete and evaluate reports and future development. Due to the uncertainty of this project, the absence of
any entitlements, and the lack of activity by the applicant, the site is included in the inventory as a
vacant/underutilized site.
The adoption of the Windsor Station Area/Downtown Specific Plan in 2012 rezoned the site to Compact
Residential, which allows up to 32 units per acre. Since the 2006 application was submitted before the Specific
Plan was adopted, the Town will allow the applicant to proceed with the original project proposal. However,
the most recent extension expires in March 2015, at which point applicants would need to resubmit a new
project consistent with the Compact Residential zoning and the design guidelines included in the Windsor
Station Area/Downtown Specific Plan. Given the lack of activity, the Housing Element assumes this will
happen. The realistic development potential on the site is 80 units, conservatively assuming that 85 percent of
the maximum capacity will occur. All 80 units are inventoried as lower-income households based on the
allowed density.
Oak Park Street
This 9-acre underutilized site is designated Village Residential and Medium-High Density Residential in the
General Plan and zoned Surrounding Residential (3 to 6 units per acre) and Medium Density Residential (8 to
12 units per acre). The site is vacant with one abandoned homestead on the western edge. Biological
constraints prevent the western edge of this site from fully developing. Due to constraints, only 5 acres,
zoned Medium Density Residential, are assumed to be available for development. Realistic development
potential on the site is 51 units, conservatively assuming that 85 percent of the maximum capacity will occur.
All 51 units are inventoried as available to moderate-income households based on the allowed density.
Cornell Street
This 5-acre vacant site is designated Surrounding Residential in the General Plan and zoned Surrounding
Residential, which allows 3 to 6 units per acre. Realistic development potential on this site is 25 units,
conservatively assuming that 85 percent of the maximum capacity will occur. All 25 units are inventoried as
above moderate-income units.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                  Page 4-73
Richardson Street
This 1.5-acre vacant site is designated Town Center/Mixed Use in the General Plan and zoned Town Center.
There is a partial application for this site that includes 37 rental apartment units over commercial. However,
since no formal application has been submitted as of July 2014, the site is treated as a vacant site for the
purpose of the sites inventory.
The Town Center zone is intended to accommodate a mix of retail, residential, office, and entertainment
uses. Residential uses are allowed but not required. The maximum FAR in the Town Center zoning district is
2.5, inclusive of residential floor area. In the Windsor Station Area/Downtown Specific Plan, the Town used
average FARs to estimate that the Town Center district will likely develop at roughly 22 units per acre for
projects that include a residential component. The proposed project is at a density slightly higher than this,
which supports the viability of high residential densities in this zone. Using the average density of 22 units per
acre assumed in the Specific Plan, realistic development potential on this site is 33 units. All 33 units are
inventoried as lower-income households based on the maximum FAR.
Emery Property
This 7.7-acre parcel is located within the Station Area/Downtown Specific Plan and has a zoning designation
of Medium Density Residential. The parcel, along with two other commercially designated parcels, is the site
of the now closed Windsor Waterworks and Slides water park. The three parcels would likely be developed as
one planned development. However, for the purposes of the RHNA, only the one residential parcel is
included in the inventory. There is currently (2014) an active RV park on part of the site. Due to
environmental constraints that include a creek on the north edge of the property and numerous oak trees, the
number of realistic units for this site were calculated based on 50 percent of the maximum allowed density
rather than 85 percent. Realistic development potential on the site is 46 units inventoried as available to
moderate-income households based on the allowed density.
Old Redwood Highway/South of Pool Creek
This site is made up of six parcels each under separate ownership. Five of the parcels are on the eastside of
Old Redwood Highway and are designated Village Residential. One parcel is on the west side of Old
Redwood Highway and is designated Surrounding Residential. The parcels all have single family residences,
but have significant development potential due to the location of the lots and the older construction. The
Village Residential parcels east of Old Redwood Highway will likely be assessable and developed as part of a
planned development. The Surrounding Residential parcel is participating in the Towns’ Merit process and is
proposing a higher density rental project at the site targeting the Village Residential densities. However, for
the purposes of the RHNA, this site is inventoried based on its current zoning. After accounting for
environmental constraints from Poole Creek, which runs across the northern edge of three of the parcels, the
sites consist of about 15.9 acres of developable land. Realistic development potential across the parcels is 88
units, conservatively assuming that 85 percent of the maximum capacity will occur. All 88 units are
inventoried as available to above moderate-income households based on the current allowed density.
Shiloh Vision Plan Area
In 2002 the Windsor Town Council approved the Shiloh Road Village Vision Plan. The Plan area includes 80
acres located along Shiloh Road between Highway 101 and Old Redwood Highway. The Plan calls for
relatively high-intensity mixed-use development following “New Urbanist” design principles. The Plan calls
for a variety of housing types at densities of up to 32 units per acre within a number of pedestrian-oriented
neighborhoods. In 2005 the Town Council adopted General Plan and Zoning Code amendments that
implement the Vision Plan.
Page 4-74                                                                                  Adopted January 7, 2015

Housing
Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Since the adoption of the Plan, two multifamily development projects have been approved within the Plan
area: Windsor Redwoods and the Esposti Park Apartments. Windsor Redwoods is constructed and occupied.
Esposti Park Apartments is included as an approved project in Table 4.45. Excluding these two projects and
environmentally constrained land, there are 26 acres remaining in the Plan area that are available for housing
development within the current (2014) Town Limits. Figure 4.6 shows the individual parcels and Plan
neighborhoods located within these 26 acres.
As shown in Table 4.46, the portion of the Shiloh Plan area within current (2014) Town Limits can
accommodate an estimated 519 units on vacant and underutilized sites. Of these total units, 450 are
inventoried as lower-income units, 46 are inventoried as moderate-income units, and 23 are inventoried as
above moderate-income units. The number of units conservatively assumes build-out at 85 percent of the
maximum permitted by the Zoning Code. Units identified as affordable to lower-income households are
provided for by sites zoned to allow residential densities of over 20 units per acre.
The Shiloh site, as identified in Figures 4.5 and 4.6, excludes portions of the Vision Plan where environmental
constraints are present. The southwest portion of the site, known as the Vicini site, is located within the 100-
year floodplain and contains wetland areas. The Vision Plan envisions up to 200 units in this area. However,
due to the presence of environmental constraints, these units are not included in the sites inventory for this
Housing Element.
All of the sites in this section were included in the 2010 Housing Element except parcel 161-171-039. This
parcel, located on the western edge of the Vision Plan area, was formerly approved for 136 units as the Shiloh
Sustainable Village Project. However, the project was stalled and the use permit expired. Therefore, this
parcel is included in the inventory as a vacant site. The parcel was included in the Shiloh Vision Plan as a part
of the Garden Apartments, Shiloh Townhomes, and Mixed Use neighborhoods.
The Shiloh site represents an ideal location for new affordable housing units in Windsor. The site is subject to
a Vision Plan which presents a community-based vision for the redevelopment of the area. Preparation of the
Vision Plan involved extensive public participation, including a multi-day design charette, a visual preference
survey, and numerous additional public meetings. Parcels within the Plan area are either vacant, partially
vacant, or substantially underutilized. Most importantly, the approval of two development projects in the Plan
area featuring multifamily projects demonstrates the viability of the Plan area for redevelopment within the
2014-2022 planning period. Additional information about each neighborhood within the Shiloh site, as shown
in Figure 4.6, is provided below.

  Realistic development potential assumes build-out at 85 percent of the maximum density permitted by the Zoning Code for all zones except Town Center and
Boulevard Commercial. For Town Center, the inventory relies on density assumptions used in Windsor Station Area/Downtown Specific Plan of 22 units per
acre. For Boulevard Commercial, the inventory assumes build-out at 75 percent of the maximum density permitted by the Zoning Code to account for
commercial uses.

Garden Apartments. Land within the Garden Apartments area is designated and zoned Compact
Residential, which allows a density of up to 32 units per acre. The Garden Apartments site is vacant. The
assumed realistic development potential of this area is 52 apartment units, all of which are inventoried as
lower-income.
Garden Cottages. Land within the Garden Cottages area is designated and zoned Village Residential, which
allows up to 8 units per acre. Approximately 2.6 acres of the 3.3 acre area is undeveloped. Developed
portions of the Garden Cottages neighborhood include three older residential units. The assumed realistic
development potential of the 3.3-acre area is 23 units, all of which are inventoried as above moderate-income.
Shiloh Townhomes. Land within the Shiloh Townhomes area is designated and zoned High Density
Residential, which allows up to 16 units per acre. Approximately 1.2 acres of the 3.4 acre area is undeveloped.
Developed portions of the Shiloh Townhomes area include three older residential units ripe. The assumed
realistic development potential of this 3.4 acre area is 46 townhomes, all of which are inventoried as
moderate-income.
Kendall Courtyards. Land within the 2.2 acre Kendall Courtyards area is designated and zoned Compact
Residential 24, which allows up to 24 units per acre. Developed portions of the Kendall Courtyards area
include six older residential structures. The assumed realistic development potential of this area is 46
townhomes, all of which are inventoried as lower-income.
Mixed Use. Land with the Mixed Use area is designated Boulevard Mixed Use in the General Plan and is
zoned Boulevard Commercial. Developed portions of the 14.7-acre Mixed Use area include nine residential
structures and structures associated with agricultural uses. The maximum permitted residential density in this
area is 32 units per acre. Projects may include Commercial/Office, Commercial Residential, and
Office/Residential vertical mixed use. To account for commercial components, the inventory assumes build-
out of 75 percent of the maximum permitted by the Zoning Code for sites zoned Boulevard Commercial.
This estimate is in line with the densities of approved projects in this district. The assumed realistic
development potential of this area is 563 multifamily dwelling units, all of which are inventoried as lower-
income.
Second Units
The Town of Windsor permits second units as-of-right in Estate Residential, Surrounding Residential, and
Village Residential zoning designations provided that the lot is occupied by one existing residential structure.
Zoning Code Section 27.34.180 establishes standards for second units in Windsor.
There were only six second units constructed during the 2007-2014 planning period, largely due to the lack of
overall development during the recession. The 2002-2007 housing element planning period, during which 28
second units were constructed, provides a more realistic prediction for how many second units might be
constructed during the 2014-2022 planning period. Because the Windsor Zoning Code limits the maximum
size of a second unit to 840 square feet, the Town assumes that monthly rents for second units are equivalent
to a 1 bedroom/1 bathroom unit or smaller. As shown in Table 4.15 of this Element, average rents in
Windsor in 2014 were estimated at $900 for a studio apartment and $1,200 for a 1BR/1BA. These rents are
affordable to lower-income households in Windsor.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                  Page 4-81
Based upon the number of new second units constructed during the 2002-2007 planning period, the Town
conservatively assumes that an average of three second units per year will be constructed in Windsor per year
during the 8.83-year planning period of January 1, 2014 to October 31, 2022. A total of 26 second units are
anticipated over the current planning period. Even though these units may be affordable to lower-income
households, the Housing Element conservatively assumes that these new second units will be moderate-
income for the purposes of the inventory.
Total Housing Resources
Table 4.47 summarizes Windsor’s ability to meet its housing needs for the 2014-2022 planning period.
Through units approved, planned, available residentially-zoned sites, and new second units Windsor can meet
its housing need for all income groups. In fact, Windsor provides sufficient sites to accommodate a 1,707 unit
surplus for this planning period.

Zoning for a Variety of Housing Types
State law requires the Housing Element to identify adequate sites for a variety of housing types, including
housing for farmworkers, mobilehomes, and factory-built housing, single-room occupancy units and
supportive housing.
Zoning for Emergency Shelters and Transitional Housing
State law requires Windsor to permit emergency shelters for the homeless without discretionary approval in at
least one zoning district in the town.
Windsor also is required to permit the development of transitional housing and supportive housing in all
zones allowing residential uses and to limit regulatory requirements for the approval of transitional housing
and supportive housing to the same requirements that apply to other forms of housing in the zone.
The Town amended the Zoning Ordinance in 2014 to allow emergency shelters in the Community
Commercial zone by right and in the Light Industrial (LI) zone with a use permit. The CC zoning district is
applied to areas appropriate for a range of local- and community-serving retail and commercial uses, including

restaurants, shops, and personal and business services. As such, areas zoned CC provide those who would use
an emergency shelter ready access to the goods and services (such as food, transit, and jobs) that are required
to regain self-sufficiency. The CC zone applies to a number of areas along the Town’s main corridor on Old
Redwood Highway. The Town has inventoried multiple vacant and/or underdeveloped sites zoned CC with a
total of 18.3 acres which represent sufficient capacity to accommodate at least one year-round shelter in
Windsor, as required by State law.

Farmworker Housing
As detailed in Section 4.3, Housing Needs Assessment, there is shortage of adequate housing for farmworkers
in Sonoma County. To help address this issue, the Town of Windsor permits agricultural worker housing by
right in the Community Commercial (CC), Heavy Industrial (HI), and Light Industrial (LI) zoning districts.
Sites zoned CC, HI, or LI apply to a number of areas within southwest Windsor. The Town has inventoried a
large portion of these zones as vacant and/or underdeveloped sites, representing sufficient capacity to
accommodate Windsor’s appropriate share of additional farmworker housing. Moreover, residentially-zoned
sites can also be used for farmworker housing, as illustrated by the Windsor Redwoods project, which
contains a farmworker family component. In addition, Program 6.A in the Housing Element calls for the
Town to cooperate with housing developers to secure additional funding for farmworker projects from
sources administered by the California Department of Housing and Community Development, including the
Farmworker Housing Grant Program, the State Office of Migrant Services, and the Federal Farmers Home
Administration.
The Employee Housing Act (Health and Safety Code Section 17021.5) require jurisdictions in California to
treat employee housing for six or fewer employees as a single family use and allow them wherever single
family uses are allowed. The Town does not regulate the occupancy of single family homes and complies with
this provision. State Law (Health and Safety Code Section 17021.6) also requires jurisdictions to treat
farmworker housing of no more than 12 units (or 36 beds in a group quarters) as an agricultural land use
subject to the same permit requirements for other agricultural uses in zones allowing agricultural uses. The
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                            Page 4-83

Town’s Zoning Ordinance allows crop production and horticulture as a permitted use in the Estate
Residential (ER), Light Industrial (LI), Heavy Industrial (HI), Open Space (OS), and Public/Institutional (PI)
zones; however, the Zoning Ordinance currently allows agricultural worker housing in two of these zones.
The Housing Element includes Program 6.B to update the Zoning Ordinance to fully comply with State law.
Mobile Houses and Factory-Built Housing
The Windsor Zoning Code permits mobilehomes and factory-built housing on any single family lot. Mobile
home parks are permitted with a Minor Use Permit in all residential zoning districts. In addition, this Housing
Element includes policies and programs to protect and promote mobilehomes as an important form of
affordable housing in Windsor. Policy 4.1 in the Housing Element calls for the preservation of Windsor’s
supply of mobilehome units as sources of nonsubsidized affordable housing, and for the Town to work with
developers to replace these units with very low- and low-income homes should any redevelopment of the
mobilehome parks occur and to provide priority placement to displaced residents. Program 4.A requires the
Town to continue to administer its Mobile Home Park Conversion and Program 4.B requires the Town to
continue to provide for the administration and enforcement of its Mobile Home Park Rent Stabilization
Ordinance. In late 2014, the Town plans to hire an outside contractor to administer its affordable housing
programs, including the Mobile Home Park Conversion Ordinance and Mobile Home Park Rent Stabilization
Ordinance. The Town will also continue to cooperate with the Sonoma County Community Development
Commission. In 2012, the Town approved Bell Village on the site of the former Windsorland mobile home
park. The approved project was conditioned to provide 77 (20 percent) low-income units and 77 (20 percent)
moderate-income units. However, the conditions of approval were amended in January 2014 to allow the
developer to pay the inclusionary housing in lieu fee rather than provide the 77 low-income units. The 77
moderate-income units are still required.
Multifamily Rental Housing
Multifamily housing is permitted in all residential and commercial zoning districts in Windsor, except for the
Estate Residential (RE) zone. Multifamily housing also is permitted in the Light Industrial (IL) zone. In the
commercial and IL zones, multifamily housing is allowed only on upper levels above non-residential ground
floor uses. To preserve existing multifamily rental housing in Windsor, Program 4.C of the Element calls for
the Town to monitor local trends in rental unit conversion and consider adoption of an ordinance which
would regulate the conversion of existing rental units to owner-occupancy. However, to date (2014) the
Town has no conversion requests.
Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Units
Single-room occupancy (SRO) units are a possible form of private affordable housing for lower-income
individuals, seniors, and persons with disabilities. SRO units are often small, between 200 to 350 square feet.
The Town is currently (2014) updating the Zoning Ordinance to explicitly allow SRO units in all zones that
allow multi-family housing, subject to specific development standards. To promote studio apartments and
SRO units as a form of affordable housing in Windsor, Policy 5.6 in the Housing Element calls for the Town
to continue to allow pairs of studio apartments of 500 square feet or less to be counted as one unit for
purposes of calculating densities and fees. The Town considers this fee reduction on a case-by-case basis. In
2008, the Town used Redevelopment funding to financially assist a specific project that had impact fees. This
project contained studio apartments.

Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Supportive Housing
Supportive housing is defined as permanent rental housing providing a range of services for seniors, people
with disabilities or long-term illnesses, farmworkers, and the formerly homeless. Services provided may
include medical and mental health care, vocational and employment services, substance abuse treatment,
childcare, and independent living skills training.
The Town of Windsor Zoning Ordinance describes zones where supportive housing is permitted. The
Zoning Ordinance currently (2014) distinguishes between supportive housing facilities with six or fewer
clients and facilities with seven or more clients. Supportive housing with up to six clients is permitted in all
residential zones in Windsor except for the Compact Residential (CR) zone. Supportive housing with seven
or more residents requires approval of a minor use permit. SB 2 mandates that the Town must not
differentiate between the number of persons within supportive housing units and must treat supportive
housing as a residential use subject to the same restrictions and permitting processes as other comparable
housing types in the same zones. Program 6.C of the 2010 Housing Element addressed this change to the
Town’s code to comply with SB 2. As described earlier, the Town updated the Zoning Ordinance in 2014 to
comply with SB 2 and allow supportive housing by right in residentially zoned areas.
SECTION 4.6                  HOUSING CONSTRAINTS AND INCENTIVES
This section addresses potential governmental and non-governmental constraints to new housing production
in Windsor. Specific policies and programs to address these constraints are outlined in the Housing
Objectives, Policies, and Programs section of this Housing Element Update. In addition, this section
summarizes opportunities for energy conservation, as they relate to new residential development in Windsor.
Governmental Constraints
This section outlines local governmental policies and regulations that can affect the cost of housing
production in Windsor.
Town Zoning Ordinance
Through its Zoning Ordinance, the Town of Windsor enforces minimum site development standards for new
residential uses. These include maximum number of dwelling units per acre, minimum lot size, lot width,
setbacks, and lot coverage; maximum building height; and minimum parking requirements. Table 4.49
summarizes development standards by zone. Table 4.50 describes the zoning districts in which residential
uses are allowed and the type of permit required for various housing types in those districts.
The Town’s residential zoning districts and their respective permitted densities are summarized below:
        ER (Estate Residential). This district is intended for areas suitable for single family residential
         development sited on larger land parcels. An acre of land will accommodate 0.2 to three units. The
         ER zoning district is consistent with the Estate Residential land use classification of the General
         Plan.
        SR (Surrounding Residential). Appropriate for a mixture of housing types, this low-density district
         is intended for single family residences; however, duplexes and triplexes are encouraged within the
         allowable density range. An acre of land will accommodate three to six dwelling units. The SR zoning
         district is consistent with the Surrounding Residential land use classification of the General Plan.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                 Page 4-85

          VR (Village Residential). This transitional-density district bridges lower-density SR and ER
           residential districts A mixture of housing types is allowed in these smaller lots, incorporating five to
           eight dwelling units per acre. The lower end of the density range may be appropriate adjacent to the
           SR or ER zoning districts with the higher end of the range being appropriate near neighborhood
           centers, parks, and transit stops. The VR zoning district is consistent with the Village Residential land
           use classification of the General Plan.
          MDR (Medium Density Residential). This medium-density district is intended for areas
           appropriate for multi-family housing, and allows for a variety of housing types, including single
           family residences, row houses, townhomes, and small apartment complexes. Typically sited near
           activity centers and along major thoroughfares, MDR zoning allows eight to 12 dwelling units per
           acre. The MDR zoning district is consistent with the Medium-High Density Residential land use
           classification of the General Plan.
          HDR (High Density Residential). The HDR zoning district is intended for areas appropriate for
           high-density, multi-family housing. Townhomes and apartment complexes are permitted in high-
           density zoning district, which allows 12 to 16 units per acre. The HDR zoning district is consistent
           with the High Density Residential land use classification of the General Plan.
          CR (Compact Residential). The CR zoning district is intended for areas of compact high density
           housing, especially in association with nearby mixed use development and near transit corridors or
           stops. Units typically include apartments, condominiums, and townhomes. In limited circumstances,
           schools, parks, and other public facilities may be provided to serve the residential community. The
           allowable density ranges from 12 to 24 units per acre for CR-24 zoned sites to 12 to 32 units per acre
           for CR-32 zoned sites. The CR zoning districts are consistent with the Compact Residential land use
           classification of the General Plan.
In addition to these residential zoning districts, all commercial zoning districts permit multifamily dwellings in
a mixed-use structure with a use permit or minor use permit only above the second floor of a non-residential-
use building, except in the Town Center Commercial (TC) Entertainment Overlay District. Live-work
facilities are permitted by right in all commercial districts, with the exception of the GC district, in which they
require a use permit. The Town’s commercial zoning districts are summarized below:
          NC (Neighborhood Center Commercial). This district is appropriate for commercial
           thoroughfares, and is often located adjacent to medium-density MDR zoning districts. Retail, child
           care, and public uses may be incorporated into either the site or building. The NC zoning district is
           consistent with the Neighborhood Center/Mixed Use land use classification of the General Plan.
          CC (Community Commercial). The CC district permits a range of local- and community-serving
           retail and service land uses, including restaurants, shops, and personal and business services. The CC
           zoning district is consistent with the Retail Commercial and General Business land use classifications
           of the General Plan.

Housing
Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
       TC (Town Center Commercial).This district is intended to provide attractive areas within the Old
        Town where the community can socialize, shop, recreate, and live. This zoning district includes
        diverse, compatible land uses that can be developed on the same site, and where desirable, in the
        same building. High-density residential complexes may be incorporated with retail, public uses,
        hotels, and office buildings. The TC zoning district is consistent with the Town Center/Mixed Use
        land use classification of the General Plan.
       SC (Service Commercial). The CS districts consist of land intensive personal and business services
        such as auto repair shops, equipment sales, service stations, and outdoor recreational uses. The SC
        zoning district is consistent with the Service Commercial land use classification of the General Plan.
       GC (Gateway Commercial). Located near heavily-trafficked areas, such as freeways, these districts
        are visually prominent entryways into town, with region-serving commercial land uses, including
        retail and tourist-related uses. The GC zoning district is consistent with the Gateway Commercial
        land use classification of the General Plan.
       BC (Boulevard Commercial). The BC district incorporates mixed-use development with extensive
        pedestrian-oriented frontage on a built-up boulevard street. This destination-center is often located
        near transit stops, and is intended to serve local residents and businesses. Compatible land uses
        include public facilities or plazas, residential, retail, office, and childcare. The BC zoning district is
        consistent with the Boulevard Mixed Use land use classification of the General Plan.
       RC (Regional Mixed-Use). Regional commercial centers provide residents, visitors, and regional-
        residents with a convenient one-stop for residential, shopping, visitor-serving, and institutional uses.
        This district allows a mix of diverse and compatible land uses including public facilities, plazas, retail,
        higher density residential, hotel, motel, conference, health services and offices. The RC zoning
        district is consistent with the Regional Mixed Use land use classification of the General Plan.
As outlined below, the Town’s industrial zoning districts also allow residential uses to a more limited extent,
including agricultural worker housing, caretaker housing, live-work facilities, and multi-family dwelling in a
mixed-use project.
       BPI (Industrial/Business Park). The BPI zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for light
        industrial and business park land uses, including low-intensity manufacturing and assembly processes,
        research and development, and corporate headquarters offices. Land uses in this district are often
        organized as a business park, with tenants that may include some commercial activities. This district
        allows both live-work housing and caretaker housing with a minor use permit. The BPI zoning
        district is consistent with the Light Industrial land use designation of the General Plan.
       LI (Light Industrial). Light industrial uses in this district will not create objectionable noise, smoke,
        odor, dust, noxious gases, glare, heat, vibration, or industrial waste. As such, multifamily housing is
        permitted in a mixed-use format with a use permit, caretaker housing and live-work facilities are
        permitted with a minor use permit, and agricultural worker housing is permitted by right. This district
        allows live-work housing with a minor use permit. The LI zoning district is consistent with the Light
        Industrial land use designation of the General Plan.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                    Page 4-87

       HI (Heavy Industrial).The HI zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for a wider variety of
        land uses that are more land-intensive manufacturing uses than allowed in the LI district. These
        include industrial manufacturing, warehousing, offices, and assembly that may generate objectionable
        noise, smoke, odor, dust, noxious gases, glare, heat, vibration, and industrial wastes. Agricultural
        worker housing is permitted and caretaker housing is permitted with a minor use permit. The HI
        zoning district is consistent with the Heavy Industrial land use designation of the General Plan.
       PI (Public Institutional). This is a special purpose zoning district and is applied to areas
        appropriate for public facilities, utilities, and public gathering facilities including: public schools,
        libraries, and government offices. This district allows residential care homes with a use permit and
        caretaker housing with a minor use permit.
Based on interviews with local affordable- and market-rate developers, the town’s zoning regulations appear
comparable to those in other communities, and most do not pose any undue constraints to housing
development in Windsor. In fact, one developer praised Windsor’s progressive development standards in and
around the downtown, as they allow for higher densities and heights and more contemporary residential
product types.

Parking
Excessive parking requirements may serve as a constraint on housing development by increasing
development costs and reducing the amount of land available for additional units or project amenities such as
child care, open space, and attractive design components. As shown in Table 4.51, residential parking
requirements vary by housing type. In 2013 the Town reduced the parking requirements for second units to
only one space per unit.

According to some multifamily housing developers, Windsor’s parking standards are relatively high in
comparison with other Sonoma County cities. One developer suggested that 1.7 spaces per unit is a generally
accepted standard for multifamily affordable housing in many communities, and that their projects in
Windsor have required on average three spaces per unit. To alleviate these concerns, in accordance with the
State density bonus law, the Town offers flexible parking standards to mixed-use and affordable housing
projects by evaluating projects on a case-by-case basis to determine if shared parking and/or reduced parking
is feasible. State density bonus law allows projects with at least five percent very low-income units or 10
percent low- or moderate-income units to qualify for parking requirement reductions. As an example of the
application of this policy in Windsor, the Windsor Redwoods received a density bonus of 20 units and a
parking reduction from 2.5 spaces per unit to 1.7 spaces per unit. Section 27.30.050 of Zoning Ordinance
provides for parking reduction through approval of a Minor Use Permit, which is an administrative action.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                    Page 4-91

Town Design Standards
In addition to Windsor’s Zoning Ordinance, in 1997, the Town adopted Design Standards to establish a
vision for how the Town’s physical character shapes the public realm. The Standards serve as a bridge
between the goals, policies, and programs set forth in the General Plan and the requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance. While the Standards are not prescribed requirements, they serve as a basis for project approval
during design review. Projects may propose an alternative means of achieving a given standards if they
demonstrate that the basic intent of the standards can be met. Exemptions may apply to encourage infill
development or where existing conditions physically preclude conformance.
Tree Preservation and Protection Ordinance
In 2007, the Town adopted a Tree Preservation and Protection Ordinance that regulates protection,
preservation, maintenance, and removal of protected trees. This Ordinance aims for “no net loss” of the
canopy of protected trees and requires a replacement tree for all protected trees that are approved for
removal. If development sites are insufficient in size or use to plant any or all replacement trees, the Town
accepts in-lieu fees which are applied to the Town’s Oak Tree Fund.
For development sites with significant canopy coverage, these mitigation requirements can impose a
constraint on development feasibility. According to local developers, on-site replacement is frequently
considered a more financially feasible mitigation option, but development sites are often not large enough to
accommodate the required number of trees. This compels developers to contribute in-lieu fees to the Oak
Tree Fund, which can affect the financial feasibility of a project.
Growth Controls
In January 1998, the Town of Windsor enacted an Urban Growth Boundary (UGB), also known as Measure
A. The UGB extends until 2017 and is designed to accommodate all of the units projected for the time
horizon of the General Plan (2015). Policy B.5.1 in the Community Development Chapter of the General
Plan allows expansion of the UGB by no more than 10 acres per year if necessary for the provision of very
low- and low-income housing to meet Windsor’s share of regional housing need and if other land is not
available within the UGB.
In 1997, due to concerns about rapid growth, the Town Council enacted a Growth Control Ordinance (last
amended in 2012). The Growth Control Ordinance limits residential unit growth to two to three percent per
year. In practice, the actual growth rate could be higher than two to three percent, based on waived and
exempted units and previously approved projects.
Under the Growth Control Ordinance, each year the Town Council establishes the number of growth control
allocations to be reserved. The number of allocations is set based on the findings and determinations in the
Annual Growth Control Report. This report reviews the status and capacity of infrastructure; the fiscal
conditions of the Town; the status of housing production; recommended development incentives; and
recommendations regarding modifications of the Growth Control Ordinance. The annual allocation also
accounts for the number of entitled units in the development pipeline. It is not a formulaic allocation, but
rather one based on demand (i.e., entitled projects). In effect, this process helps assure that there is a
sufficient allocation to meet demand from builders. Table 4.52 shows trends in approved projects, allocations,
and exemptions and waivers over time. Note that in 2007 moderate-income developments were exempted
from the allocation requirement.

All residential dwelling units must obtain reserved growth control allocations unless the units are exempt or if
the developer obtains a waiver. Developers requesting reserved growth control allocations must submit an
application to the Town. Allocation applications are reviewed through a merit process which evaluates criteria
such as:
         the number of units meeting existing RHNA targets;
         the project’s contribution to infill development and whether it is located in a priority area;
         opportunities for walking and bicycling;
         whether it is located in an area that requires hazardous mitigation;
         the project’s sustainable design features; and
         the project’s proposed density (higher density is given preference).
The Town releases reserved allocations upon final discretionary approval of the project. Allocations are tied
to the project and its entitlements. Thus, they can only be used for the project in which they were initially
meant to serve and which received necessary entitlements. Any unused allocations expire and new projects
would need to reapply for allocations in the same manner as all other new projects.
The following types of units are not required to obtain reserved growth control allocations:
         Second Dwelling Units;
         Very Low/Low/Moderate-Income Units (up to 30 moderate-income are exempt in any one year);
         Previously Approved Projects (projects that were approved prior to 1997); and
         Single Units.
The Town also issues “priority waivers” for units beyond the allocation. This is done primarily in the
Downtown area. However, the Town can, by resolution, establish additional “priority development areas”
where developers may request a waiver. In addition, the Town can establish a pre-determined quantity of
allocations for small projects of up to four new residential units as an incentive for infill residential
development. According to Town Council Resolution 2171-07, there are a total of 12 allocations available
annually for these small projects. Otherwise, if there are no allocations available for a project or if there are
not sufficient allocations for an entire project, the project is put on a waiting list. A project can only be
developed with a full allocation. The Growth Control Ordinance does not constrain the development of very
low-, low-, or moderate-income units. As such, the Ordinance is not seen as a significant constraint on the
production of very low- to moderate-income units. While the Growth Control Ordinance does limit the
number of above moderate-income units, the annual allocations are sufficient to allow for the annual need of
approximately 21.5 above moderate-income units assigned by the RHNA.
Inclusionary Housing
In 2004, the Town of Windsor adopted an Inclusionary Housing Requirement (Chapter 27.23) as part of its
Zoning Ordinance. Originally, the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance required developers of five or more units
to set aside 20 percent of units as moderate-income, 15 percent as low-income, or 10 percent as very low-
income. The Town amended the ordinance in 2008 and 2009 to provide more flexibility and reduce the
requirements. As currently adopted, developers building 10 or more housing units are required to provide for
affordable housing, as follows: 10 percent of units set aside for moderate-income households, 7.5 set aside for
Page 4-94                                                                                    Adopted January 7, 2015

Housing

low-income households, or 5 percent set aside for very low-income households. The units must remain
affordable in perpetuity for rental units, and for the longest feasible time, but not less than 45 years, for
owner units. At the resale of an affordable owner unit, the affordability period of not less than 45 years shall
be renewed.
Although concerns exist that inclusionary housing may constrain production of market-rate homes, studies
have shown evidence to the contrary. The cost of an inclusionary housing requirement must ultimately be
borne by either (1) developers through a lower return, (2) landowners through decreased land values, or (3)
other homeowners through higher market-rate sale prices. In fact, the cost of inclusionary housing and any
                                                                                                         5
other development fee “will always be split between all players in the development process.” However,
academics have pointed out that, over the long term, it is probable that landowners will bear most of the
costs of inclusionary housing, not other homeowners or the developer (Mallach 1984, Hagman 1982,
Ellickson 1985).
In addition, a 2004 study on housing starts between 1981 and 2001 in communities throughout California
with and without inclusionary housing programs evidences that inclusionary housing programs do not lead to
a decline in housing production. In fact, the study found that housing production actually increased after
                                                                                                                            6
passage of local inclusionary housing ordinances in cities as diverse as San Diego, Carlsbad, and Sacramento.
Despite these findings, the Town of Windsor recognizes the need for a financially feasible program that does
not constrain production. As described above, the Town recently amended its Inclusionary Housing
Ordinance in 2008 to reduce the requirements and allow developers to satisfy their inclusionary housing
requirement through payment of an in-lieu fee, land donation, or off-site construction. The in lieu fee is
calculated on a per square foot basis, based on the square footage of the market-rate units and was established
in 2009:
          A minimum per unit in lieu fee of $2,000 shall apply for units up to 1,000 square feet;
          For units of 1,000 square feet, the fee shall be $2.00 per square foot;
          For larger units, the fee per square foot shall increase by $0.015 per 50 square feet, or fraction
           thereof.
The fee is adjusted annually to account for inflation. The Town also offers a series of developer incentives,
per State Density Bonus Law, that help offset the added cost of the inclusionary units. The Town’s
Inclusionary Housing Ordinance also allows for developers to seek modification of the requirements due to
undue hardship. These policies are in line with recommendations in On Common Ground: Joint Principles on
Inclusionary Housing Policies, published by the Non-Profit Housing Association of Northern California (NPH)
and the Home Builders Association of Northern California (HBA) in 2005. The report points to the need for
flexible inclusionary housing requirements, such as those established by Windsor, to allow for financially
feasible residential development.

Housing
Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Within the Town of Windsor, developers of new residential projects also pay various impact fees to finance
improvements to infrastructure and public facilities needed to serve new housing. Development impact fees
shown in Table 4.54, except for the school impact fee, are assessed on a per-unit basis and are not adjusted
for the size of the unit. However, amounts do vary based on building use, meter size, front footage, and
average daily trips generated. Development impact fees can total over $57,480 for a single family unit, which
is approximately 15 percent of total development costs, and over $38,016 per unit for multifamily

Interviews with local developers indicate that the Town’s permitting and impact fees remain comparable to
other Sonoma County communities, as seen in Table 4.55. While these fees do impact the feasibility of new
residential development, developers are familiar with them, and can incorporate these costs into their
preliminary pro-formas and land purchase negotiations. As such, they are not perceived by developers as
undue constraints to production. Moreover, it is recognized that the impact fees, in particular, pay for
valuable public infrastructure and services that serve residential development in the town.
In addition to fees that support infrastructure and public facilities, fees for habitat mitigation can reach up to
$1,600,000 per acre depending on the species conservation area. These fees are discussed in detail below
under the section titled “Environmental Quality Constraints.”

Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Processing and Permit Procedures
Table 4.56 shows the permits required for different housing projects, while Table 4.57 describes the
approximate time required and the reviewing body for the Town’s various permitting procedures. As
described below, the entitlement process can impact housing production costs, with lengthy processing of
development applications adding to financing costs. As such, the Town will consider expediting the review
for developments offering lower and moderate-income housing as an incentive to production. In general,
however, developers interviewed in the past indicated that the Town’s entitlement timeline is largely in line
with other jurisdictions in the area.
In terms of processing and approval of residential uses by zone, Appendix E lists the necessary permit
requirements of various housing types within each of the Town’s relevant zoning districts. Table 4.57 then
outlines the typical timelines for each permit requirement.
Building Permit
Plan check and actual building permit issuance takes approximately three to five weeks after submittal of
plans with planning approval. An additional one to two weeks may be required if the plans require revision.
Once a building permit is issued, construction may commence immediately. Minor use permits generally
require a six- to eight-week review period, and conditional use permits require an eight- to twelve-week
review period.
With the exception of Design Review, Windsor's processing and permit procedures are reasonable and
comparable to those in other California communities. The permit process only increases in complexity and
duration when the circumstances of individual projects warrant extra consideration on the part of local staff
and officials. This is especially true of the environmental review component of the process. However, the
Town of Windsor has little flexibility to change this, since the California Environmental Quality Act specifies
procedures that local jurisdictions must observe in reviewing the impacts of development projects.
As described in Section 4.5, Sites Inventory and Analysis, the Town’s remaining need for lower-income
households is expected to be accommodated in the TC, CR, BC, and HDR zoning districts. These districts
have an emphasis on residential and mixed-use development; multifamily housing is a permitted use in CR,
CB, and HDR districts, and requires a use permit in the VR district. As such, the Town’s permitting and
processing procedures in these areas are expected to conform to the timelines in Table 4.56 and Table 4.57,
and would not experience an undue delay in entitlement.
Subdivision Approval.
The Town of Windsor's subdivision process follows the statutory requirements of the State Subdivision Map
Act, which ensures that local jurisdictions adhere to a reasonable time schedule when acting on subdivision
applications. According to the Subdivision Map Act, local jurisdictions must approve or deny a subdivision
application within one year if an EIR is required, and within six months if a negative declaration or automatic
approval is possible.
The subdivision approval process could lengthen further due to several factors. If the project would
potentially create environmental impacts, the Town may determine that an EIR must be prepared before
acting on the application. If an EIR is required, the process could be lengthened up to approximately one
year, depending on the scope of the required EIR.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                Page 4-99

Design Review for Multifamily and Mixed-Use Projects
Chapter 27.42.030 of the Zoning Ordinance requires Site Plan and Design Review approval for residential
projects of two or more dwellings within a Planned Development (PD) or multifamily zoning district. In
addition, substantial changes or intensifications of land use require a site plan and design review. Mixed-use
projects are subject to the same Design Review and permitting requirements as multifamily developments.
Since Design Review for projects of 11 or more dwelling units requires Planning Commission review, this
process has the potential to considerably slow down the approval process for multifamily projects designed
for lower-income households. In fact, local developers have commented on the Town’s lengthy design review
process as a notable cost during the development process. In response to this constraint, under Program 5.A
of the Housing Element, the Town will evaluate current design review guidelines to identify better
requirements and approval procedures.

Codes and Enforcement
New construction in Windsor must comply with the 2013 California Building Code, which was adopted with
no major revisions. Therefore, there are no extraordinary building regulations that would adversely affect the
ability to construct housing in Windsor.
Due to limited staff capacity, the Town conducts code enforcement primarily on a case-by-case basis as
requested by neighbor complaints. While Windsor has not developed a formal rehabilitation program, the
Town is participating in a countywide program called the Sonoma County Energy Independence Program
that allows property owners to finance energy efficiency, water efficiency, and renewable energy
improvements through a voluntary assessment.
On/Off Site Improvement Standards
The Town of Windsor requires developers to complete certain minimum site improvements in conjunction
with new housing development. Required on-site improvements include grading and installation of water,
sewer, storm drainage, gas, electricity, and cable utilities. Required off-site improvements include curbs,
gutters, sidewalks, full street sections, and street lighting. Along subdivision edges that face collector or
arterial streets, the Town requires construction of one-half plus 10 feet of the road section along the length of
the frontage. The Town also requires developers to install any necessary landscaped buffer strips (typically 20
feet wide with sound walls) between the back property line of homes and arterial or collector streets.
Based on conversations with local developers, these site improvement standards are typical of many
communities, and do not adversely affect housing production in Windsor. Again, developers can include
these costs in preliminary proformas, and account for them in their site acquisition costs.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
In addition to the analysis of person with disabilities in Section 4.3, Housing Needs Assessment, the
discussion below highlights the potential governmental constraints to development, improvement, and
maintenance of housing for this special needs population.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                  Page 4-101
Reasonable Accommodation
The Town amended the Municipal Code in 2014 to adopt an ordinance that will provide individuals with
disabilities reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, practices, and procedures that might be necessary to
ensure equal access to housing. It was reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission in July and
adopted by the Town Council in September 2014.
Zoning and Other Land Use Regulations
To identify any zoning or other land-use regulatory practices that could discriminate against persons with
disabilities and impede the availability of housing for this special needs population, the Housing Element
reviews existing zoning laws, policies, and practices for compliance with fair housing law.
The following are examples of ways in which the Town facilitates housing for persons with disabilities
through its regulatory and permitting process:
         As per the State Health and Safety Code (Sections 1267.8, 1566.3, and 1568.08), the Town permits
          residential care with six or fewer clients in all residential zoning districts by right. Residential care and
          supportive housing facilities with seven or more clients are required to acquire a minor use permit to
          locate in residential zoning districts.
         Residential care homes are permitted on second or higher floors, above nonresidential uses in all
          commercial zoning districts, except the service commercial and gateway commercial districts, with a
          minor use permit.
         In special purpose zoning districts, residential care homes are allowed in Public/Institutional
          Districts with a use permit.
         The Town’s Zoning Code stipulates that all mixed-use residential units shall be located on second or
          higher floors. Accessible residential units (as defined by the Town’s adopted Building Code) that
          comply with ADA requirements may be located on the ground floor.
         Parking spaces for the disabled are required to be in compliance with the Uniform Building Code
          (UBC). These spaces count toward fulfilling the off-street parking requirements.
         Parking requirements for residential care facilities are less than those required for other residential
          development. The requirement is two spaces for facilities with six or fewer clients. For facilities with
          seven or more clients, the Town requires one space for each two residential units, plus one space for
          each four units for guests and employees.
         The current Zoning Ordinance does not include regulations regarding the siting or separation of
          special needs housing such as group homes.
Building Codes and Permitting
The Town’s Building Code does not include any amendments to the Uniform Building Code that might
diminish the ability to accommodate persons with disabilities.
The Town’s Building Code stipulates that one time alterations or additions made solely for the purpose of
complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act are exempt from requirements for newly constructed
buildings.

Housing
Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Non-Governmental Constraints
Land Costs
In most real estate markets, approximately 25 percent of housing costs are attributable to land costs. Most of
this cost is land speculation, although land costs are also affected by zoning density, the availability of
infrastructure, the existence or absence of environmental constraints, and the relative amount of similar land
available for development
Current (April 2014) land values for seven properties in online listings range from $53,267 to $380,769 per
acre with an average price per acre of $235,159. The lots ranged from 0.26 acres to 26 acres, and were priced
from $99,000 to $4,500,000. One of the parcels included in the sites inventory, Oak Park Subdivision, is a
9.75 acre parcel listed in 2014 for $4 million (or $410,000 per acre).
Countering higher construction costs is a trend towards smaller residential lots. The land cost per developed
unit can also be lowered through the development of high-density housing.
Construction Costs
In 2014 RS Means (a reliable published source for construction industry costs) estimated that the hard
construction costs in the Santa Rosa area were $186 per square foot for a typical one- to three-story multi-
family residential construction with wood siding and frames and a floor area of 22,500. Based on the
International Code Council Building Valuation Data, a one- and two-family residential construction would
cost approximately $118 per square foot. This equals a rough estimate of $186,000 in construction costs for a
1,000 square foot apartment and $236,000 for a 2,000 square foot single family home.
Financing Costs
Mortgage interest rates have a large influence on the affordability of housing. Higher interest rates increase a
homebuyer’s monthly payment and decrease the range of housing that a household can afford. When interest
rates rise, the market typically compensates by decreasing housing prices. Similarly, when interest rates
decrease, housing prices begin to rise. There is often a lag in the market, causing housing prices to remain
high when interest rates rise until the market catches up. Lower-income households often find it most
difficult to purchase a home during this time period. Mortgage rates have steadily declined since 2007, and hit
a historic low in 2013 at 3.41 percent for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. In 2013 interest rates started to
increase, but still remain historically low as of 2014.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                  Page 4-103

Total Development Costs
Table 4.58 shows a rough estimate of the total development cost for a 2,000 square foot single family home
on a 5,000 square foot lot in the Town of Windsor. Based on the assumptions described below, a typical
2,000 square foot home would cost around $380,000 to build, including land costs, construction costs, site
improvements, and impact fees.

Housing
Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Environmental Constraints
Potential environmental constraints to housing development in Windsor include the presence of flood
hazards and noise impacts from the Sonoma County Airport.
Areas in Windsor subject to flood hazards are primarily located near the five creeks within the town. The
Windsor General Plan identifies land within the 100-year floodplain of these creeks as Flood Hazard Areas. A
portion of the Vicini site is designated as a Flood Hazard Areas and is subject to the regulations of the
Floodplain Combining District. The Floodplain Combining District prohibits development in the floodway
of a creek but allows development in the floodway fringe with the incorporation of mitigation measures to
reduce risk to the public. The Vicini site has not been included in the sites inventory for this planning period.
The Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport is located to the south of the Town of Windsor. Areas within
airport safety zones are subject to limited residential densities. None of the sites identified in Table 4.59 are
located within an airport safety zone.
Floodplain
A 100-year flood is the level of flood water expected to be equaled or exceeded every 100 years on average.
The 100-year flood, which is the standard used by most federal and state agencies, is used by the National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) as the standard for floodplain management and to determine the need for
flood insurance. The Federal Insurance Administration identified areas of special flood hazard in the Flood
Insurance Rate and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps for Windsor. The Flood Hazard Overlay District
identified in the Windsor Zoning Ordinance is based on these maps and is distributed throughout the Town
along various open space corridors and existing development in residential, commercial, and industrial
districts.
Areas of special flood hazard in Windsor are subject to the Town’s Flood Plain Management Ordinance
which requires all new constructions, improvements, additions, or repairs to existing structures, to obtain a
development permit if it is located in any area of special flood hazard. Permit approval is contingent on
required flood-proofing standards. Development permits must specify the flood-proofing methods for the
proposed structure and describe the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of
proposed development.
With the exception of the southeast corner of the Town, due to the built-out nature of the areas subject to
the Town’s Flood Hazard Overlay, the Flood Plain Management Ordinance will only minimally affect new
residential development.
Airport Influence Zone
The Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport is a primary air carrier airport located in unincorporated
Sonoma County immediately south of the Town of Windsor. A mixture of commercial/industrial and open
space provides a buffer between the airport and residential areas in Windsor. The primary flight pattern
extends northwesterly of the airport, over the western portion of the Town's Sphere of Influence.
Noise Exposure
The State of California Noise Standard applies the 65 decibel (dB) Community Noise Equivalent Level
(CNEL) contour to define an airport's noise impact area. Windsor’s Public Health and Safety Element
contains three policies that deal with airport and residential compatibility. These include:
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                  Page 4-105

        Policy D.1.3. The Town should require new residential projects to provide for an interior CNEL of
         45 dB or less due to exterior noise sources. To accomplish this, all residential and other noise
         sensitive land uses within the 60 dB contours should be reviewed to ensure that adequate noise
         attenuation has been incorporated into the design of the project, or that other measures are proposed
         to protect future “sensitive receptors.”
        Policy D.1.4. The Town should not permit residential development within the 60 dB contour of the
         Sonoma County Airport
        Policy D.2. The Town shall require appropriate mitigation measures for new development proposed
         with the airport’s 65 CNEL contour.
        Policy D.3. Applications for new noise-sensitive development within the 60 CNEL contour shall be
         accompanied by an acoustical analysis.
According to the 2010 Noise Exposure Map in the Sonoma County Comprehensive Airport Land Use Plan,
the highest CNEL expanding into the Town limits is the 60 CNEL contour. The only areas where a 60
CNEL contour is present are a small portion of the southwest corner of the Windsor Golf Course and a
small portion of existing residential development immediately north of Reiman Lane. Therefore, airport noise
will generally not affect new residential development.
Safety Zones
The Comprehensive Airport Land Use Plan for Sonoma County also identifies a series of airport safety zones
where residential densities are limited to reduce risks to persons on the ground. These zones, which extend to
varying degrees from the Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport, limit densities to 0.2 to five dwelling
units per acre. These zones also require a minimum amount of useable open space to minimize risks to
people on board aircraft and limit damage to property in the event of a forced landing.
The safety zones around the Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport extend to cover a significant portion
of the southwest corner of the Town of Windsor, thereby limiting higher density residential development in
these areas. However, this part of Windsor is largely built out with single family homes, the Windsor Golf
Club, and the Town’s Wastewater Treatment Plant. Few development sites remain in these areas. As such, the
airport safety zones do not represent a significant constraint to new housing development in Windsor.
Infrastructure Constraints
As described below, water supply is a potential constraint for new residential development. However,
additional infrastructure needed for new residential development, such as storm water and wastewater
systems, are anticipated to be adequate to serve housing constructed to meet Windsor’s housing need for this
planning period (2014-2022).
Water Supply and Future Demands
The Town of Windsor’s water supply comes from four primary sources: the Russian River Well Field (known
collectively as the Town’s riverbank wells), a local groundwater well, surface water from the Russian River
delivered via the Santa Rosa Aqueduct, and recycled water. The majority of water demands are met by
Russian River water. Windsor’s water system is made up of five large wells located adjacent to the Russian
River (riverbank wells), one active off-river well, two emergency wells, a direct connection to the Sonoma
County Water Agency aqueduct, and 16 reservoirs.
Page 4-106                                                                                Adopted January 7, 2015

Housing
Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
The supply of potable water represents a possible constraint on the production of any significant quantities of
new housing, especially housing constructed at densities that could be affordable to lower- and moderate-
income households. Currently (2014), the Town has enough supply capacity to meet demands. However,
demands are expected to exceed current supplies sometime around the year 2020. After 2020, the Town is
projected to begin experiencing a supply deficit if additional supplies are not brought on-line.
The Town of Windsor Water Master Plan, adopted in 2011, establishes a Capital Improvement Program
(CIP) for Windsor by analyzing the water distribution system under projected future demands at build-out
and demand increases due to population growth over time. The 2011 Water Master Plan recommends that
projects are phased out through the year 2035 in order to plan for adequate funding. Phase 1 projects were
projects completed in 2010. Phase 2 projects include projects that are to be built between the year 2010 and
2015. Phase 3 projects are projects to be built between the year 2015 and 2020. Phase 4 projects include
projects to be built between the year 2020 and 2035.
The 23 projects that the 2011 Water Master Plan recommends include purchasing additional water from
Sonoma County Water Agency or other water suppliers, improving the efficiency of existing supplies and
infrastructure (expanding use of recycled water), developing supplemental sources of water, and enacting
additional conservation and/or emergency restrictions on the Town‘s customers. By carrying out all of the
projects proposed in the 2011 Water Master Plan, future projected demands through the year 2035 – which
take into account new residential development and increased population growth – will be met.
Although the capital improvement projects will provide adequate water supply to serve new development
identified in the Housing Element, water storage capacity needs are still being verified. Public Works is
currently (2014) preparing a Water Tank Siting Study to determine the most favorable location to construct a
new storage tank based on multiple selection criteria including hydraulic compatibility, cost, and
environmental impact. The Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) identified 1.5 MG of storage deficit,
and the Study will validate overall storage requirements for current and future scenarios. Currently, the Town
has approximately 5.4 million gallons of storage including 3.0 million gallons at the Lakewood site and 2.0
million gallons at the Shiloh site. The 5-year water CIP includes budgetary allocation for a new tank to
increase potable storage capacity.
The Town’s Water Conservation Program implements a number of California Urban Water Conservation
Council Best Management Practices (BMPs) to limit demands on the community water system. Conservation
measures include residential and commercial conservation programs, new development standards, building
efficiency retrofitting, water system audits, landscape conservation incentives, appliance efficiency rebate
programs, public information programs, and a water reclamation facility that provides recycled water to
irrigate agricultural lands, recreational facilities, schools, and residential yards.
The Town’s use of recycled water has successfully limited the amount of water that is drawn from potable
water resources. Connection to the Geysers Project in 2011 enabled the Town to provide recycled water to
the geysers thermal plant. This connection enables the Town to meet NPDES discharge requirements. Per
State requirements (Chapter 727, Statutes of 2005, SB 1087), the Town will immediately furnish local water
and sewer service providers with a copy of the adopted Housing Element, and inform them of requirements
for priority service to proposed developments serving lower-income households.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                Page 4-107

Storm Water Treatment
The North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) certifies projects for water quality
impacts under standards established by the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
Projects that disturb one or more acres of soil or that disturb less than one acre but are part of a larger
common plan of development that in total disturbs one or more acres, are required to obtain a Construction
General Permit for discharges of storm water associated with construction activity.
The Construction General Permit requires the development and implementation of a Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP). Among other required content, the SWPPP must list Best Management Practices
(BMPs) the discharger will use to protect storm water runoff and the placement of those BMPs. The
RWQCB encourages specific low impact development (LID) techniques, tools, and materials to control the
amount of impervious surface, increase infiltration, improve water quality by reducing runoff from developed
sites, and reduce costly infrastructure. These practices include bioretention facilities or rain gardens, grass
swales and channels, vegetated rooftops, rain barrels, cisterns, vegetated filter strips, and permeable
pavements.
Though studies have shown that LID techniques are less expensive to develop and maintain than
conventional storm water treatment facilities, according to some developers, acquiring enough developable
space to implement these techniques can be a limiting factor. For example grass swales require a minimum
area that is six- to eight-foot wide. Designing residential development to accommodate the swales, parking
spaces, and an adequate number of housing units can inhibit a project’s financially feasibility.
SECTION 4.7                 OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
Planning to maximize energy efficiency and the incorporation of energy conservation and green building
features can contribute to reduced housing costs for homeowners and renters. In addition, these efforts
promote sustainable community design, reduced dependence on vehicles, and significantly contribute to
reducing greenhouse gases.
All new buildings in California must meet the standards contained in Title 24, Part 6 of the California Code of
Regulations (Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings). These regulations
were established in 1978 and most recently updated in 2013 with more stringent green building requirements.
Energy efficiency requirements are enforced by local governments through the building permit process. All
new construction must comply with the standards in effect on the date a building permit application is made.
This section describes programs related to energy conservation and residential development.
Municipal Building and Housing Code
The Town of Windsor adopted the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code (CALGreen), Tier 1.
CALGreen creates uniform regulations for new residential and non-residential California buildings that are
intended to reduce construction waste, make buildings more efficient in the use of materials and energy, and
reduce environmental impacts during and after construction.
Energy Upgrade California
Energy Upgrade California is a state initiative to help Californians take action to save energy, conserve natural
resources, help reduce demand on the electricity grid, and make informed energy management choices at
home and at work. It is supported by an alliance of the California Public Utilities Commission, the California
Energy Commission, utilities, regional energy networks, local governments, businesses, and nonprofits to
Page 4-108                                                                                  Adopted January 7, 2015

help communities meet state and local energy and climate action goals. Funding comes from investor-owned
utility customers under the auspices of the California Public Utilities Commission. The program offers up to
$4,500 to homeowners for selecting energy-saving home improvements.
Sonoma County Energy Independence Program
The Energy Independence Program (EIP) is a County of Sonoma Energy and Sustainability Division
program that serves county residents and businesses as a central clearinghouse of information about energy
efficiency, water conservation, and renewable energy generation. EIP provides resources, rebates, incentives,
contractors, and financing options to residential and commercial property owners to conserve energy and
save money.
The Sonoma County Energy Independence Program partners with the Windsor Efficiency PAYS Program.
Windsor Efficiency PAYS provides water and energy saving upgrades for Windsor residential properties that
provide immediate utility bill savings, new water and energy saving appliances, and drought-resistant
landscaping. Windsor homeowners and renters can “pay as you save” by installing:
         Low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators
         High efficiency measures - toilets, CFLs, clothes washers/dryers, refrigerators, and hot water
          recirculation pumps
         Drought-resistant landscaping to conserve water
In 2012 five building permits were issued under the Sonoma County Energy Independence Program (SCEIP)
to help increase energy and water efficiency. The Town has conducted significant outreach to market the
program and encourage owners whose homes are subject to code enforcement to take advantage of this
opportunity.
Climate Action 2020
In February 2012 the Regional Climate Protection Authority (RCPA) partnered with the County of Sonoma
Permit and Resource Management Department (PRMD) to secure a Sustainable Communities Planning grant
from the Strategic Growth Council for $1 million. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Implementation Program
(GRIP) - which is now also referred to as “Climate Action 2020” - is a collaborative effort among all nine
cities (including the Town of Windsor) and the County of Sonoma to take further actions in reducing GHG
emissions community-wide.
Through the implementation of this program, participating jurisdictions will achieve compliance with Bay
Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) guidelines and other related policies that establish
reduction targets for GHG emissions, including AB 32, CEQA, and local GHG reduction goals. Building
upon the climate protection efforts and goals established in the 2008 Community Climate Action Plan created
by the Climate Protection Campaign, the goal of the GRIP is to update all municipal and community-wide
GHG inventories, evaluate emission targets, and to create an implementation plan to reach those targets. The
updated Climate Action Plans that are developed for each jurisdiction will be tailored to its specific
circumstances while at the same time benefitting from a countywide perspective.
Sonoma Clean Power
Sonoma Clean Power (SCP) is a new, not-for-profit, locally-controlled electricity provider in Sonoma County
that is independently run by the Sonoma County cities that have joined the program, including Windsor,
Sonoma, Cotati, Sebastopol, Santa Rosa and Cloverdale, as well as all of the unincorporated areas in the

county. SCP provides everyone in participating cities with the option of using environmentally-friendly
power, generated by renewable sources, such as solar, wind, and geothermal. SCP both partners with, and
competes against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). The partnership arises from SCP’s use of
PG&E’s infrastructure to deliver and meter SCP electricity and the competition arises from the ability of
customers in SCP’s covered areas to elect electric generation service from either PG&E or SCP.
Pacific Gas and Electric Programs
Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), which provides gas and electricity services in the town of
Windsor, offers public information and technical assistance to homeowners regarding energy conservation.
PG&E provides numerous incentives for energy-efficient new construction and home remodeling.
Remodeling rebates include cool roofs, insulation, and water heaters. Residents are granted between $100-
$200 per 1,000 square feet for installed cool roofs and up to $500 for attic and wall insulation. Installing new
energy-efficient water heaters qualifies residents for a $30 rebate.
PG&E also offers energy-efficiency tax credits under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 for both homeowners
and builders. Existing homeowners are eligible for tax credits up to a maximum of $500 for energy -efficient
improvements. An additional tax credit is available for solar energy systems. Builders of energy-efficient new
homes are eligible for tax credits up to a maximum of $2,000.
PG&E provides a variety of energy conservation services for residents as well as offers a wealth of financial
and energy-related assistance programs for low-income customers:
        The Balanced Payment Plan (BPP). Designed to eliminate big swings in a customer’s monthly
         payments by averaging energy costs over the year. On enrollment, PG&E averages the amount of
         energy used by the household in the past year to derive the monthly BPP amount. PG&E checks the
         household’s account every four months to make sure that its estimated average is on target. If the
         household’s energy use has increased or decreased dramatically, PG&E will change the amount of
         monthly payment so that the household does not overpay or underpay too much over the course of a
         year.
        CARE (California Alternate Rates for Energy). PG&E offers this rate reduction program for
         low- to middle-income households. PG&E determines qualified households by a sliding income scale
         based on the number of household members. The CARE program provides a 20 percent discount on
         monthly energy bills.
        Energy Efficiency for Multifamily Properties. The Energy Efficiency for Multifamily Properties
         program is available to owners and managers of existing multifamily residential dwellings containing
         two or more units. The program encourages energy efficiency by providing rebates for the
         installation of certain energy-saving products such as high-efficiency appliances, compact fluorescent
         light bulbs, attic and wall insulation, and efficient heating and cooling systems.

       Energy Savings Assistance Program. PG&E’s Energy Savings Assistance program offers free
        weatherization measures and energy-efficient appliances to qualified low- to moderate-income
        households. PG&E determines qualified households through the same sliding income scale used for
        CARE. The program includes measures such as attic insulation, weather stripping, caulking, and
        minor home repairs. Some customers qualify for replacement of appliances including refrigerators,
        air conditioners, and evaporative coolers.
       Energy Works Program/Energy Partners Program - The Energy Works Program provides
        qualified low-income tenants free weatherization measures and energy-efficient appliances to reduce
        gas and electricity usage. In order to qualify for the program, a household’s total annual gross income
        cannot exceed the income as set in the income guidelines (http://www.hacsc.org/energy_works_
        program.htm); households must receive gas and/or electricity from PG&E; and the residence cannot
        have participated in the Energy Partners Program in the past 10 years.
       The Family Electric Rate Assistance (FERA) Program - PG&E’s rate reduction program for
        large households of three or more people with low- to middle-income. It enables low-income large
        households to receive a Tier 3 (131 percent to 200 percent of baseline) electric rate reduction on their
        PG&E bill every month.
       The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) Block Grant Funded by the
        Federal Department of Health and Human Services, it provides two basic types of services. Eligible
        low-income persons, via local governmental and nonprofit organizations, can receive financial
        assistance to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling dwellings and/or to have their dwellings
        weatherized to make them more energy efficient.
       Medical Baseline Allowance Program. The Medical Baseline Allowance program is available to
        households where a California-licensed physician has certified that a full-time resident is either
        dependent on life-support equipment while at home; a paraplegic, hemiplegic, quadriplegic, or
        multiple sclerosis patient with special heating and/or cooling needs; a scleroderma patient with
        special heating needs; or suffering from a life-threatening illness or compromised immune system
        with special heating and/or cooling requirements to sustain the patient’s life or prevent deterioration
        of the patient’s medical condition. The program allows customers to get additional quantities of
        energy at the lowest or baseline price for residential customers.
       PG&E's SmartAC™ program - This program offers a simple and convenient way to help prevent
        power interruptions. When customers sign up, PG&E installs a free SmartAC device that slightly
        reduces the energy the air conditioner uses automatically in case of a state or local energy supply
        emergency. PG&E customers receive $50 for signing up for the SmartAC™ program.
       REACH (Relief for Energy Assistance through Community Help). The REACH program is
        sponsored by PG&E and administered through the Salvation Army. PG&E customers can enroll to
        give monthly donations to the REACH program. Through the REACH program, qualified low-
        income customers who have experienced uncontrollable or unforeseen hardships that prohibit them
        from paying their utility bills may receive an energy credit up to $200. REACH assistance is available
        once per 18-month period, with exceptions for seniors and mentally- and physically-disabled persons.
        The Salvation Army determines eligibility by a sliding income scale based on the number of
        household members. To qualify for the program, the applicant’s income cannot exceed 200 percent
        of the Federal poverty guidelines.

housing requirement through payment of an in-lieu fee, land donation, or off-site construction.            percent low, and 5 percent very low.
Also as part of this amendment, exemptions for mixed-use and multifamily projects were

Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Table 4.61 compares the Town’s 2009 Housing Element Quantified Objectives to actual housing production.
The Town’s objectives for the period from 2007 to 2014 were 1,729 total units, including 55 extremely low
and very low-income, 330 low-income, 176 moderate-income, and 1,168 above moderate-income units. Not
surprisingly, since the previous planning period began at the start of the recession, actual production fell short
of the Town’s objectives. As shown in Table 4.60, within that period, only 161 units were built in Windsor. In
terms of meeting Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) goals, the Town met 22 percent of its total
RHNA during this period through new construction.

Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Appendix B: Summary of Public Comments
Stakeholder Workshop, June 19, 2014
The following summarizes key housing-related topics discussed during the meeting. Attending the meeting
were: Cathy Boostani from Housing Land Trust, Georgia Berland from the Sonoma County Task Force for
the Homeless, Don Albini from the Planning Commission, David Grabill from the Sonoma County Housing
Advocacy Group, and Don Cohn from Petaluma People Services/Fair Housing of Sonoma County.
Following this summary is a comment letter submitted at the meeting by the Sonoma County Housing
Advocacy Group.
       Windsor eliminated 68 units of affordable housing from the Bell Village project for unclear reasons.
        The units would have helped house displaced mobile home residents, but there wasn’t any debate or
        effort to replace the units elsewhere. A lot of people pushed for the affordable units as part of the
        original project to accommodate displaced mobile home residents and meet other affordable housing
        needs.
       The Town shouldn’t count second units as affordable unless there is an affordability covenant
        included with the unit. The homeowner could build or use the unit as a vacation rental or home
        addition.
       The planned railroad station Downtown should be evaluated in the Housing Element. There is an
        adopted Station Area Plan that provides for higher density development in Windsor. SMART
        indicated that 20 percent of units near the Santa Rosa station should be affordable. However, in
        Windsor the Station Area Plan doesn’t include any affordability requirements. In order for the station
        area to be successful, it needs to be planned for people of all income levels. The Town should strive
        to ensure that 20 percent of the units in the station area are affordable. There is also potential for the
        train to cause the station area to gentrify. The Town needs to plan ahead to ensure long-term
        affordable housing is available in areas around the station.
       The Town needs to look for ways to raise money for affordable housing. Typically jurisdictions need
        to provide 10 percent of the funding necessary to build affordable housing. Just because there isn’t
        redevelopment anymore doesn’t mean there isn’t funding available. Windsor needs to provide
        funding beyond what is made available through redevelopment boomerang funds. The Town still
        receives property taxes. The County and some other cities in Sonoma County have continued to
        provide 10 percent of the funding needed to support construction of affordable housing. Windsor
        should do the same.
       There is money coming from the State to help provide affordable housing. The new State budget has
        several billion dollars going toward affordable housing in transit oriented developments, as well as
        funding for special needs housing. The Town could take initiative to pursue this money. For
        example, Santa Rosa created a housing trust fund, which has enabled the Town to apply for match
        funding and other grants. The Town should also work collaboratively with developers or statewide
        groups to pursue projects, funding, and initiatives for housing (e.g., California Community Economic
        Development Association). The Town should allocate staff and resources to pursue partnerships and
        funding.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                               Page 4-129

       The Housing Element responds to ABAG identified housing needs, but there are 3,500 extremely
        low-income and homeless people countywide that needs housing and support services. Windsor
        needs to provide some of this housing. There aren’t many food centers or homeless shelters in
        Windsor. That’s why the homeless population is not as high as other areas of the county. Most of the
        homeless population in the county is represented by local residents and a high percentage have
        mental disabilities. There is an extremely high waiting list for homeless shelters in the county.
        Windsor should have permanent supportive housing and homeless resources. Emergency housing is
        also needed along with programs to help people get back on their feet. The Food Pantry is good, but
        more is needed. The Town should partner with churches to meet the needs of the homeless (e.g.,
        Our Lady of Guadalupe). The Town could also pursue innovative housing opportunities, such as co-
        housing arrangements.
       Windsor needs to provide workforce housing. If those serving the community (e.g., teachers, police
        officers, fire fighters) don’t’ have a place to live they will leave the community. The new hospital will
        create new jobs, but there isn’t housing affordable to most people who work at the hospital (e.g.,
        nurses, technicians). The Town should partner with organizations, such as the Housing Land Trust
        of Sonoma County and developers to build workforce housing. The Town could use inclusionary
        requirements to ensure funding or land is dedicated on which to build workforce housing.
       Windsor’s housing issues are similar to other communities in the county. Growth ordinances are in
        place in Windsor and they have strong support from the community. The growth ordinance affects
        the affordability of housing. It seems like every community has a way to skirt the regulations that are
        somewhat unenforceable. For fair housing, cities can be liable when zoning practices cause
        roadblocks to affordable housing. There have been other cities sued in Sonoma County. Town staff
        probably have a better idea of the constraints or barriers to affordable housing development. The
        Town needs to be proactive in identifying sites that are buildable, removing barriers and impediments
        to housing, and making it possible to build affordable housing. The Housing Element process should
        consult developers who are working in Windsor to understand their experience and where
        improvements are needed to facilitate the development of housing.
       Windsor has done a good job of providing affordable housing throughout the community, but future
        projects should include affordable units mixed in with market-rate units. For inclusionary housing
        programs, payment of in lieu fees is a problem that either results in housing not being built or crating
        isolated affordable housing projects. Senior projects are an example of an isolated project type that
        can become ghettoized because it is kept separate from other neighborhoods. All affordable units
        need to be integrated in the community to avoid concentrations of low-income housing, and
        affordable and market-rate units should be built simultaneously to ensure the affordable units are
        constructed and to address potential NIMBY issues. Affordable units should be designed and
        constructed in the same manner as market-rate units so there isn’t a stigma associated with
        affordable, low-income housing units or those who live in affordable units.

Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Community Workshop, July 8, 2014
On July 8, 2014, the Town of Windsor held a Housing Element Community Workshop from 6:00 pm to 8:00
pm at Town Hall. At the meeting, there were 10 attendees who heard a presentation about the Town’s
Housing Element Update and then participated in two exercises to discuss and provide input on housing
challenges and solutions in Windsor. The exercises were carried out in two groups of participants. Attendants
included Ray Holley, Cheryl Schular, Sam Salmon, Lois Fisher, Oscar Chaves, Daniel Sanchez, Dominic
Fuppoli, Alan Symcox, Tom Micheletti, and Kris Anderson-Manos.
The following summarizes key housing-related topics discussed during the meeting.
Exercise 1: Major Housing Issues
During the first exercise, workshop participants discussed and identified the most significant housing issues
facing Windsor. Based on the identified issues, the two groups identified their top three issues (see Exercise
2). The following list provides a summary of all the identified issues.
        The balancing act. How can the Town generate sufficient funding to support the development of
         affordable housing while also encouraging market-rate housing? The loss of redevelopment means
         we need to find new revenue sources for affordable housing. A regional approach to housing issues
         would make more sense.
        There are a lot of hoops to jump through if you want to build affordable housing. It can actually be
         more expensive to build affordable housing because you need a grant writer to find all the different
         sources for funding (up to 20 percent more expensive).
        Affordability to purchase or rent homes. Affordability is a growing challenge, especially for senior
         citizens living on fixed incomes and low wage workers. There is a growing sector of jobs do not
         support the ability of lower wage workers to purchase a home. Working class families need to be able
         to afford to live here. Need housing to retain people who like to live in Windsor and who grew up
         here.
        Overcrowded Housing. There is a growing issue of having too many families in one home.
        Market paralysis due to low inventory and high prices (tight housing market). People are stuck in
         their homes because there aren’t housing options available to meet their needs. Growing families
         can’t move into larger homes. Seniors conversely cannot downsize.
        There is a lack of mixed-income housing/neighborhoods. Windsor needs a variety of housing types
         that allow people to move fluidly from rental housing to ownership.
        Dealing with Housing as an isolated issue. Housing issues need to be looked at within the context of
         all the other factors impacting quality of life (living wage, demographics, types of jobs, etc.). The
         Town needs to ask the question, “what kind of community do we want to be?” The Town needs to
         evaluate community priorities, not just check boxes.
        Need to focus on Windsor’s future and orient development toward Town center growth and transit
         oriented growth and address issues of climate protection, water capacity, and traffic.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                  Page 4-131

Exercise 2: Solutions to Housing Issues
During the second exercise, workshop participants discussed and identified potential solutions to the three
most significant housing issues from Exercise 1. The following list identifies the top three housing issues
identified by each group and provides a summary of all the suggested solutions.
Group 1, Issue #1: Market Paralysis
        Provide opportunities for a greater diversity of housing inventory. Need to identify the current mix
         of housing types in Windsor and the demand.
        Annex areas within the urban growth boundary so the boundary coincides with the Town Limits.
         Designate/zone annexed areas to provide a greater diversity of housing options.
        Change State and other requirements so the Town can spend money on things that are worthwhile,
         not just exercises that don’t really amount to anything, but cost a lot of money and time (e.g., the
         Housing Element).
        Provide programs that assist people who are “stuck” in a home they have outgrown or is too large
         for them. Help people find housing that is more suitable to their needs.
Group 1, Issue #2: Dealing With Housing as an Isolated Issue
        Understand that consequences/impact of specific types of housing/land use issues and the effect on
         quality of life.
        Conduct a fiscal impact analysis on certain types of housing development to evaluate the impact on
         Town revenues and services.
        Consider the walkability of new development; what are the health issues associated with new housing
         development?
        Consider changing demographics and how that affects the need for different housing types.
Group 1, Issue #3: Determine our Priorities
        Make a plan for diversity and inclusion, and then implement the plan. Base it on our values, place
         matters.
        Understand our current mix of development. Identify what works and what doesn’t (e.g., pockets of
         low-income housing). Identify best practices.
Group 2, Issue #1: Housing Inventory
        Redevelop the civic center (i.e., Town Hall, Policy Station, Library) into mixed-use/mixed-income
         development that includes a range of housing affordability, commercial/office uses, and civic uses
         (e.g., library).

Housing
Town of Windsor Housing Element Update
Group 2, Issue #2: Working Class Affordability
       Create a Silent 2nd program that provides housing for essential personnel (e.g., firefighters, police
        officers, medics, doctors/nurses, teachers).
       Do not use inclusionary in-lieu fees to create pods of affordable housing. Integrate affordable units
        with market-rate units so there is no difference.
       Encourage use of the Town’s Density Bonus program.
       Encourage the development of secondary units.
       Consider units that are 1,200 square feet or less affordable by definition.
       Preserve and expand mobile homes. They provide affordable housing stock.
Group 2, Issue #3: Smarter Housing Growth
       Require greater diversity in the size of housing units in new developments and mix the different size
        units so that unit types aren’t segregated.
       Remove minimum parking requirements in new housing (unbundle parking). Use parking maximums
        instead of parking minimums.
       Encourage the use of Planned Development (PD) zoning.
Adopted January 7, 2015                                                                                Page 4-133

IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
I.1 Scenic Corridor Design Standards. The Town
shall develop more specific design guidelines to assist
with the review of development proposals along sce-
nic corridors and within the viewshed of these routes.
As part of this program, the Town should distinguish
between skyline ridges and intermediate ridges and
may also identify the critical vantage points from
which the scenic resources and corridor policies
should apply. (Planning)
I.2 Project and Environmental Review along Sce-
nic Corridors. Projects along designated rural lanes
and scenic corridors shall be reviewed to ensure that
the scenic resources are protected. The Town shall
require that developers proposing to develop along
scenic corridors demonstrate that their proposals will
not obstruct significant views and that their project
designs complement the natural views and setting,
rather than dominate them. At the Town’s discretion,
developers may be required to have visual simulations
prepared to better illustrate the “before and after” ef-
fects of a proposed project. (Planning)
I.3 Scenic Corridor Enhancement. The Town shall
initiate a program to enhance its scenic corridors by
litter removal programs; route identification signs; and
provision of parking at desirable viewpoints. (Plan-
ning, Community Services, Public Works, Engineer-
ing)
I.4 Project and Environmental Review along
Slopes. Projects on slopes greater than 15 percent
shall be reviewed to ensure that the landform and ma-
ture vegetation are preserved as much as possible.
(Planning, Engineering)
I.5 Interjurisdictional Coordination. The Town
shall continue to review development proposals with-
in the unincorporated portion of its Planning Area that
occur with the County’s Scenic Landscape Units, the
community separators, and along ridgelines and to
request appropriate design refinements or mitigations
for visual impacts triggered by the development pro-
posals. (Town Manager, Planning)

LAND USES
The Sonoma County ALUC has adopted a “Compre-
hensive Airport Land Use Plan for Sonoma County”
(dated January, 2001 and amended October 8, 2001).
The purpose of this plan is to establish land use com-
patibility policies in the interest of continued opera-
tions of the six public use airports in the County,
including Charles M. Schultz Airport. Appropriate
land uses are identified based on noise and safety
compatibility criteria included in the plan. Local
agency general plans, such as the Town of Windsor,
are required to be consistent with the provisions of
this plan. (General Plan policies related to noise com-
patibility are included in Section D of this chapter).

GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS
In conformance with Section 65358(b) of the State
Government Code, General Plans may be amended as
often as four times a year. At each occasion, there is
no limit to the number of individual requests that can
be reviewed.
GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
The Windsor General Plan reflects a twenty-year plan-
ning period. This time frame allows for the systematic
implementation of a desired land use pattern and in-
stallation of required public improvements. To pro-
vide for flexibility and responsiveness to change, the
Plan also should be comprehensively reviewed and
revised, if appropriate, at five-year intervals. This pe-
riodic update enables the Plan always to maintain at
least a 10-20 year time frame.
The update of the Plan in not synonymous with total
revision. Once adopted, the General Plan establishes a
basic policy framework which must be followed over
time. The purpose of reviewing the Plan at intervals is
to allow it to adjust to changing conditions, the availa-
bility of more recent planning data, and shifts in com-
munity values.

been initiated by the private sector and will continue
to be. However, through necessity the Town is
concerned with better coordination between private
development and public facilities and services.
Thus, while the General Plan provides the
framework for community development, the
everyday actions of the Town shape the community.
The manner in which the Plan is implemented is the
real test of the Town’s commitment to the goals,
objectives, and policies. The revision of its
implementing actions to be consistent with the Plan
is a reflection of the Town’s commitment.
