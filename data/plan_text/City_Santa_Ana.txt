VI                               CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT
Introduction
This chapter introduces the Housing Element: its purpose, content, public
outreach process, and relationship to other City planning efforts.
OVERVIEW
Incorporated in 1886, the City of Santa Ana has a rich historical and cultural
heritage. The City of Santa Ana is the county seat, and it boasts an eclectic urban
environment, burgeoning employment centers, transit hub, historic
neighborhoods and downtown, and a rich history dating back to the mid-1800s.
These features distinguish Santa Ana as Orange County’s downtown.
The City of Santa Ana has seen significant changes in its housing market and
housing conditions during the last decade. Housing prices tripled from 1998 to
2007, and now are significantly declining with the market downturn. Housing
and apartment rents have increased steadily during this time. As an urban center,
the revitalization of housing and neighborhoods is also a critical concern. At the
same time, the City of Santa Ana has one of the most diverse international
populations of all communities in the County of Orange.
The Housing Element recognizes the community’s housing needs and the
complexity of programs needed to address them. The vision, goals, policies, and
programs are designed to address the following issues:
   Adapting to changing housing market conditions.
   Meeting state-mandated regional housing needs goals.
   Furthering quality housing and neighborhoods.
   Accommodating social and economic diversity.
   Assisting residents with special housing needs.
   Supporting the City’s long-term economic development.
The Housing Element seeks to address each of these planning issues, while
balancing them with other City goals and objectives that will further the City’s
long-term vision as “Downtown Orange County.”

INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE AND CONTENT OF ELEMENT
California law (Government Code Section 65580 et seq.) requires that cities
develop housing programs to meet their fair share of housing needs for the
community. A key part of this goal is addressing the regional housing needs
assessment (RHNA) and state law requirements to plan, facilitate, and encourage
housing production commensurate with their assigned need. The City of Santa
Ana has been assigned a planning goal of accommodating 204 housing units for
the housing element planning period of 2014 to 2021.
To comply with state law, Santa Ana prepares a housing element every five years.
The Santa Ana Housing Element must contain goals, policies, and programs to
facilitate the development, improvement, and preservation of housing. State law
prescribes the scope and content of the housing element pursuant to Section
65583 of the California Government Codes.
The Housing Element is organized into the following sections:
    Housing Element Framework. This introduces Santa Ana’s housing needs
     and contains an analysis of resources to address those needs. This is followed
     by the Policy Framework, which is a series of goals and policies, and a
     Housing Plan of implementation programs.
    Appendix A: Housing Needs. This appendix contains an analysis of
     demographic, economic, neighborhood, and housing characteristics; special
     needs of residents; and other housing needs in the community.
    Appendix B: Housing Constraints. This appendix contains an analysis of
     potential and actual market, government, and environmental constraints to
     the development, maintenance, and improvement of housing.
    Appendix C: Housing Resources. This appendix contains an inventory,
     analysis, and assessment of the City’s resources to address its housing needs,
     including land, preservation opportunities, and financial resources.
    Appendix D: Program Evaluation. This appendix contains a summary of
     progress toward meeting the City’s 2006–2014 housing goals, and contains an
     evaluation of the appropriateness of those goals and programs.
    Appendix E: Public Outreach. This appendix details the venues provided to
     residents and stakeholders to discuss housing needs and opportunities,
     including workshops, stakeholders groups, study sessions, and visioning.

                                                                     INTRODUCTION
PUBLIC OUTREACH
California law requires that local governments make a diligent effort to achieve
participation from all economic segments of the public in the development of the
housing element. As part of the Housing Element planning process, the City
provided a wide array of venues to solicit input and participation in housing
discussions with residents, businesses, stakeholders, advocates, civic leaders, and
other interested parties. Opportunities were also offered in multiple languages,
reflecting the diversity of Santa Ana residents.
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTICIPATION
Some of the key efforts undertaken during this period were:
    Community Workshops. To capitalize on the City’s goals related to the
     intersection of housing and transportation, two public outreach workshops
     were coupled with outreach for an update to the Circulation Element. The
     City held community workshops on April 27, 2013, and May 9, 2013, at City
     senior centers. These evening and weekend workshops provided an overview
     of the Housing Element process and community needs. Attendees
     participated in facilitated sessions to provide input on housing issues of
     greatest concern to them. To maximize participation, notices were published
     in Spanish, and translation services were available at both meetings.
                                                                                    Santa Ana held multiple venues for
                                                                                    residents, stakeholders, and
                                                                                    businesses to participate in the
                                                                                    Housing Element.
    Health and Fitness Fair. Promoting health and wellness is a priority of the
     City. The City’s Parks and Recreation and Community Services Agency
     hosted a health and fitness fair on Saturday, June 1. The Planning
     Department sponsored a booth at this event to solicit feedback for the
     Housing Element through a survey and interactive games.
    Survey. A bilingual English and Spanish survey was available during the
     months of June and July to collect additional community feedback. The
     survey was available on the City’s website and advertised through the
     neighborhood community link meetings.

INTRODUCTION
   Stakeholder Workshops. The City held a special workshop (June 20, 2013)
    with community-based organizations (nonprofit legal advocates, service
    organizations, interested parties, developers, stakeholders, etc.). This
    workshop focused on the topic of healthy communities and the integration of
    policies and programs into the City’s Housing Element to support “healthy
    housing.” The purpose of this workshop was to discuss integrating health and
    wellness into the Housing Element and to solicit input from the diverse and
    specialized perspectives of each of the participants.
   Housing Commission Workshop. The City held a study session (October 1,
    2013) with the Community Redevelopment and Housing Commission to
    provide an overview of the Housing Element update. The study session took
    place during their regularly scheduled monthly meeting time and was open to
    the public.
   Planning Commission and City Council Study Sessions. The City
    conducted study sessions with the Planning Commission (September 23,
    2013) and the City Council (October 7, 2013). These sessions provided an
    overview of the Housing Element and key community needs, and then
    solicited input on issues of concern from each respective commission. All
    commission meetings were duly noticed to the public.
Appendix E contains a summary of the results of the outreach.
SUMMARY OF PARTICIPATION
Participants at the community workshops, study sessions, stakeholder meetings,
and other gatherings provided a wealth of information regarding the City’s future
direction and the most pressing needs, program ideas, and priorities for action.
Key themes included:
   Santa Ana’s Future. The City Council’s vision for Santa Ana is to strengthen
    the City’s historic role as Downtown Orange County, benefitting from its
    location, employment centers, rich heritage, and diversity. Participants voiced
    a desire for the City to continue its commitment to job creation and to
    provide desirable places for people to live and work. Santa Ana is recognized
    as a unique and diverse City in Orange County, and its future will depend on
    leveraging its wealth of resources. The City’s housing vision supports the
    notion of uniqueness, inclusiveness, and sustainability through housing
    policy and programs.
   Housing Santa Ana’s Residents. Housing plays an important role in
    achieving the City’s vision. Participants at workshops clearly emphasized the
    need for encouraging the widest possible choices of housing—single-family,
    apartments, townhomes, senior housing, housing for people with disabilities,
    and housing for homeless people affordable at all levels. Improved housing
    conditions and neighborhood safety were also important topics to the City’s
    residents. In response to increased interest in the relationship between health
    and housing, a focused stakeholder meeting explored health and wellness.

                                                                      INTRODUCTION
    The Housing Element supports offering the broadest range of choices and
    includes programs to facilitate affordability for people of all income levels.
                                                                                     Participants at meetings discussed
                                                                                     the City’s housing needs and
                                                                                     initiatives to include in the
                                                                                     Housing Element.
   Preserving Neighborhoods. Participants provided compelling testimony of
    the need to improve and maintain their neighborhoods—their housing,
    streets, parks and open space, and other important features that contribute to
    the livability of their neighborhoods. Additionally, residents were concerned
    about preserving their historic neighborhoods.
    The Housing Plan sets forth various programs to improve housing and
    neighborhoods, and affirms the role of neighborhood associations in
    participating in civic affairs and improving their neighborhoods in
    partnership with the City.
   Balancing City Goals. An update to the City’s Circulation Element and
    expansion of OCTA Bus Rapid Transit lines gave residents a chance to
    explore the intersection between housing and circulation at two joint
    workshops. Participants understood that housing goals must be balanced with

                                     RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PLANNING EFFORTS
                                     CITY VISION
                                     As expressed by the City Council, Santa Ana is to be the dynamic urban center of
                                     Orange County, acclaimed for its investment in children, neighborhood pride,
                                     enriching cultural experiences, appreciation of diversity, thriving economic
                                     climate, quality governmental services, and leadership among California cities.
                                     This vision underpins the General Plan, the blueprint for community
                                     development, and the Housing Element, and guides decisions regarding how
                                     resources should be allocated to different priorities.
                                     GENERAL PLAN
                                     State law requires that a General Plan be internally consistent, so that no conflicts
                                     exist among its chapters. Goals, policies, and implementation measures in the
                                     General Plan Elements must support and be consistent with one another. The
                                     Housing Element builds on the other 11 elements in the General Plan and is
Santa Ana’s historic clock stands as consistent with goals and policies set forth therein. The City will continue to
a beacon to its downtown.
                                     maintain consistency between General Plan elements by ensuring that proposed
                                     changes in one element are reflected in other elements through amendment of the
                                     General Plan.
                                     SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT PLANS
                                     Santa Ana has adopted a series of implementation tools—specific plans, overlay
                                     zones, and other plans—to guide future development in focused areas. These
                                     include the Metro East Mixed Use Overlay Zone, Transit Zoning Code, Specific
                                     Development Districts, and other similar efforts. The Housing Element is
                                     designed to serve as an overarching policy document that bridges specific
                                     implementation plans with the goals and policies in the General Plan. Whereas
                                     the Housing Element provides a guiding framework for housing Citywide,
                                     specific implementation tools provide guidance for specific areas of the City.
                                     HOUSING IMPLEMENTATION PLANS
                                     The City implements other plans that relate to the Housing Element. The
                                     Consolidated Plan guides the expenditure of federal funds for housing and
                                     community development activities, particularly low and moderate income
                                     households and persons with special needs. The Redevelopment Implementation
                                     Plan governs the expenditure of tax increment funds for the rehabilitation,
                                     construction, and improvement of housing. The Santa Ana Housing Authority
                                     has two plans (Annual Plan and Five-Year Plan) that guide the expenditure of
                                     federal monies for the Housing Choice Voucher Program.

Housing and Urban Development. The Housing Authority (SAHA) is a
governmental body created and authorized by state law to develop and operate
housing and housing programs for low-income families. The mission of the
SAHA is to, “provide safe, decent and sanitary housing conditions for very low-
income families and to manage resources efficiently. SAHA supports personal,
economic and social upward mobility to provide families the opportunity to make
the transition from subsidized to non-subsidized housing. SAHA also assists the
City of Santa Ana in its goal to maintain its housing stock.”

Planning Context
This section provides an overview of the key housing needs in Santa Ana based
on demographic, socioeconomic, housing, and special need characteristics. These
trends and community characteristics are a foundation for developing responsive
housing goals, policies, and programs.
DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS
As the county seat for more than a century, the City of Santa Ana has long been
recognized as the historic urban center of Orange County. Like many Southern
California cities, Santa Ana experienced a post–World War II housing boom.
During the 1940s, military facilities adjacent to the City provided an economic
stimulus, thousands of jobs, and a need for additional housing. Many of Santa
Ana’s residential neighborhoods were built to accommodate population growth
anticipated from these factors over the next few decades.
During the 1960s through the late 1970s, as master planned communities began
to emerge in southern Orange County, residential neighborhoods continued to fill
in the remaining undeveloped land in Santa Ana. Significant apartment
construction began to emerge during this period and continued through much of
the 1980s. This new housing accommodated a wave of population growth,
initially from families migrating from the greater Los Angeles area, and later in
the 1980s from immigration from other countries.
In recent decades, Santa Ana has experienced slower growth in housing, due in
part to the lack of vacant land and built-out fabric. From 1990 through 2007, net
housing production totaled almost 500 units (U.S. Census and California
Department of Finance). However, the City’s population increased by about
60,000, due in part to increased immigration from other countries, migration of
families from other cities, and demographic trends reflective of the Southern
California region. Looking forward, Santa Ana is planning to meet its future
housing needs by directing growth to focused areas of the community.
Within a context of a complex and growing urban center, these changes are one of
several considerations that shape housing needs in Santa Ana.

                                      Race and Ethnicity
                                      The City of Santa Ana is a culturally diverse community. Demographic changes
                                      over the past decades in Santa Ana are reflective of regional and national trends
                                      (e.g., aging of the population and immigration). As of the 2010 Census, Hispanics
                                      comprise 78 percent of residents, Whites comprise 9 percent, Asians 10 percent,
                                      and all others 2 percent (Chart 1).
                                      A key aspect of Santa Ana is its foreign-born population, comprising 48 percent of
                                      residents. These households often include extended or multigenerational families
                                      and tend to have more modest incomes than native-born residents. Second and

                                      Between 2000and 2010 the City experienced a significant decrease in family-
                                      forming adults ages 25–44 and their children (Chart 2). Santa Ana also
                                      experienced a decrease of approximately 22,000 children (13 percent decrease).
                                      Generally, younger households prefer smaller and more affordable housing as
                                      they accumulate wealth. Moreover, the predominance of family-forming adults
                                      will likely continue to place a strong demand on entry-level housing and larger
                                      units to accommodate children. This group is the primary source of entry-level
                                      demand for homeownership opportunities.
                                      Middle-aged adults, the primary market for move-up housing, experienced a
                                      significant increase. This group could place an increased demand on the market
                                      for move-up opportunities. Housing developments such as Skyline, City Place,
                                      and Promenade target this demographic segment. Meanwhile, with the gradual

HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Household Type
Household type is an important factor in determining housing need. According to
the 2010 Census, the City has 73,174 households, an increase of only 174 units
since 2000. However, the composition significantly changed. During the early
2000s Santa Ana household composition shifted: single people and nonfamilies
increased 25 percent, married couples without children increased 22 percent,
married couples with children decreased 22 percent, and other families increased
by 22 percent, as shown in Chart 3.
As of the 2010 Census, Santa Ana’s households are predominantly families,
comprising 81 percent of households, which is 15 percent higher than the national
average. At least half of these households are families with children. Nonfamily
households, which are typically single or unrelated persons sharing housing,
comprise 6 percent.
                                                                                     Chart 3: Household

The City’s household characteristics and trends have resulted in an average
household of 4.4 persons. According to the 2013 Orange County Community              Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2010.
Indicators Report, Santa Ana has the largest household size in Orange County
(Chart A-6) and the 10th highest in the nation. During the early 2000s, the
number of single persons and small families with two to four family members
increased in number, while the number of large families with five, six, and seven
members all decreased. Part of this is due to the economic downturn, which
helped to balance rental prices reducing the number of shared residences with
multiple families. Although family sizes are becoming smaller, the 2010 Census
shows Hispanics have the largest average family size, with an average of 5.2
persons per household.
Changes in household type and size together significantly affect the need for
different types of housing. Preserving and rehabilitating the overall supply of
housing may provide opportunities and help alleviate some of the overcrowding
pressures in the City. However, larger housing units that can accommodate
families are also needed. At the same time, providing more housing opportunities
for the aging baby boomers will allow seniors a greater opportunity to stay in the
community.

                                A variety of economic characteristics influence the need for housing and the
                                ability to afford housing. These include the jobs available in the community,
                                resident occupations, and incomes earned by different types of households.
                                SANTA ANA JOB MARKET
                                The City of Santa Ana has a diverse base of industries, according to the U.S.
                                Census Bureau, Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics. For discussion,
                                the City’s economic base can be organized into six major groups of industries.
                                The professional, finance, real estate, and information sectors provide a total of

Commute Patterns
An important consideration in addressing housing needs is the commute patterns
of residents and workforce and the extent to which a balance in jobs and housing
is desired. In a large metropolitan area where employment centers cross
municipal boundaries, a jobs/housing balance is more often achieved at a regional
level, as opposed to a City level. However, to the extent that minimizing
commutes and improving air quality are important objectives, striving to achieve
an acceptable jobs/housing balance is worthwhile.
Illustrated in the map below, the majority of Santa Ana residents—approximately
72 percent—are employed within Orange County. While the majority of
employed Santa Ana residents work outside of the City, approximately 20 percent
work within the City. The top six places where Santa Ana residents work are in
Santa Ana, Irvine, Anaheim, Costa Mesa, the City of Los Angeles, and Orange,
according to the 2010 US Census.

NEIGHBORHOOD AND HOUSING PROFILE
Neighborhood and housing characteristics define the nature of housing needs in
Santa Ana. This section analyzes general neighborhood characteristics, housing
type and tenure, housing supply characteristics, housing prices and affordability,
and housing problems.
NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS
Santa Ana has a rich mosaic of neighborhoods, each distinguished by its history,
architecture, housing types, and amenities. More than 60 neighborhood
associations have been formed to address neighborhood issues. As is common
with many communities in Orange County, approximately 70 percent of all
residential areas within the City are single-family residential neighborhoods.
Many of these neighborhoods are established and well maintained, and several
neighborhoods contain state and local historic resources.
                                                                                     Vintage home in Santa Ana
                                    Santa Ana has many neighborhoods made up of
                                    multiple-family residences: a mixture of single-
                                    family, townhomes, apartments, and a
                                    combination of industrial and residential uses.
                                    The diversity of these neighborhoods is great,
                                    and each neighborhood varies widely in
                                    condition. The diverse urban and suburban
                                    fabric of many of these neighborhoods has been
                                    woven over time and reflects the complexity of
                                    land use policies implemented over the long
                                    history of Santa Ana. The City has undertaken
extensive efforts to stabilize residential neighborhoods through appropriate land
use direction and housing programs.
To protect and stabilize residential neighborhoods, support the City’s economic
base, and provide housing for the local workforce, Santa Ana is developing new
residential neighborhoods in District Centers close to employment centers. These
District Centers include the Metro East Mixed Use Overlay Zone, MacArthur
Place, Downtown Santa Ana, City Place, and similar locations. Reflective of
modern employment centers, Santa Ana’s District Centers are defined by eclectic
skylines of high-rise residential projects, multiple-family townhomes and
apartments, and mixed-use residential/commercial projects. These residential
neighborhoods are intensely urbanized, transit oriented, and explicitly designed to  High-rise and mixed-uses define

                                  these homes predominantly consist of single-family homes, which include

                                  Multiple-family housing comprises 41 percent of all housing, of which 10 percent
                                  are duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes. Mobile home units make up the remaining

                                  These products are provided in a variety of residential neighborhoods.
                                  As Santa Ana’s population has diversified and housing needs have become more
                                  differentiated, the City has experienced significant levels of construction in

                                  employment centers. Artist lofts have added vibrancy to these special districts. The

2011 American Community Survey.   The American dream is often intertwined with homeownership, which can
                                  provide financial independence, economic stability, and personal safety. Home
                                  investment and pride in homeownership are perceived to contribute to
                                  neighborhood quality and stability. Changes in federal housing and banking
                                  policies in recent years have opened up homeownership to a much larger portion
                                  of society—particularly the working and middle class. According to the 2010
                                  Census, 47 percent (34,756 households) own a home and 53 percent
                                  (38,418 households) rent. However, the economic downturn and foreclosures
                                  threaten to decrease homeownership rates.
                                  Offering a broad range of rental and affordable homeownership opportunities for
                                  Santa Ana residents is a continuing priority. Although many residents first enter
                                  the housing market as renters, many will desire to establish greater permanency in
                                  the community. The demand for homeownership opportunities is strong among
                                  first and second generation residents, and younger adults. A variety of
                                  homeownership and rental housing allow residents and their children to live in
                                  Santa Ana throughout their lives—as their families grow, as children leave home,
                                  and as individuals approach retirement.

HOUSING SUPPLY
Housing Vacancy
An adequate supply of housing is essential to maintaining adequate choices for
residents, moderating housing prices, and encouraging the normal maintenance
of properties. This is a delicate balance that must be maintained. Low vacancy
rates result in price and rent escalation, while excess vacancy rates result in price
depreciation, rent declines, and deferred maintenance. Although market forces are
beyond the control of any one city, maintaining an optimal balance of housing
supply and demand is a desirable goal.
Although different measures exist for defining the optimal balance of housing
supply and demand, the building industry assumes that vacancy rates of 1.5 to 2.0
percent for ownership units and 5 to 6 percent for rental housing are optimal and
offer a variety of choices for residents. Based on the 2010 Census data, the
Citywide housing vacancy rate is 4.8 percent. The significant increase in
foreclosures and the uncertain credit market have resulted in an increase in
vacancy rates that have dampened the market.
Housing Size
Chart 9 compares the percentage of renter and owner households with the
percentage of appropriately sized units for renters and owners by family size. The
size of units available for homeowners matches the size of households. The same
is general true for renter households, with the exception of large-family
households. For example, there is an abundance of studio and one-bedroom
rental units, but only 30 percent of the renter households have one or two
members. Moreover, 38 percent of all families who rent have five or more
members, but only 22 percent of rented apartments and single-family homes
available have three or more bedrooms. This translates into a shortage of 5,940

                               This decade has seen unparalleled increases in housing prices and rents. Fueled
                               by historically low interest rates, overly flexible lending, and pent-up demand for
                               housing, the prices of single-family homes soared. Between 2000 and 2007, the
                               median sales prices increased by 300 percent; since then housing prices have
                               fallen by about 50 percent. The recent market decline has caused prices of single-
                               family homes to drop to $350,000 and condominium prices to drop to $150,000
                               (2012 price levels). During the next 3 years, demand is expected to be stronger.

                               Meanwhile, the market for rental apartments has remained more stable. Over the
                               past decade, apartment rents in Santa Ana have generally risen in line with
                               inflation, increasing by approximately 40 percent during 2000 to 2007 compared
                               with inflationary increases of 35 percent. Since 2007 home sales prices have
                               dropped, however, rental prices have outpaced inflation, making renting less
                               affordable over the past decade. Although the housing market and economic
                               downturn have created more lending barriers for new apartment construction,
                               demand for apartments is still strong.

Housing Affordability
With current housing prices and rents, housing affordability is a critical issue for
many households. The lack of affordable housing can create undesirable
situations, including overpayment and overcrowding. The following discussion
assesses the ability of a four-person household to afford housing in Santa Ana.
Affordability is defined as paying no more than 30 percent of gross income. This
topic as it relates to overpayment is discussed in detail later in this chapter.
Because of the market downturn, the median price for an existing single-family
home has been in decline since 2008. Between 2010 and 2012, however, median
home prices steadily increased to $350,000 (DataQuick), and the amount of
household income needed to afford a home is $100,450, which is affordable to a
four-person above moderate income household. Condominiums offer a more
affordable housing choice. With recent price reductions, the average price of an
existing condominium at $150,000 is affordable to low and moderate income
households. New homes sell at prices substantially higher than existing homes.
Although the housing market downturn has resulted in lower housing prices, the
majority of lower income households can only afford apartments due to income
and/or down payment requirements. Similar to homeownership, rental housing
affordability is typically assumed as rent payments of no more than 30 percent of
gross income. Assuming a four-person household, the maximum affordable
monthly rent would be $1,066 for very low-income households, $1,706 for low
income households, and $2,986 for moderate income households.
According to RealFacts, the median rent for an apartment ranges from $1,115 for
a studio, $1,242 for a one-bedroom unit, $1,661 for a two-bedroom unit, and
$1,696 for a three-bedroom unit. In comparison to these figures, extremely low
and very low households could not afford the median apartment without
significant overpayment. In contrast, moderate income households could afford
the majority of existing apartments, except for three-bedroom units. Chart 11
illustrated the amount of income needed to afford housing in Santa Ana.

Overpayment
                                      Housing problems relate to the extent of overpayment (paying too much for
                                      housing) and/or overcrowding (or doubling up) of households in one home. The
                                      conditions are related because overpayment often leads to overcrowding. These
                                      conditions also lead to a number of hardships for the households and their
                                      families, including insufficient income to afford other necessities, undue burden
                                      on families, and accelerated use and wear on housing.
                                      The 2011 ACS reports that many Santa Ana households experience overpayment,
                                      overcrowding, or both conditions (43 percent overpay and 33 percent are
                                      overcrowded). The prevalence of housing problems is greater among renters (58.3
                                      percent) than among homeowners (46.2 percent). Chart 12 summarizes each
                                      housing problem by tenure for residents of Santa Ana.
                                      Overpayment
                                      Overpayment refers to a renter household that pays more than 30 percent and
                                      owner household that pay more than 35 of gross income for housing costs.
                                      Moderate overpayment refers to payments between 30 to 50 percent of gross
                                      income; severe overpayment refers to payments exceeding 50 percent. The 2011
                                      American Community Survey reports 31,676 households (43 percent) overpaying
Overcrowding                          for housing. Of this total, 57 percent of renters (21,496 households) overpay and
                                      39 percent of owners (14,897 households) overpay for housing. Housing
                                      overpayment is most severe among extremely low and low-income households as
                                      well as special needs groups, such as seniors.
                                      Overcrowding
                                      According to California housing element guidelines, housing overcrowding refers
                                      to a household that has more members than habitable rooms in a home. Moderate
                                      overcrowding refers to a situation where a home is occupied by 1.1 to 1.5 persons
                                      per room, and severe overcrowding refers to more than 1.5 persons per room.
                                      According to the 2011 ACS, 33 percent of households in Santa Ana live in
                                      overcrowded situations. Approximately 21 percent of homeowners (8,020) live in
                                      overcrowded conditions, with many severely overcrowded. In contrast, 43 percent
                                      of renters (16,313) live in overcrowded housing. Overcrowding is most severe
                                      among lower income, large renter families.

SENIOR HOUSEHOLDS
Senior citizens are considered a special needs group because limited income,
health costs, disabilities, and the need for access to transportation can make it
more difficult for them to find and retain adequate and affordable housing.
According to the 2010 Census, 21,911 Santa Ana residents (7 percent) are seniors.
Of the 10,303 senior households in 2011, 7,212 (70 percent) own housing and
3,090 (30 percent) rent housing. According to the 2011 ACS, 33 percent of the
senior population in Santa Ana lives alone. The 2010 Census reports that seniors
have the following needs: 35 percent have a disability, 57 percent earn lower
income, and 59 percent overpay for housing. With the aging of baby boomers, the
increasing number of seniors is expected to create a demand for affordable,
barrier-free housing and supportive services.
The City of Santa Ana encourages the provision of a range of housing types and
support services. As described in Appendix A (page A-22), the City has
approximately 944 age-restricted units; 1,114 senior-only mobile homes, based on
telephone survey; and 520 beds in residential care and continuing care facilities,
according to the State of California licensed care database. Senior services are
provided at two senior community centers. The Orange County Office of Aging
coordinates services available to seniors in the community. Programs in the
Housing Framework address the provision of housing and services to address this
segment of Santa Ana’s population.

PLANNING CONTEXT
LARGE HOUSEHOLDS
Santa Ana is a family-oriented community in which the average household size is
4.4 persons—significantly higher than the county average of 3.5. The 2011 ACS
reports 13,660 large owner and 14,375 large renter households in Santa Ana,
representing 38 percent of all households. Generally, large households seek larger
renter or ownership units with three or more bedrooms and typically experience
extremely high cost burdens and overcrowding. Although there appears to be
sufficient ownership opportunities, as discussed later, there is a significant
shortage of rental units that are affordable and large enough to accommodate
large families. As a result of this shortfall, many large families live in overcrowded
units.
FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
According to the 2010 Census, 26 percent (19,737) of all Santa Ana households
are single-parent households with children. Of those households, 63 percent
(12,555) are female headed. The Census reports that the average single-parent
household spends 12–25 percent of annual income for childcare, leaving less
income available to pay for housing. Housing opportunities can be improved
through policies that call for the provision of affordable childcare and for the
location of family housing sites close to transportation, recreational facilities, and
supportive services.
The Housing Element sets forth programs to assist large families and female-
headed families. Programs will continue to be implemented that preserve
affordable multiple-family housing and mobile homes through acquisition,
rehabilitation, and deed restrictions. The Housing Authority will also continue to
issue housing vouchers to lower income residents. Several new programs are
proposed to create incentives to build or rehabilitate family housing (including
multiple-bedroom units) as well as address family child care needs. Numerous
programs also address the redesignation of land use along corridors and other
areas in the community to facilitate new family housing.
DISABLED PERSONS
Santa Ana has many residents with physical, sensory, developmental, or other
disabilities who require special living arrangements and services designed to meet
their needs. For example, persons with physical and/or sensory disabilities often
require barrier-free housing, which allows freedom of movement to and within
the unit itself. Disabilities can also include visual, hearing, mobility, and other
conditions. The 2010 Census reports that people with a physical or other Census-
reported disability account for 6 percent or 20,248 people in the community. This
number is anticipated to increase in Santa Ana and nationwide with the aging of
the population.
The ACS collects data on people with a disability in six categories. They include
difficulty with hearing, vision, a cognitive impairment, ambulatory ability, self-
care, and independent living. The ACS estimates that there are 2,159 children,

10,488 adults, and 10,488 seniors with disabilities. Approximately 5 percent of
adults (age 18–64) in the City are affected by a disability. The greatest challenges
for disabled adults are cognitive impairment and independent living.
To accommodate people with disabilities, the City of Santa Ana has almost 2,000
beds in state-licensed care facilities. Housing vouchers are also allocated to
disabled people. The Dayle McIntosh Center and Goodwill Industries provide a
range of programs to improve the income and quality of life of disabled persons,
such as job training, independent living skills training, and barrier-free housing
referrals.
The State Department of Developmental Services provides community-based
services to developmentally disabled persons through contracted regional centers.
The Regional Center Orange County (RCOC) is charged by the State of
California with the care of people with developmental disabilities, defined as
those with severe, life-long disabilities attributable to mental and\or physical
impairments. RCOC has served 2,565 people in Santa Ana with a developmental
disability. Table 4 provides a breakdown by age and zip code of those helped

PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS
The County of Orange conducts an annual homeless needs assessment and
biennial point in time count. The 2011 Point in Time Survey estimated 6,939
people were homeless in Orange County. This count does not include persons at
risk of becoming homeless, such as people living in transient motels, or those
living in homes at risk of foreclosure, or other precarious arrangements. In 2013,
the Point in Time (PIT) Survey estimated 4,251 people were homeless in Orange
County.
Based on the PIT Survey, roughly 20 percent of the people counted reported
Santa Ana as their last place of residence before becoming homeless. Therefore,
the City estimates that approximately 850 people were homeless in Santa Ana as
of 2013.

PLANNING CONTEXT
Numerous factors contribute to homelessness—difficulties in obtaining
employment, mental illness, family problems, and substance abuse, to name a few.
Individuals also have needs for medical care, job training, childcare assistance,
mental health care, substance abuse treatment, English language education, and
other services.
Based on the 2013 estimate of approximately 850 homeless people and the current
stock of 318 emergency shelter beds in Santa Ana, the City has an unsheltered
homeless population of approximately 532 people. This does not include 250
seasonal emergency shelter beds provided by the Winter Armory program.
The estimated homeless bed need in the 17th and Tustin Avenue County Island
within the City’s sphere is estimated to be approximately four beds, based on a
population estimate of 306 for that area. The additional homeless need associated
with this County Island could be accommodated in Santa Ana’s available
industrial zones, per the City’s adopted Senate Bill 2 ordinance.
EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS/FARM WORKERS
According to the 2012 SCAG Existing Housing Needs Data Report, an estimated
11,370 households in Santa Ana earn extremely low income, comprising 15
percent of all City households. Extremely low income households are defined as
those earning no more than 30 percent of the area median income. Large-family
households and seniors living on a fixed income make up a large percentage of
this group. As discussed in Appendix A, 1,131Santa Ana residents are employed in
the agriculture industry, and the average pay is only $18,390 per year.
State law allows jurisdictions to estimate the future housing need for extremely
low-income households at one-half of the City’s very low income housing
allocation. The City’s very low income housing allocation for the 2014–2021
planning period is 45 units; therefore, the City’s projected need for extremely low-
income households is approximately 23 units. The City has a carryover of 111
very low units from the 2006 through 2014 planning period. This adds about 55
units to the City’s extremely low allocation, bringing the total number to 78 units.
To address this need, the Santa Ana Housing Authority issues an estimated 2,699
housing vouchers to predominantly extremely low-income households. This is
less than one-quarter of the need. The Santa Ana Housing and Neighborhood
Development program in partnership with the Housing Authority also work with
nonprofit and for-profit organizations to acquire apartments, rehabilitate them,
reconfigure units to create large-family housing, and deed restrict the units so that
the rents are affordable to low or extremely low income. The Planning and
Building Agency also assists organizations to develop and deed restrict single-
family homes affordable to lower income households.

          HOUSING NEEDS
          HOUSING PRODUCTION NEEDS
          The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) prepares housing
          construction needs goals for each city in Southern California as part of the
          Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). As set forth in the California
          Government Code, all local governments are required to set aside sufficient land,
          adopt programs, and provide funding, to the extent feasible, to facilitate and
          encourage housing production commensurate with that need.
          Santa Ana’s RHNA for the 2014–2021 planning period is 204 units with a
          carryover from the previous planning period of 201 lower income units, for a
          combined RHNA of 405 units divided into four income groups. As summarized
          in Table 5 and described below, total housing construction need comprises three
          components:
               Population and Job Growth. The first component of the RHNA is the
                number of units needed to accommodate new households and employment
                growth. The household growth component is determined by calculating the
                expected population growth that will occur from 2014–2021. SCAG projects
                the job base within Santa Ana will decrease by approximately 11,000 jobs
                through 2020, stabilizing the demand for housing in the City.
               Housing Factors. The RHNA housing goals incorporate additional units to
                encourage a certain number of vacant units. This allows for sufficient choice
                for consumers, maintains rents and prices at adequate levels, and encourages
                the desired level of housing maintenance and repair. The RHNA also
                includes a factor to account for housing units that will be lost due to
                demolition, fire, or conversion to nonresidential uses.
          Fair Share Factor. Santa Ana’s housing need includes four affordability levels.
          The RHNA is a complex calculation that accounts for the fact that Santa Ana has
          a disproportionately higher percentage of affordable units. Thus, the City is
          required to produce a smaller percentage of affordable units, as compared to
          jurisdictions with higher income households.

                                            Well-maintained housing is a critical part of safe and healthy neighborhoods.
                                            Housing conditions also influence property values and the City’s image.
                                            Generally, homes built in the last 30 years are in good shape with little repair

                                            significant maintenance and even extensive rehabilitation. Generally, homes built
                                            50 or more years ago (unless well-maintained) are more likely to require

                                            begin to require rehabilitation. Much of Santa Ana’s housing was built during

HOUSING PRESERVATION NEEDS
Santa Ana has a significant number of affordable housing units that receive public
subsidies in return for long-term affordability controls. Typically, these projects
provide units affordable to extremely low, very low, and low income households,
including persons with special needs. Over time, certain affordable units are
eligible to change from lower income housing to market rate housing within ten
years of the beginning of the planning period (2024). The reasons why publicly
assisted housing might convert to market rate include expiring subsidies,
mortgage prepayments, and expiration of affordability restrictions.
The City of Santa Ana has more than 2,500 affordable housing units that have
been built with local, state, or federal monies and provide housing affordable to
lower income families and seniors. Based on the latest available information, 880
units are technically at risk of conversion by June, 30, 2024. Chart 14 shows the
number of affordable units and those at risk of conversion.
Another critical issue related to housing preservation, particularly single-family
homes, is foreclosures. In the past few years, the City of Santa Ana has
experienced a significant number of foreclosures that have displaced individuals
and families. The roots of the foreclosure crisis are complex, related to the
purchase of overvalued real estate with creative lending packages. As the market
has receded and loans readjusted, many homeowners are simply unable to afford
their homes.

Housing Resources
This chapter provides an overview of the City’s regional housing needs planning
goals and the land, financial, and administrative resources available to address
current and future housing needs.
OVERVIEW
The City’s combined RHNA is 405 units for the housing element planning
period. This includes 204 units for the 2014–2021 planning period and a
carryover from the previous planning period of 201 lower income units.
Within this housing production goal, the City is required to demonstrate capacity
to meet four different income and affordability goals: very low, low, moderate, and
above moderate. The City’s combined RHNA by affordability level is 156 units of
housing affordable to very low income households, 122 housing units affordable
for low income households, 37 housing units affordable for moderate income
households, and 90 above moderate income units. Appendix C contains
additional detail on the breakdown of the combined RHNA.
The remainder of this chapter shows how the City will accommodate the regional
housing needs production goals.

                                The City has identified areas for future residential and mixed uses within its
                                District Centers and transit corridors. These areas include Transit Zoning Code,
                                Harbor Boulevard Mixed Use Transit Corridor, Fifth Street, and First Street. The
                                sites are specifically chosen to create distinct and vibrant activity centers linked
                                together with a variety of transportation options.
                                Transit Zoning Code
                                The City adopted the Transit Zoning Code (TZC) in 2010. The TZC guides
                                development in the central urban core of Santa Ana and consists of more than 450
                                acres of land. The TZC is designed to foster the development of a transit-
                                supportive environment with the addition of new transit infrastructure. It
                                incorporates alternative transportation modes with a pedestrian-oriented
                                framework. Preservation of the existing urban character and the pedestrian
                                atmosphere is strengthened by the code’s development and design standards.
                                These standards also offer flexibility for the integration of new infill development
                                and for the reuse of existing structures. The TZC puts an emphasis on providing
                                a range of housing options, including affordable housing. Nine zones guide land
                                use as well as urban design and building form.

METRO EAST OVERLAY
Santa Ana adopted the Metro East Mixed Use (MEMU) Overlay Zone in 2007,
located at the intersection of the I-5 and SR-22. The MEMU is intended to be a
vibrant urban village with a balance of professional office, mixed-use and live-
work, commercial, recreational, and retail uses. The land uses within the MEMU
are to be connected by highly amenitized pedestrian linkages within an overall
vibrant and 24-hour district.
Residential and commercial development capacity within the MEMU is limited to
a net increase of 963,000 square feet of commercial, 690,000 square feet of office
space, and the potential for 5,550 residences. This area consists of three mixed-use
districts—the Neighborhood Transitional District, Village Center District, and
Active Urban District.
    Active Urban District. This district is intended as the location for well-
     designed high-rise mixed-use developments, offices, hotels, and other uses in

                                   corridors are consistent with the City’s Go Local vision to promote sustainable
                                   multi-modal transportation options. The three transportation corridors selected
                                   are Harbor Boulevard, Fifth Street, and First Street.

                                   Westminster/17th Street) expected to open in the coming years.

Fifth Street
The 5th Street Corridor comprises 14 acres and is located adjacent to the unused
Pacific Electric right of way. The area is occupied by heavy industrial uses and
fronts adjacent neighborhoods. Allowing for new residential uses in this area
could provide housing options, eliminate the incompatible land uses and traffic
from industrial uses, increase residential property values, and support future
transit.

First Street
The 1st Street Corridor comprises 25 acres, located west of the I-5 and
perpendicular to the Santa Ana Zoo. The street is a major gateway to the MEMU
and Santa Ana Downtown. The site contains an underutilized hotel, vacant
buildings, and commercial uses. The Saddleback Hotel, located across the street
from Santa Ana Zoo, also needs significant rehabilitation, or even demolition.
1st Street Corridor
Should these three transit corridors be chosen to accommodate new housing
opportunities and satisfy the City’s RHNA, the City will need to create new
residential general plan land use designations, zoning districts, and design
guidelines (described in Chapter 5) that allow for a range of densities, perhaps
from 23 units to 35 units per acre. At an average density of 30 units per acre, these
corridors could accommodate approximately 2,455 new residential units.

DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL SUMMARY
The City of Santa Ana has identified several major areas—Metro East, the
proposed Harbor Mixed Use Transit Corridor Specific Plan, other transit
corridors, and the Transit Zoning Code—to address its remaining RHNA.
Appendix C provides a detailed site inventory and explains how these sites can be
credited toward the RHNA in conformance with the Government Code. In short,
the City of Santa Ana has identified adequate sites to satisfy preconditions for
facilitating affordable housing and accommodate the remaining RHNA for lower
and moderate income households.
In addition to the identification of future sites for residential development, state
law also requires the City of Santa Ana to set forth a housing implementation
plan that contains programs to ensure the sites are adequate. These programs
(described in Chapter 5) should both encourage and facilitate the production of a
wide range of housing types, including affordable housing. Table 6 summarizes
the sites, capacity, and program commitments. Exhibit 1 illustrates the location of
identified sites and major projects built since 2006.

HOUSING PRESERVATION
As a built-out community, the City of Santa Ana has a large number of older
apartment projects that provide affordable housing to residents. In some cases, the
projects receive public subsidies and therefore are deed restricted as affordable to
lower income households. In other cases, the projects provide affordable housing
based on prevailing rents. Given the age of the housing stock, many of the
apartment units are not appropriately sized; lack amenities, open space, or
adequate parking; or experience overcrowding.
PRESERVATION OPTIONS
Santa Ana has long recognized the benefits of rehabilitating older multiple-family
housing to improve quality of life and further community and neighborhood
revitalization goals. The City has a proactive program to assist nonprofit
organizations to acquire, rehabilitate, and reconfigure, when feasible, multiple-
family apartments and to require long-term affordability covenants to ensure the
units are affordable to lower income households.
Table 7 details the City’s affordable housing inventory that is at risk of converting
to market rate housing within 10 years from the beginning of the planning period
(by June 30, 2024). This includes all projects that have received public subsidies
and are deed restricted to be affordable to lower income households in Santa Ana.

Policy Framework
This chapter sets forth the City’s vision, goals, and the policies to facilitate and
encourage a range of housing opportunities to meet current and future housing
needs of Santa Ana’s residents and workforce.
HOUSING VISION
Santa Ana’s vision is to be the dynamic urban center of Orange County, acclaimed
for its investment in children, neighborhood pride, enriching cultural experiences,
appreciation of diversity, thriving economic climate, quality governmental
services, and leadership among California cities. This vision underpins the Santa
Ana General Plan—the blueprint for community development—and guides
decision making regarding how resources should be allocated to different
priorities.
Santa Ana community and civic leaders recognize the importance and value of
together creating a community that provides opportunities for residents and
workforce to meet their varied needs. In 2009, the City Council adopted the
following housing vision amended in 2014 to add reference to “healthy,” thereby
acknowledging the importance of health in all housing policies:
Santa Ana residents have an equal right and opportunity to find suitable housing
in quality residential neighborhoods that allow themselves, their families, and
neighbors to live the fullest lives. We support an inclusive community that is
multigenerational, culturally diverse, healthy, sustainable, and economically
broad. The City will facilitate the production, rehabilitation, and improvement of
rental and homeownership opportunities at different affordability levels consistent
with these principles.
Santa Ana is committed to this vision of a diverse community that increases
housing choice and improves neighborhoods for all residents. This Housing
Element is the City’s approach to achieving this vision. The following describes
key topic areas for the Housing Element and provides goals and policies to
provide a foundation for the Housing Plan.

                                POLICY FRAMEWORK
                                HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS:
                                The City of Santa Ana has a rich mosaic of neighborhoods distinguished by their
                                history, architecture, housing types, and amenities. The City has a number of
                                neighborhoods with historic resources, including French Park, Floral Park,
                                Wilshire Square, West Floral Park, Washington Square, and Heninger Park. The
                                City is also known for its original Mexican barrios, including the Logan, Lacy,
                                Delhi, and Santa Anita neighborhoods, some of which date back to the later
                                1880s.
                                Rich in history and culture, Santa Ana’s neighborhoods are more than simply
Vintage home in north Santa Ana
                                collections of housing; in fact, our neighborhoods are the fundamental building
                                blocks of the community. They profoundly define the quality of life experienced.
                                Neighborhoods are where residents feel safe, where friendships and social ties
                                develop, and where people identify with their community. Ultimately,
                                neighborhoods are home. Therefore, the design and maintenance of
                                neighborhoods—their buildings, streets, parks, open space, trees, and
                                infrastructure—are critical to quality of life.
                                Some residential neighborhoods in Santa Ana are well preserved: streets are lined
                                with trimmed canopy trees; physical infrastructure is sufficient in size and in
                                proper working order; and housing is well maintained. Some neighborhoods are
                                stable, but are beginning to show signs of deterioration and could benefit from
                                neighborhood improvement. Yet other neighborhoods require significant
                                reinvestment in housing, infrastructure, parks/open space, and public services.
                                Recent research also underscores how neighborhood conditions directly influence
                                health. Important features that improve health include, among others: 1) the
                                availability of parks, trails, and recreational facilities; 2) the availability of
                                affordable and healthy food options; 3) safety of residents from crime and traffic;
                                and 4) the mitigation or removal of environmental hazards. All of these pieces are
                                as essential as the quality of housing and are critical to promoting more complete
                                and healthy neighborhoods.

                                residents, Santa Ana’s highest priority is creating livable neighborhoods. This will

                                neighborhoods. The City continues to direct substantial resources to achieving
                                these objectives and has set forth the following goals and policies to guide quality
                                and sustainable housing and neighborhoods in Santa Ana.

Goal 1
Livable and complete neighborhoods of quality housing conditions, ample
parks and community services, well-maintained infrastructure, and public
facilities that inspire neighborhood pride and ownership.
Policies
HE-1.1        Housing Conditions. Promote the rehabilitation, repair, and
              improvement of single-family, multiple-family, and mobile homes

HE-1.2        Neighborhood Involvement. Encourage active and informed
              participation in neighborhood organizations to help identify needs
              and implement programs aimed at the beautification, improvement,
              and preservation of neighborhoods.
HE-1.3        Complete Neighborhoods. Improve neighborhood quality by
              locating or providing access to complementary services and public         Neighborhood projects

                                   HOUSING SUPPLY AND DIVERSITY
                                   Where should we live? Near work, family, or community amenities? What kind
                                   of housing can we best afford? Does this neighborhood, size of home, or quality
                                   of housing best meet our household needs? Where would be the safest or most
                                   desirable place to retire? All of us ask these housing questions at different times in
                                   our lives—when our children move out of town, as we look for the first job, as we
                                   begin to have families, as we contemplate retirement, or when other life-changing
                                   events occur.
                                   As expressed in the City’s vision, an adequate housing supply for our children,
                                   our workforce, our families, and our parents is a critical goal. Housing products
                                   and prices must also be diverse, providing a range of choices and price points
                                   suited to the different incomes, lifestyles, and needs of residents and workforce. A
                                   broad housing stock includes single- and multiple-family housing, mobile homes,
                                   mixed/multiuse, and special needs housing. Ensuring affordable housing will
                                   help foster an inclusive community that welcomes all people of all ages and
                                   income levels.

                                   community-wide goals. The Metro East Mixed-Use Overlay Zone, downtown,
                                   MacArthur Place, and other similar areas support our economy and burgeoning
                                   job centers. Infill housing is encouraged along selected transit corridors and
                                   existing neighborhoods as a means to reinvest in the community and create great
                                   neighborhoods.
                                   Fostering imaginative housing solutions requires creative approaches. Market
                                   forces have driven up land and construction costs, increasing the cost of housing.
                                   Although necessary to guide growth, land use regulations, development
                                   standards, building codes, local fees and taxes, and permit procedures also
                                   increase costs. Environmental issues influence where housing should be located
                                   and how it is designed.
                                   Santa Ana will encourage housing projects that withstand the test of time.
                                   Through the implementation of design guidelines, new housing will include the
                                   latest in creative designs and site planning techniques. Increasing efforts will be
                                   placed on making housing accessible and suitable to people of all abilities and
                                   ages. Housing will incorporate sustainable “green” practices in design, site
                                   planning, and construction. The City will support active housing designs that
                                   encourage wellness.
                                   The following goal and policies guide the City’s efforts to improve supply and
                                   diversity of housing in Santa Ana.

POLICY FRAMEWORK
HOUSING ASSISTANCE
Santa Ana’s community is defined by the many people who have made their way
across the country or from other parts of the world, bringing with them different
cultures and traditions. Many residents are first-, second-, or third-generation
citizens and residents. Despite their varied backgrounds, the importance of family
and shared sense of community form a common thread connecting Santa Ana
residents.
There are challenges for how to assist residents in securing and maintaining
adequate and affordable housing. In recent years, increases in housing prices and
rents have made it increasingly difficult for lower and moderate income
households to afford housing, resulting in increasing cost burdens for residents.
Rising cost burdens have contributed to significant overcrowding. The recent
downturn in the housing market continues to place families at risk of foreclosure
or very high cost burdens.
The City of Santa Ana also faces unprecedented pressures. The California
legislature has ended redevelopment and reallocated funds to address the state
budget crisis. The federal government continues to cut back funding for housing
and community development activities. As a result, the City must be creative in
leveraging efforts with partners to pool the resources necessary to assist
households. Moreover, the City must also make deliberate decisions about how
best to allocate financial resources to different housing programs given the trade-
offs required.
The City’s housing vision affirms and supports a vibrant Santa Ana, comprising a
socially and economically diverse community of renters and homeowners.
Housing our families and children is of critical concern. Assisting households of
all backgrounds, circumstances, and income levels will play an important role in
achieving and maintaining homeownership, providing renters a greater range of
choices in housing, and protecting vulnerable individuals and families from
displacement.
Goal 3
Increased opportunities for low and moderate income individuals and families
to find quality housing opportunities and afford a greater choice of rental or
homeownership opportunities.
Policies
HE-3.1        Rental Assistance. Support the provision of rental assistance for
              individuals and families earning extremely low, very low, and low
              income with funding from the federal government.
HE-3.2        Homeownership. Increase and expand homeownership
              opportunities for low and moderate income residents and employees

HE-3.4      Supportive Services. Support the provision of employment training,
            childcare services, rental assistance, youth services, and other
            community services that enable households to attain the greatest
            level of self-sufficiency and independence.
HE-3.5      Collaborative Partnerships. Collaborate with nonprofit
            organizations, developers, business community, special interest
            groups, and government agencies to develop affordable housing
            opportunities for residents and our workforce.
HE-3.6      Homeownership Preservation. Take a leadership role in forming
            partnerships, educating residents, and providing resources that
            enable residents to make informed decisions on their homes and
            prevent foreclosure.
HE-3.7      Workforce Housing. Work with Orange County Business Council
            and major employers to explore opportunities for creating workforce
            housing, including for artists, veterans, and other residents working
            in Santa Ana.
HE-3.8      Affordable Housing. Maintain affordable housing by prohibiting the
            conversion of apartments to condominiums until the vacancy rate in
            the City is 5% or greater. Support the preservation of mobile home
            parks as affordable housing.
HE-3.9      Fair Housing. Continue to fund services and organizations that
            work to prohibit discrimination in the rental, sale, and occupancy of
            housing and provide education, support, and enforcement services to
            address discriminatory practices.

POLICY FRAMEWORK
SPECIAL NEEDS
Santa Ana is unique in Orange County, containing a diversity of people of all
backgrounds, family types, lifestyles, and income levels. While adding to the
richness of Santa Ana, many residents have special housing needs. Some special
needs are common to all, while others are more common to people of different
ages and incomes. These groups include, but are not limited to, seniors, large
families with children, people with disabilities, female-headed households, single-
parent families, and homeless people.
Fashioning an appropriate, creative and effective response to this challenge
requires a better understanding of the nature of special needs. Special needs may
arise due to one’s income, family characteristics, disability, health condition, or
many other circumstances. This complexity requires a broad range of strategies
for housing and services.
Providing housing for an aging population is one example. The retirement and
aging of babyboomers have created the need for new housing options. While
many seniors desire to age in place in their home, new forms of housing, such as
lifecare facilities, offer a broader continuum of care. These types of facilities
reduce the need for seniors to relocate multiple times to new housing. Single-
family homes for the elderly are another popular option that give residents the
ability to stay within their community, and are typically affordable to moderate
incomes.
Equally important is the changing nature of families. A growing trend is
multigenerational households, defined as those consisting of more than two
generations living under the same roof. This trend is due in part to the aging of
residents, economic conditions and challenges of finding affordable housing,
lifestyle preferences, and the cost of senior housing. Whereas the granny flat or
room addition concept is not new, developers are now building housing products
for multigenerational living.
Housing for people with disabilities or who are homeless is also changing. The
traditional way to address homeless people with emergency shelters, transitional
housing and permanent supportive housing is being blended with a new housing-
first model. This new approach focuses on placing people immediately into
permanent housing, without going to a shelter. Increasing movement of persons
with disabilities to community-based or in-homecare options require new models
of supportive housing.
Santa Ana recognizes these changes and has set forth the following goal and
policies to guide its approach to housing special needs groups.

Goal 4
Adequate rental and ownership housing opportunities and supportive services for
seniors, people with disabilities, families with children, and people needing
emergency, transitional, or supportive housing.
Policies
HE-4.1      Senior Housing. Support development of affordable senior rental
            and ownership housing, readily accessible to support services;
            provide assistance for seniors to maintain and repair their homes to
            facilitate the maximum independent living.
HE-4.2      Family Housing. Facilitate and encourage the development of larger
            rental and ownership units for families, including lower and
            moderate income families, and the provision of childcare, after-
            school care, and other services when feasible.                         Sunrise Gardens is an example of
                                                                                   assisted living housing in Santa

HE-4.3      Housing for Disabled People. Support the development of
            permanent, affordable, and accessible housing that allows people
            with disabilities to live independent lives, and assist them in
            maintaining and repairing their homes.
HE-4.4      Service-Enriched Housing. Support the provision of supportive
            services and service-enriched housing for persons with special needs,
            such as seniors, disabled people, homeless people, families, veterans,
            and people with medical conditions.
HE-4.5      Healthy Homes. Support efforts to make homes more healthful by
            addressing health hazards associated with lead-based paint, asbestos,
            vermin, mold, VOC-laden materials, and prohibiting smoking in
            multi-family projects, among others.
HE-4.6      Homeless Services. Partner with community service organizations
            that address the needs of homeless people, including housing linked
            with case management, employment, physical, mental health,
            substance abuse, and other services.
HE-4.7      Regulatory Oversight. Exercise appropriate land use, planning, and
            regulatory oversight over the operation, location, and impact
            associated with special needs housing and facilities consistent with
            state and federal housing laws.
HE-4.8      Housing Priority. Provide that Santa Ana residents, employees, and
            designated need groups receive priority for affordable housing

Housing Plan
This chapter sets forth the City housing programs that are designed to further the
housing vision for Santa Ana.
OVERVIEW
The goals and policies of the Housing Element are implemented through
programs designed to encourage the maintenance, improvement, development,
and conservation of housing and neighborhoods in the community. These
programs are organized into functional groupings that relate to specific goals.
However, in many cases a program achieves multiple goals and policies. In
pursuing these goals, the City will also seek to achieve quantified objectives.
These objectives are summarized for major housing activities in Table 8.

The remainder of this chapter describes City programs that will be implemented
to achieve the objectives for the 2014–2021 planning period. Housing Programs
are grouped under four categories that correspond to housing goals, although
programs often achieve multiple goals.

HOUSING PLAN
HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS
HOUSING REHABILITATION
1. Single-Family Rehabilitation
Periodic repair and rehabilitation of single-family housing is critical for maintaining
the quality of housing and preserving residential neighborhoods. The City of Santa
Ana estimates that up to 8,000 single-family homes may require repair and
rehabilitation. The City provides up to $75,000 in low, fixed-interest loans for the
repair and rehabilitation of single-family homes, including historic homes. These
include one- to four-unit residential properties on a single lot that are owner-occupied
units. To qualify for a home rehabilitation loan, the household must be very low or
low income, and the housing unit must be owner occupied for the life of the loan.
Single-family acquisition and/or rehabilitation programs are also offered through the
Neighborhood Stabilization Program described later under Program 39. Paint Your
Heart Out, a local nonprofit, also assists in helping Santa Ana mobile home owners
with painting, repairs, and upkeep.
2. Mobile Home Repair
Santa Ana has about 30 mobile home parks that provide approximately 3,976 mobile
home spaces. These parks provide affordable housing options for many low, very low,
and extremely low income residents. At least seven mobile home parks are age-
restricted for seniors. The City historically offered loan programs for mobile home
parks; however, the demise of redevelopment removed funding for those programs.
The City now offers a Mobile Home Hardship program, whereby very low income
seniors and people with disabilities are eligible to receive an interest-free loan of up to
$5,000 to make repairs. The City will continue to implement this program and
partnerships with other nonprofits to implement the mobile home repair program.
3. Rental Rehabilitation
The City of Santa Ana‘s rental rehabilitation program is designed to encourage the
timely rehabilitation of rental apartment housing. The City offers loans up to $75,000,
at 0 percent interest, amortized for 10 years. In order to qualify for a loan, not less
than 51 percent of the units must be affordable to and occupied by lower income
households. Once housing improvements are completed, the units are subject to deed
restrictions. Half of the rehabilitated rental units must be rent restricted as affordable
to very low income households, and the remainder must be rent restricted as
affordable to low income households. Priority for loan assistance is given to properties
cited by the City’s Code Enforcement team. Rental property acquisition and/or
rehabilitation programs are also offered through the Neighborhood Stabilization
Program described later under Program 39.

NEIGHBORHOOD INITIATIVES
4. Neighborhood Improvement
The Neighborhood Improvement Program provides City staff support and technical
assistance for neighborhood organizations to facilitate improved communication
among all parties, between neighborhoods, and with the City. The City of Santa Ana
has also established the Communication Linkage Forum (Com-Link) to promote
leadership, civic participation, unity, and pride in all Santa Ana’s participating
neighborhoods. The City also supports the Community Development Resource
Network, guided by a steering committee with members from community-based
organizations. The steering committee organizes and sponsors the Most Beautiful
Yard Award, Neighborhood Hero Award, and Celebrate Santa Ana. The City assigns
staff to work with neighborhoods to provide training and capacity building that will    Lush trees beautify parks and
enable individuals to improve their neighborhoods.                                      neighborhoods in Santa Ana.
5. Neighborhood Infrastructure
Santa Ana recognizes that neighborhood quality depends on the condition of
infrastructure. To that end, the City is strategically planning to improve and maintain
its infrastructure. From 2008–2012, the City implemented Project Restore, a $100
million program to improve the appearance, function, and safety of residential streets.
As part of the Capital Improvement program, the City continues to make substantial
investments in storm drains, sewers, and water facilities. Neighborhoods are kept
clean through waste management and street cleaning programs. Public landscaping
and street tree program are also provided to beautify and improve neighborhoods.
The City will continue to implement these neighborhood infrastructure projects and
seek additional local, state, and federal grants to continue efforts.
6. Healthy Neighborhood Initiatives
The City recognizes that a healthy neighborhood requires more than housing and
physical infrastructure; equally important are parks, open spaces, recreation
opportunities, and other projects that improve resident health. Santa Ana has
established its Santa Ana Green Program, encouraging clean fuel technologies, water
conservation, and energy saving efforts. The City is a Tree City USA, implements a
Community Forestry Program, and is involved in installing greenways, where
feasible, and improving parks. The Parks, Recreation, and Community Services
Agency has a Healthy Neighborhood Initiative to promote healthy lifestyles. Part of
this effort includes establishing “Safe and Active Living United Districts” (SALUD),
where members receive nutritional tips and participate in fitness activities, such as
walking clubs. Another example is Active Living in Santa Ana, an initiative between
the City, community-based organizations, and health care experts.

HOUSING PLAN
COMMUNITY-BUILDING INITIATIVES
7. Santa Ana Building Healthy Community Initiative
In 2009, Central Santa Ana was selected as one of the 14 sites in California to
participate in The California Endowment’s Building Healthy Communities. This
$10 million and 10-year initiative aims to improve resident health and achieve the
Endowment’s healthy community outcomes by intentionally addressing social
determinants of health—at the individual, housing, block, and neighborhood level.
The initiative also seeks to influence and shape public policy at all levels in the
community, including the City’s comprehensive general plan, safe routes to schools,
business community, parks and recreation opportunities in neighborhoods, and even
at home. Effecting system change will create a healthier and prosperous community
for the current and future generations of residents living in Santa Ana. The City will
continue to provide support to this community building initiative.
8. Building Community Efforts
The City of Santa Ana is committed to and actively involved in supporting programs
and capital improvements that improve neighborhood livability. Recent projects
include new community centers and parks (e.g., LHA “Green Hear Families” Park
and Community Center, joint use facilities (e.g., Roosevelt Elementary School,
Willard Intermediate School, Garfield Elementary School and new community
center), community gardens projects (e.g., Grain Project), public art, and other
worthy community projects. The City is active in sponsoring community efforts such
as libraries and educational services, both free standing and within City-initiated
housing projects, such as Cornerstone Villages. The City of Santa Ana will continue
to seek additional partnering opportunities to build stronger and healthier
neighborhoods through a wide variety of community building programs.
9. Neighborhood Safety
Safe neighborhoods are an important and indispensable part of quality of life. This
goal is achieved through the efforts of multiple city departments, including planning
and housing, who implement programs to improve and maintain the safety of
neighborhoods. The City is active in promoting safe routes to school for children to
walk and bicycle. Traffic control measures are in place to reduce speeding and reduce
safety hazards from vehicular traffic. The City is active in making curb cuts and
repairing its many sidewalks. The Police Department is working with community
leaders to startup Neighborhood Watch groups and provide mentoring activities for
youth. Finally, the City Council, through its Public Safety and Neighborhood
Improvement Committee, maintains an open forum for addressing the ongoing
public safety or improvement needs of each of its neighborhoods.

CODE ENFORCEMENT
10. Property Maintenance Standards (Healthy Housing)
Santa Ana requires adherence to building and property maintenance standards in
its municipal codes (e.g., International Property Maintenance Code and Health
and Safety Standards related to substandard housing). Research has increasingly
pointed toward a strong link between property maintenance, neighborhood
quality, and the overall health of residents. The American Public Health
Association and National Center for Healthy Housing have created a new
National Healthy Housing Standard. The standard’s health-based codes are
designed to complement the policies and regulations already adopted and
implemented by cities. Santa Ana has the opportunity to incorporate the latest in
best practices for healthy homes into the City’s existing building and maintenance
codes used by building and code enforcement officials.
The City will collaborate with community serving organizations to educate
residents regarding property health and maintenance issues. The City’s Code
Enforcement Department will also work cooperatively with the County Health
Department to address interior infestation of insects, vermin, or rodents; and the
lack of adequate garbage storage and removal facilities, as authorized by Senate
Bill 488 (2013).
Many jurisdictions are exploring additional ways to enforce property
maintenance standards, especially when related to health and safety
conditions in interior living spaces, including Rent Escrow Account
Programs (REAP). A REAP is an enforcement tool that encourages
landlords to maintain their properties and to bring properties that
have existing violations into compliance. When a property
demonstrates substantial habitual violations and failure to conduct
repairs and maintenance, tenants may be entitled to rent reductions,
protection from eviction or other retaliation, and a delay of rental
payment until repairs are completed.11. Proactive Rental Enforcement
The Proactive Rental Enforcement Program (PREP) promotes public health and
safety through systematic and proactive code enforcement. Santa Ana has many
rental housing properties with deferred maintenance. PREP focuses on
identifying these code violations in rental properties that threaten the occupants’
safety, the structural integrity of the building, or the condition of the surrounding
neighborhood. Code violations are identified through a quadrennial inspection
completed every four years. Properties are charged a fee for service unless the
property receives a Gold Seal for meeting standards of excellence in property
maintenance. To maximize the effectiveness of this program, the City seeks to
augment levels of funding and personnel where feasible.

HOUSING PLAN
12. Residential Response Team
The Residential Response Team (RRT) is a complement to the existing PREP
program and focused on single-family residential units. RRT is a focused code
enforcement effort that investigates complaints alleging substandard housing
conditions, property maintenance violations, and land use violations on owner-
occupied or rented single-family residences. The team also handles traditional
code enforcement concerns involving the lack of exterior property maintenance
and illegal vending violations. The most commonly reported violations involve
substandard housing, hazardous conditions, unpermitted work, illegal business in
a residence, and dangerous and abandoned buildings. Property owners are given a
fixed period to abate conditions before enforcement actions are taken. To
maximize the effectiveness of this program, the City seeks to augment levels of
funding and personnel where feasible.
HISTORIC PRESERVATION
13. Historic Program and Ordinance
The City of Santa Ana recognizes the value of its heritage and has therefore
established Chapter 30 of the Santa Ana Municipal Code to regulate and preserve
places of historical and architectural significance. The City implements its
Historic Code through the placement of properties on the Local Register of
Historic Resources and through review of requests for exterior work or
demolitions of historic structures; recommending policies and regulations for the
protection, reuse, and rehabilitation of historical property; and encouraging public
understanding and involvement in historic and architectural heritage. The City
will continue to seek opportunities to implement its historic preservation
program, where feasible, to preserve its important resources.
14. Historic Home Rehabilitation Incentive
The City of Santa Ana offers up to $75,000 in loans for the rehabilitation and/or
preservation of historic, owner-occupied single-family homes. The home loan is
limited to income-qualified property owners. In addition to direct financial
assistance, the City also supports the Mills Act property tax incentive program,
which grants property tax relief for rehabilitation improvements as a financial
incentive for owners to preserve their historic properties. The Mills Act
Agreements allow for up to 50% property tax savings. However, funds are in short
supply for smaller repairs. To complement its incentive programs, the City will
seek new funding sources, including grants and loans that can be used or
leveraged with others to focus on preventive, rather than corrective repairs.
15. Historic Neighborhood Preservation
Santa Ana has residential, commercial, and industrial areas that have cultural or
historic significance to the community. Residential neighborhoods include, but
are not limited to, French Park, Floral Park, Wilshire Square, Eastside,
Washington Square, and Heninger Park residential neighborhoods. The City is
also known for its historic Mexican barrios, including the Logan, Lacy, Delhi, and

                                                                        HOUSING PLAN
Santa Anita neighborhoods, which date to the late 1880s. Several of these are
recognized as historical districts, while others are not. In addition to preservation
strategies for individual structures, the City could explore strategies to identify
and preserve neighborhoods or elements thereof that are locally considered
worthy of preservation efforts, but not necessarily individually eligible for a formal
state or national historic designation.
HOUSING SUPPLY AND DIVERSITY
HOUSING SUPPLY
16. Transit Zoning Code
Santa Ana continues to pursue efforts to revitalize its historic core. In 2010, the
City adopted the Transit Zoning Code to encourage residential/mixed-use
housing opportunities and support transit goals. The Transit Zoning Code
applies to properties adjacent to and near Santa Ana Boulevard, Santa Ana
Regional Transportation Center, the Downtown, Civic Center area, and the
Logan and Lacy neighborhoods. The Transit Zoning Code has provisions that
will strengthen existing neighborhoods and allow for development that creates a
walkable, transit-supportive environment. The Housing Authority continues to
work with developers to build quality infill housing in downtown.
17. Metro East Mixed-Use Overlay
Approved in 2007, the MEMU Overlay Zone is intended to introduce new
development forms and land uses that will provide for the creation of a high-
intensity, mixed-use urban village within a previously developed mid- to high-rise
office environment near the intersection of the I-5 and SR-55. The plan provides a
framework for the development of three mixed-use districts—Neighborhood
Transitional, Village Center, and Active Urban. Within the MEMU Overlay
Zone, up to 5,500 multiple-family residential and live-work units are allowed. To
facilitate development, residential land uses are permitted by right in the three
districts subject to a Site Plan approval by the Planning Commission. The
MEMU will be a primary location for new housing, mixed use, and commerce in
Santa Ana.
18. District Centers
Santa Ana District Centers at MacArthur Place, Metro East, City Place, and other
areas are intended to accommodate high-rise office, commercial, residential, and
mixed-uses. Residential uses in most District Centers allow up to 90 units per acre
when developed as an integral component of a master-planned, mixed-use
project. The Specific Development District (SD) is a key planning and zoning
tool that is used to facilitate creative residential and mixed/multiuse developments
in District Centers as well as other locations. Residential/mixed-use development
standards are individually tailored to specific project needs. Santa Ana will
continue to direct multiple-family, mixed-use housing, and commercial projects
CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT                                      57

HOUSING PLAN
into select District Centers that further the City’s housing, economic
development, and other general plan objectives.
19. Harbor Mixed Use Transit Corridor Specific Plan
Harbor Boulevard spans Santa Ana and links key commercial, employment, and
residential districts. Santa Ana has made considerable capital investments in
Harbor Corridor to reestablish this corridor as a major north-south spine linked
to the City’s future fixed guideway system. The City is updating the specific plan
to create a vibrant corridor that supports mixed residential uses, business and
employment opportunities, access to multimodal transportation options, and
environment supporting health and wellness. The specific plan will create a
zoning framework to allow for new compact transit-supportive housing combined
with nonresidential uses along Harbor Boulevard. This corridor will be zoned to
accommodate part of the City’s share of the regional housing needs targets with a
mix of high quality, transit-supportive housing.
20. Comprehensive General Plan Update
The City of Santa Ana will begin a process to study best practices in updating the
General Plan, with the long-term goal of providing for a comprehensive update.
The General Plan update will cover a wide variety of topics, including
employment and economic vitality, community health and wellness, strong
neighborhoods, multimodal transportation system, public safety, education, and
parks and recreation among other topics. Another key focus will be the role of
First Street, Fifth Street, and other key transportation corridors to further housing
opportunities, economic development, mobility options, and parks and
recreational opportunities. Concurrent will be a comprehensive update to the
Zoning Ordinance (Program 21). These efforts are anticipated to commence in
2014/2015.
21. Zoning Ordinance Update
The comprehensive update of the general plan will create a need to review the
Zoning Ordinance for consistency and for additional direction to implement the
vision, goals, and policies of the general plan. To that end, the Zoning Ordinance
update will include a revision to development standards that will align the zoning
ordinance with the General Plan. To the extent determined, the effort will include
provisions that address parking, height, setbacks, and open space requirements to
facilitate sustainable, quality housing and mitigate potential constraints to
housing. The City may also explore the feasibility of adapting non-residential
zones to accommodate artist live-work needs.
Finally, the Zoning Ordinance update will also explore and include provisions of
a Healthy Design Ordinance or development concepts that encourage
development types that foster active living, health and wellness. The final scope of
work will be determined during the general plan update stage and the result of
input from the community and civic leaders.

                                                                       HOUSING PLAN
BUILDING DESIGN
22. Building Design Guidelines
Building design is a key component of the City’s overall housing strategy. Poor
quality housing design, in the long term, leads to premature deterioration, adverse
impacts to quality of life, poor resident health, and public opposition to new
housing. Santa Ana’s Citywide Design Guidelines provide specific guidance
about preferred and discouraged methods of planning, neighborhood design, and
construction. In recent years, however, planners have become increasingly aware
of the need to integrate emerging concepts of sustainability, health, and wellness
into how buildings are designed, built, and operated. One such effort is the Active
Design Guidelines. As the City encourages new forms of housing that further
health, wellness, and sustainability, new evidenced-based research offers an
opportunity to amend design standards to foster sustainability, health, and
wellness.
23. Green Building
Recent advances in technology and environmental awareness have led to a greater
understanding of how the design, construction, and operation of buildings have
profound implications for energy use and global warming. Green building is the
practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally
responsible and resource efficient throughout a building's life cycle: from siting to
design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition.
Although CalGreen Code is now state law, the City is committed to developing a
Green Building policy that incorporates sustainable concepts for housing,
supports the renovation of housing with resource-efficient equipment, considers
incentives for Green practices, works with developers to create demonstration
projects, and provides recognition for best practices.
24. Development Review
Santa Ana’s urbanization has raised the awareness of the individual and
cumulative impacts of land use decisions on community quality of life. Consistent
with state law requirements and city policy, the City of Santa Ana requires Site
Plan Review, Design Review, and Environmental Review of proposed residential
projects. City staff review projects for compliance with City development
standards and operating standards, building and site design standards, and
potential environmental impacts. In an effort to continue to improve and protect
the community’s quality of life and implement healthy community best practices,
the City will continue to ensure appropriate review with existing requirements
and development a simplified healthy design checklist for use by planners.

INCENTIVES
25. Affordable Housing Financial Incentives
The City actively incentivizes the provision of quality, affordable housing. These
may include land assembly and writedowns, direct financial assistance with
HOME and set-aside funds, issuance of tax-exempt bonds, and technical
assistance. The amount of financial assistance depends on the availability of local,
state, and federal funds. The City also adopted an ordinance that defers payment
of development fees to just before final occupancy. The City of Santa Ana will
continue these incentives and facilitate their application to each planning area as
appropriate; in some areas, a development incentive may be more appropriate
and, in other areas, direct financial assistance may be more appropriate.
26. Extremely Low Income Housing
Housing Element law has been recently expanded to include a focus on the
housing needs of extremely low income households. According to 2012 Southern
California Association of Governments Existing Housing Needs Data Report
(using 2005-2009 ACS), the City has 11,370 extremely low income the majority of
which are renter households. The Housing Authority issues 2,699 housing choice
vouchers to low income households each year. Of all housing choice vouchers,
75% of them will be extremely low income households. The City of Santa Ana
will continue to seek opportunities to support grant applications, work with
nonprofits, and provide other incentives as feasible to support the production of
affordable housing for extremely low income households.
27. Successor Housing Agency
Historically, the Santa Ana Redevelopment Agency (RDA) has played a key role
in facilitating and encouraging the production, rehabilitation, and preservation of
housing. Santa Ana also allocated tax increment funds generated from
redevelopment project areas to increase, preserve, and improve the supply of low
and moderate income housing as well as support housing, economic, and
community development activities. With the demise of redevelopment agencies
across California and reallocation of funds to the State of California, the City no
longer has an RDA. A successor agency, the Santa Ana Housing Authority, is
responsible for completing all remaining enforceable obligations. The City is
seeking to retain a portion of its tax increment funds, including Boomerang and
Supplemental Educational Revenue Augmentation Funds (SERAF), to allow the
completion and administration of enforceable obligations over the long term.
28. Density Bonus Ordinance Update
The City’s density bonus ordinance, Section 41-1600, incorporates state density
bonus law. The City will revise its density bonus ordinance to reflect recent
changes in state law. In summary, applicants of multiple-family residential and
mixed-use projects of five or more units will be entitled to a density bonus under
one of four conditions: 1) at least 5% are very low income units, 2) at least 10%
are lower income units, 3) at least 10% are moderate income for-sale units, and/or

                                                                       HOUSING PLAN
4) at least 35% of units are for persons aged 55 and older. The density bonus
ranges from 20 to 35% according to how much affordable housing is provided
above the minimum percentage in state law. Eligible projects may also receive one
to three concessions or other development incentives, depending on the
proportion of affordable units and level of income that is targeted.
29. Housing Opportunity Ordinance
In 2011, Santa Ana adopted a Housing Opportunity Ordinance. For eligible
ownership projects, at least 15% of the units must be set aside as affordable to
moderate income households for at least 45 years. For eligible rental projects, at
least 15% must be affordable to very low or lower income households for at least
55 years. These requirements may be reduced at the discretion of the Executive
Director if a greater level of affordability is provided. Provisions allow for the
payment of in-lieu fees rather than building units, or building the units on- or off-
site with City Council approval. The inclusionary requirement is triggered by: a
request to increase the permitted density above that permitted in the zone,
conversion of commercial or industrial land to residential uses, conversion of
rental units to condominiums, and various other conditions. The City will
develop policies and procedures for occupancy of units created under the Housing
Opportunity Ordinance.
30. Adaptive Reuse
Santa Ana contains a variety of buildings not originally constructed for residential
uses, that are vacant or underutilized, and which may be candidates for reuse as
new housing. Santa Ana’s Design Guidelines provides guidance on the adaptive
reuse of historic structures in the downtown. The Grand Central Art Center is an
adaptive reuse project of a historic building that creates a mixed-use
live/study/work center, accommodates university programs in visual arts, and
provides a day and night public focal point for Santa Ana’s “Artist Village.” The
City is exploring options for the adaptive reuse of historic and/or underutilized
buildings to create a diversity of housing opportunities and stimulate new
investment.
REGULATORY INCENTIVES
31. Specific Development District
The City uses a Specific Development (SD) District to facilitate creative
residential and mixed/multiuse developments where otherwise strict application
of the Zoning Ordinance would make the project infeasible. Under a SD zone,
the City may permit attached and detached single-family residences, town homes,
patio homes, zero lot lines and any other housing types permitted by the
regulations of the underlying zone. Residential/mixed- use development
standards are individually tailored to specific project needs. This tool is especially
useful when dealing with small in-fill sites, allowing for the development of new
housing. The approval process is similar to any zone change process. The City
will continue to implement the Specific Development District for projects.

                                   Santa Ana is committed to providing housing appropriate for residents. Although
                                   Santa Ana has historically had a high demand for large family units, the 2010
                                   Census also shows a more diverse trend in household size. This requires that the
                                   City’s housing stock provide units large enough to accommodate larger families,
                                   while also providing smaller housing units for newly forming households. Policy
                                   HE-4.2 states the City will facilitate and encourage the development of larger
                                   rental and ownership units for families with children, including lower and
                                   moderate income families. These types of units are being built within the Transit
                                   Zoning Code. However, there is a higher demand for smaller units in other
                                   locales. In response, the City will monitor applications for residential projects to
                                   ensure they match existing and future housing demand in Santa Ana and propose
                                   ordinance changes if needed to align products with needs.
                                   33. Parking Study
                                   The City will perform a study to evaluate parking standards for residential
                                   development, with a focus on multifamily development. The study will compare
                                   development costs of current parking standards, their effect on project density, and
                                   the costs and benefits of a parking in-lieu fee option. The study will consider
                                   reducing residential parking standards in areas where parking demands are less,
                                   or other parking options are available. Should the parking study reveal that
                                   current parking requirements are an undue constraint to the development of
                                   multiple-family housing, City staff will propose a program to City Council to
                                   mitigate the constraint. Because of the relationship of parking to other residential
                                   development standards (e.g., open space, height, lot coverage, etc.), this effort may
                                   be completed in conjunction with the update to the Zoning Ordinance.

                                   Housing and Urban Development’s Housing Choice Voucher Program. Funded
                                   by the federal government, the program provides rental subsidies to very low and
                                   extremely low income households. The rent subsidy equals the difference

Housing Authority serves 66 households. During the program, the participant
continues to receive Section 8 assistance, although their contribution may increase
as their earned income increases. As a component of this program, the Housing
Authority establishes an interest-bearing savings account, with payments
equivalent to the extra rent paid toward housing, as the participant improves their
economic status. Upon successful completion of the contract, the participant
receives the funds in the escrow account.
36. HOPWA Tenant-Based Rental Assistance
The Santa Ana Housing Authority operates the Housing Opportunities for
Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Tenant-Based Rental Assistance Program as a
countywide program. This program provides rental assistance to disabled
residents who have been diagnosed HIV-positive. This program maintains HIV-
positive people in stable housing and thereby reduces their health risks and
prevents homelessness. Through case management linkages, program participants
also receive referrals to available social services. Several local social welfare
organizations and nonprofit housing organizations also assist the City of Santa
Ana in program implementation. The program is intended to mirror the Housing
Choice Voucher Program, where the tenant must be very low income. The
Housing Authority serves 50 households under this program.
HOUSING PRESERVATION
37. Preservation of At-Risk Housing
Santa Ana has been partners in projects providing more than 2,500 units of rental
housing affordable to lower income households. Of that total, about one-third of
the units are at risk of losing affordability controls and reverting to market rents by
2014. The Housing Authority recently issued a bond to preserve the 200-unit
Wycliffe Towers senior project. Given the importance of assisted affordable
projects, however, a more strategic program is needed. The City will establish a
program that consists of regular outreach to owners of assisted projects to
understand their intentions for converting projects, refinement of the affordable
housing database, provision of assistance in structuring financing, and seeking
funding to preserve at-risk housing. Where feasible, the City would ensure
agreements meet affordability levels, occupancy restrictions, and other
requirements of state law needed to secure credit toward the RHNA.
38. Multiple-Family Acquisition and Rehabilitation
Santa Ana has many deteriorated apartment projects characterized by lesser
quality construction, overcrowding, and absentee ownership. Left unattended,
deteriorated apartments depress the values of surrounding properties and
negatively influence the quality of life in neighborhoods. To stabilize
neighborhoods and provide affordable housing, the City implements an
acquisition and rehabilitation program for multiple-family residential projects.
CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT                                       63
HOUSING PLAN
The City financially supports nonprofit and for-profit organizations to acquire
and rehabilitate projects and extend long-term affordability controls. When
feasible, housing units are reconfigured to meet the housing needs of families.
This program will continue to be used to preserve multiple-family housing,
encourage size-appropriate units, extend affordability controls, and improve
residential neighborhoods.
39. Neighborhood Stabilization
The Neighborhood Stabilization Program provides funding to cities hit hard by
dramatic increases in the numbers of abandoned and foreclosed residential
properties. The program permits cities to buy foreclosed homes at a discount and
rehabilitate or redevelop them. Since 2009, the City has successfully applied for
and received more than $17 million in federal NSP dollars to preserve
neighborhoods and eliminate blight associated with foreclosures and
abandonment of residential properties. The City adopted a strategic plan and
selected an intermediary to assist in implementing the program. To date, NSP
funds have been used to acquire, rehabilitate, resell, and plan for nearly 150
housing units. The City will continue to implement this program per the
guidelines.
HOMEOWNERSHIP ASSISTANCE
40. Down Payment Assistance Program
The City of Santa Ana offers a down payment assistance loan to help lower
income households buy their first home. Under the program, the City will offer a
loan of up to $40,000 toward the purchase price for no interest and no payments
for 45 years. To qualify, a prospective buyer must attend prepurchase and
postpurchase counseling programs, choose a home in Santa Ana that meets
maximum home values, and make a down payment of at least 3 percent. In recent
years, the dramatic escalation in the prices of single-family homes has required
deep subsidies that have been cost prohibitive. The high level of subsidy required
for a single homeowner must be balanced with the need to provide suitable
assistance to a greater number of rental households. Although the program has
been curtailed in recent years with the demise of redevelopment, the City will
investigate new funding opportunities to restart the program.
41. Homeownership Partners
In today’s economic climate, public/private/nonprofit partnerships are a
prerequisite to financing, building, and operating new affordable housing. Few
cities have the financial and administrative resources to do it alone. The City of
Santa Ana has a track record of working with nonprofit organizations to build
affordable housing. The City has worked with RSI Development, Habitat for
Humanity, and the Orange County Community Housing Corporation to
facilitate the construction of infill housing in residential neighborhoods. Some
entities provide homeownership counseling, and others help provide access to
other state and local funding sources. The City will continue to seek to expand

the number of well-qualified partners to aid in achievement of homeownership
goals.
42. Homeownership Preservation Assistance
During the early 2000s Santa Ana experienced significant increases in foreclosures
due to the housing recession and adjustable rate mortgages. To help stem the tide,
the City led a statewide effort to preserve homeownership for families and the
City Council passed a resolution declaring their support to address the
preservation of homeownership. The City of Santa Ana was also a founding
partner of the Orange County Home Preservation Collaborative. This
partnership focuses on reaching out to homeowners, improving the availability of
counseling for those at risk of losing their home, securing financing options and
other solutions, and fundraising to broaden outreach efforts. Though the
foreclosure crisis is subsiding, partnerships are in place to provide appropriate
services.
SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSING
43. Care Facilities
Santa Ana has received numerous requests to establish care facilities. Care
facilities typically come in two forms: 1) facilities licensed by the State of
California for mentally, physically, or developmentally disabled children and
adults who require supervised care, and 2) care facilities outside the regulatory
control of the Community Care Facilities Act. Whereas state law preempts
enacting local regulations on the former, the City can impose reasonable
                                                                                     Residential care homes allow
regulatory measures on the latter to ensure that such facilities are compatible with people with disabilities to live in
and do not detract from the residential character of neighborhoods. To further       neighborhoods.
housing opportunities for people with disabilities, the Municipal Code will be
reviewed and amended for changes in state law with respect to these facilities.
This action may be incorporated into the Zoning Ordinance update.
44. Developmental Disabilities
The City works with partners to address the housing and service needs of people
with disabilities, including developmental disabilities. In 2013, the City worked
with A Community of Friends to develop the 41-unit Vista del Rio project, which
provides developmentally and physically disabled adults with affordable housing
with on-site services and amenities. The City also funds organizations serving the
needs of disabled people. The City will continue to work with affordable housing
developers and the Regional Center of Orange County to expand independent
living options for the developmentally and physically disabled. This may include
reviewing or endorsing grant opportunities, soliciting applications for projects,
reviewing and facilitating new projects, or other actions to facilitate the
rehabilitation of housing for persons with disabilities.

                     45. Housing Accessible to People with Disabilities
                     The aging of our nation, changing demographics, and desire to house people of
                     all abilities into residential neighborhoods has led to innovative concepts such as
                     aging-in-place. This refers to the ability to live in one's home and community
                     safely, independently, and comfortably, regardless of age, income, or ability level.
                     To further this goal, city planners and housing professionals are exploring new
                     models of housing, such as visitability, universal design, or barrier free housing. As
                     this concept supports Santa Ana’s inclusive, multigenerational housing vision, the
                     City will explore offering incentives to developers who incorporate accessibility
                     components in the construction or rehabilitation of housing. For existing homes,
                     the City will implement its reasonable accommodation ordinance.
                     HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS
                     46. Emergency Shelters and Transitional Housing
                     Santa Ana has historically supported a continuum of care program of shelters,
                     transitional housing, and supportive services to help homeless individuals and
                     families move into stable and permanent housing. An effective network of service
                     agencies has emerged to address these needs through the guiding efforts of the
                     Orange County Partnership to End Homelessness. The City continues to fund
                     this network to support and offset the cost for providing emergency shelter,
                     transitional housing, and support services. Tthe City also adopted its emergency
San Miguel Residence
                     shelter ordinance in 2013. Emergency shelters with up to 30 beds are permitted by
                     right in the M1, M2, and SD zones. This ordinance also permits one Multiservice
                     Center with 150 to 200 beds in the City. The City will establish an Emergency
                     Shelter Overlay zone in the industrial zoned areas identified as best suited for
                     emergency shelters. To comply with state law, the City will revise the separation
                     criteria standards of the Emergency Shelter Ordinance.
                     47. Rapid Rehousing/Transition to Permanent Housing
                     Access to decent, safe, and affordable permanent housing is the ultimate goal of
                     Santa Ana’s comprehensive system of care for homeless people. As a complement
                     to its current services model, the City is striving to place homeless people
                     immediately into permanent housing with supportive services, bypassing the need
                     for stays in shelter or transitional housing. This approach is called a Rapid-
                     Rehousing Approach. Santa Ana’s Housing Authority continues to provide funds,
                     where available, to assist in the acquisition/rehabilitation of homes for permanent
                     supportive housing or provide rental vouchers for persons leaving homeless
                     programs. The City will continue to support this model and encourage service
                     providers to make every effort to rapidly rehouse homeless people.
                     48. Supportive Services
                     Santa Ana’s homeless strategy calls for the provision of outreach and support
                     services to assist individuals and families who are homeless or at risk of becoming
                     homeless. In addition, a key part of this strategy is to prevent, to the extent
                     feasible, individuals and families from slipping into homelessness. To that end,

the City supports a food bank, employment training, substance abuse recovery,
referral services, and a wide variety of other services to enable people who are
homeless to transition into society and live full and productive lives. Funds are
provided through the Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) and Community
Development Block Grant funds. The City will continue to provide funding and
technical assistance, as available, to support and encourage the continued
provision of a range of prevention, outreach, and supportive services.
HOUSING FOR SENIORS
49. HOUSING FACILITIES
Approximately 900 subsidized senior housing units are located in Santa Ana, and
the City is monitoring them to help preserve their affordability. The Santa Ana
Housing Authority allocates approximately 450 vouchers annually to seniors, and
more than 2,200 seniors are on the waiting list. The Santa Ana Housing Authority
is also actively involved in the preservation of the 200-unit Wycliffe Towers senior
complex through the issuance of a $30 million bond. Senior housing is also
permitted in several districts, and regulatory incentives (e.g., parking reductions
and density bonus) are available to facilitate the construction of new projects. As   Sunrise Gardens and many other
opportunities become available, the City continues to facilitate new senior           facilities provide a range of senior
housing, increase housing vouchers for seniors, and/or preserve deed restricted       housing options.
affordable senior housing in the community.
50. Senior Life Care Facilities
As the needs of an aging population change, Santa Ana seniors need a wider
choice of housing options that would allow them to age in place. “Aging in place”
refers to idea that seniors should have suitable housing that allows them to stay in
their own home, neighborhood or community. This includes three approaches.
The City’s reasonable accommodation ordinance allows for modifications to
make structures more accessible so seniors can continue to live in them. For those
wishing to stay in the city but desire a more supportive environment, life-care
facilities are being proposed that allow for independent, semi-independent, or
assisted-living. And, in other cases, residential care facilities for the elderly are
important. To that end, Santa Ana will continue working to facilitate the most
appropriate type of housing for seniors living in the community.
51. Senior Services
Senior citizens in Santa Ana can benefit from a broad range of supportive services
that enable them to live in their homes as independently as possible. Through
federal and state funding, the City funds a broad range of organizations that
provide meal and nutrition, recreation, health care, and service programs. Many
of the senior programs operate from the Santa Ana Senior Center and the
Southwest Senior Center. Programs such as delivering meals to homebound
seniors and referral services currently serve approximately 1,500 Santa Ana
seniors, including homebound seniors. Subsidized public transit is also available
through transit providers. The Orange County Council on Aging also serves as

the lead advocate for seniors throughout the county. The City works with various
agencies to address the housing needs of seniors.
HOUSING FOR FAMILIES
52. Family Housing
The City has a multifaceted program for increasing and maintaining the supply of
family housing. The Housing Authority allocates approximately 900 housing choice
vouchers to lower income families in Santa Ana, and the City’s homeownership
programs are targeted to low income households. The City continues to acquire,
rehabilitate, and reconfigure apartment projects to create affordable housing. Over the
past five years, the City and Agency have funded projects with nonprofit organizations
that reconfigured smaller studio and one-bedroom apartments into two-, three-, and
four-bedroom units. The City will continue seeking opportunities to rehabilitate,
reconfigure, and build family housing and alleviate overcrowding. This program will
work in tandem with the Variety in Household Sizes Program.
53. Child Care Options
The availability of affordable, conveniently located, quality childcare is one of the
most pressing concerns of contemporary family life, particularly for families with
single parents or two working parents. Santa Ana complies with state regulations
allowing childcare facilities and offers density bonuses for qualified childcare
facilities per state law. Recognizing the shortage of quality and affordable
childcare facilities, the City will: 1) review the Zoning Code to ensure that day
care and childcare provisions are consistent with state law; 2) consider incentives
for co-locating childcare facilities in affordable housing; 3) give funding priority
for projects that include family support and childcare facilities; and 4) continue
funding organizations that serve Santa Ana’s children.
54. Multi-Generational Housing
According to Generations United, one in six Americans lives in a
multigenerational household, defined as those consisting of more than two
generations living under the same roof or a household with a grandparent and at
least one other generation. This topic is particularly relevant in recent years given
the increasing number of seniors, individuals leaving home at a later age, cost of
health care, and lifestyle preferences. Whereas the granny flat or room addition
concept has been around for decades, builders are beginning to respond with
innovative products. This includes housing models from shared living spaces to
housing that caters to different lifestyles all situated in the same or adjacent
buildings. As part of the Zoning Ordinance update, City staff will explore and
review residential development concepts that offer appropriate opportunities for
multi-generational housing that fits neighborhoods in Santa Ana.

FAIR HOUSING SERVICES
55. Fair Housing
The City of Santa Ana contracts for a variety of fair housing services. Under this
contract, the fair housing service provider conducts Department of Housing and
Urban Development counseling, landlord/tenant services, mediation, and legal
enforcement where necessary to address discrimination. The City also participates
in a multijurisdictional Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice . The
City continues to provide opportunities to educate the public regarding fair

56. Reducing Second-Hand Smoke in Multifamily Housing
Exposure to smoke, whether direct or secondhand, causes adverse health
outcomes such as asthma and other respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular disease,
and cancer. This public health threat is particularly important for children, the
elderly, and those with preexisting health concerns. With growing concern over
the effects of second hand smoke, the private housing industry has become
increasingly aware of the impact of second-hand smoke. More than 16
multifamily unit complexes in Santa Ana already have adopted voluntary bans on
smoking, including several nonprofit affordable housing developers. Over the
past few years, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has also
been encouraging property owners to limit exposure to second hand smoke in
multifamily housing projects. As the City of Santa Ana is committed to creating
healthful environments for its residents, the City will explore opportunities for
implementing smoke free ordinances at multifamily housing in Santa Ana in
partnership with nonprofit organizations, the Orange County Health Care
Agency, and other community stakeholders. This may include crafting an
ordinance, educating property managers and owners, and building community
consensus around this important health consideration.

ppendix A.Housing Needs
          This chapter analyzes demographic, economic, housing, and special needs groups
          in Santa Ana to understand housing needs in the community and provide a
          foundation for the development of responsive housing goals, policies, and
          implementation programs to address that need.
          OVERVIEW
          Over the past decade, Santa Ana has seen significant challenges to housing its
          population and workforce. Population increase, changes to the economy, the
          housing market boom and downturn, and other factors affect Santa Ana’s ability
          to address its housing challenges. This Housing Needs Assessment is designed to
          explore many of these factors that influence the City’s housing needs today and
          define the challenges to addressing these needs.
          The Housing Needs Assessment is divided into five sections, each providing
          information and analysis that augments discussion provided in the Framework.
             Demographic Characteristics. Demographic characteristics, including population
              growth and change, race and ethnicity, age characteristics, and household
              composition and type.
             Economic Characteristics. Employment trends, occupations of residents,
              household income and distribution, and other factors that affect the demand for
              housing and the ability to afford housing.
             Neighborhood and Housing Profile. Inventory of housing, including its supply,
              characteristics, vacancy and tenure, housing prices, and affordability to residents of
              different income levels.
             Special Needs. Special needs in the City, including seniors, people with
              disabilities, large families, single-parent families, people who are homeless, and
              other special needs groups.
             Housing Needs. An assessment of housing production needs, housing
              rehabilitation, and the preservation of housing.

                                           This section analyzes the primary demographic characteristics of Santa Ana
                                           residents, including population growth, race and ethnicity, age characteristics, and
                                           household characteristics to identify housing needs in Santa Ana.
                                           POPULATION GROWTH
                                           Santa Ana is the 2nd largest of 34 cities in Orange County. The county
                                           experienced rapid growth in the 1980s and 1990s, with the majority of growth
                                           occurring in new communities in southern Orange County and unincorporated
                                           areas. From 1980 to 1990, the county’s population increased 25 percent, followed
                                           by an 18 percent increase between 1990 and 2000, and a 6 percent increase
                                           between 2000 and 2010. Santa Ana also experienced a rapid increase of residents
                                           between 1980 and 1990 (44 percent), primarily due to in-migration of residents
                                           from other countries or areas outside of the City.
                                           Unlike surrounding communities and the county as a whole, during this period
                                           the City of Santa Ana did not experience a residential construction boom. Rather,
                                           the City experienced an increase in household size due in part to immigration
                                           from other countries and natural increase. During the 1990s the City experienced
                                           significantly slower population growth (15 percent). Slowing population growth is
                                           reflective of the built-out nature of the City’s residential areas and low vacancy
                                           rates. Between 2000 and 2010 the City’s population decreased by about 4 percent.

Growth Trends
After a sharp growth in the early 1980s
and 1990s, Santa Ana is projected to
grow more slowly as it approaches
buildout. Santa Ana is projected to remain
one of the top two most populous cities in
Orange County.

                                           approximately 11 percent of the county’s total population, ranking Santa Ana as

RACE AND ETHNICITY
Santa Ana is known for its international population. As the county seat and one of
the oldest cities in Orange County, Santa Ana is a major gateway for newcomers
from all over the world, particularly Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the
Philippines. The various ethnic groups that constitute Santa Ana's population
have helped create a rich pattern of cultural experiences and diversity. Although
78 percent of the City’s population is Hispanic, Santa Ana also has one of the
larger Vietnamese-American populations in the county. The Vietnamese
population represents 7 percent of the City’s total population and experienced a
20 percent increase between 2000 and 2010
Chart A-2 Race and Ethnicity
Santa Ana experienced slight demographic changes in the early 2000s. Between
2000 and 2010, the Hispanic population increased its share of the total population
by 3 percent, while the non-Hispanic White population declined by 29 percent.
The Asian population had the most significant gain, increasing by 15 percent,         Chart A-2: Race and
while all others (e.g., African Americans, Native Americans, multiple races)          Ethnicity
decreased by an average of 17 percent (Chart A-3). According to the 2010 Census,
the City of Santa Ana has the highest percentage of Hispanics of any other            Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2010.
Orange County city.
Santa Ana has a large population of foreign-born residents: 48 percent of the
City’s population is foreign born compared to 31 percent countywide. During the
1990s, one in every four new immigrants to Orange County moved to Santa Ana.
Significant research has been published regarding the changing economic status,
household characteristics, and housing needs of this group (see Population
Dynamics Group at the University of Southern California, Center for
Demographic Research at California State University of Fullerton (CDR), and the
Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development).
Chart A-3 Changes in Race and Ethnicity
Although no single study describes the characteristics of foreign-born residents,
the research collectively yields useful insights about demographic trends that may
affect housing needs. Research shows that many immigrant households,
particularly those with limited English skills, earn lower incomes than later       Chart A-3: Changes in Race

                                              Age characteristics profoundly influence housing needs. Typically, younger
                                              households look for more affordable rental opportunities as they begin their
                                              careers and accumulate wealth. As adults begin to form families, the demand
                                              increases for larger rentals or more affordable single-family homes that can
                                              accommodate children. Demand for move-up housing is strongest as residents
                                              approach the peak earning years of 45–64. As retirement approaches, seniors may

                                              As a result of population decrease, Santa Ana experienced a decline in its child,
                                              college age, and family-forming population subgroups between 2000 and 2010. In
                                              2010, children under age 20 and family-forming adults (25 to 44) each comprised
                                              about 33 percent of the City’s residents. The college age subgroup represented 9
                                              percent of the population. The number of children and youth under age 20
                                              decreased by13 percent, and the college and family-forming population each
                                              decreased by 11 percent in that period.
                                              Both the middle age and senior populations grew between 2000 and 2010.
                                              Growth in both of these subgroups coincides with the nationwide aging baby
                                              boomer generation. These changes, shown in Chart A-4, indicate that residents in
                                              Santa Ana are aging in place, which may create additional demand for affordable
                                              housing opportunities as these subgroups become dependent on fixed incomes.
                                              New housing types such as multigenerational and cohousing could also be viable
                                              options for this segment of the City’s population.
                                              With the aging of the baby boom population, Santa Ana can expect to see a
                                              modest increase in demand for senior housing. However, since Santa Ana has a
                                              lower percentage of middle-aged adults compared to other cities in Orange
                                              County, the impact may be less than expected. These demographic trends shape
                                              housing demand and provide an opportunity to institute responsive policies and
                                              programs.

HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Household characteristics are equally important in determining housing need in
Santa Ana. According to the 2010 Census, the City of Santa Ana has 73,174
households, an increase of 174 households since the 2000 Census. Typical of a city
near buildout, the composition and corresponding needs have not significantly
changed over the past decade.
Household Type
Summarized in Chart A-5, the City of Santa Ana has seen a decrease in the
number of married families with children. However, the number of married
families without children has increased, while the number in the “other families”
category has slightly increased. Single persons and other nonfamilies have seen
the greatest decline during the early 2000s. Today, the City household
composition is 81 percent families, which is 15 percent higher than the national
average (66 percent). This trend suggests a continued need for larger family
housing than other communities.                                                    Chart A-5: Household

The City’s household characteristics and trends have resulted in an average
household of 4.4 persons. According to the 2013 Orange County Community
Indicators Report, Santa Ana has the largest household size in Orange County
(Chart A-6) and the 10th highest in the nation. During the early 2000s, the
number of single persons and small families with two to four family members
increased in number, while the number of large families with five, six, and seven
members decreased. Part of this is due to the economic downturn, which helped
to balance rental prices, potentially reducing the number of shared residences by
multiple families. Although family sizes are becoming smaller; the 2010 Census
shows Hispanics in Santa Ana have the largest average family size, with an
average of 5.2 persons per household.
Chart A-6 Average Household Size
Changes in household type and size together significantly affect the need for
different types of housing. Preserving and rehabilitating the existing supply of
housing may provide opportunities and help alleviate some of the overcrowding
pressures in the City. At the same time, providing more housing opportunities for
the aging baby boomers will allow seniors a greater opportunity to stay in the
community.

Resident Occupations
The ability to afford housing depends on household income, which is influenced
by employment status and occupation. The California Employment Development
Department provides annual and monthly estimates of labor force participation,
employment levels, and unemployment rates in cities. The number of employed
residents in Santa Ana increased 7 percent, from 136,400 in 2000 to 146,300 in
July 2013. With the downturn in the regional economy since 2008, Santa Ana’s
unemployment rate has risen considerably over the past decade, from 5.7 percent
in 2000 to 8.5 percent in 2008 and hitting its peak at 14.9 percent in 2010. The job
market has started to recover, and unemployment was down to 10.4 percent in
July of 2013. Santa Ana’s unemployment rate has been consistently higher than
the county’s which also reached its peak in 2010 at 9.5 percent. The county’s rate
for July 2013 was 6.5 percent.
Chart A-7 shows the industries that employ Santa Ana residents according to the
US Census Bureau’s 2010 Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics. Nearly
one in five employed Santa Ana residents (18 percent) works in manufacturing,
and another 11 percent work in retail trade. The administrative support, waste
management, and remediation sector also employs 14 percent of Santa Ana
residents. This sector encompasses service industries that support business
activity, including temporary agencies, janitorial and landscaping services, and
others.

                                        An important consideration in addressing housing needs is the commute patterns
                                        of residents and the workforce and the extent to which a balance in jobs and
                                        housing is desired. In a large metropolitan area where employment centers cross
                                        municipal boundaries, a jobs/housing balance is more often achieved at a regional
                                        level, as opposed to a city level. However, to the extent that minimizing commutes
                                        and improving air quality are important objectives, striving to achieve an
                                        acceptable jobs/housing balance is worthwhile.

HOUSEHOLD AND FAMILY INCOME
Household Income
Except for housing costs, household income is the most critical factor affecting the
ability to afford housing. According to the 2011 ACS, Santa Ana’s median
household income was $54,399, compared to $75,762 for Orange County. Santa
Ana’s household income is one of the lowest among Orange County cities;—the
City of Stanton and the retirement communities of Laguna Woods and Seal
Beach are the three lowest. The following describes and analyzes the differences
in household income by family type (married families, married families with
children, non-families, etc.) and distribution.
Cha A-9    Median Family Income by Family T Age
Like most cities, household income also varies significantly by householder age.
For households under age 25, the median income was $43,994 and increased to
$54,389 for householders between the ages of 35 and 44 as of the year 2011. The       Chart A-9: Median Family

The fact that Santa Ana’s population is the youngest in Orange County is another
reason for the City’s low median household income.
Income by Family Type
The Census defines a family as two or more people related by birth, marriage, or
adoption residing in the same housing unit. The median family income of Santa
Ana residents varies significantly among different types of families, shown in
Chart A-9. As shown, married couples without children, which comprise 22
percent of all households, earn the highest median income at $63,408. Married
couples with children under 18 years of age comprise 34 percent of all households
and earn the second highest median income of $46,986. Other family and
nonfamily households, collectively comprising 43 percent of all households, earn
in the lower $40,000s.
Other household characteristics are associated with differences in the median
household income of Santa Ana households. According to the 2011 ACS,
household income varies between foreign (non-citizen) and native residents. The
median income for foreign-born, non–U.S. citizen households in Santa Ana was
$47,493 versus $59,876 for native residents (Chart A-10). These differences do
not reflect patterns or trends associated with education, occupation, country of
origin, or other factors.                                                            Chart A-10: Median

                                  Income Distribution
                                  On an annual basis, the Department of Housing and Urban Development
                                  conducts household income surveys of each county in the nation. The State
                                  Department of Housing and Community Development uses these household
                                  income surveys to identify the need for housing assistance in communities. As
                                  summarized below, there are five primary income categories based on Area
                                  Median Income (AMI) and adjusted for household size:
                                                Extremely low: households earning 30 percent or less of AMI
                                                Very low: households earning 31 to 50 percent of AMI
                                                Low: households earning 51 to 80 percent of AMI
                                                Moderate: households earning 81 to 120 percent of
                                                Above Moderate: households earning above 120 percent of AMI
                                  State housing program guidelines also often combine extremely low and very low
                                  income into one category, called very low income. The extremely low, very low,
                                  and low income categories are also often considered “lower” income. These terms
                                  are used throughout the Housing Element.

NEIGHBORHOOD AND HOUSING PROFILE
Neighborhood and housing characteristics define the nature of housing needs in
Santa Ana. This section analyzes housing growth patterns, housing
characteristics, tenure and vacancy trends, housing prices, and affordability.
NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS
Santa Ana has a rich mosaic of neighborhoods, each distinguished by its history,
architecture, housing types, and amenities. Sixty-four neighborhood associations    Vintage Home in Santa Ana
have been formed to address neighborhood issues. Approximately 70 percent of all
residential areas in the City are single-family neighborhoods. To preserve
neighborhoods, the 1998 Land Use Element redesignated some areas of the
community for single-family housing. Many of these neighborhoods are
established, well maintained, and contain historic resources.
Santa Ana has many neighborhoods made up of a variety of residential uses: a
mixture of single-family, townhouses, apartments, and a combination of industrial
and residential uses. The diversity of these neighborhoods is great, and each
neighborhood varies widely in condition. The diverse urban and suburban fabric
of many of these neighborhoods has been woven over time and reflects the
complexity of land use policies implemented over the long history of Santa Ana.
The City has undertaken extensive efforts to stabilize neighborhoods through
                                                                                    Rowhouses in Santa Ana.
appropriate land use direction and housing programs. The City has also
introduced live-work opportunities in some areas.
To protect and stabilize residential neighborhoods, support the City’s economic
base, and provide housing for the local workforce, Santa Ana is developing new
residential neighborhoods close to employment centers. These district centers
include the Metro East, MacArthur Place, Downtown, City Place, and similar
locations. Reflective of modern employment centers, Santa Ana’s district centers
are defined by eclectic skylines of high-rise residential projects, townhouses and
apartments, and mixed-use residential/commercial projects. These residential
neighborhoods are intensely urbanized, transit oriented, and explicitly designed to
support the future economic development of Santa Ana.                               High-rise and mixed-uses define

                                        HOUSING GROWTH
                                        Like many Southern California cities, the City of Santa Ana experienced a post–
                                        World War II residential construction boom. During the 1940s three military
                                        facilities were opened adjacent to the City, providing thousands of jobs and a need
                                        for additional housing opportunities in the area. Santa Ana’s housing
                                        construction boom spanned three decades; two-thirds of the City’s housing was
                                        built between 1950 and 1979. In addition, significant housing construction
                                        continued during the 1980s, though to a much lesser degree.
                                        By the late 1980s, however, the City of Santa Ana faced a number of challenges
                                        regarding its housing, particularly apartments. Recently constructed multiple-
                                        family structures had a lack of adequate open space, low quality architectural
                                        designs, and poor use of quality materials. The City was also impacted by crime,
                                        overcrowding, and need for community services in these areas. Coupled with poor
                                        maintenance practices, these properties generated a poor image for higher density
                                        residential development. Further, many of these apartment structures were built
                                        in stable single-family neighborhoods.
                                        Chart A-12 Household Growth Trend, 1950-2015
                                        In response to these challenges, the City developed strategies to stabilize
                                        residential neighborhoods and control the quality of development. This included
                                        design guidelines, traffic management plans, and neighborhood revitalization
                                        programs. In the interim, the City reevaluated the general plan land use
                                        designation for many areas in 1991. The demolition of dilapidated units,
                                        construction of lower density projects, and market slowdown resulted in the
                                        addition of less than 900 new units from 2008–2012 (DataQuick). Additionally,
                                        the population decreased by about 43,000 people, reducing the demand for

HOUSING TYPE
As the county seat and most diverse population in the county, Santa Ana has a
broad range of housing needs. It is thus important for the City of Santa Ana to
maintain an equal diversity of housing types and prices that can accommodate the
varied lifestyles and housing needs of people of all walks of life.
The City of Santa Ana has 76,896 housing units as of the 2010 Census. Shown in
Chart A-13, these homes predominantly consist of single-family detached homes
(46 percent), and 7 percent are townhouses. Multiple-family housing comprises
41 percent of all housing, of which 10 percent are duplexes, triplexes, and
fourplexes. Mobile home units make up the remaining 6 percent of all housing in
the City. In addition, a small percentage of the existing single-family and
multiple-family units are reserved for group quarter purposes.
Chart A-13 Housing Stock Composition
As Santa Ana’s population has diversified and housing needs have become more
differentiated, the City has experienced significant levels of construction in
innovative housing types other than single-family homes and apartments. High-
rise and mixed-use condominiums are under construction near major
employment centers. Mixed-use and live-work units are sensitively integrated into
industrial/residential neighborhoods and near employment centers. Artist’s lofts       Chart A-13: Housing Stock

                                             Census reported 73,174 occupied housing units, of which 47 percent (34,756)

                                             middle class. The national homeownership rate surpassed 60 percent by 1960 and
                                             has remained between 64 and 68 percent since (see Chart A-14).

                                             In the 1990s, a deregulated lending environment improved access to home-
                                             ownership by allowing less qualification and down payment requirements.
                                             Creative loans, such as short-term adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), became the
                                             norm and allowed previously unqualified buyers to buy a home. However, the
                                             economy receded in 2008 and housing prices fell dramatically. As ARMs
                                             readjusted, many homeowners found themselves unable to afford their higher
                                             payments and could only sell their home at a significantly lower price. As a result,
                                             many homeowners face the possibility of foreclosure.

                                             2010 have led to an increased preference for renting. The 2010 Census reported
                                             that 53 percent of occupied housing units (38,418 households) were rented in

                                             of rental units and the conversion of single-family homes to rental units. The City

HOUSING SUPPLY
Housing Vacancy
An adequate supply of housing is essential to maintaining adequate choices for
residents, moderating housing prices, and encouraging the normal maintenance
of properties. This is a delicate balance that must be maintained. Low vacancy
rates result in price and rent escalation, while excess vacancy rates result in price
depreciation, rent declines, and deferred maintenance. Although market forces are
beyond the control of any one city, maintaining an optimal balance of housing
supply and demand is a desirable goal.
The building industry assumes that a housing vacancy rate of 1.5–2.0 percent for
ownership units and 5–6 percent for rental units are optimal and offer a variety of
choices for residents. In 2000, the vacancy rate was 2.2 percent for renters and 0.9
percent for owners. In 2010, the vacancy rate saw a significant increase at 4.9
percent for rental units and 1.9 percent for homeowners. The 2010 Census
estimates the Citywide housing vacancy rate at 4.8 percent, which was lower than
the county rate of 5.4 percent.
Housing Size
Chart A-15 compares the percentage of renter and owner households with the
percentage of appropriately sized units for renters and owners by family size.
Shown below, the size of units available for homeowners generally matches the
size of households. The same is true for renter households with the exception of
large-family households. According to the 2011 ACS, 38 percent of all families
who rent have five or more members, but only 22 percent of the rental units
available (apartments and single-family homes) are adequately sized with three or
more bedrooms. This translates into a shortage of about 5,940 large-family rental
units.

                               This decade has seen unparalleled changes in the housing market. Fueled by
                               historically low interest rates, overly flexible lending, and pent-up demand for
                               housing, the prices of single-family homes soared. Between 2000 and 2007, the
                               median sales prices increased 300 percent; since then housing prices have fallen
                               by about 50 percent. Shown in Chart A-16, the recent market decline has caused
                               prices of single-family homes to drop to $350,000 and condominium prices to
                               drop to $150,000 (2012 price levels).

Housing Affordability
The Santa Ana housing market has plateaued since the 2007–2008 decline. Of
the seven largest Orange County cities, Santa Ana has consistently had the lowest
median home price during the early 2000s. Single-family home prices in Santa
Ana are mostly affordable to moderate and above moderate income households.
Shown in Chart A-17, in 2012 the average price for a single-family detached
home is affordable to households earning $100,450 or more annually. However,
newer single-family homes or those within certain neighborhoods of Santa Ana
(e.g., north Santa Ana) will cost substantially more and require an even higher
income.
Condominiums provide low income households, moderate income households,
seniors, and first-time homebuyers with a more affordable and lower maintenance
opportunity than single-family detached homes. In 2012 condominiums were
affordable to households earning about $48,900. The price range of affordability
depends on the size of the down payment and the cost burden assumed. New
condominiums are typically priced at levels affordable only to moderate and above
moderate income households.
Despite increased affordability, homeownership is beyond many households. The
average annual income in the Santa Ana/Anaheim/Irvine metropolitan area is
$28,820 for a manufacturing assembler, $27,900 for a retail salesperson, $31,650
for an office clerk, $68,620 for an elementary school teacher, $70,010 for a
firefighter, and $52,510 for a postal service clerk. Even with two wage earners in
one household, the annual income needed to purchase a condominium may be
beyond the income earned by many Santa Ana residents.

                                      Apartments and rental single-family homes provide an important housing option
                                      for young adults, families, and seniors. The majority of Santa Ana’s apartments
                                      were constructed prior to 1980. These apartments therefore generally do not

                                      8,500 units in multi-family apartment complexes in Santa Ana revealed that only
                                      approximately 3 percent offer three or more bedrooms (see Chart A-18).

While Class B and C apartments provide a valuable source of affordable housing,
they do not provide opportunities for Orange County’s growing executive class.
Without additional Class A apartments the City cannot attract above moderate
income renters. The nearby cities of Costa Mesa and Irvine offer several executive
rental opportunities for professionals who would potentially choose to live in
Santa Ana should the proper location, amenities, and price be offered in Class A
housing. New housing development will provide additional Class A rental
housing in Santa Ana. The City’s District Centers including MacArthur Place to
the south and CityPlace to the north will offer amenities attractive to above
moderate income renters to professionals.
Housing Problems
The federal government considers housing overcrowding or housing overpayment
to be evidence of a housing problem. These conditions also lead to a number of
hardships for households, including insufficient income to afford other
necessities, undue burden on families, and accelerated wear on a home. In some
cases, the inability to afford housing can lead to foreclosures or otherwise loss of
housing. The following defines and describes the prevalence of overcrowding and
overpayment in Santa Ana.
Overcrowding
Overcrowding is a critical issue for many communities. In recent years,
considerable public concern has been voiced regarding the level of overcrowding
in Santa Ana and its impact on available parks and recreation services, facilities
for students, parking and traffic management, and overall condition of
infrastructure and its ability to support residents. In order to understand the issue,
two working definitions for overcrowding are cited.
Chart A-19      Housing Overcrowding in Santa Ana
          State Standard. The State of California has occupancy standards governing the
           number of people who may legally reside in a habitable space, based on
           regulations in the Uniform Housing Code. Under California’s Maximum
           Occupancy Standard, 10 persons would be allowed to reside in a one-bedroom
           apartment of no more than 454 square feet. In contrast, the federal standard
           indicates that if more than 2 persons occupied the same sized unit, the household
           would be considered as living in overcrowded conditions.
          Federal Standard. According to the Department of Housing and Urban
           Development (24 CFR 791.402[b]), housing overcrowding refers to a household
           that has more members than habitable rooms in a home. Moderate overcrowding
           refers to 1.0 to 1.5 persons per room and severe overcrowding refers to more than  Chart A-19: Housing
           1.5 persons per room. In keeping with the ACS 2011 data (Chart A-19), this         Overcrowding in Santa Ana
           standard is used as a reference guide in this housing element.
                                                                                              Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2007–2011
According to the 2011 ACS, approximately 24,281 households in Santa Ana (33                   American Community Survey.
percent) are overcrowded. Approximately 18 percent of the City’s occupied
housing units are moderately overcrowded, and 15 percent are severely
overcrowded. The ACS acknowledges error rates of 25 to 50 percent (based on

                                  sampling methodology), so these figures may not reflect current housing
                                  problems.
                                  Housing overcrowding is most severe among lower income households and lower
                                  income, large, renter families. Based on recent demographic and housing trends,
                                  it is unclear whether this level of housing overcrowding will decline.
                                  According to the 2011 ACS, approximately 21 percent of home owners (8,020) live
                                  in overcrowded conditions, with many severely overcrowded. In contrast, 43
                                  percent of renters (16,311) live in overcrowded housing. Forty-five percent of the
                                  foreign born population in Santa Ana live in overcrowded conditions, while it is
                                  estimated that only 9 percent of native residents live in overcrowded situations.
                                  The non-citizen, foreign born residents experience a lower income and have a
                                  larger household size (6.2) than family size (5.3), indicating that these households
                                  are comprised of families and unrelated people living under the same roof.
                                  Housing Overpayment
                                  Housing overpayment is also a significant problem in Santa Ana. The state-
                                  recognized definition of overpayment is spending 30 percent or more for a renter
                                  and 35 percent or more for a homeowner of one’s income on housing. Housing
                                  overpayment is a critical issue in that households spending too much for housing
                                  must often forego other necessities, including health insurance and adequately-
                                  sized housing. In recent years, the housing boom artificially pushed up
                                  unprecedented increases in sales prices. Many low and moderate income
                                  households purchased homes in the past decade with adjustable rate mortgages
                                  and are now incurring high cost burdens.
                                  Chart A-20 Housing Overpayment Santa Ana
                                  Overpayment occurs at two levels. Moderate overpayment refers to housing costs
                                  between 30 to 50 percent of gross income; severe overpayment refers to housing
                                  costs in excess of 50 percent of gross income. The 2011 ACS reports 31,676
                                  households (43 percent) overpaid for housing. Of this total, 57 percent were
                                  renters (21,496 households) and 39 percent were owners (13,867 households).
                                  Housing overpayment is most severe among extremely low and low income
                                  households and special needs groups. Of the 40,775 lower income households in

SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
Certain segments of the population have special housing needs because of a
special difficulty in finding adequate and affordable housing. Circumstances may
include income, household characteristics, disability, or medical conditions.
Within the City of Santa Ana, special needs groups may include seniors, disabled
persons, large families, single-parent households, extremely low income
households, farm workers, and homeless persons.
SENIORS
Many seniors with fixed incomes have limited income for housing expenses.
Seniors may also be less mobile due to disabilities and require building features to
allow greater mobility and provide a safer living environment. Seniors with
limited vision or mobility may need transportation assistance to meet primary
needs such as grocery shopping and medical care. All of these issues can make it
difficult for seniors to find suitable and affordable housing.
According to the 2010 Census, 21,911 Santa Ana residents are 65 years of age and
older, accounting for approximately 7 percent of the City’s total population.
Seniors account for 20 percent of owner-unit householders, and 8 percent of
rental-unit householders. The ACS reports that of the 10,303 total senior
households in 2011, 7,212 (70 percent) were owner households and 3,090 (30
percent) were renter households. As the baby boom generation ages, the City will
experience a continued increase in its senior population, potentially creating
demand for lower-income housing, barrier-free housing, and supportive services
that target seniors.
Since many seniors live on fixed incomes, overpaying for housing is a major
concern. The median income of a senior household in Santa Ana is $36,658,
which is considered lower income. Lower income senior households overpaying
for housing have less income to spend on food, health care, and transportation. Of
the City’s senior households, approximately 33 percent of owner households and
59 percent of renter households overpay for housing.
Santa Ana’s senior population is diverse in age, income, and housing needs.
Between 2000 and 2010 the senior population increased by 21 percent; seniors age
80 years and older had the largest increase at 69 percent. Each of these groups has
different health, transportation, and housing needs. The magnitude and
complexity of senior housing needs in Orange County recently led to the Orange
County Grand Jury encouraging jurisdictions to provide greater policy and
program guidance to meet the housing needs of this fast-growing group. The
Framework sets forth appropriate senior programs.

HOUSING NEEDS
Housing and Services
The City of Santa Ana permits a wide range of senior housing to allow residents
to stay within the community. These include age-restricted apartments, mobile
homes, and continuing care facilities:
    Age-Restricted Apartments. As shown in Chapter 4, the City of Santa Ana has
     publicly subsidized affordable apartment projects, providing approximately 944
     units of housing for lower income seniors.
    Residential Care Facilities. These Residential Elderly State licensed facilities
     provide care, supervision, and assistance with activities of daily living for persons
     60 years of age and over. The City has 356 beds in facilities that are often called
     assisted living facilities, retirement homes, and board-and-care homes.
    Senior-Only Mobile homes. An internet survey of mobile home parks in Santa
     Ana and phone call survey revealed that seven parks were age-restricted to person
     over 55 years. These parks provide 1,114 units restricted for seniors.
    Continuing Care Facilities. The City is home to a large continuing care facility,
     Town and Country Manor, which provides 240 beds in a variety of settings. They
     are proposing the addition of independent apartments.
Whereas the focus is often on providing housing, support services are essential to
help seniors live as independently as possible without having to move. Services
can include transportation, health care, home maintenance assistance, low-cost
loans or grants to rehabilitate homes, referral services, and many other services
that can improve the lives of our seniors. Orange County’s Office on Aging is the
lead advocate for addressing the needs of seniors in the county.
Santa Ana operates two community centers exclusively for seniors, out of which
recreational, social, health, education, and other programs are administered.
Seniors also have access to low-cost public transportation and services. These are
just some of the many services provided by the City and other public agencies.

PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
As a large urban area, Santa Ana has a significant population of people with
physical, mental, developmental, or other disabilities. People with disabilities,
including the developmentally disabled, have special needs in that many earn
very low incomes, have higher health costs, and are often dependent on
supportive services. People with disabilities also may face discrimination in the
housing market, because landlords may be concerned about how a disability is
perceived by other tenants or the disabled person’s ability to afford a unit.
Disabilities fall within several categories:
     Developmental. The Regional Center of Orange County (RCOC) is contracted
      by the State Department of Developmental Services to provide community-based
      services to developmentally disabled persons. RCOC estimates that they served
      2,565 residents in Santa Ana in 2012. Table A-5 summarizes the number of
      developmentally disabled residents in Santa Ana.
     Physical. According to the 2010 Census, the City of Santa Ana has approximately
      20,248 people in the community with a physical or other Census-reported
      disability who live in a non-institutional setting.
     Mental. The 2010–2015 Consolidated Plan reports that approximately 3,438
      residents who suffer from some form of severe mental illness need housing
      assistance, based on national prevalence estimates that are extrapolated to Santa
      Ana.
     Substance Abuse. The 2010–2015 Consolidated Plan reports that 8 percent of
      Santa Ana residents over age 12 are substance dependent or substance abusers,
      based on national prevalence estimates that are extrapolated to Santa Ana.

HOUSING NEEDS
Housing and Services
Meeting the complexity of housing and service needs of people with disabilities in
Santa Ana requires a comprehensive housing strategy. The strategy should
include facilitating independent living through in-home modifications, providing
suitable housing opportunities, allowing for supportive services, and
implementing existing state and federal law. In other cases, the preferred strategy
is to provide, through land use planning and zoning, appropriate locations where
supportive housing can be provided.
For people with physical or mobility limitations, the California Administrative
Code Title 24 sets forth access and adaptability requirements that apply to public
buildings, employee housing, manufactured housing, and privately funded and
newly constructed apartment houses. For federally assisted new construction,
federal law requires that at least 5 percent of dwelling units must be accessible to
persons with mobility disabilities, and an additional 2 percent of units must be
accessible to persons with hearing or visual disabilities.
Although home modifications can improve the ability of people to live in
independent housing, many individuals may require more extensive care.
Table A-6 and the discussion below summarize the various licensed care housing
options for people with disabilities in Santa Ana.
    Adult Residential Care . These facilities provide 24-hour nonmedical care for
     adults ages 18–59 who are unable to provide for their own daily needs. Adults may
     be physically, developmentally, and/or mentally disabled.
    Group Homes. Group homes are facilities that provide 24-hour nonmedical care
     and supervision to children in a structured environment. Group homes provide
     social, psychological, and behavioral programs for troubled youths.
    Alcohol and Drug Rehabilitation. These are facilities licensed by the Department
     of Alcohol and Drug Programs for 24-hour residential nonmedical alcoholism or
     drug abuse recovery or treatment serving adults.
    Skilled Nursing. These facilities are institutions that are primarily engaged in
     providing skilled nursing care and related services for residents who require
     medical or nursing care, or rehabilitation services.
    Immediate Care Facility. A facility for individuals ages 0–59 with developmental
     disabilities who require higher level assistance in meeting daily living needs. The
     facility’s focus is to provide care to residents ranging from 24 hour personal care to
     supportive health services.
Several agencies provide services to people with disabilities. The Dayle
McIntosh Center and Goodwill Industries provide programs to improve the
income and quality of life of disabled persons, such as job training,
independent living skills training, and barrier-free housing referrals. Goodwill
Industries also operates a fitness center in Santa Ana designed for people with
disabilities. Their specialized equipment, classes, and staff fill the gap between
conventional fitness centers and the needs of the disabled.

groups including Orange County STEP, a behavior management day service for
adults with developmental disabilities. Santa Ana College, Work Creation

promote independent living and job training. Several of these providers also offer
day programs, group homes, and community living facilities.

HOUSING NEEDS
FAMILIES
State law specifies that large families and female-headed households are a special
need group. Cities are also allowed to consider other groups as having special
needs. Because 82 percent of the City’s households are families, the average
family size is 4.4 persons, and the large number of single-parent households,
many of whom are female-headed, this section takes a broader perspective on
special needs. Given the shortage of affordable and adequately sized housing
(particularly large rental units) and service needs, many families have special
needs.
Large Households
Large households consist of five or more persons. Approximately 28,034
households in Santa Ana (38 percent) are large, of which 13,660 are owners and
14,374 are renters. These households often have difficulty in finding and
affording adequately sized housing. As of 2010, 22 percent of rental units contain
three or more bedrooms, whereas 38 percent of renter households are large
households. The City has 8,433 occupied rental units with three or more
bedrooms for its 14,374 large renter families, yielding a shortfall of 5,940 units.
Single Parents
According to the 2010 Census, 12 percent (8,853) of Santa Ana households are
single parents with children, of which 67 percent (5,934) are female headed. The
2010 Census reports that the median income of single-parent households ranged
from $35,770 (female-headed family) to $43,593 (male-headed family) versus a
median of $61,228 for married couples with children. Additionally, 30 percent of
all female single-parent households earned incomes below the poverty level
compared to a rate of 17 percent for the Citywide population. The availability and
accessibility of affordable child care (including before-school, after-school, and
day care) is thus essential for single parents. These basic services are an important
factor that limits the opportunity to find suitable housing. Without them, single-
parent families are at risk of overcrowding, overpayment, and simply being unable
to adequately provide for basic family needs.

Housing and Services
As noted by the Anne Casey Foundation, the shortage of affordable family
housing continues to create its own crisis in family well-being, education, and
health. Unsafe and overcrowded housing makes parenting difficult and places
enormous stress on parent-child relationships. Living in substandard housing can
lead to health problems in children, particularly lead exposure and respiratory
diseases. Living in poor quality housing may also result in frequent moves by a
family, leading to poorer school performance among children. The following ideas
can address the needs of families.
Create Affordable Rental Housing
Homeownership opportunities are not immediately feasible or affordable for
many large families or families earning low and moderate incomes. The City
provides more than 1,500 units of family housing affordable to very low and low
income residents through Section 8 vouchers. While publicly subsidized housing
can meet a portion of the extremely low income need, the resources are too
limited to address existing unmet need. The creation of affordable family rental
housing, including large units with three or more bedrooms, continues to be a
priority to assist the large number of families who are overpaying for housing and
live in overcrowded conditions.
In addition, the City’s Housing Opportunity Ordinance was designed to support
the production of affordable housing. Passed in 2011, the Ordinance requires
eligible ownership projects to set aside at least 15 percent of the units as affordable
to moderate income households for at least 45 years. Eligible rental projects are
required to set aside at least 15 percent of the units as affordable to lower income
households for at least 55 years. Programs 25–29 of the Framework provide
financial and technical assistance for those in need of lower income rental
housing.
Improve Housing Conditions
The City of Santa Ana has a large number of multiple-family housing projects
that were built before the City instituted modern residential design guidelines.
Although safeguards are in place to ensure that new apartments are built to
modern standards, many older apartment projects need rehabilitation. Poor
housing conditions include the physical condition of the unit, the lack of or
condition of utilities, the lack of open space and recreational amenities, and
insufficiently sized units that are unhealthy for parents and their children.
Programs 7 and 8 of the Framework constitute the City’s Community Building
Initiatives providing guidance for building both healthy communities and
supporting collaborative projects to improve neighborhood livability.
Santa Ana is actively involved in the acquisition and rehabilitation of multiple-
family housing as a means to improve the living conditions of residents and
provide a long-term or permanent source of affordable housing. Although state
law focuses on increasing the supply of housing as a key driver of long-term
affordability, simply increasing the supply will not address the need to maintain

                                   and improve the existing housing stock. The Framework contains programs to
                                   encourage and facilitate the preservation and rehabilitation of housing.
                                   Promote Homeownership
                                   Homeownership is one of the key ways to accumulate wealth. It can provide
                                   physical, emotional, and financial security to low income families and can assist
                                   in strengthening neighborhoods. But for many lower income families
                                   homeownership is largely unattainable without financial assistance. Santa Ana
                                   has the opportunity to promote homeownership in several ways. With the market
                                   adjustments, current condominium prices are such that the gap between the sales
                                   price and what low and moderate income families can afford is not as large as
                                   prior years. The Housing Plan states that the City will investigate the feasibility of
                                   reconstituting its homeownership program to allow residents to afford housing. In

                                   Promote Mixed Income Housing
                                   Many affordable multiple-family residential projects were built as stand-alone
                                   affordable projects, and state and federal funding sources still encourage and
                                   facilitate these types of development. While these affordable projects tend to
                                   compete well for limited government funding, many now believe that the most
                                   vibrant neighborhoods are ones with a mixture of affordable and market-rate
                                   housing. This approach allows lower and moderate income households, many of
                                   which are younger, newly forming families and seniors, the opportunity to live in
                                   the same neighborhood.
                                   In recent years, the City of Santa Ana has supported the production of multiple-
                                   family housing consisting of a range of unit sizes and affordability levels. Table A-

Provide the Service Network
Many families depend on a network of services to meet their needs. This includes
the provision of childcare services near where they work or live to allow parents
the opportunity to be close to their children. The availability of adequate parks,
open space, and recreational amenities near homes is also a critical need for
children. Even income support services and rental assistance, such as the vouchers
available from the Housing Authority, are important ways to support families.
The City has made it a priority to include these types of services in its apartment
projects selected for acquisition, major rehabilitation, and reconfiguration.
Programs 52–54 of the Framework detail the City resources and actions toward
helping families in Santa Ana.
EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
Extremely low income households are those earning annual incomes that are 30
percent or less of the area median income. Based on state income limits for 2013,
a four-person, extremely low income household earns no more than $28,900, and
can afford approximately $585 per month for rent. Homeownership opportunities
for extremely low income households are generally considered financially
infeasible throughout much of California, including Santa Ana, due to the levels
of subsidies required for a single unit.
According to the 2012 SCAG Existing Housing Needs Report, 11,370 households
(15 percent) in Santa Ana earn extremely low income. This is the average income
in service occupations. Extremely low income households experience a broader
range and severity of housing problems than other households.
According to the Southern California Association of Governments, the City of
Santa Ana has a construction goal of 45 very low income units from 2014 through
2021. Of that total, the City estimates that the construction need for extremely low
income units is 50 percent of that total, or 23 units. The City has a carryover of
111 very low units from the 2006 through 2014 planning period. This adds about
55 units to the City’s extremely low allocation, bringing the total number to 78
units. This is based on a methodology approved by the Department of Housing
and Community Development for estimating the need for extremely low income
housing. Meeting the goal of providing housing affordable to extremely low
income housing is challenging due to the present fiscal and economic climate and
the financial subsidies required to make these projects financially feasible.
The following are ways that the City is addressing the need for extremely low
income households to secure housing in Santa Ana.

HOUSING NEEDS
Housing and Services
The City of Santa Ana’s housing strategy for extremely low income households is
focused on rental assistance, housing rehabilitation and preservation, and new
construction to meet the needs of extremely low income households.
Rental Assistance
The Santa Ana Housing Authority issues an estimated 2,699 housing vouchers to
Santa Ana residents, predominantly those with extremely low incomes. Given the
magnitude of need, vouchers serve less than one-quarter of the need. As of
September 2013, 31 percent of the housing vouchers issued were for families. The
Housing Element proposes that the Santa Ana Housing Authority seek additional
vouchers, where feasible, to serve extremely low income households.
Housing Rehabilitation
The City of Santa Ana is acquiring multiple-family apartments, rehabilitating
them, reconfiguring units to create large-family housing, and deed restricting the
units as affordable to low/extremely low income.
New Construction
The City of Santa Ana is also encouraging new multiple family units that would
be deed restricted as affordable to the extremely low income through
implementation of the City’s Housing Opportunity ordinance and community
partnerships.
FARM WORKERS
Farm workers are a special needs group because their limited income, coupled
with the lack of affordable housing, places them in a precarious situation.
Although the community has an agricultural past, Santa Ana is now completely
urbanized, with only one active farming operation. The 2010 Census reported
that 1,131 Santa Ana residents, or 1.1 percent of the employed population, held
farming, fishing, and forestry occupations. The average annual wage of Santa Ana
farm workers was $18,390, which is very low income. Therefore, based on the
seasonal nature of the work, not just income, the primary housing need for this

PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS
As the primary health and welfare service center in Orange County, Santa Ana
has a significant number of individuals and families who are homeless. The
County of Orange conducts an annual homeless needs assessment and biennial
point in time count. The 2011 Point in Time Survey estimated 6,939 people were
homeless in Orange County. This count does not include persons at risk of
becoming homeless, such as people living in transient motels, or those living in
homes at risk of foreclosure, or other precarious arrangements. In 2013, the Point
in Time (PIT) Survey estimated 4,251 people were homeless in Orange County.
Based on the PIT Survey, roughly 20 percent of the people counted reported
Santa Ana as their last place of residence before becoming homeless. Therefore,
the City estimates that approximately 850 people were homeless in Santa Ana as
of 2013.
Numerous factors contribute to homelessness, such as unemployment, mental
illness, family problems, and substance abuse. Homeless people also have a
variety of unmet needs: medical care, job training, childcare, mental health care,
credit counseling, substance abuse treatment, and/or English language education.
The City’s homeless population is especially vulnerable and at risk of premature
loss of life due to untreated medical conditions, substance abuse, crime and
violence, and exposure to the elements.
The 2013 PIT Survey revealed the following characteristics of the homeless
population countywide, as summarized in Table A-8.

                                  Santa Ana’s comprehensive continuum of care approach is predicated on the
                                  understanding that homelessness is caused by underlying physical, economic, and
                                  social needs. People who are homeless require a range of services to reenter the
                                  mainstream. Beyond bringing persons into the system through outreach, the
                                  Continuum of Care Program is based on the provision of:
                                      Prevention. Santa Ana and nonprofit agencies provide monetary assistance and
                                       counseling/support services to households at risk of becoming homeless.
                                      Emergency Shelter. Short-term facilities, detoxification programs, and vouchers.
                                       This includes transitional shelter and case management services to prepare
                                       residents to obtain and maintain housing and live self-sufficiently. The City has
                                       also amended its Zoning Code in compliance with SB2 to allow emergency
                                       shelters in industrial zones.
                                      Residential Rehabilitation/Substance Abuse. A residence that provides housing
                                       for up to six months and provides specialized treatment and active rehabilitation
                                       for alcoholism and other drug-related issues on-site.
                                      Transitional Housing. A residence that provides a stay of up to two years, during
                                       which residents are provided case management services that prepare them to

HOUSING NEEDS
The City of Santa Ana has a wide range of housing needs related to the
production of new housing, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing. This
section provides a summary of these needs in Santa Ana.
HOUSING PRODUCTION NEEDS
State law requires cities to plan to accommodate population and employment
growth through implementing housing programs. The Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) prepares housing construction needs goals
for each city in Southern California as part of the Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA). All local governments are required to set aside sufficient
land, adopt programs, and provide funding, to the extent feasible, to facilitate and
encourage housing production commensurate with that need.
Santa Ana’s RHNA for the 2014–2021 planning period is 204 new housing units
divided into four household income/affordability groups (Table A-10).
2006–2014 RHNA
In accordance with state law, this housing element also addresses the RHNA that
was not accommodated through rezoning in the previous planning period
(January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2014). The City has a remaining RHNA balance of
201 lower income units (111 very low and 90 low based on the 2006–2014
distribution ratio). These 201 units must be accommodated through land rezoned
exclusively for residential development. A discussion of the carryover RHNA is
provided in Appendix C, Housing Resources. The City’s carryover and combined
RHNA is also provided in Table A-11.
Population and Job Growth
The first component of the RHNA is the number of units needed to
accommodate projected growth in both households and employment levels. The
household growth component is determined by calculating the expected
population growth that will occur during the planning period. According to the
2010 Orange County Projections, the City of Santa Ana is expected to increase in
population by approximately 13,000 residents from 2010 to 2020 but then decrease
in population by 900 residents between 2020 and 2035. Areas in Santa Ana that
will accommodate new housing include the Harbor Mixed Use Transit Corridor
Specific Plan area, Metro East, City Place, and other infill sites.
Santa Ana’s employment opportunities have been declining; the 2010 Orange
County Projections estimate that the City will lose about 2,000 jobs between 2010
and 2020. However, the local employment base is expected to begin growing again
toward the end of the decade. Employment opportunities are expected to increase
by about 3,400 jobs from 2020 to 2035.

HOUSING NEEDS
Housing Factors
Whereas population and job growth are key influences in housing demand, the
RHNA also includes factors to address the supply of new housing. The RHNA is
adjusted to accommodate a certain number of vacant units to allow for sufficient
choice for consumers, maintain rents and prices at adequate levels, and create an
environment conducive to housing maintenance and repair. In built-out cities
such as Santa Ana, new residential development requires the demolition or
removal of existing uses. SCAG adjusts the City’s housing planning goals for the
RHNA by a standard “replacement factor” based on the historical rate of units
lost to demolition. However, for the upcoming planning period, residential
growth is proposed in underutilized commercial areas (in the case of Harbor
Boulevard and Metro East), though additional replacement of housing is likely in
areas such as Downtown and other district centers.
Fair Share Factor
Santa Ana’s housing construction need represents the total construction need to
accommodate expected population and employment growth, while
accommodating a normal amount of vacancies and replacement units. This need
is furthered divided into four household income categories defined by state law. As
illustrated earlier in this appendix, these categories are based on the 2010 Census
County Median Family Income and include four different income categories that
are summarized in Table A-11.
California law states that the RHNA is required to avoid or mitigate the
overconcentration of income groups to achieve its objective of increasing supply
and mix of housing types, tenure, and affordability in an equitable manner. The
idea is to require cities with a smaller proportion of lower income units to provide
a larger share of those units as part of their construction need to compensate for
cities that accommodate more than their fair share. Targets are set to encourage
cities to house their fair share of all economic groups.

planning period covered by the Housing Element.

HOUSING REHABILITATION NEEDS
Well-maintained housing is a critical part of safe and healthy neighborhoods.
Housing conditions also influence property values and the City’s image. In the
absence of a comprehensive survey, the age of a home is often used to identify
housing repair needs. Generally, homes less than 30 years old are in good
condition and begin to require rehabilitation after that. Generally, homes built 50
or more years ago (unless well maintained) are more likely to require substantial
repairs than newer homes.

Chart A-21 Year Housing Built
While the 14,377 homes built in the last 30 years are presumed in good condition,
Santa Ana homes built between 1960 and 1980 may begin to require
rehabilitation. Much of Santa Ana’s housing was built during this period, before
the development of the latest in residential design standards. Typically, these
homes require reroofing, repainting, and other exterior work. In other cases, more
significant repairs may be needed, depending on the use.
Homes more than 50 years old are typically most in need of rehabilitation. An
estimated 26,766 housing units, or 35 percent of the housing stock, were built
before 1960. Unless periodically repaired, many of these housing units will
require significant repair, rehabilitation, and in some cases replacement. Typical
rehabilitation needs include the replacement of major subsystems, such as the
electrical, plumbing, and other systems.
Different definitions of substandard housing exist, depending on the source of
information used. Substandard housing conditions may refer to structural
deficiencies, such as leaking roofs, holes in the floor or walls, sloping walls, or
crumbling foundations. Substandard housing can refer to a lack of adequate
facilities: for example, frequent lack of hot water or heating systems that emit
unsafe fumes or frequently break down. These and other considerations are
important to note when discussing housing conditions.

HOUSING NEEDS
The 2010 Census, 2011 American Housing Survey, and City surveys provide an
indication of housing repair and rehabilitation needs in Santa Ana. Because of the
different methodologies used, differences in data cannot be reconciled. The point
here is to provide the best available information, understanding limitations in
data sources, so as to inform the development of housing policy. The latest
information references three substandard housing conditions:
    Deficient Utilities. The 2011 ACS reported that 765 units lack complete kitchen
     facilities, of which 589 are renter occupied and 176 are owner occupied. The 2011
     ACS also reported that 395 units lack complete plumbing facilities. Approximately
     65 percent of these units are renter occupied..
    Structural Inadequacies. Structural inadequacies include leaks, holes in the floor
     or walls, loose or missing steps, sloping exterior walls, sagging roofs, crumbling
     foundations, and other conditions. According to the 2011 American Housing
     Survey for the Anaheim/Santa Ana Metropolitan Area, approximately 5,600
     homes have holes in their roofs, 7,500 are missing outside wall material, 12,700
     have broken windows, and 36,700 have crumbling foundations or foundations
     with large cracks or holes.
    Lead-Based Paint. Lead paint hazards are typically found in buildings
     constructed prior to 1978. HUD estimates that 74 percent of dwellings built prior
     to 1980 have some level of lead-based paint. Lead poisoning can affect nearly every
     system in the body, leading to learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and
     medical conditions. According to the Consolidated Plan, approximately 10,640
     housing units may have lead-based paint hazards. According to the County of
     Orange Health Care Agency, the number of children diagnosed with elevated
     blood levels of lead has averaged approximately 100 annually.
The 2010–2015 Consolidated Plan cites local surveys and estimates that define
substandard housing in the context of housing units with serious building code
violations that require multiple inspections and aggressive corrective action. The
definition does not include housing units with minor code violations that are
easily correctable or do not require repeated enforcement (e.g., removal of debris,
proper installation of water heaters, broken windows).
The 2010–2015 Consolidated Plan cites that there are approximately 15,400
housing units in Santa Ana that are substantially substandard according to input
by the City’s Community Preservation Division. Code enforcement staff estimates
that approximately 8,000 multiple-family units are substandard and an additional
7,442 single-family units are considered substandard.

HOUSING PRESERVATION
With the downturn in the California economy and collapse of the housing
market, foreclosures have become a critical policy issue. Volumes of research have
documented the extensive causes of the foreclosure crisis, including the
proliferation of adjustable rate mortgages in the 2000s, the reduction in income
and down payment required by financial institutions, subprime lending issues,
and historically low interest rates that artificially increased housing prices. Table
A-11 summarizes foreclosures in Santa Ana for 2008 through 2012.
The City of Santa Ana had nearly 5,661 foreclosures over the past five years. The
number of foreclosures has decreased and is expected to remain low over the next
several years.

The City Council passed a resolution in 2007 declaring their commitment to
proactively seek ways to preserve homeownership. To facilitate that effort, Santa
Ana helped form the Orange County Home Preservation Collaborative to reach
out to homeowners, improve the availability of counseling for those at risk of
losing their homes, secure financing options, and pursue other solutions. In 2008,
the City also applied for and received a $5.8 million grant from the federal
government to address the impacts of the foreclosures in Santa Ana. Other efforts
are underway to further stem the tide of foreclosures anticipated to affect Santa
Ana as additional adjustable rate mortgages reset in 2010–2011.

ppendix B.Housing Constraints
          This chapter provides the requisite analysis of potential and actual market,
          governmental, and environmental constraints to the production, maintenance,
          and improvement of housing pursuant to state law.
          OVERVIEW
          Various factors influence the City’s ability to meet its housing goals. These
          include governmental constraints, such as land use regulations, and
          nongovernmental constraints, such as market and environmental factors. State
          law requires the housing element to analyze potential and actual constraints to
          the production, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons of all
          income levels and persons with disabilities.
          This chapter analyzes three potential constraints:
              Market factors: such as land costs, construction and rehabilitation costs, the
               availability of financing, and recent trends in foreclosures.
              Governmental factors: such as land use regulations, development standards,
               building codes, permit procedures, and other local policies.
              Environmental factors: such as the adequacy of infrastructure, public
               services, and water supply to support new development.
          The constraints analysis must also describe the City’s efforts to address and,
          where appropriate and legally possible, to remove governmental constraints when
          they prevent achievement of state and local housing production goals with respect
          to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing. State law does
          not require cities to remove market constraints to achieving its housing goals, but
          cities can influence and offset potential impacts.
          To that end, this chapter reviews the City’s General Plan, Zoning Code,
          Consolidated Plan, Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing, Housing Authority
          Plans, and other planning documents to analyze policies and governmental
          regulations that may limit housing opportunities in Santa Ana. Actions required
          to remove existing constraints are also detailed in this section.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
MARKET FACTORS
The feasibility of building new housing, including affordable housing, is
influenced by a variety of market factors, including the cost of land, construction
and rehabilitation costs, and financing issues. The housing market and achievable
rents and sales prices for builders also play key roles. This section details market
factors and their general impact on housing costs.
LAND COSTS
Land costs and the cost of assembling parcels are among the largest components
of the total cost of building new housing. Since Santa Ana is a 99 percent built-
out community, very few vacant parcels remain. Thus, in most cases residential
developers must buy the land and any existing structure on it. Land costs also
depend on the zoning for the site and the proposed use of the property. The
following land prices were obtained from on-line real estate database tools.
    Single-family residential land. The average cost of vacant land ranges from
     approximately $30 to $50 per square foot, based on Trulia Real Estate search and
     land value estimated at 75 percent of the sales price (2013). With home sales
     increasing in the market, the price of residential land for single-family homes is
     expected to slowly increase throughout the city.
    Mixed-use residential land. In prior years, the City surveyed properties zoned for
     mixed uses in the Metro East Overlay Zone and determined that land values
     range from $20 to $45 per square foot for unimproved land. According to
     LoopNet Real Estate search (2013), the price per square foot for properties along
     Harbor Boulevard that are zoned for commercial uses ranges from $35 to $55.
     Prices for underutilized land along First Street and Grand Street are listed at $50
     per square foot.
    Multiple-family residential land. For multiple-family properties within existing
     residential zones, City appraisals derived an estimate of $30 to $45 per square foot
     for land in older residential neighborhoods, such as the Transit Zoning District
     area and other infill locations. The value of residential land in District Centers is
     included in the estimates for mixed-use opportunities. Prices will vary significantly
     by location.
Changes in the housing market will to continue to affect the achievable rents and
sales prices of housing. However, declining land values may have benefits in that
they reduce the total development cost of building affordable housing. In effect,
the recent housing market downturn has reduced the potential constraint of land
costs.

                                                              HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
CONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION COSTS
Construction costs are the largest component of costs associated with new and
rehabilitated housing. Construction costs include labor, materials, site
improvements, and developer profit. The cost will vary by project type, quality of
materials, location, height, and whether underground parking is required. The
following provides a range of estimates that can be used to estimate costs.
Construction Costs
Various construction cost-estimating firms provide developers and jurisdictions in
the Southern California region with cost projections for residential development.
For example, R.S. Means provides construction cost manuals for calculating the
average cost per square foot of residential construction throughout the Southern
California region. Region wide numbers, however, tend to be diluted by lower cost
areas and may not accurately reflect the higher costs of building in Orange
County.
According to R.S. Means multiple-family housing ranges from $124 to $173 per
square foot, which translates to approximately $136,400 to $190,300 for an 1,100
square-foot unit. Residential development with limited ground preparation,
simplified architectural features, and standard quality of interior materials would
be in the lower range of these estimates. However, construction costs would be
higher for more luxurious buildings and projects with underground parking.
Rehabilitation Costs
The City was actively involved in funding the acquisition and rehabilitation of
multiple-family projects during the prior housing element planning period. Based
on a sample of 2009 projects in Santa Ana, the rehabilitation cost ranges from
$55,000 to $85,000 per unit. However, projects involving acquisition,
rehabilitation, and reconfiguration (to remove or combine smaller units to create
larger units) can cost from $75,000 to $120,000 per unit. Other indirect and direct
costs associated with rehabilitating housing (e.g., relocation, replacement of units,
removal of asbestos or lead-based paint, etc.) can add substantial costs.
In other cases, private property owners may initiate rehabilitation projects. To
assist property owners in improving housing, the City offers below-market-rate
loans to qualified applicants for up to $75,000 per single-family or multiple-
family unit. Mobile home owners can receive $5,000 to $10,000 per unit for
rehabilitation. The Housing Framework describes these programs in greater
detail.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
FINANCING COSTS
Financing affects the feasibility of developing new housing and housing
affordability. This includes the ability to secure a construction loan,
homeownership assistance, and the recent issue of foreclosures.
Construction Loans
Construction financing costs also affect the feasibility of building new housing.
The restrictive lending cycle has repeated itself with the housing market boom of
the early 2000s. Relaxed lending rules allowed developers to secure a loan with
only a 10 percent equity contribution (Apartment Finance Today, 2009). With the
2008 downturn, however, housing prices significantly declined and apartment
rents also showing a decline, according to RealFacts. Loan underwriting has
grown more conservative, with maximum leveraging topping out at 75 percent. In
2013 construction loans have begun to cycle back becoming easier to qualify for
and new residential development is underway throughout the City.
Although there is no hard threshold for how much equity is too much before a
project would be deemed infeasible, the higher the proportion of equity required,
the more unlikely a developer would proceed with the project. Not only would it
require more up-front cash, but also higher equity contribution means a project
must be able to achieve an even higher value at completion in order to generate
the net cash flow needed to meet the minimum acceptable cash-on-cash return
threshold. These types of trends underscore the condition of the housing market
facing communities in southern California today.
Homeowner Assistance
In recent years, the rising price of housing made it financially infeasible for many
communities to offer homebuyer assistance to residents. In some cases, the public
subsidies necessary to provide homeownership assistance were too high, and
renter assistance served a greater number of residents. In other cases, rising
market prices made it infeasible for local governments to offer subsidized loans,
because the median home price well exceeds the maximum price allowed under
the loan. Both of these factors have significantly reduced the feasibility of Santa
Ana’s homeownership programs. With changes in market prices as of 2013,
homeowner assistance may once again be a feasible option.

                                                           HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Market changes have also affected residents wishing to purchase a home. Interest
rates for loans have varied from 5 to 7 percent, down payment requirements have
ranged from zero to 10 percent, allowable income-debt ratios have significantly
varied. Recent changes in lending policy will have an impact on the housing
market in southern California. The U.S. government stopped guaranteeing big
loans in expensive cities. The new policy caps guaranteed loans at $625,000,
which restricts lending and means that potential borrowers may not qualify for a
loan or will pay a higher interest rate.
Foreclosures
In recent years, the sizeable number of home foreclosures throughout southern
California dampened the housing market. The crisis originated in the early 2000s
with subprime lending, loosening of credit terms offered by financial institutions,
overproduction of housing, and declines in the economy. According to Data
Quick, the City had 5,661 foreclosures over the past five years. The number of
foreclosures has decreased and is expected to remain low over the next several
years.
As in other metropolitan areas, the availability of foreclosed units and the
associated lending crisis in Orange County and in Santa Ana make up a market
constraint on the production of housing. Financial institutions have increased
equity requirements for developers, requiring greater equity contributions than in
recent years. For the consumer, home loans are also more difficult to qualify for
and obtain.
Summary
State law does not require jurisdictions to mitigate market constraints, as
economic conditions are beyond the control of any one city. Nonetheless, Santa
Ana is implementing programs to lessen the impact. The City competitively
applied for and received Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds to purchase
foreclosure properties and have them reoccupied. The Program was actively
involved in facilitating the production and rehabilitation of housing. Other
housing incentives programs add more flexibility and clarity to development
standards to facilitate housing production. These three programs are some of the
ways the City is addressing market constraints.

GOVERNMENTAL FACTORS
This section reviews potential governmental constraints, including land use
regulations, housing opportunities, development regulations, building codes and
their enforcement, permit processing, development fees and exactions, and
housing opportunities for people with disabilities.
LAND USE REGULATIONS
The General Plan Land Use Element sets forth land use designations to guide the
location, type, and intensity or density of permitted uses of land. The Zoning
Code implements the General Plan by providing specific direction and
development standards within each of the general land use categories. The
General Plan sets forth six goals for future land described below.
      1)    Promote a balance of land uses to address basic community needs
      2)    Promote land uses that enhance the City’s economic and fiscal viability
      3)    Preserve and improve the character and integrity of neighborhoods
      4)    Protect and enhance development sites and districts which are unique
            community assets that enhance the quality of life
      5) Ensure that impacts of development are mitigated
      6) Reduce residential overcrowding to promote public health and safety
To help meet these goals, the City of Santa Ana has 11 land use designations,
Table B-1 shows the five residential land uses, corresponding zoning districts, and
permitted densities allowed for residential development.

District Centers
The City of Santa Ana’s Land Use Element guides the long-range vision for land
use and development in specific areas of the community. Areas designated District
Centers are intended to serve as anchors and to be developed with a mixture of
high-rise office, commercial, and residential uses. These areas provide a range of
shopping, business, cultural, educational, recreational, entertainment, and
housing opportunities. Residential development in District Centers is guided
through the implementation of specific plans, overlay zones, and the Specific
Development (SD) Zone. District Centers where development interest is strong
include City Place, MacArthur Place, Transit Zoning Code area, and Metro East.
City Place is adjacent to MainPlace regional mall, and includes a planned office
complex and additional high intensity mixed-use development, such as the mid-
rise City Place The 301 Apartments. MacArthur Place, near I-405 and SR-55,
includes an existing office complex. a supportive service uses t, and recent high
and mid-rise multi-family housing projects. Metro East, near I-5 and SR-22, is
envisioned as a vibrant urban village with a balance of office, mixed-use and live-
work units, and commercial and retail land uses connected by pedestrian and
transportation linkages. Finally, the Downtown is one of the county’s major
employment centers, with the potential for a vibrant mixed-use and mixed-
income environment benefitting from transit-oriented development at the Santa
Ana Regional Transportation Center.
High Density General Plan Designation
The General Plan Land Use Element was amended in the late 1990s to eliminate
the high density residential (HR) land use designation that supported the R-3 and
R-4 zoning districts. Both these zones encompassed approximately 1,175 acres
throughout the city. This action was taken to allow the City to address long-term
neighborhood stabilization goals. Since that time, the City has created
comprehensive design and development standards, developed programs to
improve public infrastructure and traffic control, and undertaken other planning
efforts to improve and rehabilitate housing.
The absence of the HR land use designation does not constrain the City’s ability
to achieve its RHNA, nor does it constrain the production of housing. More than
80 percent of the R-3 and R-4 zones have multiple-family projects with five or
more units. Although a small portion of sites are underutilized, the City has been
directing more than 1,000 new multiple-family units to its SD Zone in District
Centers. The Housing Element will also redesignate land for residential/mixed
use along transit corridors. The Transit Zoning Code and Metro East areas will
also provide additional housing opportunities.

Table B-2 summarizes the housing types allowed in each zoning district and
whether the housing is permitted by right (denoted as “P” in the table) or

Single-, Two-, Townhouses, and Multiple-Family Residences
The Santa Ana Zoning Code permits single-family residences as a by-right use in
the A1, RE, R1, R2, and R3 residential zones. In 2006, the City amended the
Zoning Code to continue to allow single-family residences with six or fewer
bedrooms as a by right use, but require single-family residences with seven or
more bedrooms to secure a conditional use permit. This was due to a number of
factors, including mansionization concerns, parking constraints in
neighborhoods, and the desire to preserve neighborhood character.
Two-family residences are permitted by right in the R1 and R2 zoning districts.
Townhouses are permitted in the R2 and R3 zoning districts. Multiple-family
residences (three or more units per structure) are permitted by right in the R3 and
R4 zones. The current General Plan Land Use Element does not have a
corresponding land use designation for the R3 and R4 residential zones, but

rather actively directs and encourages multiple-family residences in many District
Centers and Urban Neighborhood areas, either as a by-right use or pursuant to a
SD Zone.
Manufactured Housing
Manufactured housing and mobile homes can provide opportunities for below
market rate housing that is affordable to households earning lower and moderate
incomes. The Housing Element is required to encourage the production of a
variety of housing types, including manufactured housing and mobile homes;
identify adequate sites for manufactured housing and mobile homes; and permit
such uses in conformance with existing state law. The following explains how
such uses are permitted in Santa Ana.
The Government Code, Sections 65852.3 and 65852.4, specifies that permanently          The City permits manufactured
sited manufactured homes may generally not be excluded from lots zoned for             housing in all lots zoned for single-
single-family dwellings. These Government Code sections also require that local        family dwellings.
governments treat such uses like other single-family homes permitted in the same
zone. The City’s Zoning Code defines manufactured housing consistent with
state law, allows such uses by right in all residential zones, and treats such uses in
the same manner as other conventional single-family homes located in the same
zone, in conformance with state law.
Housing Element law also requires all local governments to encourage and
facilitate a variety of housing types, including opportunities for mobile homes.
The City’s Zoning Code defines mobile homes consistent with state law and
allows mobile home parks in the R3 zone. The City has approximately 3,000
mobile homes in the community. Telephone surveys show that at least seven parks
are restricted to people age 55 years of older. The City also supports four
rehabilitation loan packages designed to preserve existing mobile homes.
Second Units
Second units are attached or detached dwelling units that provide for complete
independent living facilities and include permanent provisions for living,
sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation on the same parcel as the single-family
dwelling. In 2002, the Government Code (Section 65852.2) was amended to
require that second units be allowed in every residential zone as a by-right use.
The Government Code also specifies various development standards and
permitting processes that apply for second units.
The City of Santa Ana permits second units in the A1, RE, R1, R2, R3, R4, and
CR zoning districts, or on a parcel within any specific plan or Specific
Development zoning district in which residential uses are permitted. Second units
must be a minimum of 300 square feet in size and cannot exceed 750 square feet
or 30 percent of the primary dwelling unit size, whichever is less. One parking
space per unit is required at a minimum. The City’s Second Unit Ordinance
establishes criteria for design, yard, setback, and height.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
The Zoning Code does not allow second units as a by-right use in areas
designated as deficient in public open space, as shown on the map entitled "Areas
of Open Space Deficiency" on file with the clerk of the council. In park-deficient
areas, the property owner may secure a second unit permit by applying for a
minor exception. Three exceptions have been processed in recent years for second
units in an Area of Open Space Deficiency. Since 2009, ten second units have
been built in Santa Ana, thus adding incrementally to the number of affordable
housing units in the city.
Farmworkers
The Health and Safety Code (Section 17021.6) declares that it is the policy of the
state that each city permit and encourage the development and use of sufficient
numbers and types of employee housing facilities as are commensurate with local
needs. Section 17021.5 requires that employee housing providing
accommodations for six or fewer employees shall be deemed a single-family
structure with a residential land use designation, treated as a residential use of
property, and that the use not be subject to any regulations or fees not otherwise
required of a single-family residence within the same zone.
The City’s A1 (General Agricultural) Zone allows one single-family dwelling, a
detached guest home, and employees' quarters, all of a permanent character in
this zone. The density is limited to one dwelling unit for each 6,000 square feet of
lot area, provided the lot has an area of one-half acre or less. Despite the limited
number of farmworkers in the community and the built-out nature of the A1
zone, the City allows employee housing (for farmworkers) consistent with Health
and Safety Code Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6.
Mixed Use
As a major employment and transit center in Orange County, the City of Santa
Ana recognizes the importance of providing a broad range of housing, such as
mixed use and live-work. Santa Ana General Plan allow areas like the Transit
Zoning Code Industrial Overlay to accommodate industrial and residential uses
to coexist and transition in the Lacy and Logan neighborhoods. Live-work lofts
were also built in an industrial area near the Santa Ana Regional Transportation
Center. These opportunities are also offered through District Centers.
The General Plan facilitates a variety of mixed-use housing opportunities in
District Center. In these areas, residential development is permitted at up to 90
units per acre when it is a component of a mixed-use, master planned project, and
located near a major transit corridor. The allowable floor area ratio (FAR) for
District Centers ranges from 1.0 to 5.0 FAR. Additionally, the Urban
Neighborhood General Plan designation allows primarily a mixture of residential
uses (7 to 30 du/acre) with pedestrian oriented commercial uses. The SD zone is
one implementing tool that allows flexible standards that facilitate these uses.
Some examples of these types of mixed-use development opportunities are:
MacArthur Place, City Place, Metro East, and other focused areas. The Transit
Zoning Code district also provides additional opportunities for mixed-uses.

A unique aspect of the Santa Ana Municipal Code is a live-work community,
defined as a building, or portion thereof, used for units that are each a
combination of a studio/workshop and a living quarters, and may be either a
building, or portion thereof, originally designed for nonresidential purposes and
converted to such use, or a new building initially designed for such use. Live-
work communities are allowed by right and conditionally permitted within the
Transit Zoning Code districts. The City has facilitated 86 new live-work lofts in
the heart of the Artists Village, in District Centers, and other locations in Santa
Ana.
Care Homes
The Welfare and Institutions Code (Lanterman-Petris Act) and the Health and
Safety Code (Community Care Facilities Act) declare that it is the policy of the state
that people with a wide variety of disabilities are entitled to live in normal
residential settings. Under this authorizing legislation, state law sets forth
regulations and guidelines for community care facilities that preempt or limit many
local regulations. A community care facility is a broad term that refers to many types
of facilities, including but not limited to group homes, adult residential care
facilities, alcohol and drug rehabilitation facilities, and others.
                                                                                          Community Care facility
Under the above two acts, state law generally requires that licensed community care
facilities serving six or fewer persons be: (1) considered a residential use of property;
2) treated the same as any other residential use; (3) allowed by right in all
residential zones; and (4) subject to the same development standards, fees, taxes,
and permit procedures as those imposed on the same type of housing in the same
zone. The City permits licensed care homes serving six or fewer residents by right
in all residential zones, in a manner consistent with state law.
The Santa Ana Zoning Code regulates “care homes” serving seven or more clients.
A care home is “any facility which is maintained and operated to provide living
accommodations for and 24-hour nonmedical care to persons in need of personal
services, supervision, assistance, guidance, or training essential for sustaining the
activities of daily living or for the protection of the individual, such as the elderly,
convalescents, invalids, dependent or neglected children, or handicapped, mentally
impaired or incompetent persons.” Care homes are conditionally permitted in the
R3, R4, and other zones in the community.
In recent years, Santa Ana has received requests to establish a wide range of
facilities that serve people with disabilities or other health conditions and are not
licensed by the State of California. The list of types of nonlicensed facilities
continues to increase. Moreover, many of these nonlicensed facilities may provide
some but not all of the services provided by “care homes.” It is becoming
increasingly difficult to distinguish between the services provided by these facilities,
thus complicating local land use, zoning, and permitting. State law is also gradually
evolving in response to these realities.
To respond to this evolution of state law and to continue the City’s practice of
facilitating and encouraging housing opportunities for people with disabilities, the

             Housing Element continues three programs. Programs 43, 44, and 45 monitor
             changes to state law and implement the City’s reasonable accommodation
             ordinance to assist persons with disabilities and seniors with housing options in
             Santa Ana.
             Housing for Homeless People
             Recent state legislation has dramatically changed the ways local governments
             address homelessness. The state legislature has recognized the growing problem of
             homelessness, the complex causes (lack of affordable housing, mental illness and
             substance abuse, release from prison, etc.), the lack of available facilities for
             individuals and families, and the need for all communities to provide housing
             opportunities for this segment of the population.
             The state legislature enacted Senate Bill 2 to facilitate a continuum of housing
             opportunities for homeless people, including emergency shelter, transitional
             housing, and permanent supportive housing. Facilities are defined as follows:
                 Emergency Shelter. Provides the first step in getting people off the street.
                  Emergency shelter means housing with minimal supportive services for homeless
                  persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person.
                 Transitional Housing. Refers to buildings configured as rental housing
Isaiah House      developments, but operated under program requirements that call for the
                  termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible
                  program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no
                  less than six months.
                 Supportive Housing. Refers to housing with no limit on length of stay, which is
                  linked to on- or off-site services that assist the supportive housing resident in
                  retaining the housing, improving health status, and maximizing ability to live and,
                  when possible, work in the community.
             Based on the 2013 Orange County Point In Time Count, the number of homeless
             persons in Santa Ana is estimated to 850. Given existing shelters and housing in
             Santa Ana to serve homeless persons, the City of Santa Ana estimates a need for
             532 emergency shelter beds.
             Cities with an unmet need for emergency shelters are required to identify one or
             more zones where emergency shelters will be allowed as a permitted use without
             a conditional use or other discretionary permit. The identified zones must have
             sufficient capacity to accommodate the shelter need and provide capacity for at
             least one year-round shelter. Permit processing, development, and management
             standards can be drafted, but they must be objective and facilitate the
             development of, or conversion to, emergency shelters.
             The City’s emergency shelter ordinance currently identifies industrial zoning
             districts as appropriate locations to accommodate emergency shelters by right,
             Through the implementation of Program 46 in the Housing Framework, the City
             will amend the separation criteria and introduce an Emergency Shelter Overlay to
             the industrial zoning districts to further clarify opportunity sites best suited for

emergency shelters. As of January 2013, approximately 995 acres of industrial
zoned land were identified as opportunities areas for new construction and
modification of existing buildings for emergency shelters. These areas would be
included in the Overlay, and are also within 1.5 miles from transit services. The
development standards in industrial zones will apply, as well as standards allowed
under Senate Bill 2 including a requirement for a site-specific operation and
management plan.
DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
The Zoning Code establishes residential development standards to promote a
livable environment—adequate yards for open space, height restrictions and
setbacks to ensure privacy from adjacent homes, and in some cases minimum unit
sizes to ensure sustainable and adequate living areas. This section analyzes
residential development regulations in a twofold manner: 1) development
standards that apply Citywide; and 2) development standards that apply to areas
that will accommodate housing needed to address the RHNA.
Citywide Development Standards
Table B-3 shows common residential development standards in Santa Ana, such
as density ranges, lot standards, open space, and building standards. These
residential development standards apply to more urbanized areas of the
community that have long-established land use and development patterns. As is
the case with most communities, Santa Ana allows a broad range of residential
uses through a variety of densities, height, and other requirements.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Multiple-Family Development Standards
The City of Santa Ana has many multiple-family residential projects built
between 1960 and 1980. Because of the development standards and lack of design
guidelines at that time, many of these projects did not age well and do not offer
desired amenities. Conditions include the lack of on-site parking, open space,
privacy, and aesthetic quality. Overcrowding, public safety concerns, and the lack
of community services also detract from quality of life. The City also is addressing
off-site parking shortages in many of these areas.
In an effort to provide quality housing, further neighborhood preservation goals,
and maintain property values, the City revised its development and design
standards for multiple-family residential projects, as shown in Table B-4.
Multiple-family housing projects are allowed different density standards, based on
the size and configuration of lots, to accommodate new housing. Projects
proposing affordable and/or senior units specified under state density bonus law
can apply for modifications and/or concessions.

Parking Standards
The provision of adequate parking in Santa Ana is an important issue. Adequate
                                                                                                                                                Source: Wöhr Autopark-Systeme
parking is needed to prevent traffic congestion caused by shortage of parking
spaces and the unloading of trucks on public streets, improve the efficiency of
roadways, protect the public safety, and provide for the special needs of the
physically handicapped. At the same time, parking requirements can deter the
production of housing if the standards bear little relation to need. Thus, parking
standards must be adequate to ensure sufficient spaces to serve residential uses,
but not create an actual constraint to housing development.
As an older established community many neighborhoods in the City are
characterized by residences with smaller, unusable garages. Moreover, as
discussed earlier, a significant portion of the multiple-family projects built before
1990 lacked adequate parking which, in tandem with overcrowding, has created
significant parking shortages today in certain neighborhoods. In order to protect
the health and welfare of residents and provide for adequate public safety, the
City’s has established the parking ratios shown in Table B-5.                                            Top: Example of hydraulic parking in

                               Santa Ana allows additional parking reductions for affordable housing. For
                               projects that provide a mere 5% very low or 10% low income units and comply
                               with State density bonus law (Government Code Section 65915), developers can
                               receive the parking standards that are an additional 25% to more than 50% below
                               the City’s reduced standards. Finally, developers may request an exception to
                               allow tandem and shared parking under certain conditions. Multiple-family
                               projects, particularly those that provide affordable units, could easily qualify for
                               these reduced parking standards, which is why the City's current multiple-family
                               parking standards are not a constraint.
                               The City recognizes that parking is a key issue to the development community.
                               The Housing Plan (Program 33) thus proposes a study to evaluate parking
                               standards for residential development, with a special focus on multifamily
                               development. The study will compare the development costs of current parking
                               standards, the effect of parking standards on project density, and the costs and
                               benefits of a parking in-lieu fee option. Should parking be deemed a constraint, a
                               program to mitigate the constraint will be presented to City Council for
                               consideration.

Flexibility in Standards
The City of Santa Ana implements a variety of administrative procedures and
specialized zoning districts to facilitate the development of quality housing. These
procedures allow the developer to seek relief from typical development standards
that may constrain a potential project or physical hardships that may arise due to
the size, shape, or dimensions of a site or existing structures. The primary tools to
facilitate development are the exception process, the density bonus ordinance, and
Specific Development Zone discussed below.
Exception Process
The minor exception procedure is intended to provide relief from zoning
ordinance regulations that result in unintended inequities or hardships when
applied to specific properties and must not be a grant of special privilege. The
exception process allows the City of Santa Ana additional flexibility in facilitating
new residential products in a variety of settings. A developer may seek
modification of the following zoning standards:
    Yards: up to 20 percent of the minimum lineal dimension
    Building separation: up to 50 percent of the minimum separation required
    Lot coverage: up to 20 percent of the minimum standard
    Building height: up to 25 percent of maximum height
    Off-street parking: up to 20 percent of the minimum number of stalls provided
     that the exception does not result in parking impaction
Other standards as allowed by the Planning Commission:
    The City Council, Planning Commission, or Zoning Administrator has the
     authority to grant a minor exception when specific criteria are met. In these
     situations, the following findings must be made prior to obtain an exception:
    That because of special circumstances applicable to the subject property, strict
     application of the zoning ordinance would deprive privileges not otherwise at
     variance with the intent and purpose of this chapter;
    That the granting of a variance or minor exception is necessary for the
     preservation and enjoyment of one or more substantial property rights;
    That the granting of a variance or minor exception will not be materially
     detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to surrounding property; and
    That the granting of a variance or minor exception will not adversely affect the
     general plan of the City.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Density Bonus
The City of Santa Ana implements the state density bonus law, which allows the
developer to seek and the City to grant modification in residential development
standards to facilitate and encourage the production of affordable housing. The
City’s density bonus ordinance, Section 41-1600, incorporates state density bonus
law (California Government Code 65915–65918), as it may be amended from time
to time. As described in the Housing Plan (Program 28), the City will revise its
density bonus ordinance to reflect changes in state law.
Applicants of residential or mixed use projects of five or more units are entitled to
a density bonus under one of four conditions: 1) at least 5 percent are very low
income units; 2) at least 10 percent are lower income units; 3) at least 10 percent
are moderate income for-sale units; and/or 4) at least 35 percent of units are for
persons aged 55 and older. The density bonus ranges from 20–35 percent
according to how much affordable housing is provided above the minimum
percentage in state law. Eligible projects may also receive one to three concessions
or other development incentives, depending on the proportion of affordable units
and level of income that is targeted.
Housing Opportunity Ordinance
The City’s Housing Opportunity Ordinance was designed to support the
production of affordable housing. Passed in 2011, the Ordinance requires eligible
ownership projects to set aside at least 15 percent of the units as affordable to
moderate income households for at least 45 years. Eligible rental projects are
required to set aside at least 15 percent of the units as affordable to lower income
households for at least 55 years.
Specific Development Zoning District
The General Plan focuses new residential growth into key District Centers. The
implementing zone is often the Specific Development (SD) Zoning District. SD’s
are the primary means to facilitate the development of unique residential projects,
including live-work, mixed-use, and high-rise residential developments. These
types of residential projects require flexibility in development standards to
accommodate new housing products and unique site constraints and achieve
General Plan goals and objectives.
The Specific Development Zoning District is intended to achieve several
objectives: 1) protect and enhance the value of properties by encouraging the use
of good design principles and concepts; 2) encourage the orderly and harmonious
appearance and aesthetic development of structures and grounds; 3) provide a
method for specific development plans to be based on broader general plan goals;
4) recognize the interdependence of land values and aesthetics; and 5) encourage
excellence in project design and site use.
In the past several years, the City of Santa Ana has approved upwards of 80 SD
Districts to facilitate high quality and large-scale residential and commercial
projects. Project examples include the 350-unit Skyline Towers, 182-unit City

Place The 301, MacArthur Place North, and Santiago Street Lofts. The SD
District is obtained in the same manner as any other zone change, which requires
a public hearing before the Planning Commission and City Council. The SD
District will continue to facilitate residential and mixed use projects.
Transit Corridors Development Standards
Programs 20 and 21 propose a new General Plan land use designation and zoning
district to facilitate residential/mixed use development along major corridors. The           Development Scenario

density dependent on the proposed affordability of project, lot size, and other           determining the mix of
factors. Development standards and design guidelines will also be created and             development standards

These parameters are not meant to be prescriptive of those that will be developed
for residential/mixed uses, but are rather illustrate the process that will be used to
determine appropriate standards, including parking, within the building envelope
established by the approved density range. To ensure that future residential/mixed

use standards do not constrain the production of family housing, the Housing
Element proposes Program 32, Multiple-Bedroom Incentives. Although there is
currently a higher demand for smaller units in several areas in the City, recent
development in the Transit Zoning Code has included a variety of housing types
including units suitable for large families. In response, the City will monitor
applications for residential projects to ensure they match existing and future
housing demand in Santa Ana and propose ordinance changes if needed to align
products with needs.
Lot Sizes
The second critical issue in facilitating housing along corridors is determining the
desired project size and acquiring a site. Developers desire larger parcels because
this offers more flexibility and available land to include on-site amenities, arrange
buildings and/or units, and generate a greater revenue source for the project. For
affordable housing developers, larger projects also score more competitively on
state and federal loan and grant applications. However, lot consolidation is often
needed to assemble a desired lot size.
Lot consolidation is typically achieved through the voluntary purchase of land.
Property owners are more likely to sell if the sale generates a high enough profit.
However, if a proposed project would result in significant financial gain but the
price is not right or a landowner decides to holdout for an exorbitant price, an
otherwise desirable project may never materialize. In cases where there is
insufficient incentive for voluntary purchase and consolidation of sites,
City/Agency action is often required to purchase and assemble lots.
One promising planning strategy to encourage property owners to voluntarily
consolidate parcels into larger more developable parcels is graduated density. A
graduated density provision is one that allows progressively higher residential
density based on the size of the lot. Graduated density is an especially appropriate
tool to encourage the consolidation of small or irregularly shaped parcels into
larger parcels that are suitable for development. This tool is often applied to
transit-oriented development or the reuse of older commercial strips.
Shoup1 notes that graduated density zoning relies on market incentives to
motivate property owners to voluntarily assemble land. Property owners may see a
financial incentive to consolidate lots prior to development or sale of the lot to a
third party and therefore agree to enter into agreements with property owners of
adjacent sites. Landowners who do not wish to consolidate their lots or decide to
hold out from consolidation in the hope of gaining the highest price may miss the
chance to reap the financial benefits of lot consolidation.
Several local cities, such as Pasadena, Burbank, Glendale, and Simi Valley, have
implemented graduated densities. Although most of the sites included in the land
inventory necessary to address the RHNA are at least one acre or larger, the City

may consider a graduated density program as part of its update to the Zoning
Ordinance (see Program 21). Working with the state density bonus ordinance and
a minimum lot size, developers will be able to seek progressively higher densities
for assembling lots into larger sizes that facilitate quality housing.
Metro East Mixed-Use Overlay Zone
The Metro East Mixed-Use Overlay Zone (MEMU) is intended to introduce
development forms and uses that will provide for the creation of a high-intensity,
mixed-use urban village within a previously developed mid- to high-rise office
environment. The standards are specifically tailored to provide for a mix of
housing that encourages a continuum of living and a variety of household types.
The residential types envisioned include, but are not limited to, loft-style units,
live-work units, attached row houses, and stacked flats. Although the MEMU
does not require a specific percentage of housing, its explicit vision is to facilitate
residential development.
Table B-8 summarizes allowable residential uses and development standards in
each district. The Village Center District will provide commercial, office, and
residential uses in the same building or on the same site in buildings of 6 to 10
stories. The Active Urban District is intended for high-rise mixed-use projects,
which may combine office, commercial, and residential uses within one vertical
mixed-use building or a mix of uses within freestanding buildings on the same
site (three-story minimum height, no maximum). Live-work units are permitted
in all districts and multiple-family units are permitted in the Neighborhood                                         MEMU Overlay Zone

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Residential and mixed-use development in the three districts is required to
include 100 square feet of private and/or common open space per unit.
Development can satisfy this requirement in private areas such as balconies or
patios or common areas such as courtyards, rooftop decks, recreation facilities,
multipurpose rooms, or other areas designed for common use by residents.
Additionally, each development must set aside a certain percentage of the total
development site for publicly accessible open space and to provide for a high level
of pedestrian connectivity and activity throughout the Metro East area.
Reflecting the desired urban nature of the overlay zone, the required building
setbacks are minimal and facilitate the incorporation of publicly accessible open
space while reinforcing a continuous urban street frontage. Open space standards
are flexible; each project can incorporate either large private areas or large
common areas, or a combination of smaller private and common open spaces.
Greater lot coverage, combined with an FAR of 3.0, allows for a greater number of
units to be constructed, which can decrease the incremental cost of developing
each unit, thereby permitting lower sales or rental prices.
Properties within the MEMU may develop to the standards of the underlying
zoning district or the MEMU. To exercise the latter option, a MEMU Site Plan
Review application approved by the Planning Commission is required. The
MEMU allows residential development as a by-right use provided the Planning
Commission grants Site Plan Review per the following findings:
    That the proposed development plan is consistent with and will further the
     objectives outlined in Section 1.2 of the MEMU.
    That the proposed development plan is consistent with the development standards
     specified in Section 4 of the MEMU.
    That the proposed development plan is compatible with adjacent development in
     terms of similarity of scale, height, and site configuration and otherwise achieves
     the objectives of the Design Principles in Section 5 of the MEMU.
    That the land use, site design, and operational considerations in the proposed
     development plan have been planned in a manner that will result in a compatible
     and harmonious operation in Section 7 of the MEMU.
Since the MEMU’s adoption in 2007, several mixed use projects were proposed,
but were eventually withdrawn prior to entitlement due to the market downturn
in late 2007. This included Olen Properties proposed 132-unit project, and the
First/Cabrillo project that included 374 units. Each project offered two parking
spaces per unit. As both projects contained a majority of one and two bedroom
units and met current parking standards, the MEMU parking requirements are
not deemed a constraint to housing production. In 2013, the Lyon Communities
development was entitled for 250 apartments and 12 townhomes, with 126 one
bedroom, 116 two bedroom and 11 three bedroom units; meeting and exceeding
parking requirements.

Transit Zoning Code Districts
The Santa Ana Transit Zoning Code (TZC) provides a new planning framework
to strengthen existing neighborhoods and guide future development along the
Santa Ana Boulevard corridor, the Downtown, the civic center area, and the
Logan and Lacy neighborhoods. This plan strengthen Santa Ana’s core as a
regionally important transit-oriented district and government center, supported by
diverse neighborhoods. First released in October 2007 for public review, the
Transit Zoning Code was adopted in 2010.
As a place matures and its livability and economic value increase, a diverse set of
housing choices can attract an increasingly varied resident population. Therefore,
a fundamental component of the plan is to create a variety of housing choices
within pedestrian-friendly residential and mixed-use neighborhoods. The TZC
allows a variety of housing types such as single-family residences, rowhouses,
stacked flats, liner housing, and high rises.
With the adoption of the Transit Zoning Code, the area has the general plan land
use designations and zoning districts to support the development of new housing.
Multiple-family housing is permitted by right, subject to a conformance review.
For existing industrial uses within the TZC area, property owners may develop
sites as residential uses should they choose to activate the overlay zone, much like
the current Metro East Mixed Use Overlay Zone. Table B-9 illustrates the
housing types envisioned for each district.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Residential Development Standards
The Transit Zoning Code provides a range of residential development standards
that are based on building type. The TZC envisions up to 13 building types, of
which 10 permit multiple-family housing. Densities range from 5 units per acre
for a single-family house to 90 units per acre for tower-on-podium products. The
wide range of densities and building heights permitted in the proposed plan
would greatly facilitate housing production for a wide range of family types and
household incomes.
Summarized in Table B-10, the development standards facilitate the development
of building types that are affordable to a range of income levels. The proposed
parking requirements, 2 tenant spaces plus 0.15–0.25 guest spaces per unit, reflect
the transit-oriented nature of the area. The TZC proposes modest minimum and
maximum setbacks (0–15 feet), depending upon the development zone, to
promote a more active street front. The open space requirements are flexible,
reflect the urban feel of the area, and facilitate the most efficient and cost-effective
use of developable area.

BUILDING CODES AND ENFORCEMENT
Santa Ana enforces building codes, property maintenance standards, on- and off-
site improvement requirements, and other sections of the municipal codes to
ensure quality housing and neighborhoods for residents. Although building codes
and improvement requirements do raise construction costs, the public interest is
best served when buildings adhere to proper construction and engineering
practices and neighborhoods have appropriate infrastructure.
Building Codes
The State of California Health and Safety Code (Section 17958) mandates that
the California Building Standards Commission adopt and publish the California
Building Standards Code every three years. These codes contain the latest
advances in construction practices and engineering concepts. The 2010 edition of
the California Code of Regulations, Title 24, became effective on January 1, 2011.
The new state codes incorporate by reference the Model Codes published by the
International Code Council, which recently consolidated multiple regional codes
into a single set of codes.
As required by state law, local governments must adopt these codes by a specified
date, but may make amendments to address local geological, climatic, or
topographical conditions provided the modifications are no less restrictive than
the state standards. The City has adopted the most recent building codes to reflect
the latest advances in construction technology and building practices. Table B-11
lists the City’s adopted building code standards.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
The Planning and Building Agency and the Fire Department made certain
changes and modifications to the 2010 Edition of the California Building,
Plumbing, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire, and Existing Building Codes that are
reasonably necessary due to local conditions in Santa Ana. Other modifications of
an administrative or procedural nature were also made. Sixteen findings were
made relative to the Code and were due to seismic concerns, drainage issues, soil
conditions, humidity, and fire hazards in the community.
The Housing Plan includes programs to amend the City’s building codes and
practices and to establish a set of citywide design guidelines. Program 22 commits
the City to create citywide design guidelines. Program 23 commits the City to
develop a Green Building Policy that that incorporates sustainable building
concepts and supports demonstration projects and best practices.
Overcrowding Prohibition
Section 41-192 of the Municipal Code prohibits residential overcrowding.
Pursuant to Briseño v. City of Santa Ana 6 Cal. App. 4th 1378(1992), the court
held that the ordinance was “invalid,” which is to deprive it of legal force.
However, there was no order to repeal SAMC 41-192. The court in Briseño
interpreted the occupancy limitation ordinance as “invalid” pursuant to Uniform
Housing Code (UHC), and state law, which preempted the City of Santa Ana’s
local ordinance. The court held that in order to validate the ordinance the City
was required, under UHC§ 17958.7, to provide findings that a departure from the
standards set forth in the UHC occupancy limitation was necessary. The City of
Santa Ana affirms the ordinance is nonoperative.
On- and Off-Site Improvement Requirements
Article III of the Municipal Code requires minimum on- and off-site
improvements prior to acceptance and approval of the final subdivision map.
Pursuant to Section 34-81, common improvements include grading and street
work, curbs and gutters, sidewalks, drainage, fire hydrants, street trees, lighting,
and water and sewer lines. The cost of all improvements enumerated must be
borne by the subdivider, except such improvements of a type, size, or quality over
and above the standards required to service the subdivision, and where the City
Council has enacted provisions for the City to bear that portion of the costs for
such installations required in order to serve additional areas. Appendix C provides
a discussion of infrastructure issues for future housing sites.

PERMIT PROCESSING
Santa Ana is committed to ensuring that residential developments built within the
community are of lasting value, provide a decent and quality living environment
for residents, and improve property values. The City’s development review
process is designed to ensure that residential projects meet these objectives.
Although the process adds to the length of time to approve a project, the City is
charged with the responsibility of ensuring that residential projects are decent,
safe, and well designed. This process and the timeframes are described below and
summarized in Table B-10.
Initial Submittal
The development review process begins with submittal of the development
application. The initial submittal may be preceded by an initial consultation with         Design Solutions
the Planning or Building Department. The City of Santa Ana has a “First Look”       Recognizing the need to
                                                                                    balance the City’s housing

Environmental Review
City staff initiates the environmental review process for all discretionary projects,
as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and
implementing Guidelines. The City prepares or oversees the preparation of an
environmental assessment for any project that is not exempt from CEQA. This
assessment may involve a Negative Declaration or Mitigated Negative
Declaration for projects that either have no effect on the environment or can be
conditioned to have no impact. In cases where a significant environmental impact
may occur, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is required. The general
timeframe is one month for a Negative Declaration, six months for a Mitigated
Negative Declaration, and one year for an EIR.
Discretionary Actions
Variances, zone changes, general plan amendments, conditional use permits, tract
and parcel maps, minor exceptions, and all other discretionary actions require a
public hearing before the City Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission, or
City Council. The Zoning Administrator has delegated authority from the
Planning Commission to grant variances, conditional use permits, and minor
exceptions. Discretionary approvals are also required for the proposal and
approval of Specific Development Districts. From submittal of application to the
City Council or approval body is three months.
Table B-12 provides a summary of the City’s development permit processing steps
and the associated timeframes to process a prototypical single-family,
condominium, and multiple-family residential product. Permit processing times
vary from 2 months to 10 months, depending on the complexity of the project and
associated environmental clearance required.

DEVELOPMENT FEES AND EXACTIONS
The City of Santa Ana charges processing fees and exactions to recover the costs
of providing services to new development. Development fees are designed to
ensure that developers pay a fair, pro rata share of the costs of providing
infrastructure, and to compensate for processing development application.
Regional entities also charge development impact fees to cover the costs of
providing schools, sanitation, and regional transportation improvements.

Cumulative Cost
To determine the total cost of development fees, City staff compiled three
prototypical projects–a single-family home, a 300-unit condominium project, and
74-unit apartment project. All development fees were then calculated. As shown
in Table B-14, total development fees for the residential projects ranged from
$17,033 to $26,875 per unit. It should be noted that a significant percentage of the
per unit fee is actually due to other agency charges.

 Notes:
 1. Projects based on samples obtained from planning and development staff.
 2. The project receives fee credits from the OCSD and TSIA.
In recent years, many cities have adopted inclusionary ordinances and in-lieu fee
requirements to finance the development of housing affordable to a mix of
household income levels. The City adopted Housing Opportunity ordinance to
require residential project over five units to include 15 percent of the overall
project as affordable housing. The impact on developers can be reduced through
the pursuit of density bonus benefits.

HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
Effective on January 1, 2002, Senate Bill 520 amended housing element law and
Government Code Section 65008 to require localities to analyze the constraints
on housing for persons with disabilities. The following section addresses the
assessment of potential constraints and programs included to remove or mitigate
constraints to housing for persons with disabilities.
Building Codes
The City has already removed some potential constraints to housing by adopting
the California Building Code, 2010 edition, including Appendix 1, based on the
2009International Building Code, which requires new residential construction to
address the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The City also has the
authority to enforce accessibility laws and regulations (California Code of
Regulations Title 24) when evaluating new construction requests.
The aging of the nation’s population has underscored the need to make housing
accessible to people with different ranges of abilities. The building industry has
responded by developing various housing accessibility standards. One such
approach, referred to as “visitability,” is intended to make housing more accessible
to people who have trouble with steps or who use wheelchairs or walkers. A house
is considered to be visitable when it meets three requirements: one zero-step
entrance, doors with 32 inches of clear passage space, and one bathroom on the
main floor accessible by a wheelchair.
Given that most housing in Santa Ana was built prior to the enactment of federal
and state accessibility guidelines, many homes were not designed with visitability
concepts. As part of rehabilitation loan programs, the City’s housing
rehabilitation programs can fund wheelchair ramps, wider doors, grab bars, lower
counter tops, and other rehabilitation projects for persons with disabilities or with
limited mobility. As part of its Housing Plan (Program 44), the City will
investigate offering incentives to developers who incorporate visitability
components in the construction or rehabilitation of housing.
Land Use and Zoning
Land use and zoning are often cited as potential constraints to the provision of
special needs housing. The City is committed to facilitating a broad range of
housing types as required under state law. This includes community care
facilities. The Zoning Code does not explicitly address care homes serving six or
fewer residents, but the City’s long-standing practice is to permit them as a by-
right use in all residential zones and in conformance with state laws. The City’s
Zoning Code permits care homes serving seven or more clients in the R3, R4, and
commercial zones, subject to a conditional use permit. No unique
spacing/concentration requirements are imposed on care homes.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
SB 520 also references the need for an analysis of local occupancy standards that
apply specifically to unrelated adults and not to families. The Zoning Code does
not have occupancy standards that treat families differently than unrelated adults.
Furthermore, there is no definition of family in the Zoning Code that defines the
number or type of members that can constitute a family. Although Section 41-192
of the Municipal Code prohibits residential overcrowding, the courts ruled in
Briseño v. City of Santa Ana (6 Cal. App. 4th 1378[1992]), that the ordinance was
invalid pursuant to Uniform Housing Code (UHC). The City affirms that the
ordinance remains nonoperative.
Permitting Process
Currently, the City of Santa Ana processes a request to retrofit homes for
accessibility modifications over the counter in an administrative fashion. The City
permits licensed residential care homes with six or fewer persons as a by-right use
in all single-family zones. The City does not have a set of particular conditions or
use restrictions for residential care homes with more than six persons, except for a
conditional use permit. Care homes that require a conditional use permit follow
the same noticing and public hearing requirements as other uses.
The Housing Element continues three housing programs (Programs 43–45) to
clarify implementation of the Zoning Code and further fair housing for residents
with special needs. In these programs, the City will continue to monitor changes
in state law and will update the Zoning Ordinance as necessary with respect to
care facilities, the rehabilitation of housing, and maintenance of the reasonable
accommodation ordinance.
Reasonable Accommodation
In 2010, Santa Ana formally adopted a process for disabled persons to request
reasonable accommodation from zoning, permitting procedures, or building
requirements. The City recognizes the importance of reducing barriers to
adequate housing for disabled persons and will continue to implement the
reasonable accommodation ordinance to allow a process for requesting relief from
land use, zoning, building laws, rules, or administrative practices of the City
(Programs 45 and 50 in the Housing Plan implement the ordinance to assist
persons with disabilities and seniors with housing). The City’s reasonable
accommodation information is available at City Hall and on the City’s website.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
This section discusses the various environmental factors in relation to the
production, maintenance, and improvement of housing in Santa Ana. These
include environmental hazards, infrastructure issues for water and sewer, and
opportunities for energy conservation.
ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS
Natural Hazards
Like the entire Southern California region, the City of Santa Ana is in an area of
high seismic activity. Although no active fault traces cross the City, Santa Ana's
close proximity to five major fault zones subjects the area to surface rupture,
ground shaking, and ground failure. Several of Santa Ana’s public buildings have
undergone rehabilitation to reduce seismic risk. Flooding is also a consideration
for several areas within Santa Ana. The principal watercourse traversing the City
is the Santa Ana River, with Santiago Creek as the main tributary located at the
northern part of the City. With the Prado Dam improvements to the flood control
system, only a small portion of the northwest area of the City and an area adjacent
to the Santiago Creek are subject to the 100-year floodplain. Sites identified to
address the RHNA and discussed in Appendix C are not located within the 100-
year floodplain.
Man-Made Hazards
Certain land uses in Santa Ana use hazardous materials or pose fire hazards. The
majority of hazardous materials are on industrially zoned land or in commercial
development that either sells or uses such materials. According to the CalEPA
Enviromapper, no sites have hazardous materials that would impact the ability to
construct new housing on sites discussed in Appendix C. Since the City of Santa
Ana is largely developed, there is minimal potential for fire related to brush or
other natural materials. Fire hazards within the City may be associated with heavy
industrial uses, older commercial and residential structures, overcrowding in
residential units, the presence of hazardous materials, and arson. The City
recently adopted amendments to the Fire Code, but the amendments are not
unlike measures adopted in neighboring cities.
INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS
According to the 2005 Urban Water Management Plan and 2003 Sewer Master
Plan, the existing infrastructure system is well-developed and largely sufficient on
a citywide basis. Current and projected deficiencies are primarily a result of recent
growth and development pressures within the City, although increased
consumption by existing customers is also a factor. The following provides a
citywide discussion of infrastructure systems. A more focused analysis on areas of
potential residential growth can be found in the land inventory discussion.

HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Water Infrastructure
The sole source of water for Santa Ana is a municipally owned system operated by
the Santa Ana Public Works Agency. Santa Ana is a member of the Metropolitan
Water District and receives approximately between 30 and 35 percent of its water
supply imported from northern California via the State Water Project and the
Colorado River via the Colorado River Aqueduct. The City of Santa Ana receives
the remaining 65 to 70 percent of its water supply from groundwater wells
accessing the Santa Ana River groundwater basin.
The City’s 2010Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) indicates that existing
water supplies and planned capacity improvements are sufficient to meet
anticipated water demands. Therefore, on a citywide level, the availability of an
adequate supply of water is not a constraint to the production of housing. The
UWMP also did not indicate the presence of undersized water mains that would
preclude the development of housing in the community. Adequate fees are in
place and revised to maintain, repair, and replace water mains as necessary.
Sewer Infrastructure
The City of Santa Ana maintains approximately 390 miles of local sewer lines.
Main sewer trunks within the City of Santa Ana are owned and maintained by
the Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD), which provides sewage
collection and treatment service. The City's sewage is diverted to Reclamation
Plant Number 1 in Fountain Valley. The Reclamation Plant has a design capacity
of 60 million gallons per day (gpd) and is planned to provide capacity of up to 120
million gpd. OCSD requires all developers of residential projects within their
service area to pay capital facility charges that are designed to fund the
construction, maintenance, and improvement of facilities.
The 2003 Sewer System Master Plan states that, in general, the capacity of the
major sewers is adequate under dry weather flow conditions except for minor
surcharging in a small number of sewers. Additional surcharging would be
expected during most rainfall events. Under extreme peak wet weather flow
conditions, expected to occur less than once in five years, more sewers will
surcharge and a few of the worst may overflow. Capacity limitations in OCSD
trunk sewers cause or contribute to many of these problems, and coordination
with OCSD will be required to achieve an acceptable solution. The City’s two lift
stations were found to have adequate capacity under all conditions.
The Sewer Master Plan lists the recommended interceptor improvements and
their associated planning level costs. Projects on OCSD trunk sewers are not
included in the list, as those projects are not the responsibility of the City (Sewer
System Master Plan, Executive Summary). Please refer to Appendix C regarding
the adequacy of the sewer system for the Metro East Mixed-use Overlay District,
transit corridors, and proposed Transit Zoning Code district. To date, many sewer
infrastructure improvement have been completed since the 2003 Sewer System
Master Plan that have alleviated some of the worst case conditions.

ENERGY CONSERVATION
Rising energy costs, dependence on fossil fuels, and increasing evidence of the
adverse impacts of global warming have provoked the need in California and
nationwide to improve energy management strategies. Recognizing that the
design, construction, and operation of buildings have a profound impact on
energy use and global warming, state housing element law requires an expanded
analysis of the opportunities for energy conservation.
State Requirements
On a regulatory level, the City enforces the State Energy Conservation Standards
(California Code of Regulations, Title 24). These standards provide flexibility for
builders to achieve a minimum “energy budget” through use of performance
standards. These requirements apply to all new residential. New Title 24 codes
will be in place in 2008, which will require all buildings be approximately 22
percent more energy efficient than currently required. The City’s existing
development can be categorized into three types of construction relative to energy
efficiency: pre-Title 24, current Title 24, and new Title 24. According to the 2000
Census, the City estimates there are 59,000 pre-Title 24 residential units within
the City. The balance, or approximately 14,000 units, was built in compliance
with Title 24 in effect at the time of construction.
Green Building Programs
In response to an increased understanding of the relationship between buildings
and impact on the environment, the building industry has developed “Green”
building programs. The two most prominent green building programs are
California Green Builder, sponsored by the California Building Industry
Association, and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED),
sponsored by the US Green Building Council (USGBC).
    Green Builder is a voluntary environmental building and certification
     program for homes. The program focuses on energy efficiency, water
     conservation, wood conservation, advanced ventilation, and waste diversion.
     Certified homes incorporate water-efficient landscaping and fixtures, utilize
     high-efficiency insulation and ventilation systems, contain environmentally-
     sound building materials, initiate waste reduction methods during
     construction, and exceed Title 24 Building Code energy efficiency standards
     by 15 percent.
    LEED is a national rating system for green buildings that focuses on
     commercial and multiple-family residential projects. The USGBC reviews
     projects for conformance and assigns points based on various efficiency,
     sustainability, materials quality, and design factors. Once LEED has reviewed
     the project, a certification is issued based on the number of points achieved.
     The City has five projects registered with the USGBC, including Santa Ana
     State Building 520, signifying an intent to seek certification upon completion.

City Programs
Santa Ana has established its Santa Ana Green Program, supported by the
Environmental Transportation Advisory Committee, which promotes good
environmental practices through a variety of efforts. The following highlights a
few ways the City is promoting energy resource conservation:
    Climate Protection Initiative. The City participates in the US Mayors
     Climate Protection Agreement, which strives to meet or exceed the Kyoto
     Protocol targets through actions ranging from antisprawl land-use policies to
     urban forest restoration projects to public information campaigns.
    Tree Program (Tree City USA). The City is recognized as a Tree City USA,
     which signifies that the City has established a Tree Board, a Tree Care
     Ordinance, and a Community Forestry Program with an annual budget of at
     least $2 per capita. Trees also help clean the air and soil, control noise
     pollution, slow stormwater runoff, provide shade, and increase property
     values.
    Water Conservation Initiative. The City educates residents on water
     conservation opportunities, provides high-efficiency water conservation
     devices in public facilities, provides water conservation incentives to residents,
     uses reclaimed water to commercial and industrial users for irrigation or
     processes, and works with regional water purveyors on a variety of
     conservation efforts.
    Recycling Programs. The City continually surpasses the State of California’s
     recycling goals through the implementation of several successful programs.
     These programs include residential curbside recycling, multiple-family
     recycling, construction and demolition recycling, composting, and annual
     household hazardous waste collections.
    Build Green Initiatives. The City encourages the use of solar power through
     a two-year permit-fee-waiver program for solar projects. Santa Ana performs
     free engineering reviews for solar energy projects and building inspections.
     City staff can also examine new air-conditioner units, furnaces, and similar
     equipment for compliance with Title 24 guidelines and a determination of
     efficiency.
    Green Building. The City’s Housing Vision affirms the commitment to
     create sustainable housing opportunities for the residents and workforce of
     Santa Ana. To implement this direction, the Housing Plan states that the City
     of Santa Ana will create a Green Building Policy that incorporates sustainable
     building concepts and supports demonstration projects and best practices.
Taken together, the City’s programs help to conserve water, encourage recycling
and divert waste from the landfill, encourage alternative energy sources and lower
energy use, and conserve water resources. The Housing Element proposes
expanding these initiatives through a Green Building Policy.

ppendix C.Housing Resources
          This chapter provides an inventory, analysis, and assessment of the City’s
          resources to address its housing needs, including the City’s share under the
          regional housing needs assessment (RHNA).
          OVERVIEW
          2014–2021 RHNA
          The City’s RHNA is 204 housing units for the 2014–2021 planning period.
          Within this housing goal, the City is required to plan for four income and
          affordability goals: very low, low, moderate, and above moderate. The City’s
          RHNA by affordability level is 45 units of housing affordable to very low income
          households, 32 units of housing affordable to low income households, 37 units of
          housing affordable to moderate income households, and 90 units of housing
          affordable to above moderate income households.
          This appendix demonstrates how the City will achieve its 2014–2021 RHNA
          planning goals. Table C-1 breaks down the 2014–2021 RHNA and the combined
          RHNA based on the unmet need from the 2006–2014 planning period (as
          discussed below). An additional section is provided at the end of the chapter that
          details financial resources available to fund the construction, preservation, and
          rehabilitation of housing.
          2006–2014 RHNA
          In accordance with state law, this housing element also addresses the RHNA that
          was not accommodated through rezoning in the previous planning period
          (January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2014). Of the original 2006–2014 RHNA of 3,393
          units, the Housing Element identified the potential to accommodate 2,406 units
          through construction, approval, and vacant or underutilized land adequately
          zoned for housing. The City had a remaining RHNA balance of 987 lower
          income units, which were to be accommodated through rezoning of vacant or
          underutilized land (see Table C-2). The City did not need to rezone any land to
          accommodate moderate or above moderate income RHNA.
          After the Housing Element’s adoption in 2009, 291 affordable units were
          constructed or approved that were not identified in the Housing Element.
          Additionally, the City adopted the Transit Zoning Code in 2010, which provided
          the necessary zoning and density levels to accommodate up to 494 lower income

units in accordance with Section 65583.2(c)(3)(b) of the California Government
Code. The potential for residential units in this planning area was not counted
towards the City’s previous RHNA. Therefore, the City can reduce its remaining
RHNA balance by 785 units, leaving the City with a RHNA balance of 201 lower
income units (111 very low and 90 low based on the 2006–2014 distribution
ratio). The City planned on rezoning land along Harbor Boulevard and
accommodating its remaining RHNA by adopting the Harbor Mixed Use Transit
Corridor Specific Plan within the 2006–2014 planning period. However, the City
determined that the importance of the project and the need for extensive public
outreach warranted more time and the project timeline was extended. Adoption of
the specific plan is expected in early 2014 (Program 19). These 201 units must be
accommodated through land rezoned exclusively for residential development. A
breakdown of the rezoning completed and affordable projects constructed
between 2009 and 2012 is provided in Table C-2.

In September 2013, the City updated its 2008 field survey of underutilized land
with the potential for redevelopment. (Note that this survey does not apply to
vacant land.) The survey addressed four site characteristics:
    Building maintenance, including the condition of structural elements, roof
     materials, doors, and windows.
    Building aesthetics, including the types of materials, architectural style, and
     placement of structures on the lot.
    Site landscaping, including the condition of plants, amount or absence of
     landscaping, and presence of automatic irrigation.
    Parking lot, including the condition and type of impermeable surface, amount of
     parking provided, and presence/condition of walls or fences.
The survey ranked each characteristic on a four-point scale: no deterioration (four
points); minor deterioration (three points), moderate deterioration (two points),
substantial deterioration (one point), and dilapidated conditions (zero points).
The values assigned for the four characteristics were then summed and averaged
to create a score. In general, sites with an average score of less than 3.0 are
considered to be in need of moderate or substantial rehabilitation.
The redevelopment potential of each site, however, is influenced by other factors,
such as the age of the structure, proximity to other sites in need of rehabilitation,
and the I/L ratio. In particular, the age of the structure is an important indicator.
Structures built 30 or more years ago are more likely to need significant
rehabilitation or structural repairs (e.g., seismic retrofitting). These needs can
increase the costs of maintaining and upgrading a site to the point where it can be
more profitable to sell and/or redevelop the site.
The following analysis demonstrates how the City can accommodate its RHNA

the Harbor Mixed Use Transit Corridor. The information is presented for each

METRO EAST OVERLAY
Introduction
The City of Santa Ana adopted the Metro East Mixed Use (MEMU) Overlay
Zone in 2007 to facilitate the development of a vibrant urban village with a
balance of professional office, mixed-use and live-work, commercial, retail, and
recreational uses connected by highly amenitized pedestrian linkages. The plan
proposes three mixed-use districts and supporting policies and programs to
facilitate an ultimate buildout of 5,551 residential units.
The City has identified 21 acres of underutilized land that could accommodate a
minimum of 964 units. These sites were chosen based on their vacant status or
highly underutilized nature, recent residential development interest expressed for
several of these parcels, historical location within a former redevelopment project
area, proximity to transit lines, and general site characteristics.
Exhibit C-1 and Table C-3 provide an illustration of sites in the MEMU Overlay
Zone area and a breakdown of their residential development potential.
Adequate Sites Analysis
The MEMU Overlay Zone applies to all of the properties listed in Table C-3. All
of the properties are included in the Active Urban District. No zoning or general
plan land use designation changes would be required to develop the sites.
Moreover, the MEMU Overlay Zone allows residential development as a by-right
use provided the project conforms to the vision, objectives, and standards set forth
in the MEMU. The residential development must obtain a Site Plan Review
application approved by the Planning Commission, which makes specific findings
that the project is consistent with the MEMU. The following sites could
accommodate residential development:
Site 1 is an 8.2-acre vacant site, owned by a single entity, and available for
development. It is adjacent to the I-5 and a high-rise office complex. Site 2 is a
12.9-acre collection of five adjacent parcels that contain marginal, abandoned,
and/or underutilized uses. Surrounding uses include an office building, school,
and hotels, while the north side contains low-scale offices and commercial uses.
Sites 2a and 2b comprise 5.6 acres and are owned by a single entity. The large site
size and single ownership make this site particularly advantageous for
development, as consolidation would not be necessary. Structures on Sites 2b–2e
are or will soon be over 40 years old, and may be ready to transition to other uses.
Although the I/L ratio appears high, the prospect of residential development
could justify higher land values and incentivize development.

Capacity Analysis
The maximum intensity permitted by the MEMU Overlay Zone is a floor area
ratio (FAR) of 3.0, as determined by the District Center General Plan land use
designation and the MEMU development standards. Although converting FAR
terms to density (units per acre) can vary depending on unit sizes, the maximum
residential density would be approximately 98 units per acre. Additionally, a
minimum density is dictated by the requirement that every development within
the Active Urban District must be at least three stories, which would generally
yield a minimum of 25–30 units per acre.
The MEMU area is expected to build out at an average density of 45–60 units per
acre based on building prototypes and vision in the MEMU Overlay Zone. Recent
developer interest in the potential sites envisioned projects built at higher
densities of at least 72 units per acre, indicating that an expected minimum
density of 45 units per acre is realistic and feasible. Developers have also expressed
interest in redeveloping other portions of the MEMU area at densities of 84 units
per acre—including sites with existing nonresidential development—further

demonstrating the viability of these sites.
In conformity with Section 65583.2(c)(3)(b) of the California Government Code,
the identified sites are zoned so they allow at least 30 units per acre and therefore
have the capacity to accommodate lower income housing.
Financial Feasibility Analysis
Although the MEMU allows for both residential and nonresidential development,
its policies and development standards expressly encourage and facilitate the
development of higher density housing. The MEMU could accommodate more
than 5,000 units. Flexible development standards allow a variety of housing types
and sizes to meet a range of housing needs and enhance the financial feasibility of
developing new residential projects.
Development within the MEMU area is subject to the City’s Housing
Opportunity Ordinance. This ordinance requires that at least 15 percent of the
units in an eligible ownership project be set aside as affordable to moderate
income households for at least 45 years. For eligible rental projects, at least 15
percent must be affordable to very low or lower income households for at least 55
years. Additionally, per Program 28, the City will revise its current state density
bonus ordinance to reflect changes in state law. The amount of density bonus
could range from 20 to 35 percent, depending on the amount by which the
percentage of affordable housing units proposed in a project exceeds the
minimum percentage established in state law. Eligible projects may also receive
one to three concessions or other development incentives, depending on the
proportion of affordable units and level of income targeting.
Summary Assessment
The 21 acres of land discussed herein are excellent candidates for new housing.
The MEMU vision is to create a district center that contains residential/mixed-use
and supports a vibrant employment center. The 964-unit capacity projected for
the planning period is realistic, representing less than 20 percent of the total
buildout for the area. The average density threshold of 45 units per acre is
realistic; it is based on developer interest and First Look applications. The
MEMU also has flexible development standards, by right residential/mixed use
subject to conformance review, and location within a redevelopment project area.
Taken together, the 21 acres identified in the MEMU are likely candidates for
residential development in the planning period.
HARBOR MIXED USE TRANSIT CORRIDOR SPECIFIC PLAN
Introduction
The Harbor Mixed Use Transit Corridor Specific Plan (Harbor Corridor Plan)
will be adopted in early 2014. The section of north Harbor Boulevard guided by
this specific plan is a gateway to Santa Ana. Orange County’s first bus rapid
transit service (Bravo! BRT operated by OCTA), opened Route 543 along Harbor
Boulevard in June 2013, with two more BRT lines (Bristol/State College and
C-10                             CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT

                                                                  HOUSING RESOURCES
Westminster/17th Street) expected to open in the coming years. A combination of
vacant and underutilized land, current and future transit improvements, and
nearby freeway access makes Harbor Boulevard an ideal candidate for new
residential development opportunities.
The City has identified a potential of up to 4,600 units that could be built on 305
acres of land along Harbor Boulevard. While this plan guides and emphasizes
mixed-use development, the plan contains a policy that requires at least 10.1 acres
of land be zoned exclusively for residential to accommodate all income levels of
housing. The plan’s focus on transit supports higher-density uses at transit nodes,
with lower densities serving as transitions to adjacent existing residential
neighborhoods.
Exhibit C-2 depicts the draft Harbor Corridor Plan land use districts, along with
candidate sites that could be set aside exclusively for residential development.
Table C-4 provides property characteristics for each candidate site. The Harbor
Corridor Plan will identify the final sites to be set aside exclusively for residential
development.
Adequate Sites Analysis
The City has identified residential/mixed use potential on all 305 acres of vacant
and underutilized lands within the specific plan boundaries. Program 19
identifies the area as a key corridor for transit-oriented residential and
employment opportunities. The Harbor Corridor Plan allows for a variety of
housing types, including live-work, care homes, single dwelling, and multifamily
units.
The majority of land along the corridor contains underutilized auto and
commercial sites with approximately 740 existing residential units. The area is
also home to a mobile-home community. Multiple developers have expressed
interest in building residential projects within the project area and there is already
one residential development in the pipeline expected to be constructed in 2014
(see Table C-2). This project will add 70 new units to the specific plan area, with
69 units restricted to lower income households.
Environmental and Infrastructure Analysis
The Harbor Corridor Plan will be supported by a programmatic environmental
impact report. The draft technical studies prepared in 2013 made the following
conclusions about new development under the Plan. Overall, the draft studies
found minimal environmental or infrastructure constraints on new development
in the project area. Any improvements identified are relatively small and localized
and would not create a significant constraint to the development of new housing.
    Existing sewer infrastructure within the Harbor Corridor Plan is deficient based
CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT                                    C-11

HOUSING RESOURCES
     on Orange County Sanitation District depth of flow versus diameter
     requirements. However, the Harbor Corridor Plan does not generate enough
     wastewater to pose a significant impact to the existing infrastructure. Calculations
     have shown that the Harbor Corridor Plan will add an additional 1-5% to existing
     flows. A small number of pipes that are over capacity may need to be upsized prior
     to development of the Harbor Corridor Plan. New development will be
     responsible for their fair share of infrastructure improvements.
    Existing water supply and pipe sizes are adequate to accommodate the Harbor
     Corridor Plan according to the City’s 2010 Urban Water Management Plan.
    The Harbor Corridor Plan would add additional impervious area to the corridor.
     The majority of this will come from developing the vacant lots. The additional
     impervious area will add an additional 15% to existing flows. While this is not a
     significant impact to the existing storm drain system, a previous 1993 report (Boyle
     Engineering Report) concluded that the existing system is deficient and unable to
     convey the current runoffs. The recommendations made in the Boyle Engineering
     Report would need to be implemented in order to convey existing runoff as well as
     future flows from the Harbor Corridor Plan. New development will be
     responsible for their fair share of infrastructure improvements.
Capacity Analysis
Densities in the specific plan area range from 5 to 50 dwelling units per acre. At
least 10.1 acres will be designated exclusively for multifamily residential
development by right at a minimum density of 20 units per acre (202 total units).
Recent developer interest in residential sites includes conceptual residential
projects at 20 and 31 units per acre, demonstrating the feasibility of residential
projects in the area.
Financial Feasibility Analysis
Mixed use and residential development is financially feasible for development
along north Harbor Boulevard. The specific plan area could accommodate more
than 4,600 units. The plan’s development standards allow a variety of housing
types and sizes to meet housing needs while providing flexibility to respond to the
market—keeping projects financially feasible for developers.
As a part of the Harbor Corridor Plan outreach strategy, the City led a developer
roundtable to obtain input from the development community on the feasibility of
introducing residential into the project area. Developers cited the combination of
available vacant and underutilized land with current and future transit
connections as key reasons why affordable and market rate housing could be built
along the corridor.
Development within the Harbor Corridor Plan area is subject to the City’s
Housing Opportunity Ordinance. This ordinance requires that at least 15 percent
of the units in an eligible ownership project be set aside as affordable to moderate
income households for at least 45 years. For eligible rental projects, at least 15
percent must be affordable to very low or lower income households for at least 55
years.

As outlined in Program 28, the City will revise its density bonus ordinance to
reflect changes in state law. The amount of density bonus could range from 20 to
35 percent, depending on the amount by which the percentage of affordable
housing units proposed in a project exceeds the minimum percentage established
in state law. Eligible projects may also receive one to three concessions or other
development incentives, depending on the proportion of affordable units and level
of income targeting.
Summary Assessment
Nearly all 305 acres of the Harbor Corridor Plan could potentially accommodate
new housing, and dozens of acres are currently vacant or extremely underutilized
(e.g., vacant buildings). A little more than 10 acres of land within the Harbor
Corridor Plan will be set aside exclusively for residential use by right at a
minimum density of 20 units per acre. Given the Plan’s potential to support up to
4,600 units and current interest from the development community, it is reasonable
to assume that at least 500 units of new housing at densities around 20 to 30 units
per acre could be built along the corridor within the planning period. The Harbor
Corridor Plan will also have flexible development standards that promote “active
living”, by-right residential/mixed use subject to conformance review, and
proximity to current and future BRT and Fixed Guideway improvements.

structures (generally from 35 to 45 years old) and site conditions (most are below      SARTC

are ideal for lot consolidation, which would create several parcels that would
exceed an acre. Larger lot sizes can help facilitate residential/mixed uses that
incorporate quality design features, amenities, and adequate on-site project
management. Affordable developers also tend to want at least one acre to
construct projects.

Environmental and Infrastructure Analysis
The transit corridors have not had detailed environmental analysis of water and
sewer capacity. Thus, the latest information comes from the City’s 2010 Urban
Water Management Plan, 2003 Sewer Master Plan, and City Engineering staff.
The following conclusions are cited from these sources.
   The 2010 Urban Water Management Plan states that available and projected
    water supplies can continue to meet the City’s imported water needs until the year
    2035. The plan did not identify deficient service areas or water lines along the
    corridors that would preclude the development of these corridors, although the
    plan anticipates continued commercial development .
   For each corridor area, most of the larger trunk sewers appear to have adequate
    capacity to serve potential residential development. However, due to the large
    overall number of apartments proposed in some areas, the increase in sewer flows
    could be significant when compared to existing commercial uses. Sewer studies
    should be performed for each location to determine the impacts on existing trunk
    sewers before a project is approved.
   For the Fifth Street corridor, the existing 12-inch sewer in Fifth Street is shown to
    be near capacity in the City’s Sewer Master Plan model. This specific sewer
    should be studied to determine if upsizing is required.
   For the First Street corridor, the existing sewer mains in First Street and McClay
    Street are old and may require replacement. These sewer mains need to be studied
    to determine the impact of proposed developments.
   Other smaller local sewers in each area may also require replacement or upsizing
    due to capacity deficiencies and/or conditions. These lines should also be studied
    prior to approval of any projects.
The presence of environmental constraints for Fifth and First Streets parcels are
unknown at this time. Along Fifth Street, which contains a number of industrial
parcels, the potential for environmental contamination is more likely. The
transportation infrastructure supports residential development along these
corridors. Sites along Fifth Street are adjacent to the Pacific Electric right-of-way,
which is envisioned as a multimodal transportation opportunity.
As required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the
redesignation of sites along First Street and Fifth Street will require the
preparation of environmental documentation that clarifies the impact of
residential/mixed uses to infrastructure, the existence of any environmental
constraints, and programs to mitigate impacts as required.
Capacity Analysis
In conformity with Section 65583.2(c)(3)(b) of the California Government Code,
the identified sites are zoned to allow at least 30 units per acre and are therefore
considered to have the capacity to accommodate lower income housing. Programs
20 and 21 of the Framework describe the City’s plan to create a new general plan

                               residential/mixed-use development standards for housing along these major

                               Opportunity Ordinance. This ordinance requires that at least 15 percent of the
                               units in an eligible ownership project be set aside as affordable to moderate
                               income households for at least 45 years. For eligible rental projects, at least 15
                               percent must be affordable to very low or lower income households for at least 55
                               years.

The Residential/Mixed Use zoning district could facilitate lot consolidation by
offering progressively higher densities based on lot size and percentage of
affordable units provided. The standards could facilitate the consolidation of sites
into larger projects at higher densities, which lowers development costs, improves
financial feasibility, and encourages affordable housing. Should additional
flexibility be needed, developers could request modification of a variety of
development standards to facilitate the project for properties with special
circumstances (lot size, topography, location of surroundings, etc.).
Per Program 28, the City will revise its current density bonus ordinance to reflect
recent changes in state law. The amount of a density bonus could range from 20
percent to up to 35 percent, depending on the amount by which the percentage of
affordable housing committed to be provided exceeds the minimum percentage
established in state law. Eligible projects may also receive one to three regulatory
concessions or other development incentives, depending on the proportion of
affordable units and level of income targeting.
Program 30 states that the City will work with employers to produce a
demonstration workforce housing project and advocate for favorable legislation
that incentivizes the production of such housing. The underused land along the
transit corridors, with its proximity to transit systems, employment centers, and
freeway access, is among many potential locations for workforce housing. Finally,
the developments could qualify as categorically exempt under Section 15332 of
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), further expediting
development processing time and reducing entitlement costs.
Summary Assessment
In summary, the transit corridors offer significant opportunities for residential
development, including affordable housing, within the housing element period.
Through the upcoming General Plan and Zoning Ordinance update, the City
may draft and adopt residential/mixed-use development and design standards to
facilitate and encourage voluntary lot consolidation. If applied to these corridors,
new land use designations and the encouragement of lot consolidation could
provide the potential for up to 1,195 units on 40 acres of vacant and underutilized
land. Developers have continually expressed interest in building housing along
these corridors, particularly the East First Street corridor. With new general plan
designation, zoning, and residential/mixed-use standards, these sites could offer
excellent opportunities for development.
TRANSIT ZONING CODE
Introduction
The City adopted the Transit Zoning Code (TZC) in 2010. The TZC guides
development in the central urban core of Santa Ana and consists of more than 450
acres of land. Recent developments in this area highlight the opportunities for
both affordable and market rate residential projects. Projects such as Triada
Garden and Triada Court provide 98 new units affordable to very low incomes in
CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT                                  C-27
HOUSING RESOURCES
the Urban Neighborhood zone of the TZC. Additionally, the proposed Depot at
Santiago project (see Table C-2) will add 70 new units, with 69 units restricted to
lower income households.
The TZC was also designed to provide the zoning necessary to support the long-
term development of a transit program. The integration of a new transit
infrastructure and infill development will strengthen existing neighborhoods and
allow for a mix of uses and a variety of housing types. The TZC could
accommodate up to 4,075 housing units.
Adequate Sites Analysis
The TZC has the necessary general plan land use designation and zoning to
support the development of new housing. Multiple-family housing is permitted
by right within all zones covered by the TZC. The City has identified the
potential for 1,176 units on approximately 72 acres in the TZC area. There is
opportunity for redevelopment or recycling of land with Downtown, Urban
Neighborhood 2, Urban Core, and Transit Village designations. Many of these
parcels are also in an Industrial Overlay Zone. The majority of these
underutilized parcels contain industrial and auto storage uses with an I/L ratio
less than 1.0. In some cases, individual sites may not have a low I/L ratio, but are
viable for development when consolidated with adjacent sites.
Much of the TZC area is suitable for housing at densities of at least 20 units per
acre. As mentioned above, recent residential projects demonstrate the ability of the
TZC to accommodate 50 percent of the City’s remaining 2006–2014 RHNA on
underutilized sites (494 units—see Table C-2). Underutilized sites on 26 acres in
this area have sufficient capacity to accommodate 530 units by right at 20 units an
acre with sites large enough accommodate a minimum of 16 units. Additional
units could be accommodated on vacant or underutilized parcels through lot
consolidation of adjacent parcels within sites 3 and 4 (See Table C-7).
Due to recent development and continued developer interest in this area the City
has counted the potential for 500 units within the TZC toward the 2014-2021
RHNA. The City’s Housing Opportunity Ordinance applies to the properties
within the TZC area designated within an Industrial Overlay Zone. Large parcel
sizes, the opportunity for lot consolidation, and underutilized uses make this area
attractive for both market rate and affordable housing projects.
Exhibit C-5 and Table C-7 provide an illustration and development potential of
the TZC.

Environmental and Infrastructure Analysis
The area of Santa Ana covered under the TZC is in one of the oldest parts of the
community. Various infrastructure systems, such as the sewer system, date back to
the early 1920s. As part of the technical studies for the TZC, significant
infrastructure improvements were identified for the 20-year buildout horizon. As
part of the project, the EIR for the Transit Zoning Code (2010) detailed the
potential environmental and infrastructure impacts of the project and
implementation measures to address the presence of any impacts. The TZC EIR
indicates that future development of the code:
   would not be constrained by any significant biological, seismic, geological, or
    hazard constraints (TZC EIR, Sections 4.3 and 4.5).
   could alter the existing drainage pattern and potentially result in increased
    downstream flooding through the addition of impervious surfaces, or exceeding
    the capacity of existing or planed stormwater drainage systems, additional
    mitigation will be necessary (TZC EIR, Sections 4.6)
   would not require or result in the construction of new water treatment facilities,
    the expansion of existing water treatment facilities, or the expansion of the existing
    network of water lines (TZC EIR Sections 4.12.1-4.12.4).
   would not increase wastewater generation such that treatment facilities would be
    inadequate to serve the projected demand in addition to the provider’s existing
    commitments (TZC EIR Sections 4.12.5–4.12.9).
To address the needed improvements to and/or replacement of infrastructure, the
City’s practice is to require all developers to pay a pro rata share of the costs to
improve or replace the infrastructure. This is in addition to the on and offsite
improvements that are required under the Municipal Code (Article III) to serve
individual projects. These included rehabilitation of existing asphalt pavement;
installation of new water, sewer, and storm drain lines; installation of a fixed-rail
system (trolley); and enhanced bicycle and pedestrian routes.
Capacity Analysis
A fundamental goal of the code is to facilitate a variety of form-based housing
choices that may include lofts, live-work buildings, courtyard housing, rowhouses,
and other types of multiple-family housing. This diverse mix of rental and
ownership housing can provide opportunities for housing affordable to all income
levels. Some sites are anticipated to be multiple-family projects at 25–45 units per
acre, with other sites building townhouses and single-family detached products at
7–15 units per acre. Overall, the density mix will likely average between 20 and 30
units per acre.
Financial Feasibility Analysis
The City has a variety of policies and programs to facilitate affordable housing.
City ownership of land can greatly facilitate the production of affordable housing
by eliminating the cost of land acquisition and reducing the time needed to obtain
and finance loans. Policy HE-2.8 of the Framework directs the City to maximize

affordable housing on Authority-owned properties that is high quality,
sustainable, and available to various income levels.
Development with an Industrial Overlay in the TZC area is subject to the City’s
Housing Opportunity Ordinance. This ordinance requires that at least 15 percent
of the units in an eligible ownership project be set aside as affordable to moderate
income households for at least 45 years. For eligible rental projects, at least 15
percent must be affordable to very low or lower income households for at least 55
years.
Per Program 28, the City will revise its current density bonus ordinance to reflect
recent changes in state law. The density bonus could range from 20 to 35 percent,
depending on the amount by which the percentage of affordable housing
committed to be provided exceeds the minimum percentage established in state
law. Eligible projects may receive one to three regulatory concessions or other
development incentives, depending on the proportion of affordable units and level
of income targeting. Finally, the developments could qualify as categorically
exempt under Section 15332 of CEQA, expediting development processing time
and reducing entitlement costs.
Summary Assessment
In total, the projects developed in the area covered by the TZC have access to
incentives to facilitate residential development, including affordable housing,
within the housing element planning period. Given the TZC’s potential to
support up to 4,075 units (including 1,176 units identified in Table C-7) and
current interest from the development community, it is reasonable to assume that
at least 500 units of new housing at densities around 20 to 30 units per acre could
be built in the City’s central urban core within the planning period. The
combination of the code’s flexible development standards, streamlined permitting
process and by-right development, intense urban vision, recent development
interest, and continued development interest make sites within the TZC likely
candidates for residential development within the planning period.

                              HOUSING PRESERVATION
                              The City of Santa Ana has a significant amount of affordable housing that
                              receives public subsidies in return for long-term affordability controls. Typically,
                              these residential projects provide units affordable to extremely low, very low, and
                              low income households, including persons with special needs. Some of the
                              projects maintain their eligibility in perpetuity. The majority of projects, however,
                              are restricted for 15–55 years, after which they can begin charging market rate
                              rents. Housing units eligible to change from lower income housing to market-rate
                              housing during the planning period (2014–2021) are of immediate concern to the
                              City and its residents.
                              Chart C-1     Affordable Housing Projects
                              State law requires that housing elements include an analysis of “assisted multiple-
                              family housing” projects regarding their eligibility to change from low income
                              housing to market rates by 2024 (10 years from the start of the planning period).
                              Assisted housing is multiple-family rental housing that receives government

                           HOUSING RESOURCES
                           EVALUATION OF PRESERVATION OPTIONS
                           Table C-8 shows that 798 housing units are at risk of conversion by the end of the
                           planning period (2021), and an additional 82 could convert within 10 years of the
                           start of the planning period (2024). This section analyzes four options to preserve
                           affordable units: 1) replacement of rent subsidies, 2) construction of new
                           affordable housing, 3) rehabilitation of units in return for extended affordability
                           controls; and 4) refinance of the project.
                           Replacement of Rent Subsidies
                           The first option is to replace the HUD rental vouchers given to each tenant (in
                           the case of portable vouchers) or the payment subsidies given to each property
                           owner when properties receive project Section 8 certificates. The financial cost of
                           replacing subsidies depends on the fair market rent for the apartment and the
                           household income level of the tenant. Typically, the subsidy would equal the
                           difference between what a household can afford to pay (e.g., 30 percent of income
                           after utility payments) and the fair market rent for the unit.
                           As shown in Table C-9, replacing the rental subsidies would total $6.8 million

                            1HUD Orange County Fair Market Rent, 2013.
                            2The affordable rent is based on the maximum payment for a very low income household and adjusted for
                            household size, as derived from income limits provided by the State of California, 2013.
                            Utilities are estimated at a minimum of $125 per month plus $25 per each additional person. Figures are subject
                            to rounding.
                           This option assumes the property owner accepts a subsidy that guarantees fair
                           market rent. In some cases, property owners may decline. Although this subsidy
                           would guarantee the long-term affordability of the unit, the cost could increase
                           over time as market pressures push rents higher and require the City to increase
                           the rental subsidies. Generally, this option is seen as a short-term fix to a long-
                           term problem, not considered a sustainable solution.

New Construction
The second option is to replace at-risk affordable units with new housing.
Replacing an affordable project typically involves new construction. The project
would require finding suitable sites zoned for multiple-family uses, purchasing
available vacant or underutilized land, negotiating with a developer, funding the
project, and managing other costs associated with building new housing. Table C-
10 shows that the replacement cost of all 880 units ranges from $165–$240million.

Acquisition and/or Rehabilitation
In recent years, Santa Ana has pursued a proactive strategy of acquiring and
rehabilitating apartments to eliminate blighted conditions, improve the health
and safety of the units, and stabilize surrounding neighborhoods. Four recent
examples are the Minnie Street, Ross and Durant, Sixth Street, and Townsend
and Raitt projects. The rehabilitation work costs between $55,000 and $85,000 per
unit. However, if unit reconfiguration is required (e.g., combining studios into
family units), the cost could range from $75,000 to $120,000 per unit.
Table C-11 estimates the costs of acquisition and rehabilitation of apartments.                   Recent Acquisition and
The 880 units of affordable senior and family apartment units are anticipated to                  Rehabilitation Project
cost approximately $48 to $74 million to rehabilitate, preserve, and extend
affordability controls. If acquisition and rehabilitation are required, the total cost
would increase to between $65 and $105 million.

               Affordable Housing Refinancing
               The City or the Santa Ana Housing Authority could offer incentives for property
               owners to refinance their mortgage in return for continuation of income
               restrictions on units. Either agency could issue tax exempt bonds for the refinance
               or purchase of properties with expiring use restrictions. This strategy has been
               successfully used for numerous new construction and rehabilitation housing
               projects throughout Santa Ana.
Wycliffe Plaza Wycliffe Plaza is a recent example of the issuance of mortgage revenue and tax-
               exempt bonds to finance the acquisition and rehabilitation of multifamily rental
               housing. This financing structure preserved 200 dwelling units, of which 140
               were affordable. This extended the project affordability requirements. Other
               projects might be excellent candidates for bond refinancing or similar
               mechanisms to restructure outstanding loans. The success of the refinancing
               option depends on the financial incentives to the owner. If bond structures allow
               for interest rates well below the rates on the initial mortgage, the owner will have
               an incentive to refinance. If the City’s lower interest rates are not competitive, this
               option becomes less feasible.
               Summary
               As noted above, the City has used nearly every one of these options to preserve or
               replace affordable housing that has converted to market rates. The particular
               option that is most suitable and affordable depends on the real estate market, the
               property owner’s intentions, the condition of the property, and a wide range of
               other conditions. The key in choosing a strategy is to have advanced knowledge of
               the status of the project so that creative solutions can be devised to not only
               preserve the units, but do so in a manner that achieves the City’s housing
               production goals set forth by the RHNA mandate.

                                                                   HOUSING RESOURCES
Program Efforts to Preserve At-Risk Units
The following housing programs have been developed to address the preservation
of assisted units eligible to convert from affordable to market rate. The Santa Ana
Housing Authority will be responsible for implementing the programs. Funding
for implementation could be provided through funding sources cited above.
    Monitoring At-Risk Units. The City will maintain contact with owners of at-
     risk units. For at-risk projects, the City will communicate to the owners the
     importance of the units to the supply of affordable housing in Santa Ana as
     well as its desire to preserve the units as affordable. The City will confirm that
     the owners of at-risk projects will continue their Section 8 contracts, and will
     determine whether HUD will offer the owners a contract extension.
    Financial Assistance. If federal funds for the Section 8 program are
     discontinued at some point and other methods to preserve the at-risk units
     fail, the City will determine if it can assign financial resources to preserve the
     units. This option could include issuing bonds or holding TEFRA hearings
     that are the prerequisite for issuing multiple-family revenue bonds.
    Technical Assistance. The City can assist the owners of properties eligible for
     conversion to market rates in seeking funds and completing other tasks
     necessary to secure funds that preserve the affordability of housing. Based on
     information gathered through the monitoring program and visitation
     program, the City will dedicate staff resources to work with property owners.
    Preservation of Units. The Santa Ana Housing Division has identified
     several affordable projects at imminent risk of conversion. City staff will work
     with the property owners to explore opportunities to preserve the long-term
     affordability of the projects.
    Identify and Work with Qualified Entities. The City has close working
     relationships with numerous nonprofit entities, for-profit organizations, and
     developers who may be interested in acquiring and/or managing units at risk
     of conversion. HCD also lists a number of qualified agencies interested in
     managing affordable housing in Orange County and other counties
     throughout California. The City will consult the list of qualified entities to
     expand its administrative capacity to preserve affordable housing.
Housing element law requires that cities establish the maximum number of units
that can be preserved over the planning period. Based on objectives stated in the
Consolidated Plan and this housing element, the City’s objective is to preserve all
at-risk units where feasible, pending funding availability. Through
implementation of Program 37, the City will allocate technical and financial
resources to preserve at-risk housing units in Santa Ana.

HOUSING RESOURCES
FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR HOUSING
Federal, state, local, and private programs are available to fund and/or subsidize
the construction of new housing, preservation of existing affordable housing,
maintenance of neighborhoods, and rehabilitation of housing. The following
summarizes some of the major sources and amounts of funds available.
FEDERAL RESOURCES
Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers
Housing Choice Vouchers is a federal rental assistance program that provides a
subsidy to very low income families, individuals, seniors, and the disabled.
Participants pay 30 percent of their adjusted income toward rent. The Santa Ana
Housing Authority pays the balance of rent to property owners and administers
the program. Housing vouchers can be used for any housing that meets the
requirements of the program—it is not limited to units located in subsidized
housing projects. Funds available in 2013/2014 total $27,541,014.
Community Development Block Grants (CDBG)
The CDBG program is a federal entitlement program awarded to Santa Ana on a
formula basis. The objectives are to fund housing activities and expand economic
opportunities. Projects must benefit low and moderate income persons, aid in the
prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or meet other urgent needs. Eligible
activities include property acquisition, rehabilitation, preservation, economic
development, code enforcement, public facilities, and public services. Funds
available in 2013/2014 total $5,680,480.
HOME Investment Partnership
HOME is a federal grant to expand the supply of decent, safe, and sanitary
affordable housing. HOME is designed as a partnership program between the
federal, state, and local governments; nonprofit; and for-profit housing entities to
finance, build, rehabilitate, and manage housing for lower income owners and
renters. Eligible activities include multiple-family unit acquisition and
rehabilitation, single-family unit rehabilitation, and nonprofit affordable housing
entity assistance. Funds available in 2013/2014 total $1,228,217.

Emergency Shelter Grant
The federal Emergency Shelter Grant program is available for projects serving
homeless people. Annual grant funds are allocated on a formula basis to assist
with the provision of shelter and social services for the homeless. Eligible activities
include the rehabilitation/remodeling of a building used as a new shelter,
operation and maintenance of the facility, supportive services, and homeless
prevention. Funds available in 2013/2014 total $538,354.
Neighborhood Stabilization
The Neighborhood Stabilization Program provides funding to cities with high
foreclosure problems and risk of property abandonment. The program permits
cities to buy foreclosed homes at a discount and rehabilitate or redevelop them.
Grants can be used to acquire land and property; demolish or rehabilitate
abandoned properties; offer down payment and closing cost assistance to low to
moderate income homebuyers; and create "land banks" to assemble, temporarily
manage, and dispose of vacant land for the purpose of stabilizing neighborhoods
and encouraging reuse or redevelopment of urban property.
In FY 2013/2014, the City has received $2,952,558 in funding for this program.
Funds will be used as follows:
    Down payment assistance
    Single-family home acquisition and rehabilitation
    Condominiums and historic home acquisition and rehabilitation
    Acquisition and rehabilitation of rental housing
    Redevelopment
Low Income Housing Tax Credits
The federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program provides tax credits to
individuals and corporations that invest in low income rental housing. Tax credits
are sold to corporations and people with high tax liability, and proceeds are used
to create housing. Eligible activities include new construction, rehabilitation, and
acquisition of multiple-family rental projects. Several projects in the community
have used these funds for rehabilitation purposes. Typically, affordable housing
developers seek to utilize this source of funding.
PRIVATE RESOURCES
Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae)
Fannie Mae provides financial resources through a variety of programs, including
the Community Home Buyer Program (fixed-rate mortgages), the Community
Home Improvement Mortgage Program (mortgages for purchase and
rehabilitation of a home), and the Fannie Neighbor Program (low down-payment
mortgages for the purchase of single-family homes for underserved low income
minorities).

ppendix D.Program Evaluation
          This chapter describes progress in meeting objectives set forth during the 2006–
          2014 Housing Element planning period which, in combination with the public
          outreach appendix, summarizes new initiatives proposed.
          OVERVIEW
          State law requires that housing elements contain an evaluation of current housing
          programs and their success in meeting the objectives set forth in the 2006–2014
          Housing Element. The purpose is to provide a sound basis for the development of
          new or modified housing programs for the present housing element that will
          better address the community's housing needs.
          The 2006–2014 Housing Element set forth a housing vision, four goals, and
          supporting policies to guide actions with respect to housing:
             Promote livable neighborhoods through quality housing conditions, quality
              parks and community services, and well-maintained infrastructure that
              inspire neighborhood pride.
             Provide a diversity of quality housing, affordability levels, and living
              experiences that accommodate Santa Ana’s residents and workforce of all
              household types, income levels, and age groups to foster an inclusive
              community.
             Increase opportunities for low and moderate income individuals and families
              to find quality housing, including move-up opportunities, and afford a
              greater choice of rental or homeownership opportunities.
             Provide adequate rental and homeownership housing opportunities and
              supportive services suitable for seniors, people with disabilities, families with
              children, and people needing emergency, transitional, or supportive housing.
          This appendix contains a concise description of progress toward each goal and the
          appropriateness of programs for the 2014–2021 Housing Element. More detailed
          information can be found in the City’s annual housing reports prepared for
          HCD, HUD, and other reporting entities.

                                   GOAL 1: HOUSING IMPROVEMENT
                                   As an established, built-out city, Santa Ana faced significant housing challenges
                                   during the 2000s. One such challenge continued to be the improvement of its
                                   aging housing stock. The City had many single-family, multiple-family, and
                                   mobile home units that required maintenance, rehabilitation, or replacement.
                                   Many were built before the City instituted new design/development standards and
                                   thus were too small, lacked desired amenities, and needed adequate parking.
                                   Overcrowding and public safety concerns also contributed to poor conditions.
                                   The 2006–2014 Housing Element thus set forth the goal to improve housing
                                   conditions through a menu of housing rehabilitation programs. This included
                                   single-family homes, apartments, and mobile home units. Moreover, as part of
                                   this effort, the City implemented programs to acquire, substantially rehabilitate,

                                   reported progress since adoption by the City Council. Sources used include the
                                   federal Consolidated Annual Performance Evaluation Report (CAPER), HCD
                                   Annual Progress Report, and NSP progress reports. In just three years, the City
                                   has achieved all of its objectives for rehabilitation set forth in the housing element.
                                   Covered later in this appendix but not summarized below, the City of Santa Ana
                                   was also successful in rehabilitating 73 single-family homes and 77 apartment
                                   units with federal funds under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. All of
                                   these additional achievements included both acquisition and rehabilitation.

Housing Rehabilitation
The 2006–2014 Housing Element proposed a menu of housing rehabilitation
programs to improve the conditions of housing. As mentioned earlier, the City
achieved all its objectives within three years. In addition, the City successfully
competed for over $17 million in three neighborhood stabilization grants. This
infusion of federal funding allowed the City to rehabilitate more than 150 housing
units, including substantial acquisition and rehabilitation projects.
Neighborhood Programs
The 2006–2014 Housing Element also proposed a menu of neighborhood
programs to help revitalize and stabilize residential neighborhoods in the City.
From 2007 through 2012, more than $72 million dollars have been expended to
repave, slurry seal, and reconstruct local streets. The City continues to empower
neighborhoods through the Communication Linkage Forum and Community
Development Resource Network. A significant accomplishment was the
implementation of healthy community efforts, including initiatives led by the
California Endowment.
Code Enforcement
                                                                                        This home is the 2007 winner of

welfare. In 2014/2015, the City anticipates restoring staffing levels to this program.
Historic Preservation
 City staff continues to work with residents and established neighborhoods to
 maintain their unique character, architectural integrity, and aesthetic qualities.
 By applying its citywide design guidelines, Mills Act contracts, adding properties
 to the historic district registry, or working with the Santa Ana Historical

GOAL 2: HOUSING PRODUCTION
A central goal of state housing element law is to facilitate the production of new
housing to accommodate expected increases in population and employment.
Every five years, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
issues housing goals for each city in the region as part of the Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA). Santa Ana was assigned a goal of developing
sufficient capacity to accommodate 3,393 units (divided into four affordability
levels) for the period covering 2006–2014.
The City of Santa Ana set forth programs to facilitate and encourage the
production of and generate capacity for housing commensurate with the 2006–
2014 RHNA goals. Table D-3 summarizes progress toward the RHNA goals
through actual housing production. This includes affordable housing produced
during the period as well as a portion of the acquisition, rehabilitation, and/or                                       Birch Street Courtyards.
preservation of at-risk projects completed to the extent allowed under current
state law.
The City’s efforts to address the RHNA came during a volatile period—loss of
RDA funds, reduction in every federal and state funding, large staffing cuts in
every City department, and also the foreclosure crisis. Moreover, although state
law allows counting the acquisition, rehabilitation, and preservation of affordable
housing, the strict timing for the contracts (first two years of the planning period)
eliminates the credit deserved for many outstanding projects from being counted
toward the RHNA. The City made significant progress toward its RHNA
                                                                                                                        California Palms
objectives, building over one-third of its lower income RHNA allocation. The
City also rezoned land to accommodate nearly all of the 1,931-unit balance.

 Notes:
 1. The City of Santa Ana approved the conversion of a motel, California Palms, to a transient/residential hotel.
 These units can be counted toward the RHNA as new construction units. A total of 187 units were deed
 restricted to lower income households.
 2. State law does not allow the counting of acquisition and preservation, substantial rehabilitation, or
 preservation of at-risk units unless such projects are identified and planned for preservation within the first two
 years of the planning period. This precluded numerous projects from counting toward the RHNA.

                                  PROGRAM EVALUATION
                                  Provision of quality, affordable housing was one of the primary goals envisioned
                                  by the 2006–2014 Housing Element and great care was taken to identify sites and
                                  financing to facilitate that effort. The following discussion highlights major
                                  successes since 2006. Table D-4 details progress for action set forth under Goal #2
                                  of the Housing Element.
                                  Identification of Housing Sites
                                  The 2006–2014 Housing Element, built on the Land Use Element by setting
                                  goals, policies, and actions to facilitate development in District Centers and other
                                  infill locations such as transit corridors and the downtown area. During the
                                  planning period, the City adopted the Transit Zoning Code, which covers the area
                                  formerly known as the Renaissance Specific Plan and downtown. The Transit
                                  Zoning Code facilitates a range of housing products with varying levels of
                                  affordability.
                                  The 2006–2014 Housing Element identified several corridors to accommodate
                                  residential development to address its RHNA goals. The City was successful in
The Harbor Mixed Use Transit      securing a SCAG Compass Blueprint grant to update the specific plan for Harbor
Corridor Specific Plan encourages Boulevard (one of three transit corridors). When completed in 2014, the specific
mixed use, transit-oriented       plan will accommodate a balance of commercial uses, mixed uses, and transit-
development.                      oriented developments that can complement the City’s GoLocal Systems and
                                  support economic development along the corridor.
                                  Housing Incentives
                                  Santa Ana adopted several programs to facilitate the development of affordable
                                  housing in the community. In 2011, the City adopted a Housing Opportunity
                                  Ordinance. For eligible ownership projects, at least 15% of the units must be set
                                  aside as affordable to moderate income households for at least 45 years. For
                                  eligible rental projects, at least 15% must be affordable to very low or low income
                                  households for at least 55 years. The Housing Opportunity Ordinance is a model
                                  for other jurisdictions in Orange County seeking to adopt inclusionary
                                  requirements.
                                  After four years of work, the City also adopted the Transit Zoning Code to provide
                                  a transit supportive and pedestrian-oriented environment, opportunities for the
                                  integration of new infill development, a range of affordable housing
                                  opportunities, and the reuse of existing structures. Higher densities, flexible
                                  parking provisions, private open space incentives, and other key features facilitate

Housing Production and Approval
Ultimately, the success of housing programs is reflected in the number of
affordable housing units built, preserved, or rehabilitated. Santa Ana has made
tremendous progress in this regard in just the past three years. Key projects built
or approved during the planning period include:
   Triada Development. This project includes 114 units of new apartments, new
    single-family homes, and rehabilitated homes on single and scattered sites. This
    project was funded with $15 million in RDA funds, a $4 million land donation,
    and low income housing tax credits worth $13.7 million. The project provides
    deed-restricted housing for extremely low and very low income residents for a
    minimum of 55 years. This effort earned Project of the Year Award at the 31
    Annual Affordable Housing Award.
                                                                                      Triada Courtyard is in the Station
   Terraces at Santiago. This project includes 36 two- and three-bedroom units of    District.
    family apartments. It was funded by $7 million in low income housing tax credits,
    and land was acquired with NSP funds, $3.8_ million in RDA funds, and $.2.5
    HOME funds. The project provides deed-restricted housing for extremely low
    and very low income residents for a minimum of 55 years. This effort earned a
    Gold Nugget Award for Best Residential Project of the Year within a Suburban
    Setting.
   Depot at Santiago. This project includes 70 units of apartments affordable to
    extremely low and very low income housing. It was funded with $3 million loan
    in CDBG and HOME funds, $700,000 in rental housing vouchers, and $18
    million in low income housing tax credits. The project provides deed-restricted
    affordable housing for extremely low and very low income households for a
    minimum of 55 years. It is slated for construction shortly with completion
    anticipated in 2014.

PROGRAM EVALUATION
GOAL 4. SPECIAL NEEDS
The City of Santa Ana is unique in Orange County, containing a diversity of
people of all backgrounds, family types, lifestyles, and income levels. As a large
urban City, Santa Ana is home to a population of residents from all walks of life.
While adding to the richness of the Santa Ana community, many residents have
special housing needs. Many of these special needs are common to all, while other
special needs are more common to people of different ages, incomes, or other
factor.
Over the past several years, special needs projects have been built or proposed for
each group. Family projects were shown under Goal #2 and Goal #3 discussions.
Highlights of accomplishments are described below:
   Vista del Rio project. This project features 41 special needs apartments for persons
    with physical and developmental disabilities. The site is located near an OCTA
    bus line, Park, UCI Medical Center, and a grocery market. The project was
    financed with $6.4 million in 9% Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and $2
    million in RDA and HOME funds, $2.9 million City land donation, deferred fees,
    and other sources. Social services are provided by A Community of Friends. This
    project provides extremely low and very low income housing for a minimum of 55
    years.
   Town and Country Manor. This project features 174 apartments for senior
    independent living on the campus of Town and Country Manor. Also to be
    constructed is a new expanded entry lobby and an Aquatic and Wellness Center
    with a covered pool area and fitness center. Site improvements will be made to the
    existing parking lots and a new main driveway entrance that will connect the
    entrances on Memory Lane and Lawson Way. An EIR is currently underway for
    this project.
   Homeless Housing. Forums with local Service Providers, Industrial owners and
    stakeholders were held in 2012 and 2013 to assist in the creation of the City’s
    ordinance to address homeless needs. In 2013, the City adopted an ordinance to
    permit emergency shelters and a multi-service center in the M1. M2, and
    Industrial Specific Development Zones subject to operational and management
    standards allowed under state law. The ordinance also allows limited expansion of
    the existing Salvation Army emergency shelter. In addition, transitional and
    permanent supportive housing will be treated as a residential use like a single or
    multiple-family project.

ppendix E.Public Outreach
          This chapter describes the public outreach process that was the foundation of the
          Housing Element update, the City’s Housing Vision, and programs.
          OVERVIEW
          California law requires that a diligent effort be made to achieve public
          participation from all groups in the development of the housing element. As part
          of the Housing Element update, the City held more than six meetings that
          provided opportunities for residents, businesses, stakeholders, advocates, civic
          leaders, and other parties to participate in the process.
          In embarking upon the effort, the public outreach program for the Housing
          Element was designed with several overarching goals in mind:
              Facilitate Equal Opportunity and Access. The intent was to provide venues that
               would allow all stakeholders equal access and opportunity to participate. To
               facilitate this, multilingual advertising and translation services were provided at
               community workshop forums. Meetings were held at different times of the day
               and week, and the facilities were accessible to people of all abilities.
              Allow a Broad Range of Discussion. The outreach process offered opportunities
               to focus on specific topics. The City capitalized on multiple city-wide planning
               efforts and activities to reach the largest audience possible. For instance two joint
               workshops were held to discuss the update to the City’s Circulation Element and
               its relationship with the Housing Element. Other outreach efforts included
               stakeholder groups via a focused health and wellness workshop, and to elected
               officials through study sessions.
              Community Engagement. As part of the Housing Element update, a bilingual
               English and Spanish survey solicited additional community feedback regarding
               housing, health, and wellness. The survey was available electronically through the
               City’s website, and hard copies were distributed at the Health Fair and
               Community Linkage Forum. Comment cards were also available at each
               community workshop, allowing participants to leave their feedback in writing.
          Finally, it is understood that achievement of Santa Ana’s housing planning goals
          is fundamentally a process that will unfold over the planning period. Given the
          strong implementation program provided, the City will continue to offer

                                   OUTREACH EVENTS AND PARTICIPATION
                                   Recognizing the importance of public participation in shaping the priorities of the
                                   community, the City of Santa Ana held at least a half dozen events for members of
                                   the public, elected officials, stakeholders, businesses, and/or other interested

OUR HOUSING
Participants acknowledged that long-term population growth in Santa Ana is
inevitable and recognized the dilemma the City faces with regard to providing
housing for people of all economic, age, and family categories. They agreed that            “…Affordable mixed-use

    housing in Santa Ana is apartments and townhouses. Though some residents
    strongly oppose this type of development, others expressed support, provided that
    such projects are well planned and designed. Residents favored new mixed-use
    developments as a positive change.                                                      “For the younger population

   Affordable Housing. Given the high cost of housing compared to the normal
    incomes of working families, “people must work too hard to afford housing.” A
    recently passed citywide inclusionary ordinance will help provide affordable
    housing. Participants also suggested that rent control should be used to keep
    places affordable, especially since rents have increased faster than inflation.

                                     beautify neighborhoods. Ideas mentioned included landscaping along streets,

                                    Parks and Open Space. Participants noted a need for park, open space, and
                                     recreational areas in nearly all parts of the community. The lack of parks is
                                     particularly noticeable downtown and in denser neighborhoods that consist
                                     primarily of multiple-family housing. Others desired community gardens and
                                     street landscaping. Infill housing must include open space in each project.
                                    Overcrowding. Overcrowding and housing density is seen as a significant problem
                                     in Santa Ana and is viewed as a contributing factor to the City’s decaying housing

                                     transportation and to balance density with livability and affordability.
                                    Crime and Safety. In certain neighborhoods, public safety is a concern for many
                                     residents. Crime is one of the main reasons why people move out of Santa Ana.
                                     Specific areas of concern included gangs and graffiti. Some participants perceived
                                     that certain types of development either cause or contribute to higher levels of
                                     crime, which again affects the quality of life in neighborhoods.
                                    Infrastructure. Residents cited that a common issue was the need to repair
                                     infrastructure—sidewalks, potholes, etc.—in neighborhoods and citywide. Poorly
                                     maintained infrastructure is not only a safety issue, but also presents a negative
                                     image of the City to residents, visitors, and the business community.

   Multigenerational Housing. Due to a myriad of factors, such as culture,
    affordability, and shifting demographics, participants voiced their support for
    multigenerational housing. Collective housing was also suggested as a supportive
    and affordable option for young adults, single parents, and seniors.
   Healthy Neighborhoods. Living a healthy lifestyle is important to many Santa
    Ana residents. Feedback received through the outreach workshops included a
    desire to have increased access to fresh food and open space, improved living
    conditions, a sense of community, and quality places for children to play.
OUR COMMUNITY
Although the focus of the workshop was on housing, residents felt there were            “Don’t let the state dictate how

    City’s public educational system. Many residents make great financial sacrifices to
    put their children through private education. Although improvements have been
    made in certain schools and neighborhoods, the public school system is also one of
    the main reasons why people leave Santa Ana.
   Transportation. Attendees felt that as the City grows, transportation will need to
    improve to accommodate new housing and mobility. Suggestions for
    transportation improvements included light rail, improved street conditions,         “Find a way that would
    transit services near housing, and walkable neighborhoods. Many residents            encourage people to think

   Density. Housing density continues to be a concern. It was mentioned at the
    project level (blighted projects) and the neighborhood level. There was a concern
    that higher density housing has been allowed to change the character and quality
    of life in neighborhoods. Others felt that the City must build more housing to
    reduce overcrowding.
   Crime and Safety. Crime and safety, although affecting individual neighborhoods,
    are citywide concerns mentioned by residents discussing future housing needs.
    Crime, particularly gangs and graffiti, is one reason why people move out of Santa
    Ana to safer suburbs. Some participants also expressed concern regarding crime at
    certain types of higher density housing.
   Healthy Community. The City should promote a healthier community. The idea
    means different things to different people: a city with ample parks, open space,
    and recreational centers; better and safer routes for people to walk or to bicycle
    from neighborhoods to places of interest; a smoke-free environment; and
    integration of public health planning into land use decisions.

                                       Family Housing. Various individuals and groups emphasized the need to
                                        prioritize family housing, specifically rental over ownership housing. Many
                                        families earn lower incomes, pay too much for housing, and live in overcrowded
                                        conditions. Affordable family rental housing is needed.
                                    OUR ECONOMY
                                    During the outreach process, concern was voiced that many of Santa Ana’s
                                    current and potential residents cannot afford to purchase or rent housing in the
                                    City. It is also important to have affordable housing for Santa Ana’s workforce.
                                    Key comments offered include:
                                       Educational Training. The 18 to 30 year olds are moving out of Santa Ana.
                                        Young adults with good employment skills cannot afford to stay local. The City
                                        should be more proactive. Without adequate educational attainment, it will not be
                                        possible to earn enough income to afford housing. If graduates are unable to find
                                        affordable move-up housing, the City will lose these skilled employees.
                                       Workforce Needs. Young adults with good employment skills cannot afford to
                                        stay local. What can be done to be more proactive? Looking closely at the needs of
                                        the workforce and understanding the densities that work best to produce

                                       Public Education. A challenge to advancing the affordable housing agenda is
                                        neighborhood concerns and resistance. Prior images of “affordable” housing need
                                        to be replaced through public education. A broader understanding of the value of
                                        affordable housing to the community is also needed.

                                        housing. Standards are challenging to meet; processing time can be long; potential
                                        sites are not located near transportation; inadequate densities are available for new
                                        housing; and parking requirements can be difficult to meet. The City needs to
                                        facilitate development and support affordable housing.
                                       Development Costs. While there are requests to improve and/or expedite the
                                        development approval process, in many cases it is not the approval process but
                                        rather City policies that are the issue. For example, the General Plan and Zoning
                                        Code do not allow housing in the downtown (other than live-work).

    Big Ideas. Solutions to workforce and affordable housing require big ideas.
     Employers and the City will need to contribute. Ultimately, the City Council will
     evaluate housing policy alternatives and set housing policy direction. These
     policies need to be shaped into a well-articulated vision for Santa Ana’s housing
     future. Incentives are also needed to promote more affordable housing.
    Funding Projects. The City should leverage monies with other funding sources
     like state bonds and tax credits. Advocating for the federal government programs
     that benefit affordable housing efforts and advancing more use of tax credits for
     entities would help to provide affordable housing.
SURVEY RESULTS
A bilingual survey (English and Spanish) was developed to solicit input about
health and wellness in Santa Ana’s communities. Electronic and paper copies             Participants at the Health and

There were 314 surveys submitted during the outreach period: 209 in English
and 105 in Spanish. Survey results indicated that 85% of respondents are City
of Santa Ana residents, with only 8% reporting that they work in Santa Ana.
The majority of the respondents were long-term residents; only 3% of
respondents reported that they have lived in the City for less than 1 year, and
87% indicated that they have lived in Santa Ana for 5 years or longer.
Respondents were asked to identify their three most important health and
housing related issues, which ranked in the following order:
     1) Access to open space, parks, and community centers (72%)
     2) Access to healthy food (58%)
     3) Affordable rental housing payments (50%)
Increased rental housing opportunities was identified as the least important
issue, with only 19% of respondents identifying it as one of their three most
important issues.
When asked to identify how far they need to travel to buy groceries, including
fresh fruits and vegetables, 49% of respondents noted that the distance requires
a car or bus; while 28% of respondents indicated that they were within a 10-              Chart E-1: Proximity to Groceries

PUBLIC OUTREACH
Participants were asked to prioritize several improvements that would make
their neighborhood a better place to live. Lighting improvements and property
maintenance (weeds, trash, etc.) were tied as the number one priority (55%),
followed by traffic improvements (53%), home repairs (broken windows, paint,
architectural features, etc.), and sidewalk improvements (49%). Neighborhood
welcoming or social events (44%) and street trees and landscaping (39%) were
slightly less of a priority.
An open-ended follow-up question gave respondents the opportunity to share
ideas on how to improve their neighborhoods. The top 15 ideas proposed by
residents are listed below and organized by the number of responses.
Participants felt that the City of Santa Ana should:
      Increase the amount public space (parks, recreational facilities,
         walking trails, community gardens, public art, etc.)
      Increase police enforcement to address crime and gang activity
      Conduct repairs to streets and sidewalks / add more street furniture,
         landscaping, and lighting
      Improve code enforcement for housing units
      Offer more public events (block party, farmer’s market, holiday
         celebrations, live music, etc.)
      Build bike lanes and trails
      Increase the amount of affordable housing / promote workforce and
         low income programs
      Place more speed bumps and increase speed enforcement
      Promote neighborhood watch programs
      Issue parking permits for neighborhoods with mid and high densities
      Increase communication between city and residents
      Improve trash and street cleaning services
      Offer more youth programs (e.g. recreational sports)
      Increase homeless control
      Regulate the number of people allowed to live in a unit by number of
         bedrooms
The survey also asked residents to identify the street or intersection that was
closest to their home. A map was generated identifying the location provided
by each survey participant. As shown on the map below, participants
represented a variety of neighborhoods in the City of Santa Ana.

Airport Environs Element
INTRODUCTION
BACKGROUND
The Airport Environs Element of the City of Santa Ana General Plan serves as a
long-range policy guide to safeguard the general welfare of the inhabitants within
the City of Santa Ana in the vicinity of John Wayne Airport (JWA). Additionally, it
provides guidance for the purpose of ensuring navigable airspace is not impacted
by future development in the City.
Section 21675 of the Public Utilities Code (PUC) requires Airport Land Use
Commissions (ALUC) to formulate a comprehensive land use plan for the area
surrounding each public airport that includes and is based upon a long-range
master plan or an airport layout plan that reflects the anticipated growth of the
airport during at least the next 20 years. Specifically, the comprehensive land use
plan seeks to protect the public from the adverse effects of aircraft noise, to ensure
that people and facilities are not concentrated in areas susceptible to aircraft
accidents, and to ensure that no structures or activities adversely affect navigable
airspace. The ALUC’s two primary duties include:
   Prepare Compatibility Plans. Each ALUC is required to “prepare and adopt”
    an airport land use plan based upon a long-range master plan for each of the
    airports within its jurisdiction [PUC Sections 21674(c) and 21675(a)].
   Review Local Agency Land Use Actions and Airport Plans. The ALUC
    reviews the plans, regulations, and other actions of local agencies and airport
    operators pursuant to PUC Section 21676.
The Public Utilities Code provides that the ALUC shall be guided by the
Caltrans/Division of Aeronautics’ California Airport Land Use Planning Handbook
when adopting or amending the comprehensive land use plan. Two of the
ALUC’s Airport Environs Land Use Plans (AELUP) relate to the City of Santa
Ana: John Wayne Airport (JWA) and the AELUP for Heliports. The ALUC has
adopted aircraft noise, ground safety, and height restriction policies for the
planning areas contained within these AELUPs. The City will refer required
actions within the AELUP planning areas to the ALUC for consistency
determinations as defined in the PUC Section 21676.

AIRPPORT ENVIRONS ELEMENT
FORMAT OF THE AIRPORT ENVIRONS ELEMENT
The Airport Environs Element is presented in four sections. The body of this
Element is devoted to establishing Planning Guidelines that relate to areas
affected by JWA and establishing Policies with regards to airport related issues.
The Appendices to the Element provide detailed information regarding the areas
addressed within the policy framework. Each section of the Element is
summarized below:
   The Introduction provides an overview of the requirements for the Element
    established by State Law and the rationale of the Element as well as
    presenting information on the Element’s consistency with other City General
    Plan Elements.
   The Planning Issues section identifies and defines areas of concern in
    relation to land uses and impacts of noise from JWA.
   The Policy Plan section describes City goals and policies regarding areas
    impacted by JWA.
   The Appendices provide detailed information as well as a glossary/definitions
    section and analyses and technical information referenced in the Element.
GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
The Airport Environs Element of the General Plan is one aspect of the City’s
long-range planning program. California Government Code requires that
General Plans contain an integrated, consistent set of goals and policies. The
Airport Environs Element is therefore affected by policies contained in other
elements of the General Plan. For example, the City’s Noise Element contains
standards and guidelines regarding appropriate acceptable noise levels for all land
uses, while the City’s Land Use Element establishes the location of land uses and
the desired density/intensity of these uses to meet community needs. The Land
Use Element also addresses factors such as man-made risks that may affect the
general pattern of development.
The policies and programs contained in this Element have been determined to be
consistent with the City’s other General Plan Elements (see Appendix A).
PLANNING ISSUES
NOISE
The City of Santa Ana Noise Element defines noise problems and provides
standards and guidelines establishing thresholds and appropriate measures to
minimize the impact of noise on the community. The Airport Environs Element
expands upon these policies by identifying noise impacts as they relate to JWA.

                                                                                 AIRPORT ENVIRONS ELEMENT
The ALUC has adopted Title 21, California Airport Noise Standards and
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) criteria, to describe noise
exposures. Two noise zones are described below and depicted in Exhibit 1:
     65 dB(A) CNEL Noise Contour. Exposure of 65 dB(A) CNEL or higher
      (High Noise Impact).
     60 dB(A) CNEL Noise Contour. Exposure levels from 60 dB(A) CNEL up
      to 65 dB(A) CNEL (Moderate Noise Impact).
In the City of Santa Ana, noise from aircraft using John Wayne Airport is not
severe. Only small portions of the City are contained in either Noise Contour as
shown in Exhibit 1.
The table below establishes noise standards for sensitive land uses.

 Notes:
 1
   Interior areas (to include but are not limited to): bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, living rooms, dining rooms,
   closets, corridors/hallways, private offices, and conference rooms.
 2
   Exterior areas shall mean: private yard of single-family homes, mobile home parks, park picnic areas, school
   playgrounds, and common areas. Private open space, such as atriums and balconies, shall be excluded from
   exterior areas provided sufficient common area is included within the project.
 3
   Interior noise level requirements contemplate a closed window condition. Mechanical ventilation system or
   other means of natural ventilation shall be provided per Chapter 12, Section 1305 of the Uniform Building
   Code.
65 dB(A) CNEL NOISE CONTOUR
Impacts in the 65 dB(A) CNEL Noise Contour are sufficient to warrant
restrictions on residential uses and may require sound attenuation measures. All
residential uses are deemed inconsistent in this area unless it can be shown that
such units are sufficiently mitigated to address present and projected noise
exposure which may include, but is not limited to, avigation easements and sound
attenuation. This exposure shall be the energy sum of all noise impacting the
project, so as not to exceed an interior standard of 45 dB(A) CNEL.
Noise sensitive institutional uses such as schools, churches, hospitals, libraries,
and other noise-sensitive land uses may also be inconsistent in this zone unless it
can be shown conclusively that such units are sufficiently mitigated to address
present and projected noise exposure. Again, this exposure shall be the energy
sum of all noise impacting the project so as not to exceed an interior noise

standard of 45 dB(A) CNEL. Commercial, industrial, and recreational uses may
be appropriate in this zone providing that structures are mitigated to allow
normal work activities to be conducted. In the City of Santa Ana, the small
portion of area that lies within this impacted zone shall be consistent with defined
noise standards (in the table presently shown on page twenty-three) of the
AELUP.
60 dB(A) CNEL NOISE CONTOUR
The noise impact in this zone includes moderate noise levels of 60 dB(A) CNEL
or greater but less than 65 dB(A) CNEL. Pursuant to California Noise Insulation
Standards, Title 25, California Code of Regulations, single event noise exposure
levels in this area may create serious disturbances to inhabitants. Residential units
in this area should be mitigated to address present and projected noise exposure.
The residential interior noise level shall not exceed 45 dB(A) CNEL. In the City
of Santa Ana, this impact area zone is designated in the General Plan for
Industrial and Commercial land uses and, therefore, there are no noise
incompatibilities.
HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS
The ALUC has adopted the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 77 as the
criteria for determining height restrictions in Orange County.
The allowable height of structures surrounding an airport is described in FAR
Part 77 as the allowable height at which safe movement of aircraft occurs. The
regulation requires that notice be given to the FAA by a person proposing to
construct a structure that would exceed specified heights and/or would be erected
at specified sites (see Exhibit 2). The height that is specified for which notice is
required is any structure extending above a 100:1 slope of an imaginary surface
extending outward for 20,000 feet from the nearest runway at JWA (see Exhibit 3).
Beyond the 100:1 imaginary surface, FAR Part 77 requires notification to FAA for
any project that will be more than 200 feet in height above the ground level
pursuant to FAR Part 77 Section 77.13.
The ALUC considers and recognizes the FAA as the single authority for
analyzing project impact on an airport or aeronautical operations or navigational-
aid procedures. The ALUC also considers the FAA as the authority for reporting
the results of such studies and project analyses. The ALUC will not consider the
findings of reports or studies conducted by parties other than the FAA unless the
FAA certifies and adopts such findings as true and correct.

The ALUC understands that the FAA will make a final determination of whether
the proposed project falls into one of the following categories:
1. The project is neither an obstruction nor hazard to air navigation,
2. The project is an obstruction to air navigation, but it is not a hazard and the
     FAA will establish conditions for lighting and marking the buildings; or,
3. The FAA determines the project is a hazard to air navigation.
The ALUC is responsible for ensuring the continued operation of airports in
Orange County, and to safeguard the general welfare of inhabitants within the
vicinity of the airport. The Commission may utilize criteria for protecting aircraft
traffic patterns at individual airports which may differ from those contained in
FAR Part 77, should evidence of health, welfare, or air safety surface be found
sufficient and necessary to justify such an action. The City of Santa Ana will
comply with the requirements of FAA FAR Part 77, Caltrans Division of
Aeronautics, and the ALUC.
SAFETY
The AELUP does not establish any Runway Protection Zones within the City of
Santa Ana.
STATE LAW
The City of Santa Ana will comply with and administer all requirements
established by state law and the Public Utilities Code Section 21676. The City of
Santa Ana will submit for ALUC review new development and redevelopment
projects which contain amendments to a General Plan or Specific Plan, and/or
adoption or approval of a zoning ordinance or building regulation, within the
JWA planning area.
HELIPORTS/HELISTOPS
Under PUC Section 21661.5 and in accordance with PUC Section 21670 et seq.
and California Administrative Code Title 21, Business Regulations, Chapter 25,
Division of Aeronautics, Sub-Chapter 2.1, the ALUC is charged with reviewing
and acting on proposed heliports within its jurisdiction. Fulfilling this
responsibility, the ALUC has adopted a Heliports AELUP that is applicable
within every jurisdiction in Orange County that permits such facilities. The
ALUC is also responsible for making recommendations directly to the California
Department of Transportation/Aeronautics Division, regarding the required state
heliport permit under Section 21661.5 of the PUC.

ALUC review of proposed heliport/helistop projects is initiated through referral of
the development permit by the sponsor’s or the local agency’s referral for a
development permit. The ALUC will review any proposal for a heliport/helistop
within the City of Santa Ana with respect to safety zones, noise impacts, and
height restrictions as defined in the Heliports AELUP for Sections 2.2.1 through
2.2.3. Emergency flights for medical purposes and temporary landing sites do not
need to be submitted to the ALUC.

Circulation Element
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The Circulation Element of the Santa Ana General Plan serves as the City’s
primary guide for transportation planning. The Element is concerned
with accommodating the transportation needs of those living, working,
and visiting the City. Its objective is to articulate the City’s vision and
plans for the ongoing development and maintenance of a comprehensive
transportation network... a network which will efficiently move people
and goods throughout Santa Ana and the surrounding region well into
the next century.
The Circulation Element focuses on roadways and other transportation
modes including public transit, railroads, pedestrian and bicycle paths,
that provide a full range of travel options. Also included is an assessment
of the City’s current roadway system and recommendations for the
improvements necessary to maintain acceptable levels of service on this
system through the year 2010.
The Circulation Element is one of several elements of the general plan
mandated by State planning law. It is intended to guide the development
of the City’s circulation system in a manner consistent with the Land Use
Element and other elements which comprise the general plan.
State General Plan Guidelines indicate circulation elements should
consider the following:
    “...the general location and extent of existing and proposed major
    thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local
    public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use
    element of the plan.”
FORMAT OF THE CIRCULATION ELEMENT
In response to State requirements and local objectives, the Circulation
Element consists of the following sections:
   The Purpose and Scope provide an overview of the objectives to be
    accomplished with implementation of the Element. It also

    content.
   The Community Factors provide an overview of the opportunities
    and constraints that are important considerations in the formulation
    of the goals and policies in the Policy Plan.
   The Policy Plan states the City’s goals and policies regarding
    transportation planning, development, and implementation. This
    section also contains the Master Plan of Streets and Highways and the
    Master Plan of Bikeways.
   The Implementation Plan identifies the actions that will be used to
    the implement the Circulation Element’s goals and policies.
   The Appendix contains background information and other data
    relevant to traffic and circulation issues considered in the Element.
    This section of the Element also contains traffic forecasts and
    evaluates future conditions, characterizes regional and local
    improvements to the circulation system, and discusses key
    implementation strategies.

COMMUNITY FACTORS
Santa Ana is a major destination in the region because it is a major
                                                                            In 1889, the County of
employment center and serves as the county seat for regional offices of     Orange was formed with
federal, State, and County governments. The City is located in the midst    Santa Ana as the County
of an established network of freeways generally midway between the          Seat.
major urban areas of Los Angeles and San Diego. Santa Ana’s location and
its proximity to the regional freeway system provide an opportunity to
capture the economic benefits associated with good access, a centralized
location in the region, and an established street and rail system. In
addition to Santa Ana’s location, other factors considered in the
formulation of the Element include land use characteristics, traffic
conditions, planned system improvements, transportation system
management, and alternative modes of travel.
LAND USE CHARACTERISTICS
Santa Ana is a built-out city and any future intensification of
development will require corresponding improvements to the circulation
system if current levels of service are to be maintained. In major
development areas, the addition or expansion of transportation facilities
will have a corresponding impact on adjacent development over time.
Land use factors considered as part of this Elements preparation are
identified below.
   The City’s street and highway system is largely established and fixed,
    with the exception of a few remaining major street improvement
    projects. The City’s current development pattern necessitates the use
    of new approaches and technologies to increase traffic capacity on the
    existing roadway system without creating the potential for significant
    adverse land use impacts.
   As traffic volumes increase and peak hour congestion worsen, the
    historical approach to solving congestion problems has been to
    increase roadway capacity by widening streets, or building new roads.
    Due to the cost and negative impacts associated with widening
    roadways, this is now the least likely option to be considered by the
    City. With completion of the street widenings currently planned or
    programmed, no additional widenings are anticipated in the
    foreseeable future.
   Some areas of the City are developed in a manner that facilitates
    pedestrian access to commercial services. However, automobile-
    oriented development prevails in much of the City. When commercial
    districts are separated from residential areas by long distances, it is
    difficult for residents to conduct business without using their cars.

                             Many shopping centers are surrounded by large parking lots and
                              separated from adjacent developments by walls or other barriers,
                              making pedestrian access between developments inconvenient. Site
                              plans are often designed around parking and automobile circulation,
                              with little or no attention given to the convenience and comfort of
                              pedestrians or users of public transportation.
                          TRAFFIC CHARACTERISTICS
                          Santa Ana’s roadways are experiencing increased traffic congestion, as are
                          most areas of Orange County, due to growth and development in the City
                          and surrounding region. The increased traffic projected through the year
                          2010 will result in additional congestion on local streets in the absence of
                          mitigation measures. Key traffic considerations addressed in the Element
                          include the following:
                             Since 1980, the City of Santa Ana has experienced significant growth
                              and development, and is now almost completely built-out. This
                              growth, coupled with the continued reliance on private automobiles
                              for travel, has led to increased traffic throughout the City. This traffic
                              is being added to a circulation system currently operating at or near
                              capacity in many areas of the City.
                             Traffic conditions at key intersections in the City were surveyed and
                              the morning and evening peak hour level of service (LOS)
                              determined. The analysis indicated that some of the intersections
                              surveyed currently operate at an undesirable level of service (LOS E or
                              F) during at least one of the peak traffic periods. Congestion is
                              experienced throughout the City, especially during the evening peak
                              hour periods.
                             In the event congestion is not mitigated by planned roadway
                              improvements, traffic will typically find alternate routes resulting in
                              additional through traffic on residential streets. Neighborhood traffic
                              management programs will be expanded, as appropriate, to minimize
                              the intrusion of spillover traffic in residential areas.
                          PLANNED SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS
                          As indicated, the built-out character of the City limits opportunities for
                          the construction of major transportation improvements without
                          considerable expense and land use impacts. Nevertheless, the public
                          agencies responsible for overseeing the development, maintenance, and
                          operation of the transportation facilities which serve the City and the
                          region are involved in planning efforts to ensure that the transportation
                          network meets the needs of the City and region into the next century.
                          Planned local and regional system improvements include:
There are 260 signalized
intersections in the City

           of Santa Ana.

                                                         CIRCULATION ELEMENT
   A number of widening projects are planned in the City including
    McFadden Avenue, Bristol Street, Grand Avenue, and Edinger Avenue,
    as well as realignments of selected roadway segments including
    Fairview and Alton Avenue.
   A number of new freeway corridors are also planned in Orange
    County which will impact traffic conditions in Santa Ana. These
    include the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridors in the southern
    and eastern sections of the County; and the extension of the Orange
    Freeway (SR-57) that is also under consideration.
   An urban rail system is also being planned for the County, and
    segments of this system will serve Santa Ana. This north/south system
    will begin in Fullerton, with a terminus in Irvine, and serve several of
    Santa Ana’s major activity areas.
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT
Some desirable improvements to the local street system may require
substantial financial investments that may not be feasible or cost-effective
relative to the system benefits. City plans for improving the roadway
capacity recognize these limits, and as a result, strategies to enhance
alternative travel modes and manage transportation demand are given
priority consideration.
The strategy to alleviate traffic congestion in the City will include
measures that do not involve roadway construction. Programs focusing on
“travel behavior” can be equally effective in reducing traffic congestion.
The following issues related to trip reduction are important
considerations in the development of the City’s long-range transportation
policy.
   With the physical and financial constraints on improving system
    capacity, strategies to eliminate peak period travel, or shift trips to off-
    peak periods are becoming increasingly important. Santa Ana has
    adopted a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) ordinance for
    the City’s large employers. This ordinance is designed to reduce peak
    travel demands associated with commuter trips. Employers who are
    subject to the TDM ordinance are required to implement programs
    which help reduce peak hour traffic demands.
   An adequate supply of parking will continue to be essential to the
    economic success of businesses in the City. However, to improve
    safety and optimize traffic operations, on-street parking is removed
    from arterial streets wherever feasible. In residential areas, parking
    permit programs will continue to be used as a means of ensuring that

                              parking management programs will be considered wherever feasible
                              to maximize business opportunities.
                             Requirements that every development project provide a sufficient off-
                              street parking supply to accommodate maximum demands are
                              evaluated as necessary to reduce the parking required for mixed-use
                              projects. In addition, City efforts will continue to encourage ride
                              sharing and the use of public transportation by supporting safe,
                              convenient parking areas at park-and-ride lots, and at the Regional
                              Transportation Center.
                             The City has implemented an Intelligent Transportation System to
                              relieve traffic congestion. This system includes close circuit television
                              surveillance cameras, electronic message signs and highway traffic
                              advisory radio broadcasts. An essential benefit of this system is its
                              ability to provide “real time” information concerning congestion and
                              major traffic-related incidents, thereby facilitating their choice of less
                              congested travel routes.
                          ALTERNATIVE TRAVEL MODES
                          The City continues to promote a fully integrated multi-modal circulation
                          system by fostering patterns of land use and urban design which improve
                          convenience and safety for pedestrians, bicyclists, and users of public
                          transportation. The following issues relative to alternative modes of travel
                          are important considerations in this Element:
                             Strategies to manage transportation demand and reduce reliance on
                              single-occupant automobiles for travel rely on the City’s ability to
                              support the expanded use of bicycles, pedestrian travel, public transit,
                              and commuter rail.
                             The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) operates a fixed
                              route bus service in the county along with Access, a program to
                              provide transportation for senior citizens and disabled persons. The
                              OCTA, in coordination with the Southern California Regional
                              Railroad Authority, also operates commuter rail service from San
                              Diego to downtown Los Angeles via Metrolink.

    Pedestrian travel in the City primarily occurs on the existing system of
     sidewalks. Given the City’s low rate of car ownership in relation to
     other Orange County cities, planning efforts, will continue to improve
     and maintain the existing system of pedestrian facilities (sidewalks,
     etc.) to accommodate pedestrian travel to major activity centers and
     community services.
GROWTH MANAGEMENT POLICIES
In 1990, Orange County voters approved Measure M which provides
funding for needed transportation improvements county wide. Measure
M authorized the imposition of a one-half cent retail sales tax for a period
of 20 years effective April 1, 1991. The revenue received from Measure M
will be used for regional transportation improvements and returned to
local jurisdictions for use on local and regional maintenance projects.
Santa Ana complies with the Measure M program in order to qualify for
these revenues. Participation in the Measure M program has fostered
cooperative planning efforts between Santa Ana and the adjacent cities as
it relates to roadway improvements with area-wide benefits.

INTERJURISDICTIONAL COORDINATION
Santa Ana’s geographic location puts it at the hub of the Orange County
transportation system. The City’s transportation system and the problems
associated with that system are, to a large extent, shared with those of its
neighboring cities. Key factors related to Interjurisdictional coordination
considered as part of this Element’s formulation include the following:
   In cooperation with the cities of Tustin and Orange, Santa Ana has
    established two joint powers authorities (JPAs) designed to address
    land development and infrastructure issues which affect the adjacent
    jurisdiction. Developments and circulation improvements which
    occur within the designated JPA boundaries are coordinated through
    this authority.
   Santa Ana is a member of the Inter-City Liaison Committee along
    with the cities of Irvine, Tustin, Costa Mesa, and Newport Beach. The
    Committee facilitates the sharing of information about common
    issues, including traffic, affecting the South Coast Metro, Irvine
    Business Complex, and the John Wayne Airport areas.

BACKGROUND
The circulation system has been a vital part of Santa Ana’s history dating
back to 1869 when the City was founded. At that time, the circulation
system consisted primarily of dirt roads that provided access from the
surrounding agricultural areas to the shops and post office located in the
downtown area. The subsequent arrivals of the Southern Pacific Railroad
in 1878 and the Santa Fe Railroad in 1886 brought a second transportation
mode. Santa Ana now has a multi-modal circulation system which
includes both private and public transportation and rail service. The
roadway system serving the City includes several regional grade-separated
freeways and a paved system of surface streets including regional Smart
Streets.
Other transportation modes in the City include the public transit system
which operates bus routes over numerous city streets, on-street bikeways
and exclusive off-street bikeways, as well as an extensive sidewalk system
to accommodate pedestrian travel. Despite the predominance of the
roadway system for moving people and goods, the City’s transportation
system includes other important components such as truck routes,
freight, and passenger rail service.

                            REGIONAL CONTEXT
                            The City of Santa Ana is a major destination center in the region since it
                            serves as the governmental center and a key employment center for
                            Orange County. The City is located in the midst of an established network
                            of freeways and is midpoint between the major urban areas of Los
                            Angeles and San Diego. Santa Ana’s location and its proximity to the
                            regional system of freeways provides an important means of capturing
                            the economic benefits associated with easy access, a central regional
                            location, and an established street and rail system.
                            Regional roadway access is provided by five freeways - the Santa Ana
    In 1989, the train fare
 between Santa Ana and
                            Freeway (I-5), the Orange Freeway (SR-57), the Garden Grove Freeway
Los Angeles was $1.35 one   (SR-22), the Costa Mesa Freeway (SR-55), and the San Diego Freeway (I-
way and $2.25 round-trip.   405). The regional system of freeways serving the City and surrounding
                            area are illustrated in Exhibit A-1.
                            REGIONAL SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS
                            Improvements planned on several freeways will address some of the most
                            critical regional congestion problems. The most significant project
                            involves the widening of the Santa Ana Freeway. Construction is complete
                            on the segment of this project that passes through Santa Ana. The
                            widening included going from six lanes to as many as twelve lanes at
                            some locations in the City. The completion of this project north of Santa
                            Ana to the County line will further enhance traffic flow through the city
                            on this regional travel corridor.
                            Current plans for improving the Costa Mesa Freeway call for the addition
                            of two general purpose lanes between the Riverside Freeway (SR-91) and
                            the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) and improvements at both interchanges.
                            Several toll road projects are planned or are underway to expand the
                            regional roadway system in Orange County. These improvements include
                            construction of the Foothill/Eastern, and San Joaquin Hills
                            Transportation Corridors, the latter of which is already in operation.
                            These toll roads will primarily serve south Orange County but will help to
                            alleviate traffic congestion on the Santa Ana (I-5), San Diego (I-405), and
                            Costa Mesa (SR-55) Freeways which impact local traffic in Santa Ana. The
                            Foothill/Eastern Corridor, in particular, will benefit Santa Ana by
                            relieving congestion on the Costa Mesa (SR-55) Freeway.
                            As discussed below, there are several regional roadway improvements and
                            transit corridors proposed for construction in Santa Ana. An extension of
                            A-2                                          CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN

the Orange Freeway (SR-57) is being considered for construction along
the Santa Ana River between the Garden Grove and San Diego Freeways. A
private consortium has been awarded a franchise by Caltrans to build and
operate this freeway as a toll road for 30 years. If the project receives
environmental clearance and obtains sufficient funding, this roadway

(OCTA) is studying the feasibility of developing the Pacific Electric
Railroad right-of-way in the western portion of the City as a long-term
transit corridor to serve downtown Santa Ana from the Garden Grove
Freeway (SR-22).
The OCTA is working to develop an urban rail system for the County. As
proposed, this north/south system would service several of the City’s
major development areas along its route through central Santa Ana. These
new transportation corridors are further discussed and illustrated in the
Roadway Improvements section of this Appendix.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS AND PLANS
The Circulation Element is integrally related to federal, state, and
regional transportation programs, as well as local plans and regulations.
The City’s role in transportation planning has become increasingly
important, as recent legislation in the areas of growth management,
congestion management, and air quality require more active local
coordination to meet regional objectives. “The transportation related plan
and programs that impact the policies in this Element are discussed
below.
SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN
The Circulation Element, together with the Land Use Element, provides
the framework for the planning of future development in the City.
Conformity between the Land Use and Circulation Elements is critical
since the former will have a direct influence on traffic volumes and
roadway levels of service. The Circulation Element, in turn, identifies
major transportation-related improvements which may impact

surrounding land uses and development. Other elements of the General
Plan which interrelate with circulation issues include the Urban Design
Element and the Economic Element.
AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN
The South Coast Air Quality Management District is the agency
responsible for enforcing regulations to achieve both national and state
ambient air quality standards. Because of the importance of motor
vehicles as a pollution source, substantial emphasis has been placed on
reducing motor vehicle travel, and increasing vehicle ridership. This
Element contains policies and implementation actions that address the
need for coordination between the City and regional, state and federal
agencies responsible for improving air quality in the region.
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was adopted by the U.S.
Congress to provide clear and comprehensive national policy for
eliminating discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The ADA
directs the federal government to provide enforcement standards for ADA
policies in a consistent manner on behalf of those individuals with
disabilities. The legislation requires that barrier-free access be provided at
public facilities. All new facilities including new roadways, parkways, and
sidewalks must be constructed to meet ADA standards. Existing roadways
must be modified to conform to these standards when improvement
projects are undertaken.
SUPER TRUCKS
The federal 1982 Surface Transportation Assistance Act requires that
terminal access route roadways be designated to carry “super” trucks
between the national freeway system and local truck terminals. This
Element includes provisions to address this federal requirement.
CONGESTION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
California residents passed Proposition 111 in June, 1990. This legislation
requires that larger urbanized areas like Santa Ana adopt a Congestion
Management Program (CMP) to reduce traffic congestion, and provide a
mechanism for coordinating land use and transportation decisions. The
Orange County Transportation Authority is the lead agency for the
Orange County CMP. In order to receive Proposition 111 funds, Santa Ana
is responsible for evaluating the impacts of proposed local land use
decisions on the regional transportation system, and calculating the level
of service on the roadways and intersections identified in the regional

SMART STREETS PROGRAM
The Smart Streets Program is an important component of the county’s
Growth Management Plan. Potential “Smart Street” improvements
include traffic signal synchronization, re-striping/widening of roadways
to increase the number of travel lanes, intersection grade separations, bus
turnouts, removal of on-street parking, and intersection improvements.
The designated Smart Streets in Santa Ana include Harbor Boulevard (the
entire portion within the City), First Street (from the western City limits
to the Santa Ana Freeway), and Edinger Avenue (from Main Street east to
the City limits). The Smart Streets are shown in Exhibit A-2.
MEASURE M
Measure M is a local transportation and growth management initiative
approved by Orange County voters in November, 1990. The measure
included a one-half cent sales tax increase for improving streets and
freeways, stabilizing transit fares, and developing rail transit.
Approximately 21 percent of the revenue is targeted for local street and
road projects. In order to receive its share of revenue, a city must adopt a
Growth Management Program in its general plan that includes LOS
standards, a monitoring program, development phasing with circulation
improvements, and the assessment of development impact fees, while
also maintaining prior levels of funding directed to transportation. The
key components of the Growth Management Element have been
incorporated into this Circulation Element.
The level of service (LOS) standard for traffic circulation in the City has
been established as a LOS D. In order to achieve this standard, the City
has adopted a policy that within three years of the issuance of the first
building permit for a development project, any necessary improvements
of transportation facilities to which the project contributes measurable
traffic, must be completed. All new development is required to pay its
share of the street improvement costs associated with the development,
including those improvements required for regional traffic mitigation.
CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN                                           A-11

CIRCULATION ELEMENT
New development in the City is also required to establish a development
phasing program which phases the approvals of the development
commensurate with required transportation-related improvements. The
phasing plan must include an overall build-out plan which can
demonstrate the ability of the infrastructure to support the planned
development. The City is required to monitor the implementation of the
development phasing program for each new development project on an
annual basis. This monitoring effort must be documented in a report.
Future development is subject to a number of requirements designed to
manage the traffic impacts it generates. A traffic impact analysis is
generally required if a project generates at least 2,400 vehicle trips per day,
or if a project generates 1,600 trips to the Congestion Management
Program (CMP) network. In addition, the City of Santa Ana has adopted a
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Ordinance for employers
with 100 employees or more. The TDM Ordinance calls for new
development to incorporate measures to provide public transit
information, facilities to encourage carpools/vanpools, bicycle use and to
promote public transit use.
JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES
In cooperation with the cities of Orange and Tustin, Santa Ana has
established two Joint Powers Authorities (JPAs) designed to address land
development and infrastructure issues which affect the adjacent
jurisdiction. Developments and circulation improvements which occur
within the designated boundaries are coordinated through the JPA.

IMPLEMENTATION OF MASTER PLAN OF STREETS AND
HIGHWAYS
This section describes the City of Santa Ana Master Plan of Streets and
Highways (MPSH), and the applicable design and service standards for
the various roadway classifications that comprise the MPSH. The section
concludes with an identification of those programs that are used in
implementing the goals and policies of the Circulation Element.
LEVEL OF SERVICE STANDARDS
An important “standard” referred to throughout this Element relates to
the ability of a roadway and/or intersection to accommodate traffic. This
level of service standard may be used to describe both existing and future
traffic conditions. Level of service (LOS) is a qualitative ranking that
characterizes traffic congestion on a scale of A to F with LOS A being the
optimal traffic condition and LOS F representing extreme congestion.
In addition to the LOS definition, a volume to capacity ratio or V/C ratio
is used to provide a more quantified description of traffic conditions at
intersections. The V/C ratio is the ratio of existing or projected traffic
volumes to an intersection’s design capacity. A V/C ratio of 0.90 for an
intersection means that the traffic volumes at the intersection represent
90 percent of its design capacity. The V/C ratio can also be related to the
above LOS definitions. For example, an intersection with a V/C ratio
exceeding 0.95 is handling traffic volumes that are approaching design
capacity. The V/C ratio of 0.95 corresponds to LOS E which indicates an
unacceptable level of service at that particular intersection. The following
six level of service definitions relate traffic conditions to traffic volumes
and the design capacity of roadways and/or intersections.
    LOS A (V/C ratio 0.0 - 0.60) Free flow. Individual users are virtually
     unaffected by the presence of others in the traffic stream. Freedom to
     select desired speeds, and to maneuver within the traffic stream is
     extremely high. The general level of comfort and convenience
     provided to the motorist, passenger, or pedestrian is excellent.
    LOS B (V/C ratio 0.61 - 0.70) Stable flow. The presence of other
     users in the traffic stream begins to be noticeable. Freedom to select
     desired speeds is relatively unaffected, but there is a slight decline in
     the freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream from LOS A. The
     general level of comfort and convenience provided is somewhat less
     than at LOS A, because the presence of others in the traffic stream
     begins to affect individual behavior.
    LOS C (V/C ratio 0.71 - 0.80) Stable flow. This LOS marks the
     beginning of the range of flow in which the operation of individual
CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN                                            A-13

CIRCULATION ELEMENT
     users becomes significantly affected by interactions with others in the
     traffic stream. The selection of speed is affected by the presence of
     others, and maneuvering within the traffic stream requires
     substantial vigilance on the part of the user. The general level of
     comfort and convenience declines noticeably at this level.
    LOS D (V/C ratio 0.81 - 0.90) High density, but stable flow. Speed and
     freedom to maneuver are severely restricted, and the driver or
     pedestrian experiences a generally poor level of comfort and
     convenience. Small increases in traffic flow will generally cause
     operational problems at this level.
    LOS E (V/C ratio 0.91 - 1.00) Operating conditions at or near the
     capacity level. All speeds are reduced to a low but relatively uniform
     value. Freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream is extremely
     difficult, and generally accomplished by forcing a vehicle or
     pedestrian to “give way” to accommodate such maneuvers. Comfort
     and convenience levels are extremely poor, and driver or pedestrian
     frustration is generally high. Operations at this level are usually
     unstable because small increases in flow or minor variations within
     the stream will cause breakdown.
    LOS F (V/C ratio >1.00) Forced or breakdown flow. This condition
     exists wherever the amount of traffic approaching a point exceeds the
     amount which can traverse that point. Queues form up behind such
     locations as arrival flow exceeds discharge flow.
Exhibit A-3 graphically represents the mid-block conditions for the LOS
definitions described above. This Circulation Element establishes LOS D
as the maximum acceptable LOS for major intersections in the City except
in major development areas. The Congestion Management Plan
establishes LOS E as the maximum level of operation for CMP roadways
(freeways and Smart Streets).

                 streets. demand and congestion warrant such widening.
                          Each arterial roadway is assigned to one of the following functional
                          classifications:
                              Principal Arterial. Typically, an eight-lane, divided roadway
                               designed to accommodate between 45,000 to 67,500 vehicle trips
                               daily. The typical right of way width is 144 feet.
                              Major Arterial. Generally consists of six-travel lanes, and is also
                               divided. Typically, the right-of-way width for this type of roadway is
                               120 feet. A major arterial is designed to accommodate between 33,900
                               and 50,600 vehicle trips daily.
                              Primary Arterial. Generally consists of a four-lane, divided roadway.
                               Typically, the right-of-way width is 100 feet. A primary arterial is
                               designed to accommodate between 22,500 and 33,800 vehicle trips
                               daily.
                              Secondary Arterial. Generally a four-lane, undivided roadway. The
                               typical right-of-way width for this category of roadway is 80 feet. A
                               secondary arterial is typically designed to accommodate between
                               15,000 and 22,500 vehicle trips daily.
                              Commuter Street. A two-lane, undivided roadway carrying less than
                               10,000 vehicle trips per day.        The right-of way width for this

                               undivided roadways with a right-of-way width of 56 feet.
                              Local Commercial Street. A two-lane, undivided roadway carrying
                               up to 6,000 vehicle trips per day. Parking may be allowed on both

Roadway Improvements
Potential capacity improvements for arterial streets in Santa Ana include
completion of programmed widenings, removing on-street parking to add
travel lanes, widening intersections to add turn lanes, or constructing
grade separations at railroad crossings. The City traffic model forecasts
are used to identify the intensity of congestion at each intersection and
the types of improvements which could best help to alleviate the
projected future congestion.
The initial list of potential improvements was narrowed to exclude
projects which were judged to be impractical to implement, or would
require extensive dislocation of adjacent buildings. The refined list
includes enhanced intersections which are wider than existing street
cross-section because they include additional turn lanes. Enhanced
intersections are shown in Exhibit A-4. Street reclassifications and
intersection improvements other than enhanced intersections are shown
in Exhibit A-6. Street reclassifications include modification of Edinger
Avenue from a primary arterial to a major arterial, and reclassification of
Broadway from a secondary arterial to a residential collector from First
Street south to its intersection with Main Street to reflect the residential
character of the street. Exhibit A-7 shows new regional roadways and
transit corridors proposed for construction in Santa Ana.
Bikeway Master Plan
Numerous improvements to the existing system of bikeways are
identified in this Element in order to provide greater coverage and
improved system continuity, thereby enhancing the status of bikeways as
an integral component of the overall circulation system. On-street bicycle
lanes are planned only for location on major arterials where they can be
safely accommodated. These bicycle lanes vary in width from four feet to
seven feet wide depending on the available right-of-way. The City of Santa
Ana has established the following two classifications of bikeways which
generally correspond with the Orange County Transportation Authority
(OCTA) bikeway classifications:
   Class I Bikeway. Provides for bicycle travel on a right-of-way
    completely separated from the street.
   Class II Bikeway. Provides for a striped lane for one-way travel within
    the street right-of-way.
An existing Class I bikeway runs along the banks of the Santa Ana River,
the Southern Pacific railroad tracks to the south, the Santa Ana Gardens
Channel, Flower Street, and along Maple Street. Proposed Class I
CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN                                          A-23

CIRCULATION ELEMENT
bikeways are planned along Santiago Creek. A linkage to connect the
Maple Street trail to the Alton Street trails is also planned.
Class II bikeways are found along segments of Raitt Street, Greenville
Street, Ross Street, Chestnut Avenue, Santa Ana Boulevard, Fairview
Street, the O.C. Flood Control Channel, Flower Street, and Sunflower
Avenue. The Bikeway Master Plan is illustrated in Exhibit 2 provided in
the Policy Plan.
Implementation Programs
This section describes the implementation programs used to achieve the
goals of the Circulation Element.
    Intelligent Transportation System. The City has implemented an
     Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) to ameliorate traffic
     congestion. This system includes the use of closed circuit television
     surveillance cameras, electronic message signs, and radio as traffic
     advisory tools. An essential goal of this system is to provide “real time”
     information concerning congestion and incidents to motorists,
     thereby facilitating the choice of less-congested travel routes. The
     components that comprise the ITS are illustrated in Exhibit A-8.
    Air Quality Management Plan. The Clean Air Act (CAA) was
     adopted by the U.S. Congress to establish national air quality
     standards. Regional and local transportation plans and programs
     must conform to the State Implementation Plan and Air Quality
     Management Plan (AQMP) for the South Coast Air Basin. These plans
     identify strategies and programs to achieve air quality standards. The
     South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) is the
     agency responsible for developing an Air Quality Management Plan,
     and enforcing regulations for achieving National Ambient Air Quality
     Standards and California Air Quality Standards. Because of the
     importance of motor vehicles as a pollution source, substantial
     emphasis has been placed on reducing motor vehicle travel, and
     increasing vehicle ridership.

                                                          CIRCULATION ELEMENT
The City of Santa Ana will continue to participate in the regional planning
efforts being undertaken by the SCAQMD and the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) to develop and implement strategies
which improve regional air quality.
   Bikeway Master Plan. The City will continue to develop its bikeway
    system as outlined in this Circulation Element. The system of
    bikeways will include both the Class I and Class II facilities described
    herein. A proposed Class I bikeway is planned along Santiago Creek.
    Class II bikeways proposed in this Plan include extension of the
    existing bikeway along Santa Ana Boulevard from the Civic Center to
    the Santa Ana Transportation Center.
   Interagency Coordination of Transportation/Transit Planning.
    The City’s location at the hub of the Orange County transportation
    system means that Santa Ana’s transportation system, as well as its
    problems, are intertwined with those of surrounding cities. The
    Orange County Congestion Management Program (CMP),
    administered by OCTA, establishes service levels and standards for
    the regional transportation system, and requires that traffic impact
    analysis for new development identify impacts outside the local
    jurisdiction. Projects to upgrade the Santa Ana (I-5), San Diego (I-
    405), and Costa Mesa (SR-55) Freeways have involved extensive
    coordination between the cities and Caltrans. The City will coordinate
    efforts with Caltrans and OCTA in making improvements to the local
    freeway system and State highways which serve the planning area. The
    purpose of this undertaking is to ensure that the City is fully
    appraised of roadway and facility improvement efforts in the early
    stages of planning and design.
   Capital Improvement Program. The City’s Capital Improvement
    Program (CIP) is a seven-year plan which prioritizes and schedules
    significant capital expenditures. Individual projects are reviewed and
    ranked on an annual basis, and may include street-scape upgrades,
    installation of traffic signals, slurry seal for streets, sidewalk repair,
    and sewer line upgrades. The City will continue to update, review, and
    implement its CIP on an annual basis.
   Project Review. The City’s inter-agency project review process
    ensures that building design, architecture, and site layouts meet local
    regulations and are compatible with surrounding development, and
    that there are no unintended impacts upon the roadway system. This
    review process is also used to review and assess proposed
    transportation improvement projects which have the potential to
    impact adjacent land uses.

CIRCULATION ELEMENT
    Environmental Review. The City evaluates the environmental
     impacts of new development, and provides mitigation measures prior
     to development approval, as required by the California Environmental
     Quality Act (CEQA). Environmental review is provided for major
     projects and those with a potential to adversely impact the
     environment. Issue areas that are addressed in the environmental
     analysis process for all project reviews include potential impacts on
     traffic, public transit, and transportation-related infrastructure. In
     compliance with CEQA, the City requires appropriate mitigation and
     assigns responsibilities monitoring the implementation of mitigation
     measures.
    Joint Power Authorities. In cooperation with the City of Orange and
     the City of Tustin, Santa Ana has established two Joint Powers
     Authorities (JPA’s) to address land development and infrastructure
     issues which jointly affect these jurisdictions. In addition, Santa Ana is
     a member of the Inter-City Liaison Committee with the cities of
     Irvine, Tustin, Costa Mesa, and Newport Beach in order to facilitate
     the sharing of information about common issues which affect the
     South Coast Metro, Irvine Business Complex, and John Wayne Airport
     areas. Each of these entities address common concerns such as major
     development plans, cost-sharing arrangements, and technical
     coordination of transportation improvement projects. Developments
     and circulation improvements that occur within the designated JPA
     boundaries are coordinated through the process outlined by the
     authority.
    Mitigation Fees. The City will implement local and regional
     requirements for project mitigation fees to ensure that the public does
     not bear undue financial burdens to facilitate new development. The
     City assesses new development the costs of providing any additional
     transportation-related infrastructure required to service the project.
    Parking Studies. An adequate supply of parking is essential to the
     economic success of businesses. However, parking is an integral
     component of the total circulation system rather than an independent
     element. Parking needs are evaluated, as necessary, to determine
     needed changes based upon changing circumstances in land use
     patterns and the public’s mode of travel. To enhance safety and
     optimize traffic operations, on-street parking is removed from arterial
     streets wherever feasible.
    Neighborhood Permit Parking Program. In residential areas,
     parking permit programs are used as a means of ensuring that
     sufficient on-street parking is available for local residents, by
     restricting non-resident parking during specific time periods.

                                                          CIRCULATION ELEMENT
   Parkway and Street Maintenance. The City has a comprehensive
    program for maintaining major traffic corridors in the City. The
    program identifies guidelines for landscaping median and parkway
    areas, street furniture, lighting, and other street-scape improvements.
    The City has also prioritized the relocation of above-ground utilities
    underground.
   Roadway Improvement Program. This Circulation Element
    identifies significant roadway improvements that are considered as
    part of its implementation. Recommendations include the changes to
    the MPSH identified in Exhibit A-6.
   Transportation Demand Management. Santa Ana has adopted a
    Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Ordinance which is
    designed to reduce peak travel demands associated with commuter
    trips. Employers of 100 or more persons in any new development are
    subject to the TDM ordinance and are required to implement
    programs to aid in reducing peak hour traffic demands based upon
    the traffic volumes generated by their project. Collectively, these
    efforts can be expected to result in lower peak traffic volumes on City
    streets. The City continues to support strategies included in the TDM
    program which can lessen the need for peak period travel.
   Neighborhood Traffic Management Program. In residential areas
    that experience significant commuter or “cut-through” traffic on local
    streets, the City conducts a traffic impact assessment and a traffic plan
    is developed in accordance with California Vehicle Code Section
    21101(f) and the rules and regulations contained in Resolution 2004-
    53, as they may be amended from time to time. The traffic plan may
    include traffic diverters or other roadway design features to reduce
    “cut-through” traffic.
   Signage Program. The City is working with Caltrans and the County
    of Orange to develop a signage program that assists in guiding visitors
    and residents to major activity centers in the City. The program
    promotes the installation of signs at key intersections, and selected
    locations along arterial roadways indicating key shopping areas,
    cultural attractions, and points of interest for visitors to the City. The
    program is designed to direct visitors to the City’s activity centers
    from the adjacent freeway system.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
LOCAL ROADWAY SYSTEM
The local roadway system is a significant component of the City’s
circulation network because of the multiple travel modes that it
accommodates. In addition to providing travel corridors for automobiles,
buses, and bicycles, the roadways provide right-of-way for pedestrian
travel via the parkway sidewalk system. The components of the
Circulation System discussed below, in conjunction with the local
roadways, function to provide a range of travel alternatives for the City’s
residents, employees, and visitors.
PUBLIC TRANSIT
The City of Santa Ana is well served by public transit services offered by
the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA). Key elements of
this transit service include the following:
    Fixed Route Bus Service. An extensive network of fixed-route transit
     service is provided in Santa Ana due to its central location in Orange
     County. The Santa Ana Transit Terminal is the hub of public transit
     service for the County, and is a central transfer point for many of the
     bus lines. In addition to the bus routes that traverse the City, many
     routes also serve the periphery of the City. Exhibit A-9 illustrates the
     streets served by local and express bus routes. All of the routes that
     enter the Downtown/Civic Center area stop at the Santa Ana Transit
     Terminal located at Ross Street and Santa Ana Boulevard.
    Access Service. In addition to fixed-route transit service, OCTA also
     provides demand-responsive service through OCTA Access. OCTA
     Access provides disabled individuals with door-to-door service
     anywhere in Orange County.
    Transit Alternatives. The Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center
     is located at Santa Ana Boulevard and Santiago Avenue. It serves as a
     transfer point for OCTA buses, Metrolink, and Amtrak. The Santa Ana
     Transit Terminal is located near 5th Street and Ross Street, and serves
     as a transfer point for OCTA buses.
TRUCK ROUTES
Streets designated as truck routes in Santa Ana are illustrated in Exhibit
A-10. These routes include local routes, and the terminal access routes for
“super trucks”. Some of the “super trucks” exceed the maximum weight
allowed and are not permitted on the local routes.

PARKING FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS
Parking facilities are an essential component of the vehicular circulation
system. Historically, parking has been provided along the streetside and
in off-street parking lots. In recent years, however, parking along arterial
streets has increasingly been removed for safety reasons and to provide
more traffic capacity. Key factors related to parking that are considered in
this Circulation Element include the following:
   On-street Parking. In Santa Ana today, on-street parking is
    prohibited on principal, major, primary, and secondary arterials
    wherever possible. Parking is permitted on local streets unless
    specifically prohibited.
   Permit Parking Program. The City has established a permit parking
    program in response to parking intrusion into single-family
    neighborhoods from adjacent developments. The City has numerous
    neighborhood permit parking districts included in this program.
    Within these districts, on-street parking is regulated to ensure that
    spillover parking demands do not prevent local residents from
    parking on the street.
   Off-street Parking. Off-street parking standards are established
    during the Development Review Process. The number of required off-
    street parking spaces for new or modified developments are
    identified, as are the minimum dimensions for parking spaces.
   Park and Ride. The City has two park-and-ride facilities for those
    who choose to car-pool or use public transportation to reach their
    destinations: the parking structure adjacent to the Santa Ana Transit
    Terminal, and the parking lots at the Regional Transportation Center
    which are primarily for the use of rail patrons. Several public parking
    structures are also provided by the City in the Downtown area. These
    public structures are illustrated in Exhibit A-11 along with park-and-
    ride facilities.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM
The City of Santa Ana is served by four freeways: the Santa Ana (I-5), the
Garden Grove (SR-22), the Costa Mesa (SR-55), and the Orange (SR-57)
Freeways. These freeways are located near the northern, eastern and
southern boundaries of the City and carry commuters into the City, as
well as to the surrounding region. Local roadways in the City generally
form a grid pattern in north-south and east-west directions. Major streets
are within one-half-mile or one-mile intervals, and interrupted mainly by
the freeways and the Santa Ana River. Major freeways serving the City of
Santa Ana include the following:
    The Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) traverses the northeastern section of
     the City and has up to 12 lanes between the Garden Grove Freeway
     (SR-22) and the Costa Mesa Freeway (SR-55). Construction of the
     segment north of the Orange Crush (I-5, SR-57, SR-22) interchange is
     expected to be completed within 5 years. The recently completed
     widening project on the Santa Ana Freeway provides car pool lanes
     and improved interchanges.
    The Orange Freeway (SR-57) is a north south freeway that ends at
     the northern boundary of Santa Ana. This freeway has 10 lanes,
     including 2 car pool lanes, and runs through the eastern section of
     Los Angeles County. This freeway is being considered to be extended
     along the Santa Ana River from the Garden Grove Freeway (SR-22) to
     the San Diego Freeway (I-405).
    The Garden Grove Freeway (SR-22) is an east-west freeway running
     near the northern City limits. This freeway has 6 lanes, widening to 8
     lanes at its interchange with the Santa Ana (I-5) Freeway.
    The Costa Mesa Freeway (SR-55) runs north-south along the eastern
     edge of the City. This freeway has 8 lanes widening to 10 and 12 lanes
     between the Santa Ana (I-5) and San Diego (I-405) Freeways. The
     widening to 10 lanes of the segment between Riverside Freeway (SR-
     91) and the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) is underway.
    The San Diego Freeway (I-405) runs east-west, just south of the City
     and merges with the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) approximately 15 miles
     southeast of the City. This freeway has 6 lanes and runs in an east
     southeast direction from Los Angeles County ultimately connecting
     with the I-5 Freeway.
    The San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor is a toll road from
     the Corona del Mar Freeway (SR-73) near the City’s southern
     boundary and extending southeast through Irvine, Laguna Hills, and
     Laguna Niguel, and connecting to the Santa Ana (I-5) Freeway at San
     Juan Capistrano.

Santa Ana was connected    Santa Ana is crossed by several rail lines which are used-for three types of
   to Los Angeles by rail  operations: commuter rail (Metrolink), passenger rail (Amtrak), and
          service in 1878. freight rail. Exhibit A-12 illustrates the rail routes through the City. Key
                           components of the rail system serving the City and issues related to this
                           Circulation Element includes the following:
                               Metrolink. Metrolink trains run during the morning and evening
                                rush hours on weekdays only. Three trains travel northbound to
                                Union Station in downtown Los Angeles in the morning and three
                                trains travel southbound to Oceanside in the evening. Metrolink
                                trains use the same station as Amtrak trains in Santa Ana. OCTA bus
                                routes connect with Metrolink trains at the Santa Ana Regional
                                Transportation Center.
                               Future Urban Rail Systems. OCTA has currently completed a Major
                                Investment Study to evaluate the feasibility and cost effectiveness of
                                urban rail, and other potential improvements in the north-south
                                corridor through central Orange County. When an urban rail system
                                is developed, it will likely serve major activity centers in the southern
                                portion of the City, the Civic Center, the Downtown, and the northern
                                portion of the City. Local bus routes will be routed to provide riders
                                with convenient access to urban rail stations.
                               Amtrak. Amtrak provides passenger service in the Los Angeles-to-San
                                Diego corridor, operating nine trains daily in each direction, with a
                                stop at the Regional Transportation Center.
                               Freight Rail. Freight rail service is provided by the Union Pacific.
                                Amtrak trains use the BN&SF railroad tracks, and operate eight trains
                                to Los Angeles and 8 trains to San Diego daily. The Union Pacific lines
                                are used by approximately 3 to 4 trains per day. Train activity is largely
                                dependent upon customer demand.
                           AIRPORTS
                           The John Wayne/Orange County Airport is located just southeast of the
                           City of Santa Ana. It is a commercial aviation airport served by several
                           commercial air carriers and commuter airlines. The airport is also a base
                           for some 1,000 personal and business aircraft, and 30 helicopters. It is
                           estimated that 7.3 million passengers and 19,822 tons of cargo passed
                           through the airport during 1996. Also, 452,955 aircraft flights were made
                           during 1996 or 1,241 planes per day. By the year 2000, it is estimated that
                           8.4 million passengers will be using John Wayne Airport. Other
                           commercial airports serving the City are Los Angeles International
                           Airport, Ontario Airport, Long Beach Airport and Burbank Airport.

EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
A citywide computerized travel demand forecasting model has been
developed to aid in planning appropriate street improvements. This
model is a tool which estimates traffic volumes on the City’s arterial street
system, based on land development patterns and intensities in the City
and surrounding region. The baseline existing conditions scenario in the
model reflects the 1992 land use and transportation system in the City.
    Existing Traffic Volumes. Traffic counts used to evaluate existing
     conditions were collected in 1991 prior to initiation of construction
     activities along the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) which have substantially
     altered normal traffic patterns in the City.
    Santa Ana Freeway. The I-5 carries the highest freeway traffic volume
     within the City, with 238,000 daily vehicles north of Grand Avenue.
     The most heavily traveled arterial within the City is MacArthur
     Boulevard which carries volumes of 44,800 west of the Costa Mesa
     Freeway (SR-55). Several arterial roadways within the City currently
     have daily traffic volumes in excess of 40,000 vehicles. These roadways
     include Seventeenth Street, Fairview Street, Harbor Boulevard, and
     Bristol Street.
    Level of Service. To evaluate congestion, morning and afternoon
     peak hour Levels of Service (LOS) were calculated for 99 key
     intersections throughout the City. The analysis determined that
     congestion is experienced throughout the City, especially during the
     PM peak hour. Additional information concerning levels of service on
     local roadways is provided in the Circulation Element EIR.
    CMP Intersections. There are five Congestion Management Plan
     (CMP) designated intersections located in Santa Ana. They consist of
     First Street at Harbor Boulevard, First Street at the northbound Santa
     Ana Freeway (I-5), First Street at the I-5 Freeway (southbound),
     Edinger Avenue at the southbound Costa Mesa Freeway (SR-55), and
     Warner Avenue at Harbor Boulevard.
    Increased Traffic. The City has experienced significant population
     growth in the past several decades. At the same time, a number of
     commercial and employment centers have been developed in the City,
     and additional development is envisioned in the near term. This
     population growth and new development occurred years after the
     City’s roadway network was constructed. Because of the nature and
     extent of existing development, there are limited opportunities to
     expand or otherwise improve the City’s roadway system.
    Roadway Improvements. The County of Orange and Caltrans are
     working with a number of Orange County cities to improve the
A-48                                            CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN

    efficiency or expand the capacity of selected major arterial roadways.
    A number of widening projects are planned in the City for Fairview
    Street, McFadden Avenue, Bristol Street, Grand Avenue, and Edinger
    Avenue, as well as realignments of selected roadway segments.
FUTURE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
The Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH) is the official map for
transportation planning purposes for the Orange County Transportation
Authority. The classification of arterial streets within each city in the
County is required to be consistent with the MPAH. The type, location,
and intensity of land development determines the demand for circulation
and influences travel mode choices. The Circulation Element therefore
plans for a transportation system which will serve the needs of the
development envisioned in the Land Use Element.
Future traffic volumes on the arterial street system were forecast using a
traffic model developed for the City assuming the development of
planned land uses and programmed transportation improvements. The
results of the modeling efforts to assure consistency between 2010 land
use and circulation systems are discussed below.
   Even though the City of Santa Ana is almost completely built-out, the
    Land Use Element envisions redevelopment and new development
    within selected areas of the City. The increased intensity of land use
    over time can be expected to generate additional traffic. Under these
    conditions, congestion can be expected to increase in some areas
    unless steps are taken to provide additional system capacity or to
    reduce travel demands.
   The future land use scenario represents development expected by the
    Year 2010, reflecting the types and intensities of uses reflected in the
    Land Use Element of Santa Ana’s General Plan. The forecast assumes
    completion of transportation network improvements detailed in
    Santa Ana’s seven-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP), as well as
    other improvement projects in Orange County currently under
    construction or programmed for construction by 2010.
   The magnitude of future traffic demands at each of the intersections
    evaluated in the City was estimated with the citywide traffic
    forecasting model. This baseline analysis of future conditions
    measured peak levels of service at the study intersections assuming
    that travel demand characteristics and intersection lane
    configurations would be the same as they were in the base year. This
    evaluation indicated that, assuming these future conditions, 64 of the
    evaluated intersections would operate at LOS E or F during at least
    one of the peak hours.
CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN                                          A-49

CIRCULATION ELEMENT
    If the circulation system is expected to adequately serve the future
     travel demands which the Land Use Plan would generate, the City will
     need to significantly upgrade system capacity or reduce peak travel
     demands. A second traffic forecast was prepared to evaluate the
     effects of enhancing roadway capacity by widening congested
     intersections and fully implementing the City’s current TDM
     ordinance. Volumes on the Santa Ana Freeway are projected to be
     419,000 north of Seventeenth Street. The most heavily traveled
     arterial is Bristol Street which is projected to carry volumes of 63,000
     south of SR-22. Several other arterials are projected to carry volumes
     of over 50,000 vehicles, including MacArthur Boulevard, Fourth
     Street, Harbor Boulevard, and Seventeenth Street.
    With the recommended improvements, 31 of the study intersections
     are projected to operate at an unacceptable level of service (LOS E or
     F) during at least one of the peak hours. Almost all of the congestion
     is experienced during the PM peak hour. None of the five designated
     Congestion Management Plan (CMP) intersections is projected to
     experience capacity problems.

SUMMARY
The new City of Santa Ana General Plan was developed through an extensive
process of public participation involving citizens, elected and appointed City
officials and City Staff.
The General Plan has been developed to conform to state law and to meet local
planning needs through the year 2000. Periodic updates of the new General Plan
are anticipated.
The General Plan builds upon Santa Ana’s historical assets including the City’s
heritage as the governmental and financial center of Orange County and the
buildings, districts and streetscapes which reflect this heritage.
The General Plan anticipates two major potentials that can shape Santa Ana over
the next several decades. The plan anticipates and maximizes the probability of
the Countywide rapid transit system to be located in Santa Ana and encourages
mixed use development and preservation m corridors and centers relating to this
new access and visibility.
The General Plan has three major sections: the Framework Plan, Policy Plan, and
Environmental Impact Report.
1. The Framework Plan describes Santa Ana’s overall planning strategy and
     program. This strategy reorganizes the City’s land use and urban design
     structure to take maximum advantage of:
         the economic development advantages offered by Santa Ana’s historic
          regional location and functions
         an improved multi-modal transportation system including:
          –   Countywide rapid transit access to Santa Ana
          –   improved local transit
          –   improved auto access to major activity centers
          –   a new Amtrak station
          –   a downtown multi-modal transportation and bus center

       –    a downtown shuttle system
       –    new pedestrian connections within and between land use districts
            and to public transportation facilities.
   The Framework Plan provides an overview of the City’s implementation
   program which includes:
      continuing involvement of the community in developing the detailed
       implementation plans that will be developed for subareas of the
       Framework Plan
      efficient processing of development and rehabilitation proposals by
       means of a Development Review Team
      a carefully coordinated development program to foster and assist private
       investment through:
       –    land assembly
       –    coordinated provision of public improvements
       –    Specific Plans
       –    citizen participation coordination
       –    low interest loans and grants
       –    project promotion
2. The Policy Plan spells out the:
      goals and objectives which underlie the Framework Plan
      greater detail regarding implementation policies and programs
       supporting the Framework Plan.
   Together, the Framework Plan and Policy Plan envision a new image for
   Santa Ana consisting of:
      increased economic activity to provide jobs and maintain a solid financial
       base for city services
      improvement of Santa Ana’s housing stock for a full range of income
       groups and lifestyles
      the finest multi-modal transportation system in Orange County
      a new physical environment consisting of:
       –    preserved and enhanced viable Neighborhoods
       –    District Centers combining new shopping facilities with
            recreational, cultural, education, employment and special housing
            types
       –    improvement of Santa Ana’s major Industrial Districts
       –    Mixed Use Corridors with a range of uses similar to the District
            Centers but with more facilities related to regional transit and auto
            access.

PLANNING CONTEXT
HISTORICAL
Santa Ana’s rich history provides a legacy for community planning and
revitalization in the 1980’s. Santa Ana was founded in 1869 by William Spurgeon.
The original town, laid out by Mr. Spurgeon, consisted of 24 blocks. The town
served as a shopping center and post office for surrounding agricultural areas.
In 1878 the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived and the Santa Fe Railroad followed
in 1886. This encouraged development of the City. In 1889 the County seat was
located in Santa Ana and this further stimulated the development of businesses,
stores, financial institutions and hotels serving the metropolitan population.
Citrus and walnut farms were still plentiful and buying and selling land became
the number one enterprise. The First to 17th Street area was subdivided during
the building boom of the 1880’s. Many of the structures in downtown and the
surrounding bungalow homes were built in the early 1900’s and 1920’s.
The City is retaining and building upon its important governmental, retailing and
employment roles in the County and the rich architectural and streetscapes
heritage associated with the City’s history.
REGIONAL
Santa Ana is geographically central to the developable land within Orange
County. The City has excellent relationships to freeways, rail services via Amtrak
and air transportation at the John Wayne Airport. Because of Santa Ana’s
geographic centrality and functional importance to the County, the Orange
County Transit District is planning major fixed rail transit corridors in the Main
Street and Pacific Electric right-of-ways. These regional transportation
improvements, combined with improvements to freeway access points and local
streets, provide Santa Ana with abundant development opportunities for the
1980’s.

                                                          CONSERVATION ELEMENT
PLANNING PROCESS
The Planning Process used in creating the Santa Ana General Plan is
summarized in Exhibit 3 and related photographs. The process involved:
        a 150-person Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) to which all citizens
         applying were appointed by the City Council
        the Planning Commissioners who served as chairpersons of five CAC
         subcommittees: Land Use and Urban Design, Circulation, Housing,
         Economic Development and Environmental Factors
        the City Council who participated in goal setting and policy making
         workshops
        the public-at-large who participated in a series of Town Forums and
         Public Hearings
        City Staff who worked with The Arroyo Group (TAG) in conducting the
         planning process and who evaluated the program as it evolved.
The six key steps in the planning process were:
1. Data Collection and Analysis. The data base for the previous General Plan
    was outdated and up-to-date census data was not available. Emphasis was
    placed on community definition of problems and opportunities through CAC
    and Staff Steering Committee workshops and mapping. TAG subcontractors
    also gathered key data in areas such as market demand, traffic, seismic, etc.
    This data was summarized and analyzed in a separate Problems and
    Opportunities Report.
2. Formulation of Goals and Objectives. Initial goals and objectives were
    developed through workshops, with the CAC and City staff. Several cycles of
    refinement were done by TAG based on input from the Planning
    Commission, City Council, CAC and staff.
3. Formulation of Subarea Alternatives. Santa Ana has a large number of fixed
    elements such as streets and land uses. Therefore, subarea plans were
    developed to provide alternative land use patterns in different parts of the
    City. Each subarea plan was related to an urban design framework previously
    approved by the CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
4. Formulation of Areawide General Plan Alternatives. Areawide General Plan
    alternatives focused on different combinations of subarea plans.
5. Plan Selection Plan. Selection was done through a series of meetings with the
    CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
6. Plan Refinement. Plan refinement was accomplished by staff review of a
    Preliminary Draft, and CAC, Planning Commission and Public-at-Large
    comments on a Public Hearing Draft.

POLICY PLAN
INTRODUCTION
The Policy Plan section of the General Plan sets forth the detailed policies of the
City relative to the framework Plan described in Section 1.
Each element of the Policy Plan contains goals, objectives, implementation
policies and implementation programs.
Each element also contains a Planning Factors section which reflects the major
issues identified through the citizen participation process.
The Plan Components section of each element describes the planning and design
concepts illustrated in the maps and provides an overview of implementation
considerations.
The Conservation element is concerned with the protection, utilization and
development of natural and cultural resources. It emphasizes scarce resources and
those needing special attention or management, and aims to prevent their
exploitation, neglect or destruction.

PLANNING FACTORS
Santa Ana is a built-up, urban community. As a result, readily-apparent resources,
such as natural habitat and wildlife, are limited. Certain stretches of Santiago
Creek offer undisturbed plant and wildlife environments. Open space lands held
for park and recreational uses offer important opportunities for enjoyment of a
rare urban resource: open space. Other natural resources for which conservation
efforts are appropriate are more difficult to see; they include clean air, water, and
land itself.
Man-made resources appropriate for conservation are more plentiful in an urban
environment than natural ones. Such resources include relics of our pre-history;
examples of our early building and living styles; historic and current contributions
to our cultural life; and our use of buildings, space and life forms to stimulate our
aesthetic senses.
Both natural and man-made resources are important to the quality of life enjoyed
by Santa Ana’s residents.
PLAN COMPONENTS
Major features of the Conservation element include protection of the public
health, safety and welfare through effective management of natural resources such
as clean air, water and land; preservation of those natural and cultural resources
existing today, such as waterways, natural habitats, open spaces, historic buildings
and pre-historic remains; and enhancement of the City’s aesthetic and visual
amenities through increased use of vegetation and restoration of historic and
cultural resources.
Conservation concerns are closely related to open space and recreation objectives.
The following element deals with these matters. Conservation objectives also are
related to recommendations found in the Scenic Corridors element, which seeks
to preserve and enhance natural and man-made resources found in travel
corridors throughout the City.

Economic Development
Element
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The Economic Development Element strives to address critical issues pertaining
to the City’s economic base; that is, jobs, business and industry, and the real estate
market, all of which contribute to the local tax base. The Element provides a
blueprint for directing the City’s economic development initiatives over the long
term through the year 2010, based upon the strengths in the local economy. The
Element’s long-range vision lays the foundation for more immediate, short-term
strategies related to specific geographic subareas, and/or clusters of business and
industry which present particular economic development challenges or
opportunities. These include the City Community Development Agency annual
economic development objectives, and quarterly Geobased Revenue Information
Program (GRIP) economic development strategies reflective of the latest
economic market shifts and trends. It is designed to complement the Land Use
Plan in the Land Use Element.
The Economic Development Element is one of five optional elements included in
the General Plan because of the heavy emphasis placed by the City upon cost/
revenue and cost/benefit issues. This can be viewed as the “business” aspect of
providing necessary public services to the community. The strategic economic
development approach to planning looks toward attracting and retaining
businesses which pay their own way from a quantitative cost/revenue perspective,
while at the same time providing more qualitative community benefits.

                              The Economic Development Element is presented in four sections. The body of
                              the Element is a summary of the opportunities and constraints which shape the
                              City’s economic development policy, as well as the policy framework which
                              guides the decision-making process. Each section of the Element is summarized
                              below:

COMMUNITY FACTORS
As indicated by the Land Use Element, Santa Ana is a predominantly “built-out”
City with limited potential for land assembly to facilitate major new development.
At the same time it possesses the resources and ability to create economic
opportunity for community residents and businesses alike. The City is fortunate
to have a strong and diverse economy supported by a large, skilled workforce. City
government has been innovative and progressive in establishing a business-
friendly atmosphere supported by exemplary programs and services in the areas of
development permit processing, redevelopment, cultural arts, and employment
training.
In 1993, the City successfully competed for and received designation as one of
                                                                                        Since 1990, the largest

                                                                                        The largest private employer

U.S. Foreign Trade Zone.
ECONOMIC BASE CHARACTERISTICS
Sales and use taxes combined represent approximately one-third of the City’s
general revenues. Sales and use tax is generated primarily from the retail and
business-to-business sectors of Santa Ana’s economic base. Retail businesses
generate approximately 53 percent of sales and use taxes received by the City,
while the business-to-business sector generates 34 percent. It is interesting to note
that the City’s top two sales/use tax generators are not engaged in retail sales
activities at all. On a statewide basis, fully 36 percent of all taxable sales receipts
come from non-retail transactions, including business-to-business sales, mail
order sales and internet sales. This has led previously completed economic
strategies and analyses, as well as the current Economic Development Element, to
recommend the targeting of high net revenue generating firms outside of the
retail trade sector to augment ongoing retail business attraction efforts by the City.
Other important issues related to the City’s economic base identified below.
    A Target Industry Analysis was conducted in 1993 which identified Santa
     Ana as having a competitive locational advantage over three other selected
     markets—City of Irvine, City of Los Angeles, and the U.S. as a whole for
     those products or services depicted in Exhibit 2. Examples of sectors having a
     high competitive advantage for Santa Ana include Publishing and Apparel &
     Textiles. In addition, the matrix shows sectors with significant growth
     potential such as Software & Telecommunications which are also relatively
     high on the competitive scale.

                               ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
                                  The downward trend in unadjusted dollars of total City revenues began to
                                   turn around in 1994, reaching $8.4 Million in 1995, although not yet
                                   approaching the historic 1986 high point of $9.7 Million. The revenue decline
                                   can be attributed both to structural economic conditions related to the
                                   regional real estate recession, as well as to demographic factors including
                                   increased ethnic diversity, a lower median age, and a growth in the average
                                   number of persons per household.
                                  Employment within City increased by 8.6 percent between 1984 and 1997 to
                                   142,050 Citywide. Once again, structural changes can be seen in the City’s
                                   three largest sectors including losses in manufacturing jobs as labor-intensive
                                   industries relocated to less-urbanized areas, as well as gains in unskilled jobs.
                                   During this period, the overall share of manufacturing jobs decreased by 2.9
                                   percent. While retail trade and service jobs increased by 0.8 percent
                                   respectively.

                               SALES/USE TAX CHARACTERISTICS
                               With sales and use taxes comprising such a large share of revenues generated by
                               the business sector, it is not surprising that the City places a heavy economic
                               development emphasis upon sales tax. Issues related to sales and use taxes include
                               the following:
                                  Santa Ana’s per capita taxable sales receipts from All Outlets during 1996
                                   were $9,400 compared to $9,915 for the State of California as a whole, a
                                   difference of $515 annually. The Retail Stores category experienced a much
                                   greater disparity of $970 annually.
                                  The Orange County market is ranked 14th in the entire U.S. for the survey’s
                                   other key variable, “Effective Buying Income” (EBI). Santa Ana’s Buying
                                   Power Index is exceeded by only two other cities in the county, Anaheim and
                                   Huntington Beach, while its EBI is lower than only those two communities,
                                   in addition to Irvine and Newport Beach.
                                  During 1996, Santa Ana’s per capita taxable sales generated from All Outlets
                                   was $9,400 annually, $5,384 of which came from Retail Stores. A substantial
                                   loss of potential sales, and consequently sales tax revenue to the City, stems
                                   from the great difference between per capita sales in Santa Ana compared to
                                   the larger Orange County trade area. The City figures are 23.9 percent lower
                                   than the County for All Outlets, and 27.1 percent lower for Retail Stores.

                                                  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
   While the City did relatively well in terms of receipts from All Outlets, which
    includes business-to-business sales and use taxes, it did not compete as
    effectively for Retail Sales dollars a number of major categories exhibited
    significant differences in Automotive and General Merchandise Sales, where
    the City was lower than the County by 35.3 percent and 41.9 percent
    respectively.
   The retail problem is compounded when Santa Ana is contrasted with
    bordering communities. Santa Ana ranks fifth among six central county cities
    in annual per capita sales, exceeding only Garden Grove, while lagging
    behind Costa Mesa, Tustin, Fountain Valley, and Orange.
LABOR MARKET CHARACTERISTICS
The California State Employment Development Department estimated Santa
Ana’s total labor force at 153,750 for December, 1997, with 6,980 persons
unemployed. The City’s unemployment rate of 4.5 percent is higher than that of
Orange County at 2.5 percent, but still very low relative to the nation as a whole.
The City’s available labor supply is projected to grow to over 237,000 by the year
2010 according to the Center for Demographic Research at California State
University, Fullerton. Other labor market issues include the following:
   Over one half of City residents are employed in the Manufacturing and Retail
    Trade sectors of the economy. Only about one quarter are engaged in
    Professional, Technical, and/or Managerial positions.
   The labor force characteristics indicate two somewhat opposing conditions
    from an economic development perspective. First, at over 150,000, the City
    possesses a huge inventory of workers, which is attractive to labor-intensive
    business and industrial establishments. On the other hand, the relatively low
    education and training levels of the resident workforce leaves room for
    improvement.
   The City of Santa Ana is addressing this structural imbalance through a
    variety of skills training and vocational education programs overseen by the
    Santa Ana Private Industry Council, the local agency responsible for
    administering the Federal Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) funds and
    programs. The City also provides tax and skills training incentives to firms
    located within the Enterprise Zone who agree to hire eligible workers.

                            COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL REAL ESTATE TRENDS
                            The central Orange County real estate market for office, industrial (including
                            manufacturing, warehouse, and research and development), and retail space with
                            Santa Ana strategically located at its geographic hub - is expected to improve
                            dramatically across all three sectors during 1998. Net absorption of space and
                            rental rates are anticipated to increase significantly, with concomitant declines in

                            Element includes the following:
                               The central county subarea compares very favorably with the total County in
                                both the industrial and the retail categories. Vacancy rates for industrial space
                                are only 4.4 percent lower and 0.6 percent lower respectively for the subarea,
                                while average monthly rents are only 1.9 percent lower and 3.5 percent lower
                                respectively. The central orange county area with Santa Ana at its core,
                                maintains a strong competitive position for businesses engaged in
                                manufacturing, distribution, research and development, and retail sales
                                activities. The subarea’s market strength is attributed to its proximity to air,
                                rail, and ground transportation resources, as well as its greater population
                                density relative to the remainder of the County.
                               Income levels are generally lower in the subarea. Santa Ana is a primary
                                beneficiary of Orange County’s strong real estate market conditions in terms
                                of economic development potential for retail and industrial land uses.
                               The situation for office space and office tenant attraction, on the other hand,
In 1930 the City issued 107
   building permits with a
                                shows room for improvement. Central Orange County’s office vacancy rate of
      valuation of $92,118.     17.0 percent is 7.6 percent higher than that of the County. It is important to
                                note, however, that significant corporate headquarters relocations to Santa
                                Ana (PacifiCare Health Systems), and to have recently taken place. These
                                moves may well be a harbinger of change for the Central County office
                                market due to its potential cost savings (15.7 percent lower average monthly
                                rents) over the County as a whole.
                               Santa Ana’s freeway convenience and its nearness to John Wayne Airport (as
                                well as the El Toro Marine Base, should a second commercial airport be built
                                there) should place it near the top of the list for consideration as an office site

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
GLOSSARY
Business-to-Business Sales. Transactions falling outside of the consumer retail
marketplace including chemicals, high-tech equipment, paper products,
construction materials, industrial machinery, copiers, computers, test equipment,
and medical products. At times, the sales and use taxes on such goods are
erroneously reported to the State of California, rather than the City, resulting in a
loss of revenue to the City as the funds collected become part of a countywide
pool shared by individual jurisdictions on a prorata basis.
Discretionary and Non-Discretionary Taxes. Discretionary taxes are those
revenue sources over which the City has direct authority to increase, decrease, or
eliminate altogether. These include business license tax, transient occupancy
(bed) tax, utility user tax, and franchise fees (such as cable television). Non-
discretionary taxes, on the other hand, are those revenue sources that are
controlled by the State of California such as property tax and sales/use tax.
High Net Revenue Generating Firms. Businesses which create an excess of tax
revenues over and above the cost for the City to provide necessary public services.
Examples include business-to-business with point of sale/use tax, hotels and
motels, automobile dealers, and retail establishments.
Labor-Intensive Industry. Land uses, such as manufacturing, which tend to
employ large numbers of workers per acre of land or per square foot of building
space.
Per Capita Taxable Sales. Dollar value of total taxable transactions divided by
total resident population.
Sales and Use Taxes. California’s sales tax, paid by retailers engaged in business
in the State, applies to all retail transactions except those specifically exempted by
law. The use tax applies to the storage, use, or other consumption in this State of
goods purchased at retail outside of the State without payment of California sales
tax. Use tax also may apply to purchases shipped to a California consumer from
another state. The statewide rate for both the sales and use tax is currently 7.25
percent (combined state and local rates, exclusive of special district rates). The
Orange County Transportation Authority receives an additional 0.5 percent,
bringing total sales and use taxes to 7.75 percent in Santa Ana and other cities in
the County. The City of Santa Ana receives a 1.0 percent share of the total levy.
Structural Labor Market Changes. Internal shifts in the relative composition of
the local market between the various major sectors, such as retail trade,
manufacturing, and services. The local share of Manufacturing jobs, for example,
has declined in recent years, while employment in the Services sector has
increased.

SANTA ANA COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY
An administrative arm of City government, this organization is responsible for
carrying out redevelopment programs in six separate project areas spread
throughout the City, and comprising over 5,000 acres of land area. Each project
area includes an implementation plan which governs the programs and activities
provided by the Agency within its boundaries. The Agency’s primary purpose is to
spur business growth and community revitalization by eliminating conditions of
physical and economic blight. The Agency provides many development incentives
including rehabilitation loans, tax exempt bonds, site assembly assistance, and
infrastructure improvements.
SANTA ANA ENTERPRISE ZONE
Designated by the State of California in 1993, businesses located within this
7,000-acre zone are provided with an assortment of financial incentives including
sales and use tax credits, manufacturing investment credits, hiring credits,
business expense deductions, net operating loss carryovers, net interest deductions
for lenders, and employee and salary reimbursements for on-the-job training.

FOREIGN TRADE ZONE #50 - SANTA ANA SUBZONE
The 90-acre site, situated within both the Enterprise Zone and a redevelopment
project area, is a subzone of U.S. Foreign Zone #50 located in Long Beach, and
served by the Port of Long Beach. The FTZ offers import duty reductions on
products which are re-exported from the zone after value is added through
testing, calibration, or reassembly.
SOUTHLAND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
A non-profit organization established in 1982 by the City and local business
interests, the EDC is a self-funding U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)
Certified Development Corporation which works in cooperation with local banks
to provide long-term, fixed asset financing to small businesses.
ORANGE COUNTY SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER
(SBDC)
Originally built by the City utilizing a combination of redevelopment and federal
grant funds, the facility is now operated by the Rancho Santiago Community
College District under license from the State of California Department of
Commerce. The SBDC provides business counseling and educational services to
students enrolled in community college courses.
EXISTING CONDITIONS
As indicated by the Land Use Element, Santa Ana is a predominantly “built-out”
city with limited potential for land assembly to facilitate major new development.
At the same time it possesses the resources and ability to create economic
opportunity for community residents and businesses alike. The City is fortunate
to have a strong and diverse economy supported by a large, skilled workforce. City
government has been innovative and progressive in establishing a business-
friendly atmosphere supported by exemplary programs and services in the areas of
development permit processing, redevelopment, cultural arts, and employment
training. In 1993, the City successfully competed for and received designation as
one of only 27 Enterprise Zones in the State of California. The City’s Enterprise
Zone has since won both state and national awards for excellence after its first five
years of operation. Augmenting the City’s long history and commitment to
economic development, the zone provides financial as well as other incentives to
business and industry choosing to locate or expand within its boundaries. The
City also offers import duty savings on materials and equipment to firms located
within its U.S. Foreign Trade Zone.

ECONOMIC BASE CHARACTERISTICS
Sales and use taxes combined represent approximately one-third of the City’s
general revenues. Sales and use tax is generated primarily from the retail and
business-to-business sectors of Santa Ana’s economic base. Retail businesses
generate approximately 53 percent of sales and use taxes received by the City,
while the business-to-business sector generates 34 percent. It is interesting to note
that the City’s top two sales/use tax generators are not engaged in retail sales
activities at all. On a statewide basis, fully 36 percent of all taxable sales receipts
come from non-retail transactions, including business-to-business sales, mail
order sales and internet sales. This has led previously completed economic
strategies and analyses, as well as the current Economic Development Element, to
recommend the targeting of high net revenue generating firms outside of the
retail trade sector to augment ongoing retail business attraction efforts by the City.
It is important to recognize that approximately one-quarter of total business
revenue flowing to the City in 1996 was generated by only 30 firms, which are
listed alphabetically in Table A-1. This concentration of revenues reinforces the
need for continuation of highly selective and targeted business attraction and
retention initiatives on the part of city government.

A Target Industry Analysis was conducted in 1993 which identified Santa Ana as
having a competitive locational advantage over three other selected markets—City
of Irvine, City of Los Angeles, and the U.S. as a whole. Examples of sectors
having a high competitive advantage for Santa Ana include Publishing and
Apparel & Textiles. In addition, the matrix shows sectors with significant growth
potential such as Software & Telecommunications which are also relatively high
on the competitive scale.

                                                                   ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
Table A-2 illustrates the City of Santa Ana’s general revenue composition in terms
of dollars per $1 Million of net assessed valuation of all real estate within the City
for the 10-year period 1986 through 1995. As shown in this table, the downward
trend in unadjusted dollars of total City revenues began to turn around in 1994,
reaching $8.4 Million in 1995, although not yet approaching the historic 1986
high point of $9.7 Million. The revenue decline can be attributed both to
structural economic conditions related to the regional real estate recession, as well
as to demographic factors including increased ethnic diversity, a lower median
age, and a growth in the average number of persons per household. These
conditions resulted in lower real estate values, hence property tax revenue and
lower household income levels. In addition, other political, legal, and economic
actions taken at the State and Federal levels of government contributed to the
erosion of the City’s tax base. The declines in these non-discretionary revenue
sources which are outside the control of City government necessitated moderate
increases in discretionary taxes which can be levied by City government such as
Utility Users Tax, Business License Tax, and Transient Occupancy Tax.

Table A-3 depicts the Santa Ana business base in terms of employment within
City boundaries between 1984 and 1997 with total jobs increasing by 8.6 percent
to 142,050 citywide. Once again, structural changes can be seen in the City’s three
largest sectors including losses in manufacturing jobs as labor-intensive industries
relocated to less-urbanized areas, as well as gains in unskilled jobs. During this
period, the overall share of manufacturing jobs decreased by 2.9 percent, while
retail trade and service jobs increased by 0.8 percent, respectively.

The U.S. Department of Commerce conducts censuses of Manufacturing,
Wholesale Trade, Retail Trade, and Services every five years, most recently for
1992. Table A-4 summarizes four key indicators for each of these sectors. The
figures point to the relatively higher employment, payroll, sales, and value of
shipments generated by Manufacturing in comparison to Retail Trade and
Services. Santa Ana will need to concentrate on making up for any unavoidable
dislocation of industrial uses through gains in other major sectors.

SALES/USE TAX CHARACTERISTICS
With sales and use taxes comprising such a large share of revenues generated by
the business sector, it is not surprising that the City places a heavy economic
development emphasis upon sales tax.
Santa Ana’s per capita taxable sales receipts from All Outlets during 1996 were           The median income for Santa
$9,400 compared to $9,915 for the State of California as a whole, a difference of         Ana in 1990 was $35,162
$515 annually as shown in Table A-5. The Retail Stores category experienced a             compared to $35,798 for the
much greater disparity of $970 annually.                                                  State and $55,922 or Orange

Each year, Sales and Marketing Management Magazine conducts a
comprehensive, national “Survey of Buying Power.” A key statistic of this report is
the “Buying Power Index” which measures a particular market area’s “ability to
buy.” The Orange County market is ranked 14th in the entire U.S. for the
survey’s other key variable, “Effective Buying Income” (EBI). Santa Ana’s Buying
Power Index is exceeded by only two other cities in the county, Anaheim and
Huntington Beach, while its EBI is lower than only those two communities, in
addition to Irvine and Newport Beach as show in Table A-6.

Despite these encouraging figures, during 1996 Santa Ana’s per capita taxable
sales generated from All Outlets was $9,400 annually, $5,384 of which came from
Retail Stores as shown in Table A-7. A substantial loss of potential sales, and
consequently sales tax revenue to the City, stems from the great difference
between per capita sales in Santa Ana compared to the larger Orange County
trade area. The City figures are 23.9 percent lower than the County for All
Outlets, and 27.1 percent lower for Retail Stores.

While the City did relatively well in terms of receipts from All Outlets, which
includes business-to-business sales and use taxes, it did not compete as effectively
for Retail Sales dollars. Table A-8 offers an analysis for selected major categories
which demonstrates significant differences in Automotive and General
Merchandise Sales, where the City was lower than the County by 35.3 percent
and 41.9 percent, respectively.

LABOR MARKET CHARACTERISTICS
The California State Employment Development Department estimated Santa
Ana’s total labor force at 153,750 for December, 1997, with 6,980 persons
unemployed. The City’s unemployment rate of 4.5 percent is higher than that of
Orange County at 2.5 percent, but still very low relative to the nation as a whole.
The City’s available labor supply is projected to grow to over 237,000 by the year
2010 according to the Center for Demographic Research at California State
University, Fullerton.
Table A-10 illustrates the composition of Santa Ana’s labor pool, expressed both
in terms of industry and by occupation. Over one half of City residents are
employed in the Manufacturing and Retail Trade sectors of the economy. Only
about one quarter are engaged in Professional, Technical, and/or Managerial
positions.

The labor force characteristics reported in Table A-10 indicate two somewhat
opposing conditions from an economic development perspective. First, at over
150,000, the City possesses a huge inventory of workers, which is attractive to
labor-intensive business and industrial establishments. On the other hand, the
relatively low education and training levels of the resident workforce leaves room
for improvement.
CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN                                                  A-11
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
The City of Santa Ana is addressing this structural imbalance through a variety of
skills training and vocational education programs overseen by the Santa Ana
Private Industry Council, the local agency responsible for administering the
Federal Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) funds and programs. The City also
provides tax and skills training incentives to firms located within the Enterprise
Zone who agree to hire eligible workers. Vocational education opportunities are
available to local residents through Santa Ana College, a two-year community
college, and the Central Orange County Regional Occupational Program (ROP).
These programs are creating the trained labor pool necessary to fuel business
growth and expansion within the City.
COMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL REAL ESTATE TRENDS
The Central Orange County real estate market for office, industrial (including
manufacturing, warehouse, and research and development), and retail space with
strategically located Santa Ana at its geographic hub - is expected to improve
dramatically across all three sectors during 1998. Net absorption of space and
rental rates are anticipated to increase significantly, with concomitant declines in
vacancies.
Table A-11 represents a compilation of key commercial/industrial market forecasts
for Central County in 1998. The base data were prepared by the two largest real
estate brokerage firms covering the Orange County area. While there are slight
variations in methodology at the subarea level, the averaged rates presented below
are indicative of the Central County’s market position in comparison to Orange
County as a whole.

As illustrated by Table A-11, central County compares very favorably with the
total County in both the industrial and the retail categories. Vacancy rates for
industrial space are only 4.4 percent lower and 0.6 percent lower respectively for
the subarea, while average monthly rents are only 1.9 percent lower and 3.5
percent lower respectively. These data point to the strong competitive position of
central County, with Santa Ana at its core, for businesses engaged in
manufacturing, distribution, research and development, and retail sales activities.
The subarea’s market strength is attributed to its proximity to air, rail, and ground
transportation resources, as well as its greater population density relative to the
A-12                                                                CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN

                                                  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
remainder of the County. This is despite the fact that income levels are generally
lower in the subarea. Santa Ana is a primary beneficiary of Orange County’s
strong real estate market conditions in terms of economic development potential
for retail and industrial land uses.
The situation for office space and office tenant attraction, on the other hand,
shows room for improvement. Central County’s office vacancy rate of 17.0
percent is 7.6 percent higher than that of the County. It is important to note,
however, that significant corporate headquarters relocations to Santa Ana
(PacifiCare Health Systems), have recently taken place. These moves may well be
a harbinger of change for the central County office market due to its potential cost
savings (15.7 percent lower average monthly rents) over the County as a whole.
Santa Ana’s freeway convenience and its nearness to John Wayne Airport (as well
as the El Toro Marine Base, should a second commercial airport be build there)
should place it near the top of the list for consideration as an office site by
corporate site selectors.

Education Element
INTRODUCTION
Educational services and facilities are principal contributors to a community’s
quality of life. Often the level and character of such services become key factors in
the locational decisions of families and businesses. In the provision of educational
services, traditionally the agency responsible for providing the services conducts
the long range planning for facilities and programs. Such is the case in Santa Ana
where four independent districts, each under the auspices of a board of trustees,
are responsible for providing public education within the City. The General Plan,
by establishing land use and development policy, directly impacts the future
growth of the City and the student population to be served by these districts.
Though independently functioning political entities, the City and the four school
districts are best able to plan for the future growth of Santa Ana and the quality of
its educational services by a coordinated, cooperative approach in their long range
planning activities.
This education element addresses the physical planning issues related to the
provision of education services such as the location of facilities and the projection
of student enrollment as it relates to the need for additional schools. As a mid-
term planning document, this Element addresses education planning activities
into the year 2000. Programmatic issues such as staffing, budgeting, salaries, etc.
are handled by district boards and will not be addressed in this document.

EDUCATION ELEMENT
EDUCATIONAL SERVICES AND FACILITIES
EDUCATIONAL SERVICES
The City of Santa Ana’s school age population is presently served by four school
districts Santa Ana Unified, Garden Grove Unified, Tustin Unified, and Orange
Unified. These Districts, as shown in Exhibit 1, are located either entirely within
Santa Ana as is the SAUSD, or partially as is Orange, Tustin and Garden Grove
Unified. However, public education in the City is provided primarily by SAUSD
whose facilities account for approximately 90 percent of school resources available
in the City. The Garden Grove School District serves students residing west of the
Santa Ana River and more than one-sixth of the City’s total student population.
Supplementing Santa Ana and Garden Grove are the educational services
provided by the adjacent districts mentioned above and a variety of private,
parochial and commercial schools. Higher education in Santa Ana is provided by
Rancho Santiago College whose main facility is located in the City. As there are
no plans for the physical expansion of Rancho Santiago College within Santa Ana
over the 13-year time frame of this element, it will not be addressed here.
This element focuses on the primary and secondary educational services provided
by the public school systems within the City of Santa Ana and addresses those
areas in which the planning process can be better coordinated between the
districts providing these services and the City.
CURRENT AND PROJECTED ENROLLMENT
The SAUSD is responsible for educating more than 37,000 students during the
current 1987/88 school year. In addition, Garden Grove has 16 schools west of the
Santa Ana River that serve 7,972 Santa Ana students even though only five of
these schools are located within this City. Orange Unified School District serves
610 students that reside in Santa Ana, and Tustin Unified serves 595 Santa Ana
students. The 1987-88 student enrollment total for Santa Ana is approximately
47,500 when special students are included.
As can be seen in Table 1, enrollment data from SAUSD indicates an increase of
more than 3,200 regular students over the next five years and an additional 1,600
in the following five years. Garden Grove will increase its student population by
more than 539 over the next six years as can be seen from the projections in
Table 2. This increase will include 231 Santa Ana students by 1990 as shown in
Table 3 which indicates the projected enrollments for Garden Grove’s Santa Ana
students. Enrollments in Santa Ana Unified and Garden Grove Unified will
increase by more than 12,000 over the next ten years, taking total enrollment in
the City from approximately 47,000 to more than 60,000.

The increase in students over this same ten-year period in the Tustin and Orange
Districts will be proportionately smaller due to the smaller number of Santa Ana
students they serve—1,200 of 47,000. A conservative estimate of their growth
would be 100 additional students. In addition, the growth in Special Education
and other special programs is expected to increase from 1,275 to 1,650 during this
period in the Santa Ana Unified District and from 100 to 300 in the Garden
Grove District.

 The projected rate of growth in student population for Santa Ana Unified is more
 than five percent over the next five years, and an additional four percent by 1998.
 In the Garden Grove Unified District, the growth rate is slower, averaging less
 than one percent annually through 1990 and increasing to 1.5 percent by 1994.
 Overall, the rate of student enrollment increases is higher than the City’s
 population growth rate which has averaged 1.6 percent annually since 1980. The
 current population of 225,774 is projected to increase by nine percent to 246,737
 by 1990 and an additional nine percent to 256,368 by 1995 according to the
 Orange County Forecast and Analysis Center. Student enrollment as a percentage
 of total population will remain stable during this growth period—it is presently 21
 percent and is projected to be at 21 percent in 1995 also.

ENROLLMENT HISTORY
In order to assess future enrollment, it is important to analyze past enrollments
and acknowledge any trends in order to make projections for future enrollment as
accurate as possible. For this purpose, data for the Santa Ana District has been
taken from the “Five Year Plan for Student Enrollment and Housing” which
indicates the total number of students by grade level for the last five years. These
figures, shown in Table 4, reflect the enrollment of “regular” students only and
does not include students in special programs. When special students are
included, the totals would be at least 1,200 students greater than indicated.

Historical enrollment figures shown for Garden Grove in Table 5 indicate that
District’s enrollment has declined from 38,776 in 1979 to 35,209 in 1986 which is
just over 10 percent. A disproportionate share of this decline 2,017 students has
occurred in high school grades. Of the 3,567 decline in students, only 672 were in
elementary school with the remaining decline occurring at the intermediate level.
Contrary to declining district wide enrollment, Garden Grove District schools on
the Santa Ana River corridor have experienced increasing enrollments which are
projected to continue. Table 6 shows the current enrollment figures in these
schools.

EDUCATION ELEMENT
ENROLLMENT FACTORS
The school enrollment increases in Santa Ana have been in contrast to an overall
decline of the school age population nationally; specifically, when contrasted to
surrounding Orange County cities. During the years 1946-64, birth rates in all
parts of the United States increased at a rapid rate, but, after 1964, these same
rates fell almost as fast as they had risen. Demographers are now discussing a
second “boom” which is an echo of the original “baby boom.” Thus, on a
nationwide basis, general school enrollments are expected to rise, first at the
elementary level and finally at the intermediate and high school level by the end
of this decade and the early part of the next. A recent study by the Western
Interstate Commission for Higher Education, indicates that states such as
California, Colorado and Utah are expected to turn out 19% more graduates by
the end of the 1990’s than they are currently producing. Projections such as these
are based on current data and drop-out rates. If the drop-out rates for both racial
and language minority groups were to decline during this time period, the
number of graduates would conversely increase. Another policy factor which
could influence this data is a change in United States immigration policy.
According to Dr. Carlos Arce, Executive Director of the National Chicano
Council on Higher Education, the granting of amnesty or the enhancement of the
status of nonresident aliens will very likely affect school enrollments in the border
states such as California and Texas.
Other factors which might lead to increasing enrollments are the continuing
migration of United States residents to the sunbelt areas, which of course,
includes California. All regions in the country, except the mountain states,
showed a decrease in the number of live births from 1960-1977. These same states
also showed a significant outmigration to other areas, particularly the southwest.
Other similar demographic considerations which indeed can influence our
enrollment is the fact that the vast majority of the states in which the total fertility
rate was above replacement level fertility are in the west. Women of Spanish
origin have the highest number of lifetime births expected (2,428 per 1,000
women), followed by black women (2,258 per 1,000 women), and other white
women (2,096 per 1,000 women). Because of their small percentage of the total
nationwide population, Asians have not been included in many demographic
studies. Local experience seems to indicate that as a group, Asian women
experience a higher than average rate of births per 1,000 women.
ATTENDANCE AREAS
Attendance areas for the SAUSD are divided into three grade levels: elementary
(K-5); intermediate (6-8); and high school (9-12). In the GGUSD, the 7th grade
is included in the intermediate level. The basis of each attendance area is a
centrally located school facility that serves the students within its boundaries.
Attendance areas serve primarily as the basis for the “neighborhood school”
philosophy, but also as a tool for planning and program development. As such,

                                                                    EDUCATION ELEMENT
these boundaries are not permanent, but are adjusted as necessary to meet
changing student housing needs. Over the next few years, for example, boundaries
in the SAUSD will be changed to reflect the new high school under construction
in the southeast portion of the City and the eleven new elementary schools that
are proposed for construction at various sites throughout the City. Because of the
districtwide decline in enrollment in Garden Grove, it is unlikely that any
boundary changes will occur as a result of new school construction.
Exhibits 2 and 4, respectively, show the elementary, intermediate, and high school
attendance area boundaries in Santa Ana for all districts. In the Garden Grove
District, the boundaries reflected do not necessarily indicate the presence of a
school facility as in Santa Ana. This is indicative of the fact that Santa Ana
borders the Garden Grove District and some attendance areas include parts of
Santa Ana even though the school facility is in Garden Grove. The irregularity of
School District boundaries is also apparent in northern and eastern Santa Ana
where portions of the City are included in the Orange and Tustin Unified School
Districts. Unlike west Santa Ana, however, these areas cover only a small part of
Santa Ana and are characterized by low-density residential development and large
tracts of commercial and office development. The low number of students
generated in this area is reflected in the fact that there are only two schools outside
of the SAUSD—one in the Orange District and one in Tustin’s District.
SCHOOL FACILITIES
There are presently a total of 57 public school facilities within Santa Ana. The
SAUSD maintains 24 elementary schools, seven intermediate schools, three high
schools and five special education facilities. Table 7 indicates these schools, their
acreage, and the year of construction. There are 16 GGUSD facilities either
located in Santa Ana or serve a large number of Santa Ana students. These
facilities are listed in Table 8. The dates of construction are indicated because
after a 30-year period, each school facility is eligible for rehabilitation funds from
the State to upgrade the site. Twenty-six, or nearly half of the City’s schools have
become eligible to receive rehabilitation funding. This number includes two
elementary schools in the Orange and Tustin Districts. One of these facilities, the
Gladys Wallace School in the Tustin District, is leased and operated by the
SAUSD.

In order to provide an indicator of the City’s current educational facilities and
their potential for housing additional students or expansion, a capacity to design
schedule is indicated in Tables 9 and 10 for SAUSD and GGUSD, respectively.
The optimum design capacity is defined as that capacity which provides
maximum use of available square footage without overcrowding both classroom
and other related instructional areas (i.e., library, music rooms, speech therapy
rooms, etc.).
These data are very important because they identify those schools which are
currently or soon will be overcrowded. In SAUSD, for example, ten of the 21
elementary schools are presently overcrowded, and by 1988, 13 will have exceeded
their design capacity. By 1989, 14 schools, two-thirds of the elementary facilities,
will have student enrollments that exceed their capacity. In Garden Grove, seven
of ten elementary schools are overcrowded and by 1989, eight of the ten will be
over capacity. One of three intermediate schools are now overcrowded but by
1989, two of three will exceed their capacity. At the high school level, two of three
schools is overcrowded with no increase (Exhibit 3) in the number of
overcrowded facilities through 1989 (Exhibit 4). In SAUSD, the overcrowding
situation is in reality worse than it appears considering that nine elementary
schools are on a year-round school calendar to increase enrollment capacity (year-
round school programming increases a facility’s enrollment capacity by
approximately 25 percent). Each of SAUSD’s three high schools are presently well
over their original design capacity and are projected to remain so until
construction is complete on the new Century High School scheduled for opening
in the fall of 1989.
With respect to growth at the intermediate school level (grades six through eight)
the SAUSD was faced with a severe shortage of classrooms several years ago. As a
result of that shortage, one new intermediate school was built (MacArthur) and
an elementary school was converted into an intermediate school (Sierra). Thus,
for the past several years, there has been sufficient classroom space at the
intermediate level. However, several hundred students are bussed from east-
central Santa Ana to other intermediate schools (McFadden, Spurgeon and
Willard) in order to maximize the available use of student housing in grades six
through eight. It is projected that by 1990/91 school year, there will be another
550-600 regular students at the intermediate level. Busing and the use of
additional portables will not be adequate to handle this growth from
approximately 7,700 to over 8,300 regular students (there are approximately 250
intermediate students in special education programs). The SAUSD will apply to
the State for a new intermediate school during 1987. At this time, it appears the
most logical placement of such a facility would be in the east-central area of Santa
Ana. In Garden Grove, because of the declining enrollment, the District is
ineligible for new construction funding.

EDUCATION ELEMENT
To supplement school capacity and relieve the overcrowding until new schools
can be built, Districts have relied heavily on the use of portables as an alternative
housing method. As can be seen in Tables 11 and 12 for Santa Ana and Garden
Grove, respectively, those schools with enrollments over their design capacity
accommodate their excess student population through the use of portable
classrooms. Portables are not utilized exclusively for overcrowding, however, they
are also used for special programs and to provide additional specialized facilities.
The overcrowding situation in the City’s schools can be seen graphically in
Exhibits 2 through 4 for the elementary, intermediate and high school facilities.
Overcrowded facilities will be addressed in the following section on planning
factors as they relate to proposed sites for new schools and other factors which
impact school enrollment.

PLANNING FACTORS
As indicated earlier in this element, there are many factors that impact student
enrollment at any given time. Major determinants of enrollment, however, are
population and growth rates, household size, birthrates, migration, and indirectly
the City’s economy and overall quality of life. This section of the element will
discuss some of these factors as they relate to the City’s development and long
range planning for school facilities.
POPULATION AND HOUSING
The City of Santa Ana’s current population is 225,774 according to figures
compiled by the California State Department of Finance (DOF). (This figure is
based upon DOF’s annual housing survey which uses the number of housing
units as the basis for determining an area’s population). As can be seen in
Table 13, the City’s population has grown at an average rate of approximately 1.6
percent per year since 1980 when the population was 203,713. This has resulted in
26                                                             CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN

                                                                       EDUCATION ELEMENT
a population increase of 8.1 percent over this time period. Comparatively, the
housing stock has increased by an average of only 4.9 percent over that same six
year time period from 67,181 in 1980 to 70,487 in 1986. This is an average growth
of approximately .67 percent per year. The lack of available housing in the City
has created severe overcrowding problems in some of the City’s older
neighborhoods where the housing is more affordable. Indicative of the
overcrowding, the average increase in the number of households over this period
was 1.2 percent. According to State guidelines, overcrowding is defined as a
household which has more than 1.01 persons per room. The 1980 census reports
that approximately 17.2 percent of the City’s households are overcrowded. The
City’s Code Enforcement staff, however, estimates that overcrowded households
comprise a larger percentage of the total than is represented by the census. Code
enforcement activities as well as the promotion of affordable housing of all types
will help to mitigate the overcrowding situation. The overcrowding has resulted
in larger household sizes and an inability of the District to predict enrollment
based upon standard calculations of expected students per household. While there
is no hard data upon which to quantify the impact, undocumented residents and
their families contribute significantly to the increased enrollment experienced by
the District.

It should be noted that there is not a direct correlation between increased housing
production and an increase in population. Population increases are more a
function of job availability; the level and quality of City services, and social and
cultural environment/amenities than availability of housing, though housing is a
factor. Approximately half of the population increase in the past ten years has not
come from new development, but from multiple households sharing existing
units. This phenomena is borne out by data in Table 13 from 1981 to 1986 which
show a 1.6 percent average annual increase in population; a .67 percent average
annual increase in housing units; a 1.2 percent average annual increase in
households per year, and an increase from 2.88 persons per household to 3.27
persons per household over this time period.

EDUCATION ELEMENT
One of the most important long-term influences upon enrollment figures for the
past, present and future is the City’s General Plan. The Land Use Element
reflects the present and anticipated future development patterns in the City. The
knowledge of location and density of housing development is crucial in
determining future capital facility needs and potential sites for new public
facilities such as schools. New development and redevelopment that has occurred
in Santa Ana since the adoption of the revised General Plan in 1982 were based
upon heavy use of “Mixed Use Corridors” and “District Centers” as areas targeted
for retail, office and higher density multi-family projects. Exhibit 5 indicates those
areas of the City that were District Center and Mixed Use Corridor where there
was no limit to residential density. Exhibit 5A is the City’s current General Plan
Land Use Map adopted in June 1987 which reflects significantly lower densities
and correspondingly lower student generation potential. Since a 1987 General
Plan amendment, unlimited density in the City is now restricted to the immediate
downtown area, Main Place area, Hutton Centre, and South Coast metro area as
indicated in Exhibit 5A.
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
The number of residential units in an area can generally be used as a predictor of
school enrollment. As defined in the Housing Element of the General Plan, a
“unit” is the place of abode of a person(s) in a single-family dwelling or in a
multi-family dwelling (does not consider the number of bedrooms). As discussed
earlier, because of the extent of overcrowding in Santa Ana, the number of
residences is not an accurate predictor of enrollment, but it can be used as an
indicator. For purposes of predicting future enrollment, it is important to look at
development trends and consider the new residential development in conjunction
with existing housing data. Exhibit 6 is a graphic display of the new residential
development that has been permitted between 1984 and 1986 in Santa Ana. As the
corresponding data in Table 14a indicates, the amount of new residential
construction approved trebled from 617 in 1984 to 1,737 in 1986. The Housing
Element of the General Plan, which was prepared in 1984, stated a goal of 1,534
as the average annual increase in units through 1989. From 1984-86, multi-family
development accounted for 97 percent of all new development, as only 126 of the
3,551 units were single family. Even though areas designated for low density
single-family land use is more than four times the areas designated for medium to
high density residential, the vast majority of new development has been in multi-
family projects. One reason for the few single-family developments is the dearth
of parcels large enough to accommodate new single-family developments.
Further, most redevelopment in the City has been occurring in areas zoned for
multi-family projects that were originally developed with single-family units.

The downtown area of Santa Ana has seen the most development activity in terms
of new residential construction. This area is generally bound by Seventeenth
Street to the north, First Street on the south, Bristol Street on the west and the
Santa Ana Freeway on the east. This area has had more than 500 new units
approved since 1984. Up to five hundred units have been approved for the area
immediately southeast of downtown. Most of these units have been in the
Eastside neighborhood. Areas west of the Santa Ana River north of First Street,
and east of Santa Ana River north of Seventeenth Street also have up to 500 new
units approved for development. New residential development west of the river
south of First Street has been in the 100-300 unit range. These developments will
impact the Garden Grove School District.

While the impact of much of the City’s approved residential development has not
yet been felt in school enrollment because many of these units have not yet been
constricted, there is an indicator of the number of students that will be generated
from these units. “Impact of Residential Development on School Enrollment in
Santa Ana,” a study conducted by Cotton/Beland/Associates in March 1986
(Appendix A), provides data that indicate the number of students generated by
both single-family and multi-family developments. This report states that
“Census data and building permit data from the City together with recent
population projections from the California Department of Finance, indicate that
increases in school population have probably resulted from changes in household
size and structure much more than from growth due to new construction. In
addition, apartment development would be expected to have little impact on
school enrollment, particularly for large projects.” This view is supported by the
fact that of the 15 elementary schools that are currently over capacity, only four
(Lowell, Grant, Remington and Roosevelt) are located in the high growth areas of
the City (300 + new units). Four of the proposed sites are in medium growth
areas (25-300 units) and five are in areas of low growth (0-100 units) based on
units permitted over the past three years. The location of the proposed 11 new
elementary school sites are shown in Exhibit 7. These facilities will be discussed
further in the following section on Housing Alternatives.

Based upon the data presented above, it is apparent that the City will continue to
experience population growth and much of this growth will be in the Spanish-
speaking segment of the City’s population. Because females in this group have a
higher than average birthrate, it is expected that the school enrollment figures will
likewise continue to rise. The overcrowding situation in the City’s housing stock
is also expected to continue even given the significant increase in new units
approved over the past few years. While construction of new residential projects
will relieve overcrowding in the short-term, the subsequent slowdown in new
development coupled with the increase in population is expected to render a
continued shortage in the amount of available housing.
FACILITIES NEEDS AND HOUSING ALTERNATIVES
The enrollment and population data presented in this element support the
contention of the SAUSD Community Task Force on School Facilities in their
1984 report: “Santa Ana will continue to experience growth within its school age
population considering the fact that nearly every school currently exceeds its
design capacity (82%), and the above-mentioned growth, it is obvious that any
new growth will necessitate the need for additional classroom space.” Because
there are simply not enough classrooms in current school facilities to meet student
housing needs, new construction has been the obvious focus of the SAUSD’s long
range planning.
In Garden Grove, the alternative of new construction is not available because of
State restrictions on construction in areas of declining enrollments. This puts the
GGUSD in a position of serious shortage of classroom space because even though
enrollments have declined districtwide, in the area of Santa Ana west of the River,
enrollments are increasing and facilities there are already experiencing
overcrowding. In the Orange and Tustin Districts where there is similar
districtwide declining enrollments, overcrowding in Santa Ana schools or those
that serve Santa Ana students is not the problem it is in other districts.
The first consideration regarding new facilities in Santa Ana is their location.
State standards recommend at least 10 acres for an elementary school, 20 acres for
an intermediate and 40 acres for a high school. Acreage of these sizes are very
scarce in Santa Ana, particularly in the City’s built-up core. While the City does
not have the responsibility or the authority to identify and approve school sites,
there are land use considerations that it uses to consider the appropriateness of
sites. The SAUSD has identified 11 elementary school sites and one high school
site, all of which have approved funding from the State. These sites are indicated
in Exhibit 7.
The Districts are legally mandated to comply with selection responsibilities set
forth in the State Department of Education’s “School Site Selection and Approval
Guide.” The criteria established in this guide are more comprehensive in scope
than the City’s criteria which primarily addresses the land use compatibility issue

of site selection. The guide is available at local District offices or the State
Department of Education, 721 Capitol Mall, Sacramento, CA 95814.
The areas determined to be potential school sites based on population growth and
new residential development are indicated in Exhibit 8. The circles in this Exhibit
indicate spheres of influence or “service areas” which will generate the student
population of a future facility in these areas. In working with the District to
identify school sites as the need arises, the City will utilize the abovementioned
criteria to evaluate recommended sites. Item seven above is an option that is
currently being used by the SAUSD to alleviate the severe overcrowding in
elementary schools over the next two to three years until new facilities are
constructed. At least three park sites are being utilized for the location of portable
classrooms to service adjacent school sites. More information regarding these
agreements between the City and the District are discussed in the following
section. Other housing alternatives also considered viable have been identified in
the “Five Year Plan for Student Enrollment and Housing 1984-1989” prepared by
the District. These alternatives are:
    New Construction. One of the most obvious alternatives for student housing
     is the construction of additional permanent classroom space. This alternative
     is being pursued by the SAUSD for the construction of 11 elementary schools
     and one high school to satisfy housing needs over the next five years. New
     construction is, of course, limited by the availability of funds from the State.
     Eleven proposed elementary schools and the high school mentioned earlier
     have been approved by the State. Because of declining enrollments District-
     wide, new construction is not an alternative for consideration by the Garden
     Grove District.
    Portable Housing. Both the GGUSD and the SAUSD have long made it a
     practice to utilize portable classroom facilities to meet “temporary classroom
     needs.” Enrollment fluctuations between various neighborhoods in the City
     have been most economically served by the use of portable classroom
     facilities. When such facilities are no longer needed at one school, they are
     usually in demand at several others. There are several concerns regarding the
     use of portables. The first is that while they provide additional classroom
     space, there comes a point in time in which increased school size places
     demands on other such facilities which portables cannot normally address.
     For example, restroom facilities and lunch-serving capacities at some sites are
     hard pressed by the expanded enrollment possible through the use of
     portables. Portable classrooms have relieved the instructional overcrowding at
     these sites, but exacerbated other overcrowding problems. Another negative
     aspect of the use of portables is that these units, while temporary, are included
     as classroom space for the purposes of the distribution of new school
     construction funding. If these classrooms are leased rather than purchased,
     they would not be included and the leasing District would be in a more
     favorable position to obtain Green Act funding for new school construction.

   Boundary Changes. Together with the use of portable classrooms, boundary
    changes have been the alternative most often used to meet changing student
    housing needs in the City during the last 20 years. This was essentially the
    method used in the SAUSD to equalize enrollment between District
    intermediate schools last year. That it is not always completely successful
    demonstrates this alternative’s short term nature.
   Alternative Schools. The lack of boundaries is also an alternative which can e
    used to effectively meet student housing needs. Alternative schools, such as
    the fundamental school program, with their “open enrollment” help to
    reduce overcrowding. Other forms of alternative programs or “magnet
    schools” could serve as a viable method to house students who would
    normally otherwise be in an overcrowded neighborhood school. Another type
    of magnet school which could lead to the reduction of overcrowding at the
    high school level would be the creation of “mini high schools.” These would
    be programs for several hundred students which could become an integral
    part of the District’s Applied Curriculum Program or the “strand” concept
    which is in the implementation process. For example, a program stressing
    electronics might be housed in a factory or other similar industrial facility in
    an area which contains several large electronics corporations. The curriculum
    would be oriented around the academic requirements of both the District and
    the electronics industry. The proximity to these types of business would be
    necessary to provide the working partnership between the District and its
    quality academic program, and the practical skills and knowledge of the
    specific industry.
   The housing alternatives discussed above include only physical
    considerations such as structures and boundaries which affect long range
    planning. Other factors which impact long range planning are programmatic
    and economic factors which this element only briefly discusses because these
    factors are not within the City’s control. These factors are addressed in the
    following section on constraints and opportunities.

CONSTRAINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
STATE SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION FUNDING
Since the Proposition 13 tax code changes went into effect in 1978, the public
schools in California rely on the State for operating and construction funding.
Because this element focuses on planning for the physical expansion and new
construction of schools within the City, financial constraints and opportunities
which affect school construction are being considered here. The State authorizes
site acquisition and construction funds through an allocation system based on
demonstrated need. Each year only a certain amount of money is pledged to new
school construction and rehabilitation of older schools. Each school district in the
State must compete for this limited amount of funds each year.
Santa Ana’s four Unified School Districts must apply to the State Allocation
Board for funding for each school built or expanded. Based on current formulas
and the extreme overcrowding in schools, the SAUSD is the only district eligible
for new school construction at this time. The remaining Districts in Santa Ana
are experiencing declining enrollments and are not eligible for funding for new
construction. Because of recent legislation and voter approval of bonds, the State
will fund the land purchases and construction for 11 new elementary schools in
the SAUSD. These funds have only become available this year. Due to past
funding formulas that severely restricted any District’s ability to successfully
compete for State allocations under the Leroy Greene Act, SAUSD was unable to
keep up with demand for new classroom space. This has left the SAUSD in a
catch-up position even though it is now eligible for at least 11 new schools. The
constraints are even greater in the Garden Grove District where parts of the
district are experiencing severe overcrowding yet, based upon financing formulas,
are still ineligible for new school construction funding.
DEVELOPER FEES
A major opportunity for local school construction funding was adopted by the
State Assembly effective January 1, 1987. This legislation regulates the impact fees
being imposed on new development in local jurisdictions on a statewide basis. It
authorizes school districts to impose fees on new residential, commercial and
industrial projects if the district finds that the construction is having a significant
impact on demand for additional classroom space. Previously, each city or county
jurisdiction would have to adopt impact fees and pass them through to the school
district. The new law allows districts to impose the fees independently of local
governments and directly assess the developer. These fees are used as the District’s
required local match for State funding on new school construction. Thus, these
fees are being passed through the District to the State.
Adoption of the developer fee legislation resulted in each of the four Unified
Districts in Santa Ana enacting resolutions to begin collecting fees on new

developments to serve as the required local match for State allocations for new
school construction. The impact of the developer fee program on the availability
of funds for new construction will not be determined until they have been in
effect for a period of at least one year. There are concerns regarding this program
and its application to districts with declining enrollments and those that do not
have plans for new construction. As these issues are resolved and the program
survives its first year of implementation, we will more clearly be able to determine
its benefits to Santa Ana.
CITY FUNDING OF LOCAL SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION
In 1985, the City of Santa Ana City Council authorized a special fund of eight
million dollars to assist the SAUSD in purchasing new sites and constructing new
schools. The eight million dollars is based upon redevelopment revenues and will
be accrued over a period of at least four years. The City acknowledged the need
for this extraordinary arrangement based on the School District’s desperate need
for classroom space to serve the existing community. This response was taken to
mitigate impacts on the School District from expected continued residential
growth in the City. The City has also established a joint-staff committee to work
with Garden Grove District to identify alternatives to mitigate the impacts of new
development west of the Santa Ana River on school enrollment in that District.
Tustin and Orange Districts have a very low percentage of Santa Ana students
and with declining enrollments, overcrowding has not been an issue.
Traditionally, State funding mechanisms for school construction have been a
major constraint because of the restrictiveness of the criteria under which districts
were eligible for new facilities. Exacerbating this situation has been the
complexity of local public facilities funding initiatives that have been difficult to
get public approval. These constraints have led to the severe overcrowding
currently experienced by the schools in the City of Santa Ana. Recent State
legislation has made construction funding criteria less restrictive and the
implementation of the developer fee program is expected to have a significant
impact on new construction funding availability. What this means for the City of
Santa Ana is that there is finally the opportunity to reduce the overcrowding and
subsequently to address other areas of District services to upgrade the quality of
education in the community.

1.    To amend the Land Use Element of the City’s General Plan and the
      zoning district where appropriate to designate new school sites. These
      actions will be taken upon the District’s acquisition of properties on a site-
      by-site basis.
2.    Establish a City policy requiring a 60-day notification to school districts on
      the issuance of building permits for properties identified as future school
      sites.
3.    Based on City population and school enrollment projections, assist school
      districts in identifying potential school sites adequate to handle projected
      enrollment needs. Prepare periodic reports to City Council outlining
      recommended planning methods to promote adequate and appropriate site
      availability to meet these needs.
4.    Coordinate City and school district development and expansion plans to
      maximize joint development where feasible.
5.    Enhance City services at the public libraries, Bowers Museum, recreation
      centers and public parks to supplement and/or complement those services
      offered by the public and private school systems.
6.    Utilize redevelopment powers, developer participation and the City’s
      General fund to provide new facilities or enhance existing facilities for
      additional cultural, recreational and educational services.
7.    Continue to provide City staff assistance and coordination to school
      districts in the areas of site selection, site design, traffic control, circulation
      and site acquisition.
8.    Work with school district staffs to create and maintain a shared data base
      for planning and forecasting purposes.
9.    Cooperate with City school districts to share park sites for temporary school
      facilities where the City deems feasible for satellite schools, expansion of
      existing schools and the “hop-scotch” plan of new school construction (see
      SAUSD report title “K-S Housing Alternatives-Winter 1986”).

EDUCATION ELEMENT
10.  Encourage each school district to collect necessary project information from
     residential developers at the time of payment of impact fees. This
     information can be verified by the City when the project is complete and a
     Certificate of Occupancy is issued.
11.  Analyze all discretionary actions for impacts on cultural, recreational and
     educational services and facilities within the City.
12.  The Planning Department shall prepare and present a report to the
     Planning Commission on the implementation of this element on an annual
     basis. The Planning Commission shall in turn forward the annual report to
     the School Board and City Council. The report should include progress
     regarding programs, policies and objectives of the Element.
13.  This Element shall be updated not less than twice within the next five
     years at the direction of the Planning Commission.

SUMMARY
The new City of Santa Ana General Plan was developed through an extensive
process of public participation involving citizens, elected and appointed City
officials and City Staff.
The General Plan has been developed to conform to state law and to meet local
planning needs through the year 2000. Periodic updates of the new General Plan
are anticipated.
The General Plan builds upon Santa Ana’s historical assets including the City’s
heritage as the governmental and financial center of Orange County and the
buildings, districts and streetscapes which reflect this heritage.
The General Plan anticipates two major potentials that can shape Santa Ana over
the next several decades. The plan anticipates and maximizes the probability of
the Countywide rapid transit system to be located in Santa Ana and encourages
mixed use development and preservation m corridors and centers relating to this
new access and visibility.
The General Plan has three major sections: the Framework Plan, Policy Plan, and
Environmental Impact Report.
1. The Framework Plan describes Santa Ana’s overall planning strategy and
     program. This strategy reorganizes the City’s land use and urban design
     structure to take maximum advantage of:
         the economic development advantages offered by Santa Ana’s historic
          regional location and functions
         an improved multi-modal transportation system including:
          –   Countywide rapid transit access to Santa Ana
          –   improved local transit
          –   improved auto access to major activity centers
          –   a new Amtrak station
          –   a downtown multi-modal transportation and bus center

        –    a downtown shuttle system
        –    new pedestrian connections within and between land use districts
             and to public transportation facilities.
    The Framework Plan provides an overview of the City’s implementation
    program which includes:
       continuing involvement of the community in developing the detailed
        implementation plans that will be developed for subareas of the
        Framework Plan
       efficient processing of development and rehabilitation proposals by
        means of a Development Review Team
       a carefully coordinated development program to foster and assist private
        investment through:
        –    land assembly
        –    coordinated provision of public improvements
        –    Specific Plans
        –    citizen participation coordination
        –    low interest loans and grants
        –    project promotion
2. The Policy Plan spells out the:
       goals and objectives which underlie the Framework Plan
       greater detail regarding implementation policies and programs
        supporting the Framework Plan.
    Together, the Framework Plan and Policy Plan envision a new image for
    Santa Ana consisting of:
       increased economic activity to provide jobs and maintain a solid financial
        base for city services
       improvement of Santa Ana’s housing stock for a full range of income
        groups and lifestyles
       the finest multi-modal transportation system in Orange County
       a new physical environment consisting of:
        –    preserved and enhanced viable Neighborhoods
        –    District Centers combining new shopping facilities with
             recreational, cultural, education, employment and special housing
             types
        –    improvement of Santa Ana’s major Industrial Districts
        –    Mixed Use Corridors with a range of uses similar to the District
             Centers but with more facilities related to regional transit and auto
             access.

PLANNING CONTEXT
HISTORICAL
Santa Ana’s rich history provides a legacy for community planning and
revitalization in the 1980’s. Santa Ana was founded in 1869 by William Spurgeon.
The original town, laid out by Mr. Spurgeon, consisted of 24 blocks. The town
served as a shopping center and post office for surrounding agricultural areas.
In 1878 the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived and the Santa Fe Railroad followed
in 1886. This encouraged development of the City. In 1889 the County seat was
located in Santa Ana and this further stimulated the development of businesses,
stores, financial institutions and hotels serving the metropolitan population.
Citrus and walnut farms were still plentiful and buying and selling land became
the number one enterprise. The First to 17th Street area was subdivided during
the building boom of the 1880’s. Many of the structures in downtown and the
surrounding bungalow homes were built in the early 1900’s and 1920’s.
The City is retaining and building upon its important governmental, retailing and
employment roles in the County and the rich architectural and streetscapes
heritage associated with the City’s history.
REGIONAL
Santa Ana is geographically central to the developable land within Orange
County. The City has excellent relationships to freeways, rail services via Amtrak
and air transportation at the John Wayne Airport. Because of Santa Ana’s
geographic centrality and functional importance to the County, the Orange
County Transit District is planning major fixed rail transit corridors in the Main
Street and Pacific Electric right-of-ways. These regional transportation
improvements, combined with improvements to freeway access points and local
streets, provide Santa Ana with abundant development opportunities for the
1980’s.

PLANNING PROCESS
The Planning Process used in creating the Santa Ana General Plan is
summarized in Exhibit 3 and related photographs. The process involved:
        a 150-person Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) to which all citizens
         applying were appointed by the City Council
        the Planning Commissioners who served as chairpersons of five CAC
         subcommittees: Land Use and Urban Design, Circulation, Housing,
         Economic Development and Environmental Factors
        the City Council who participated in goal setting and policy making
         workshops
        the public-at-large who participated in a series of Town Forums and
         Public Hearings
        City Staff who worked with The Arroyo Group (TAG) in conducting the
         planning process and who evaluated the program as it evolved.
The six key steps in the planning process were:
1. Data Collection and Analysis. The data base for the previous General Plan
    was outdated and up-to-date census data was not available. Emphasis was
    placed on community definition of problems and opportunities through CAC
    and Staff Steering Committee workshops and mapping. TAG subcontractors
    also gathered key data in areas such as market demand, traffic, seismic, etc.
    This data was summarized and analyzed in a separate Problems and
    Opportunities Report.
2. Formulation of Goals and Objectives. Initial goals and objectives were
    developed through workshops, with the CAC and City staff. Several cycles of
    refinement were done by TAG based on input from the Planning
    Commission, City Council, CAC and staff.
3. Formulation of Subarea Alternatives. Santa Ana has a large number of fixed
    elements such as streets and land uses. Therefore, subarea plans were
    developed to provide alternative land use patterns in different parts of the
    City. Each subarea plan was related to an urban design framework previously
    approved by the CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
4. Formulation of Areawide General Plan Alternatives. Areawide General Plan
    alternatives focused on different combinations of subarea plans.
5. Plan Selection Plan. Selection was done through a series of meetings with the
    CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
6. Plan Refinement. Plan refinement was accomplished by staff review of a
    Preliminary Draft, and CAC, Planning Commission and Public-at-Large
    comments on a Public Hearing Draft.

POLICY PLAN
INTRODUCTION
The Policy Plan section of the General Plan sets forth the detailed policies of the
City relative to the framework Plan described in Section 1.
Each element of the Policy Plan contains goals, objectives, implementation
policies and implementation programs.
Each element also contains a Planning Factors section which reflects the major
issues identified through the citizen participation process.
The Plan Components section of each element describes the planning and design
concepts illustrated in the maps and provides an overview of implementation
considerations.
The importance of energy conservation has become more apparent in recent years
with increases in the price of energy. The national interest is best served if
dependence on foreign energy sources is diminished. Reduction of energy
consumption is important in reducing the environmental impact of coal and
nuclear energy generation.
8                                                  CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN
                                                                    ENERGY ELEMENT
The purpose of this section is to provide policies and programs for reducing
energy consumption and increasing utilization of new energy sources.
PLANNING FACTORS
As shown in Exhibit 4, Santa Ana’s energy comes from many sources and has
many end uses. The City itself is not a utility owner. The largest components of
energy use are, in order:
    transportation (gasoline and diesel fuel)
    energy conversion and transmission bases
    residential natural gas and electricity
Exhibit 5 shows a typical Southern California family’s energy use according to
information from utilities and common energy use estimates. The largest
components of household energy use are automobile transportation, home
heating and air conditioning and domestic water heating.
Because of the large amount of energy waste involved in electric power
generation, savings at the user end also result in savings in conversion and
transmission.
Energy conservation itself is a source of energy because it is a substitute for
additional energy. To be most effective, City policy should concentrate on those
areas where the greatest amount of energy can be saved and in areas where the
local jurisdiction is the most appropriate strategic level.
The major opportunities for energy savings for a family lie in saving auto miles
travelled and in reducing space heating and cooling loads for its home. Major
strategies to accomplish this include location of the living place near work,
shopping and cultural/leisure activities; use of alternative transportation to make
these trips; and construction of energy-efficient homes.
Opportunities for savings also exist in the commercial and industrial sectors.
At the same time, new energy sources can substitute for existing, non-renewable
sources in some applications. Solar energy and use of alternative motor vehicle
fuels and stationary boiler fuels are examples of alternative energy use.

Growth Management
Element
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND INTENT
The purpose of this Element is to mandate that growth and development in
Santa Ana be based upon the City’s ability to provide an adequate circulation
system pursuant to the Revised Traffic Improvement and Growth Management
Ordinance also known as Measure M.
HISTORICAL CONTEXT
On November 6, 1990, Orange County voters approved Measure M which
provides funding for needed transportation improvements Countywide.
Measure M authorized the imposition of a half cent retail sales tax for a period
of 20 years effective April 1, 1991. The tax is estimated to raise $3.1 billion
Countywide over this 20 year period. The monies received from Measure M
will be returned to local jurisdictions for use on local and regional
transportation improvements and maintenance projects. In order to qualify for
these revenues, however, Measure M requires each city to comply with the
Orange County Division, League of California Cities Countywide Traffic
Improvement and Growth Management Program which was included by
reference in the Measure M ordinance. The Countywide Growth Management
Program is designed to achieve a cooperative process among local Orange
County jurisdictions to coordinate and implement traffic improvements and
stronger planning on a Countywide basis, while maintaining local authority
over land use decisions. It is also designed to maintain local authority in
establishing performance standards, such as traffic level of service, while
considering regional impacts.
In order to receive Measure M funds, the City must submit a statement of
compliance with the Countywide Growth Management components which are
summarized below.
   Adoption of a Growth Management Element that includes:
    –    Traffic level of service standards;
    –    A development mitigation program; and
    –    A development phasing and annual monitoring program.

GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
    Participation in inter-jurisdictional planning forums;
    Development of a seven year Capital Improvement Program;
    Address housing options and job opportunities; and
    Adoption of a Transportation Demand Management Ordinance.
The City’s compliance with these components has been addressed in this
Element or are referenced where adopted by a separate action in a separate
document.
INTRODUCTION
OVERVIEW
The Growth Management Element contains policies for the planning and
provision of traffic improvements that are necessary for the City’s orderly
growth and development. The policies and programs presented in this
Element are for the establishment of traffic level of service (LOS) standards; a
development mitigation program and a development phasing program. In
addition, this Element includes an implementation program for annual
monitoring.
The Element is divided into six sections. Section I provides a statement of the
purpose and intent of the Element. Section II provides an overview of the
Element and includes discussion regarding General Plan consistency, and the
implementation process. Section III provides general definitions for terms
utilized in the Element. The goals, objectives and policies for the Element are
provided in Sections IV and V. Section VI discusses the implementation
programs for achieving the goals and objectives of the Element.
CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
A major goal of the Growth Management Element is to ensure that the
planning, management and implementation of traffic improvements are
adequate to meet the current and projected needs of the City. While this goal is
a high priority, it must be achieved while maintaining internal consistency
among the other elements of the General Plan as required by State law.
Therefore, the Growth Management Element does not replace or supersede
other General Plan elements, such as the Circulation Element which also
specifies goals and policies for transportation and circulation issues. Instead, it
establishes traffic standards that will also be included in the Circulation
Element.
The Element is the City’s most current position on growth management
policies. Consequently, although there is some overlap among the policies here
and in other general plan elements, this Element is defined as the key resource
document for growth management policies and issues.

                                                    GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS
The intent of this Element is to establish policies in the General Plan for
future actions and programs that will implement the City’s growth
management goals. As a new element, its initial implementation may point out
the need for future amendments to reflect changes in the implementation
process over time. It is recognized that a transitional period will exist between
adoption of the Element and the implementation of its policies and programs.
A significant effort in the transportation planning process will be undertaken
by the City in its involvement in the growth management areas (GMA’s)
established by the Regional Advisory Planning Committee. The purpose of the
GMA’s is to enable local jurisdictions to focus their mutual concerns,
coordinate improvements and implement those improvements through the
inter-jurisdictional (GMA) process. Santa Ana is located in four GMA’s (2,3,7
and 8) as shown in Exhibit 1. City staff will work with the staff from other
cities represented in each of the GMA’s to address the transportation issues
identified by mutual consensus of the representatives of each GMA.
STATE AND FEDERAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM IMPACTS
It is recognized that Federal and State highways are a significant component of
Santa Ana’s transportation system. The City’s transportation system is greatly
influenced by the impact of two freeways which run through the City—the
Santa Ana Freeway and the Newport Freeway—and the three freeways which
are adjacent to the City’s borders—the Garden Grove and Orange Freeways at
the City’s northern boundary and the San Diego Freeway at its southern
boundary. Thus, this element discusses the relationship of the State and
Federal highway system to the City’s circulation system.
Existing Freeway System Deficiencies
A significant portion of the transportation problem in the County stems from
the inadequate capacity of the freeway system to serve the peak period travel
demands. This lack of capacity has resulted in poor levels of service,
characterized by severe congestion and low travel speeds during peak periods.
The most severe congestion occurs at the junction of I-5 and SR-55 here in
Santa Ana.
Impact of Freeway System on the Arterial Highway System
Arterial highways are intended to handle the bulk of intra-regional traffic and
complement the freeway system and the local street network. As congestion
continues to increase on the freeway system, more drivers utilize the arterial
system, particularly those parallel to freeways, or those arterials serving the
same trip destination as the freeways. Consequently, these arterials,
particularly the north/south ones, such as Bristol, Main and Grand, are

GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
becoming increasingly congested. This situation is of special concern on those
arterials which provide access to the freeway system.
DEFINITIONS
For the purposes of this Element, the following terms are defined below:
   Capital Improvement Program which outlines a seven-year list of capital
    projects to be undertaken by the City. The program contains: 1) the
    proposed project improvement; 2) the funding source; and 3) the
    estimated cost in current dollars.
   Critical Movement shall mean any of the conflicting through or turning
    movements at an intersection which determine the allocation of green
    signal time.
   Deficient Intersection Fund shall mean a trust fund established to
    implement necessary improvements to existing intersections which do not
    meet the Level of Service standard adopted in this Element. Such fund
    will be established from transportation fees mutually agreed upon by the
    GMA in which the deficiency exists.
   Development Phasing shall mean a program which establishes the
    requirement that building and grading permits shall be approved or issued
    in a manner that assures implementation of required transportation
    improvements. The City shall specify the order of improvements (number
    of dwelling units) based, at a minimum, on mitigation measures adopted
    in conjunction with the environmental documentation and other relevant
    factors.
   Deficient Intersection List shall mean a list of intersections that: 1) do not
    meet the Traffic Level of Service Policy for reasons that are beyond the
    control of the City (e.g., ramp metering effects, traffic generated outside
    the City’s jurisdiction, etc.); and 2) projects currently on the Seven-Year
    Capital Improvement Program. Additional intersections may be added by
    the City to the deficient intersection list only as a result of conditions
    which are beyond the control of the City.
   Growth Management Areas (GMA’s) shall mean subregions of the
    County established by the Regional Advisory Planning Committee to
    promote inter-jurisdictional coordination in addressing infrastructure
    concerns and in implementing needed improvements.

                                                       GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
    Growth Management Element shall mean the Growth Management
     Element of the City’s General Plan as required by the Revised Traffic
     Improvement and Growth Management Ordinance (Measure M).
    Level of Service Standard shall mean a Level of Service of “D” except in
     major development (urbanized) areas or intersections which are impacted
     by factors beyond the City’s control in which case the Level of Service
     standard shall be “E.”
    Local Transportation Authority is the body responsible for the
     implementation of Measure M as designated by the Orange County Board
     of Supervisors, the Orange County Transportation commission.
    Major Development Areas shall mean those areas of the City which are
     designated in the City’s general plan land use map for the most intense
     urban development both in scale and mixture of land uses. They are
     intended to serve as anchors to the City’s commercial corridors and to
     serve as regional centers of commerce and employment (see Exhibit 2 for
     map of major development areas).
    Measurable Traffic shall mean a traffic volume resulting in a one percent
     increase in any critical movement at an intersection.
    Measure M refers to the Revised Traffic Improvement and Growth
     Management Ordinance adopted by Orange County voters on
     November 6, 1990. The Measure authorized the imposition of a half cent
     retail sales tax for a period of 20 years effective April 1, 1991. The sales tax
     increase will be allocated to local orange County jurisdictions for use on
     local and regional transportation improvements and maintenance projects.
GOALS, OBJECTIVES, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
GOALS
The goals of this Element are to:
Goal 1
Reduce traffic congestion.
Goal 2
To ensure that adequate transportation and public facilities are provided for
existing and future residents of the City. These goals shall be accomplished
through implementation of the policies and programs set forth in this
Element.
Achievement of these goals shall be measured by the following objectives that
follow.

GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
OBJECTIVES
Transportation
   The circulation system shall be implemented in a manner that achieves a
    Traffic Level of Service “D” except in the City’s major development areas
    and at those intersections which are impacted by factors beyond the City’s
    control.
Development Phasing
   Development shall be phased in a manner consistent with the
    Development Phasing Program.
POLICIES
Traffic Level of Service
   The Level of Service standard for traffic circulation in the City shall be
    LOS “D.” In order to achieve this standard, it shall be the City’s policy
    that within three years of the issuance of the first building permit for a
    development project, the necessary improvements to transportation
    facilities to which the project contributes measurable traffic, shall be
    completed. The LOS shall be D for intersections under the sole control of
    the City. Intersections exempt from the above paragraph include those
    located within the City’s major development areas (Exhibit 2); facilities
    under the jurisdiction of another City or the State; or those included on
    the Deficient Intersection List established by a GMA in which the City
    participates. It is the policy of the City that all development contributing
    measurable impacts to intersections on the Deficient Intersection List be
    assessed a mitigation fee. This fee will be determined by the jurisdictions
    in the G14A and locally administered as part of the City’s Capital
    Improvement Program.
   Level of Service (LOS) will be measured by the Traffic Level of Service
    Policy Implementation Manual established by the Local Transportation
    Authority.

Development Mitigation
    All new development shall pay its share of the street improvement costs
     associated with that development including regional traffic mitigation.
    The City will continue to collect transportation area fees for improvements
     within its boundaries and shall work with adjacent jurisdictions to
     determine acceptable impact fee levels within the growth management
     areas. These fees may be assessed as necessary in addition to the City’s
     transportation area fees to cover fee shortfalls in project improvement that
     may not be generated by established fee programs.
    New revenues generated from Measure M shall not be used to replace
     private developer funding which has been committed for any project.
    A Deficient Intersection Fund shall be established by the City to make
     improvements on those intersections identified by the GMA as necessary
     to achieve the LOS standard established in this Element.
Development Phasing
New development in the City shall be required to establish a development
phasing program which phases approval of development commensurate with
required improvements to roadway capacities. The phasing plan shall include
an overall buildout plan which can demonstrate the ability of the
infrastructure to support the planned development.
    Development phasing for new projects shall be a component of the
     development review and entitlement process and shall be approved prior to
     issuance of building or grading permits.
Annual Monitoring
The City shall monitor the implementation of the development phasing
program for each of its new development projects on an annual basis and
prepare a report which indicates the status of development approval and the
required traffic improvements and the relationship between them.
Additional Element Policies
The following items are required as components of the City’s Growth
Management Plan and are included as optional discussion items in this
Element.
    Inter-jurisdictional Planning Forums. The City of Santa Ana shall
     participate in inter-jurisdictional planning forums within its established
    growth management area as adopted by the Regional Advisory Planning
    Council.
    The City shall continue to participate in inter-jurisdictional planning
    forums as established at the GMA level and as appropriate with
CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN                                                 11

GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
     neighboring or affected jurisdictions to address transportation or other
     planning issues.
    Capital Improvement Program. A seven year capital improvement
     program shall be adopted and maintained in conformance with the
     provisions of Measure M for the purpose of maintaining the levels of
     service established in this Element.
    Balanced Community Development. Recognizing the constraints of
     existing physical development characteristics (Santa Ana is 98 percent built
     out), it is the City’s policy to strive toward achieving a balance of land uses
     where by residential, commercial and public land uses are proportionally
     balanced.
    Transportation Demand Management. The City shall promote traffic
     reduction strategies through the measures adopted by ordinance
     (NS-2124) in its Transportation Demand Management Plan.
PROGRAMS
Inter-jurisdictional Planning
The City will participate in inter-jurisdictional planning forums through the
growth management areas established. Such forums include the growth
management areas adopted by the Regional Advisory Planning Council as well
as the City’s joint powers agreements with adjacent cities. These planning
forums are intended to address cumulative traffic impacts and to coordinate
improvements in transportation facilities.
Development Mitigation
The City’s development mitigation program has been established as a process
in which all new development pays its share of the costs associated with that
development. Participation in development mitigation shall be required of all
new development projects. Development mitigation requirements are
identified in the project review and approval process.
Development mitigation will also be coordinated through inter-jurisdictional
forums as appropriate to determine fees for growth management areas and
other inter-jurisdictional agreements where improvements are necessary to
benefit an area larger than the development site and/or extending outside of
the City’s boundaries.
Development Phasing
It is the City’s policy to require a development phasing plan for all new
development projects. The City’s development phasing program is established
to ensure that infrastructure is constructed as development occurs so that the
provision of road improvements is in balance with traffic demand. The

                                                 GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT
phasing program for new developments shall provide a reasonable lead time to
design and construct specific transportation improvements for approved
development projects. The City will establish a three year time frame as a
guideline for the design and construction of required transportation
improvements. The three year time frame shall be from the issuance of the first
building permit for the project. The time frame for completion of project
related improvements shall be incorporated into the phasing program for
project approvals in conformance with current City procedures.
Annual Monitoring
The City’s annual performance monitoring program is intended to provide an
annual evaluation of its development phasing plans. This program will a
review and evaluate the implementation of phasing plans which reflect
conditions of approval for traffic improvements required as mitigation
measures for the project. The monitoring program is intended to ensure that
road improvements or funding were actually provided as required in order to
determine whether development may continue. If the improvements or
funding required have not been provided, development shall be deferred until
compliance with the provisions of this program are achieved.
The monitoring program shall include an annual review of new development
projects until all required improvements have been constructed. Traffic related
mitigation requirements such as traffic demand management programs shall
be continued in conformance with the provisions of project approved
programs.

Land Use Element
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The Land Use Element of the City of Santa Ana General Plan serves as a long-
range guide for land use and development in the City. The Element indicates the
type, location, and intensity of the development and land uses permitted in the
City. The primary objective of this Element is to assist in the management of
future growth, to improve the City’s overall physical appearance, to minimize
potential land use conflicts, and to facilitate growth and development reflecting
the community’s vision.
The Land Use Element is one of the seven elements required by State planning
law. It is intended to guide the City’s physical development in a manner
consistent with the Circulation Element and other land use related elements of
the General Plan.
The scope and content of this Land Use Element is governed by California Law
(Section 65302(a) of the State Government Code) which indicates that the Land
Use Element must:
   Designate the distribution, location, and extent of land uses for housing,
    business, industry, open space, recreation, and public facilities;
   Establish standards of population density and building intensity for each land
    use category covered by the Plan; and
   Identify land uses in those areas subject to development constraints.
FORMAT OF THE LAND USE ELEMENT
The Land Use Element is presented in four sections. The body of the Element is
a summary of the opportunities and constraints, which shape the City’s land use
policy, as well as the policy framework which guides the decision-making process.
The Appendix to the Element provides detailed information regarding the areas
addressed within the policy framework. Each section of the Element is
summarized below:
   The Purpose and Scope provides an overview of the Element’s rationale, and
    the requirements governing its scope and content.

LAND USE ELEMENT
  The Community Factors provide an overview of the factors and community
   characteristics which were considered in the formulation of the Land Use
   Element.
  The Policy Plan states City goals and policies regarding land use and
   development with supporting policies identified for each goal. The Policy
   Plan also includes the Land Use Plan, as well as standards for the intensity of
   development.
  The Implementation Plan contains a listing of the actions, programs, and
   other measures, which are used to implement the Land Use Element.
  The Appendix contains detailed background information relevant to the areas
   addressed in the Element. It also includes the analyses and technical
   information considered in formulating the Policy Plan and the
   Implementation Plan.
This Land Use Element governs the land area included within the corporate
boundaries of the City of Santa Ana. The City’s location in a regional context is
shown in Exhibit 1.

COMMUNITY FACTORS
The Santa Ana community serves as the governmental and cultural center of
Orange County. With a current population exceeding 300,000 residents, the City
ranks among the largest in California. Santa Ana continues to experience growth,
although unlike many of its Orange County neighbors, it has been almost fully
developed for many years. The City’s rich history is reflected in its diverse mix of
residential neighborhoods, business districts, and emerging cultural opportunities.
The development patterns of Santa Ana’s neighborhoods vary significantly in
intensity, character, and architecture. Commercial uses range from small, family
owned and operated businesses to large regional shopping centers. The City’s
strong industrial base is characterized by a mixture of facilities which range from
one to two person manufacturers to Fortune 500 corporate operations.
As the seat for Orange County, the Civic Center area contains Federal, State, and
local governmental facilities including the courts, criminal justice facilities,
administrative offices, and service centers. Each of these land use characteristics
help to define the City as a vibrant and dynamic urban center. Playing a key role
in shaping future growth and redevelopment, the Land Use Element perpetuates
positive land uses and promotes development which supports a high quality of life
throughout the community.
A number of critical issues were considered in the formulation of the goals and
policies contained in this Element. These goals and policies, together with the
Land Use Plan, provide a “framework” for future decision-making regarding land
use and development in the City. The emerging issues and opportunities which
are important factors for the Element include the City’s land use patterns,
demographic characteristics, environmental conditions, and public infrastructure
considerations.
LAND USE CHARACTERISTICS
Many of the City’s land use characteristics are directly related to its historic     Santa Ana was founded by
position as one of Orange County’s earliest pioneer settlements. Since Santa Ana     William Spurgeon in 1869.
was founded in the 19th century, its primary settlement period occurred before the
automobile age. Unlike many of its Orange County neighbors, the City’s land use
patterns mirror both its rich history as well as, its more recent growth. Key land
use characteristics include the following:
    Santa Ana is surrounded by incorporated cities. As a result, its sphere of
     influence is primarily restricted to within its own jurisdictional boundaries.
     Since the City has very limited vacant land available for development, most
     new development involves recycling and redevelopment in areas previously
     improved. The City’s central location and its status as a county governmental

                                  LAND USE ELEMENT
                                       and employment center are likely to result in continued development
                                       pressure.
                                      The City is the fifth largest Orange County city in terms of land area,
                                       consisting of 27.3 square miles. Of this total, 58 percent is devoted to
                                       residential development, 15 percent to commercial uses, 14 percent to
                                       industrial, 11 percent to public and institutional uses, and two percent to
                                       public parkland and open space. The City’s overall distribution of land use
                                       and development reflects its maturity as a commercial, employment, and
                                       governmental center.
                                      Historically, over 6,000 acres of land in Santa Ana was included in one
                                       Merged Redevelopment Project Area. Further, an 11,790-acre area has been
                                       designated as a California Enterprise Zone and that designation expired on
                                       December 13, 2013. The Enterprise Zone provided businesses with tax
                                       incentives intended to promote business development and growth, in addition
                                       to creating jobs. The City has been permitted to continue to process
                                       Enterprise Zone vouchers for existing companies until December 31, 2014.
                                      The City of Santa Ana has adopted a number of specific plans to provide
                                       greater direction, and consistently high quality development standards for
                                       projects in these areas. These specific plans were established for those areas of
                                       the City which would benefit from a comprehensive development scheme not
                                       otherwise possible under existing land use regulations.
                                      Santa Ana is served by five freeways: the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5), the
                                       Garden Grove Freeway (SR-22), the Costa Mesa Freeway (SR-55), the San
                                       Diego Freeway (I-405), and the Orange Freeway (SR-57). Planned freeway
                                       enhancements and other regional transit improvements will further enhance
                                       accessibility to the City. The City’s central location in relation to the regional
                                       transportation network contributes to its continued growth and economic
                                       vitality.
                                  DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS
 Santa Ana is the largest City in To fully understand the City’s land use and development trends, the demographic
    Orange County in terms of     and socioeconomic characteristics of the community must be considered. Key
population and ranks 52nd in the  demographic trends likely to affect future land use and development include the
                  United States.
                    Census 2000   following:
                                      The City experienced a dramatic increase in population growth from 1970 to
                                       1990 in spite of its “built-out” character. During this time period, the City’s
                                       population nearly doubled while the County’s population increased by only
                                       25 percent.
                                      The City’s population as of January 1, 2009 is estimated by the California
                                       Department of Finance to be 355,662 persons. According to 2006 Orange
                                       County Projections, it is anticipated to grow to 371,203 persons by the year
                                       2015, based on growth trends.
                                  6                                                     CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN

                                                                  LAND USE ELEMENT
    Since 1990, the development of new housing in the City has not kept pace
     with its population growth. This has led to a significant increase in the
     average household size. The 2009 average in the City is 4.7 persons per
     household compared to 3.1 persons per household for the County.
    The 2009 housing stock of the City of Santa Ana consisted of 75,856 units
     including 40,875 single-family units and 34,978 multiple-family units and
     mobile homes. Approximately 51 percent of the housing units in the City are
     renter-occupied and 49 percent are owner-occupied per Census 2000.
    The City’s population is relatively young, with 115,074 persons (34.1%)
     younger than 18 years old. This is a greater percentage of children than for
     the County as a whole (27%). In 2000, the City’s population was the youngest
     among the larger cities in the nation. In addition, 18,132 residents (5.4%)
     were 65 years or older in 2000.
ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS
Even though the City is largely developed, a number of environmental factors
must be considered in planning for future development activity. The
environmental factors such as flooding and earthquake faults which typically
constrain development are not substantial deterrents to continued growth and
development in Santa Ana nor the region. Seismic, flooding, and air quality issues
are summarized below and further discussed in the Environmental Impact Report
for the Land Use Element:
    No known major fault traces are located in Santa Ana. However, the south-
     central portions of the City, and areas with lower elevations along the Santa
     Ana River, may be subject to liquefaction in the event of a major earthquake.
    The Santa Ana River is the major drainage channel flowing through the City.
     During severe storms, overflows of the Santa Ana River could lead to
     flooding.
    Santa Ana is located in the South Coast Air Basin which has yet to attain
     Federal and State standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulates.
     Major development proposals will continue to be subject to governmental
     review and oversight designed to improve air quality.

LAND USE ELEMENT
INFRASTRUCTURE
The City’s ability to implement the Land Use Plan of the Element is largely based
upon the current and future capacity of the City’s major infrastructure systems.
The capacity considerations included in the development of the Land Use Plan
include the following:
   The Santa Ana Water Department delivers service to City businesses and
    residents. Based on 2005 Urban Water Management Plan, the City expects to
    continue to have access to adequate water supplies through the year 2025
    without problems of major significance.
   Increases in development may require the construction of additional sewer
    facilities. The Orange County Sanitation District’s Sewer Master Plan
    outlines plans for the provision of efficient and adequate sewage disposal
    services throughout the County.
   Storm drain facilities in the City need replacement and upgrades in some
    areas to meet the 10-year storm criteria. The City’s Updated Master Plan of
    Drainage has identified and prioritized storm drain improvements needed in
    the City to accommodate development anticipated in the Land Use Plan.
   In compliance with State legislation, the City has implemented a citywide
    recycling program to reduce its rate of solid waste generation, and its impact
    upon County landfills.
The foregoing environmental and infrastructure-related factors may have
implications in regard to future land use and development. While none are
sufficient to preclude development, each must be thoroughly evaluated in
decisions regarding the development of particular sites and uses in implementing
the Land Use Plan.

POLICY PLAN
The goals and policies listed in this section of the Element direct land use and
development, and reflect long range planning objectives for the community.
They provide the framework around which the Land Use Plan and the
Implementation Plan are structured.
Since Santa Ana is an almost fully developed City, the goals and policies of this
Element largely focus on the conservation, maintenance, and rehabilitation of
existing property. At the same time, however, it is also sensitive to opportunities
for redevelopment and new development that serves to improve the quality of life
in the City.
LAND USE GOALS
Goal 1       Promote a balance of land uses to address basic community needs.
Goal 2       Promote land uses which enhance the City’s economic and fiscal
             viability.
Goal 3       Preserve and improve the character and integrity of neighborhoods.
Goal 4       Protect and enhance development sites and districts which are
             unique community assets that enhance the quality of life.
Goal 5       Ensure that the impacts of development are mitigated.
Goal 6       Reduce residential overcrowding to promote public health and safety.

LAND USE PLAN
The Land Use Plan is comprised of three components that direct and regulate
land use in Santa Ana. These include a Land Use Map, development intensity
standards, and adopted Specific Plans. These key components establish a
framework for land use and development in the City. The Land Use Plan
indicates the location, types, and extent of development and land uses throughout
Santa Ana. It consists of a map which designates land use categories and their
relative location, as well as development intensity standards for each category. The
Land Use Plan is further supported by Specific Plans which correlate to the Land
Use Plan.
DEVELOPMENT INTENSITY STANDARDS
As required by State law, the Land Use Element also establishes standards for
development intensity. These standards ensure that the types of development
permitted under each land use designation are well understood by the property
owner, decision-makers, developer, and the general public. Development intensity
refers to the size or degree of development possible within a particular land use
category.
The development intensity standard used for nonresidential development is floor
area ratio, which is the ratio of the building’s floor area to the total area of the lot
on which the building is located. The development intensity standard for
residential developments is “units per acre” which is a measure of the number of
units allowed for each acre of land - with the exception of Metro East District
Center, Transit Village District Center, Downtown District Center, Harbor
Corridor District Center, and Urban Neighborhood areas. To encourage a

rounding. The Land Use Plan is illustrated in Exhibit 2. Additional information
concerning the Land Use Plan and the land use designations is provided in Table

GLOSSARY
Air Basin. One of 14 self-contained regions in the United States, minimally
influenced by air quality in contiguous regions. Santa Ana is located in the South
Coast Air Basin.
Air Pollutant Emissions. Discharges into the atmosphere, usually specified in
terms of weight per unit of time for a given pollutant. The South Coast Air
Quality Management District has identified primary pollutants including carbon

this context, the ambient noise level constitutes the normal or existing level of
environmental noise at a given location.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). The-average equivalent A-
weighted sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of five decibels
to sound levels in the evening from 7 P.M. to 10 P.M. and after addition of 10
decibels to sound levels in the night before 7 A.M. and after 10 P. M.
Conservation. The management of natural resources to prevent waste,
destruction, or neglect.
Decibel (dB). A unit for describing the amplitude of sound, equal to 20 times the
logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the
reference pressure, which is 20 micropascals (20 micro Newtons per square
meter).
Density. Dwelling units per acre; population, families per square mile/acre.
Erosion. The process by which soil and rock are detached and moved by running
water, wind, ice, and gravity.

Fault. A fracture in the earth’s crust forming a boundary between rock masses
that have shifted. A fault is considered to be an active fault if it has exhibited
movement within the last 11,000 years and can be expected to move within the
next 100 years. A potentially active fault is a fault that last moved within the
Quaternary Period before the Holocene Epoch (the last 2,000,000 to 11,000). An
inactive fault which shows no evidence of movement in recent geologic time and
no potential for movement in the relatively near future.
Flood Plain. A lowland or relatively flat area adjoining inland or coastal waters
that is subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year
(i.e., 100-year flood).
Floor Area Ratio. The ratio of the gross floor area of all the buildings on a lot to
the area of the lot itself.
Ground Failure. Mudslide, landslide, liquefaction, or the seismic compaction of
soils.
Goal. The ultimate purpose of an effort stated in a way that is general in nature
and immeasurable. For example: “To enhance the open-space amenities of the
community” may be considered a goal.
Hazardous Material. An injurious substance, including pesticides, herbicides,
toxic metals and chemicals, liquefied natural gas, explosives, volatile chemicals,
and nuclear fuels.
Household. The census considers all persons living in a dwelling unit to be a
household, whether or not they are related. Both a single person living in an
apartment and a family living in a house are considered households.
Implementation Measure. An action, procedure, program or technique that
carries out general plan policy. Example: “Develop a geologic hazard overlay
zoning classification and apply it to all geologic hazard areas identified in the
general plan.”
Implementation Program (Action Program). A coordinated set of measures to
carry out the policies of the general plan. Example: Open-space action program
for implementing open-space policies.
Infrastructure. The physical systems and services which support development
and people, such as streets and highways, transit services, airports, water and
sewer systems, and the like.
Intensity. The level of land use (low to high) for buildings. The intensity may be
measured using lot coverage, floor area ratio, or building bulk.
Liquefaction. A process by which water-saturated granular soils transform from a
solid to a liquid state because of a sudden shock or strain.

LAND USE ELEMENT
Policy. A collective term describing those parts of a general plan that guide action,
including goals, objectives, policies, principles, plan proposals, and standards in
both the text and diagrams.
Standard. A specific, often quantified guideline, defining the relationship
between two or more variables. Standards can often directly translate into
regulatory controls. Example: Three to six dwelling units per net acre (low
density residential).
Subsidence. The gradual, local settling or sinking of the earth’s surface with little
or no horizontal motion. (Subsidence is usually the result of gas, oil, or water
extraction, hydro compaction, or peat oxidation, and not the result of a landslide
or slope failure.)
Surface Rupture. A break in the ground’s surface and associated deformation
resulting from the movement of a fault.
Vacancy Rate. The percentage of unoccupied housing units in a jurisdiction.
Vacancy rates usually differ according to tenure and housing type.

Appendix A
BACKGROUND
This section serves as the Appendix to the Land Use Element. It also discusses
related plans, describes land use standards in greater detail, and provides an
overview of existing conditions. The Appendix also provides a context for
planning, and an overview of those trends affecting the City.
The previous Land Use Element was adopted by the City in 1982, with the next
comprehensive update more than 16 years later in 1998. Major demographic
changes have occurred during this time including a shift in the City’s ethnic
diversity, a lower median age, and a growth in the average number of persons per
household. Other changes in this time period have included a growth in the
number of neighborhood associations in the City. These neighborhood
associations have had an active role in shaping land use and development in the
City.
Between 1982 and 1998, the City’s population has increased from 224,000 to

LAND USE ELEMENT
325,888 persons according to the State Department of Finance estimates. Since
1980, the number of persons living in the City grew by more than 73 percent.
During this period of substantial population growth, the number of housing units
remained relatively stable. Other notable demographic changes have occurred as
well. The City’s population is getting older. The median age of the population in
1980 was 26.2 years. By 2000, it had increased to 26.5 years compared to a median
age of 33.3 years for the County overall.
REGIONAL CONTEXT
The City of Santa Ana is located approximately 30 miles southeast of downtown
Los Angeles, and 10 miles northeast of Newport Beach in the west-central section
of Orange County. Santa Ana is bordered by the City of Orange, and
unincorporated areas of Orange County on the north; the City of Tustin on the
east; the cities of Irvine and Costa Mesa on the south; and the cities of Fountain
Valley and Garden Grove on the west. Freeway access to the City of Santa Ana is
provided by the Garden Grove Freeway (SR-22) and the Orange Freeway (SR-57)
on the north, the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) on the northeast, the Costa Mesa
Freeway (SR-55) on the east, the San Diego Freeway (I-405) on the south.
REGIONAL TRENDS
Santa Ana is the largest City in Orange County in terms of population (9 percent
of the County population) and fourth in terms of land area (27.3 square miles).
Approximately 58 percent of the City’s land area is developed with residential
uses. Commercial areas account for approximately 15 percent of the City’s total
land area, and industrial uses cover approximately 14 percent.
The City’s January 2009 population is estimated by the California Department of
Finance to be 355,662 persons. The 2009 housing stock consists of 75,856 dwelling
units and the average household size is 4.7 persons per household.
The City experienced rapid population growth from 1970 through 1990. The
City’s population in 1970 was 155,710 persons. By 1990, the population had
increased to 293,742 persons, representing an increase of 89 percent, while the
County’s population increased by only 25 percent. Moreover, during this period of
intensive population growth, the number of housing units in the City only grew
by approximately 12 percent. The City’s growth trends since 1990 have been more
modest and is expected to continue at approximately one percent per year through
the year 2010. The City’s housing production is likewise expected to continue to
be stable. There has been little growth in housing over the last several years;
however, additional infill housing is anticipated through 2015 particularly in the
City’s District Centers. With even modest population growth at the current rate of
housing production, the City is likely to continue to experience a rise in average
household size.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS AND PLANS
A number of other City plans and regulations are important considerations in
respect to implementation of the Land Use Element. The City’s zoning
regulations are a primary tool for implementing the Land Use Plan. In addition, a
number of Specific Plans have been adopted for key districts in the City which
helps to implement the plan for these areas. Finally, the City has also adopted
redevelopment plans and other programs which are effective tools in support of
adopted land use policy. While all of these Plans are discussed in the
Implementation Plan of this Element, they are also important when evaluating
development proposals.
SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN
The Land Use Element is an integral part of the General Plan, and is one of the
seven mandatory elements under State planning law. State law also requires all
elements of the General Plan to be internally consistent, and to provide similar
policy direction. The Elements which are most closely related to the Land Use
Element include the following:
   The Circulation Element establishes a transportation network to improve
    access, to facilitate efficient transportation, and to serve the circulation needs
    of future development contemplated in the Land Use Element. The scope of
    the Circulation Element has been expanded to include the Growth
    Management Element which is in conformance with the Measure M
    Program.
   The Urban Design Element seeks to create a positive visual appearance in
    the City through a variety of improvement programs, and the preservation of
    the area’s historical structures.
   The Open Space and Recreation Element seeks to provide sufficient open
    space to meet the recreational and aesthetic needs of the City. The Element
    also promotes the preservation of open space for the conservation of natural
    resources.
   The Housing Element promotes the preservation of the existing housing
    stock, the development of housing to meet existing and future needs, and the
    promotion of opportunities to develop and maintain affordable housing in the
    City.
   The Economic Development Element outlines ways to increase employment
    opportunities in the City, and to enhance Santa Ana’s economic base.
   The Airport Environs Element of the City of Santa Ana General Plan serves
    as a long-range policy guide ensuring that development in the City does not
    endanger the general public from safety or noise hazards associated with
    aircraft in the vicinity of John Wayne Airport (JWA). Additionally, it provides

    guidance for the purpose of ensuring navigable airspace is not impacted by
    future development in the City.
REDEVELOPMENT PLANS
Prior to the elimination of Redeveloping Agencies in California in 2011, an
estimated 5,185 acres (8.1 square miles) of land in Santa Ana was included in one
Merged Project Area. Prior to August 2004, this Project Area was divided into six
separate redevelopment project areas as described below. Of this total, 9 percent
(464 acres) is in residential use, 32 percent (1,678 acres) commercial, 40 percent
(2,075 acres) industrial, with other uses accounting for the remaining 19 percent
(968 acres). The following six redevelopment plans have been adopted:
   Santa Ana Redevelopment Plan. This plan which encompassed 694 acres,
    was adopted in 1973 to revitalize the downtown area, improve traffic
    circulation, reestablish businesses, and stimulate private investment;
   North Harbor Boulevard Redevelopment Plan. Adopted in 1982, the Plan
    covered 470 acres along Harbor Boulevard. The Plan for this area was
    adopted to define future development, and create design standards for new
    development in the area.
   Inter-City Commuter Station Redevelopment Plan. This plan, also adopted
    in 1982, focused on approximately 525 acres designed to provide for the
    development of a commuter rail station and to promote supporting uses.
   South Main Street Redevelopment Plan. Adopted in 1982, the plan applied
    to 1,500 acres in one of the primary commercial and industrial districts of the
    City;
   South Harbor Boulevard/Fairview Street Redevelopment Plan. Adopted in
    1982, this 1,085 acre plan covered a key industrial area in the vicinity of
    Harbor Boulevard and Fairview Street; and
   Bristol Corridor Redevelopment Plan. Adopted in 1989, the plan promoted
    the redevelopment of a 781 acres area along the Bristol Street corridor of the
    City.
The location of the previously existing redevelopment project areas are shown in
Exhibit A-1.

ENTERPRISE ZONE
A 11,790 acre portion of the City of Santa Ana has been designated by the State as
a California Enterprise Zone. This designation provides businesses with state tax
incentive programs designed to promote new business development, as well as
growth or expansion of existing businesses to revitalize the economy of the zone.
Tax benefits include sales and use tax credits, hiring credits, business expense
deductions, net loss operating carryovers, net interest deductions for lenders, and
employee tax credits. The designated area will remain an Enterprise Zone until
the year 2023.
The location of the Enterprise Zone is shown in Exhibit A-2.

LAND USE PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
To effectively achieve the broad range of goals outlined for the City’s future
growth and development, a variety of plans, programs, and regulations must be
relied upon. This section of the Element discusses these tools, and how they
correlate with implementation of the City’s land use goals.
DEVELOPMENT INTENSITY STANDARDS
Table A-1 summarizes the development intensity standard for each of the General
Plan designations, and provides land use distribution by acreage for the land use.
The intensity standards for the categories permitting residential development are
expressed in density, measured in “units per acre,” or floor area ratio and zoning
development standards in the case of certain Mixed Use land use designations.
The intensity standards for non-residential development are expressed as “floor
area ratio” or FAR. The FAR concept is illustrated in Exhibit A-3. The intensity
standards in concert with the zoning and development standards regulate the
massing, form and building size.

LAND USE ELEMENT
The City established development intensity standards in 1988, for nonresidential
land use designations. The standards measure intensity through the use of floor
area ratios. The floor area ratios proposed for the City’s major commercial
corridors are expected to remain in place over the life of the Land Use Element.
Those areas of the City proposed for the most intensive levels of development
include district centers, professional and administrative office districts, and several
other commercial centers with a unique character, or special development
concerns. Some of these areas correspond to those for which Specific Plans have
been prepared.
The proposed floor area ratio(s) for most of the City’s commercial corridors
allows structures of two to three stories with surface parking. The major
development areas-the District Centers and Professional/Administrative Office
Districts along Tustin Avenue and East First Street-allow mid-rise and high-rise
buildings with structured parking. These areas are expected to generate the
highest level of development activity in the City as centers of commerce. These
areas are listed in Table A-2 and are shown in Exhibit A-4. The floor area ratios
indicated in Table A-2 are the maximum building intensity allowed for
development.

All properties are subject to compliance with the development standards of the
underlying zoning district or overlay zone, and are not guaranteed to achieve the
designated intensity. The floor area ratio standard should therefore be interpreted
as a maximum intensity standard, and not as a development right. When
calculating the square footage allowed for a proposed development, no upward
rounding is permitted in determining the final permitted intensity. Likewise, no
upward rounding is permitted in calculating the allowable number of residential
units. For example, a calculation yielding a permitted density of 12.7 units for a
given development site, means that 12 units are permitted.
The use of floor area ratio as a development standard allows a high degree of
flexibility in both the location and design of a structure. The benefit of this
flexibility to the City is the possibility for the provision of more open space on a
site without reducing the total square footage of development. The following
guiding principals apply to the floor area ratio definitions:
    Floor area ratio refer to the gross floor area of a building divided by the gross
     lot area upon which it is located.
    Surface parking or parking structures are not included in the building area to
     calculate the floor area ratio, with the exception of the area affected by the
     Transit Zoning Code.
    To encourage lot consolidation for optimal site design, the floor area ratio can
     be calculated on an area wide basis for contiguous parcels which are part of a
     large, multi-structure project.
    To qualify for an area wide floor area ratio calculation, a project must be
     integrated in design and function, and the owner/developer must record deed
     restrictions limiting the project area to the legally allowed floor area ratio.
LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
The Santa Ana Land Use Plan includes 12 land use designations. These
designations indicate the types and intensity of development to be allowed on the
property which they cover. Generally, the designation also reflects the
predominant development character of the area. As is typical in older, urbanized
communities like Santa Ana, there are some areas where existing development
does not completely reflect the land use designation of the Land Use Plan. Where
these occur the properties are deemed legal non-conforming and may continue
until such time as the property has been vacant for twelve months or more. Each
land use designation and a brief description are discussed below.

Residential
The Land Use Plan provides for three distinct residential land use designations.
Residential development is also permitted in two other designations: District
Center and Urban Neighborhood. The Santa Ana Land Use Plan includes the
following residential land use designations:
    The Low Density Residential (LR-7) designation applies to those areas of
     the City which are developed with lower density residential land uses. The
     allowable maximum development intensity is 7 units per acre. Development
     in this category is characterized primarily by single-family homes. This
     designation applies to a large proportion of the City (6,459.4 acres)
     representing 47 percent of the City’s total land area.
    The Low-Medium Density Residential (LMR-11) designation applies to
     those sections of the City which are developed with residential uses at
     permitted densities of up to 11 units per acre. The land area included in this
     designation is approximately 420.6 acres. The great majority of the land
     designated as Low-Medium Density Residential is located in the westerly
     portion of the City, north and south of First Street. Properties with this
     designation are typically characterized by mobile home parks, a mixture of
     duplexes and single family residences, or small lot subdivisions.
    The Medium Density Residential (MR-15) designation applies to those
     sections of the City which are developed with residential uses at densities of
     up to 15 units per acre. Development in this designation is characterized by
     duplexes, apartments, or a combination of both. A total of 370.8 acres is
     designated as Medium Density Residential. The designation applies to areas
     located in the vicinity of downtown, areas north and south of MacArthur
     Boulevard, and in other areas where there are established multiple-family
     development projects.

LAND USE ELEMENT
Commercial
The Land Use Plan identifies three land use designations that encourage a variety
of office, retail and commercial enterprises to serve the community.
    The Professional/Administrative Office (PAO) designation applies to those
    areas where professional and/or administrative offices are predominant, or
    where such development is being encouraged. Land included in this
    designation is found primarily near the Civic Center, and along the First
    Street and Tustin Avenue Corridors in close proximity to freeways. There are
    other smaller PAO areas in the City such as along North Broadway and along
    portions of east and west Seventeenth Street. A total of 633.0 acres is included
    in this land use designation. The floor area ratio intensity standard applicable
    to this land use designation ranges from 0.5 to 1.0.
    The Professional and Administrative Office areas are intended to provide a
    unique environment for office development in those areas of the City where
    office uses are the predominant land use. The purpose for maintaining and
    supporting these areas exclusively for office and office-related uses is to
    encourage major employment centers at locations which significantly lessen
    the impact to the City’s local street system. The First Street/Tustin Avenue
    office corridor between the Santa Ana (I-5) and Costa Mesa (SR-55) Freeways
    serves this purpose. In addition, the orderly, well-maintained quality of
    existing development supports a continuation of these areas as functional
    office/employment centers.
    The Professional and Administrative Office designation includes a range of
    floor area ratios to differentiate development intensity and character in
    relation to adjacent land uses. The areas with a FAR of 0.5 are not major
    office centers, but rather have an established character of lower intensity
    garden office and professional service uses. These areas are typically adjacent
    to low density residential neighborhoods, or are converted residential office
    uses. Office development along East Fourth Street, between Grand Avenue
    and the Santa Ana Freeway, is typical of this low-rise office character. The
    PAO area located adjacent to the Civic Center contains a range of office
    development intensity which supports the City’s functional role as the
    government center of the County.
    The types of uses typically located in the PAO district include the following:
        Professional and administrative offices/office parks;
        Service activities such as copy centers, courier services, travel agencies,
         and restaurants when such uses are an integral component of a planned
         office development; and
        Professional uses such as accountants, attorneys, doctors, engineers, and
         insurance brokers.

   The General Commercial (GC) district applies to commercial corridors in
    Santa Ana including those located along Main Street, Seventeenth Street,
    Harbor Boulevard, and other major arterial roadways in the City. The
    intensity standard applicable to this designation is a floor area ratio of 0.5 -
    1.0, though most General Commercial districts have a FAR of 0.5. A total of
    888.3 acres of land is included in this designation.
    General Commercial districts are key components in the economic
    development of the City. They provide highly visible and accessible
    commercial development along the City’s arterial transportation corridors. In
    addition, General Commercial land uses provide important neighborhood
    facilities and services, including shopping, recreation, cultural and
    entertainment activities, employment, and education. The districts also
    provide support facilities and services for industrial areas including office and
    retail, restaurants and various other services.
    The General Commercial development standards are based upon the
    character and intensity of development, as well as the degree of access and
    market demand for these properties. The relationships to adjacent land uses,
    are also considered. Uses typically located in this district are:
        Business and professional offices;
        Retail and service establishments;
        Recreational, cultural, and entertainment uses; and
        Vocational schools.
    General Commercial Districts have a floor area ratio of 0.5 with the exception
    of the Mid-town area which has an floor area ratio of up to 1.0.
   One Broadway Plaza District Center is a separate land use designation as it
    has an F.A.R. of 2.9, which exceeds the typical District Center intensity limit.
    Additionally, it does not include a residential component. One Broadway
    Plaza is envisioned as a landmark professional office complex that will be a
    focal point in the Downtown Redevelopment area serving the Civic Center
    complex, Downtown, and Midtown urban areas. The City’s District Centers
    and major development areas are shown in Exhibit A-5.

LAND USE ELEMENT
Mixed Use
The Land Use Plan provides for two distinct mixed use land use
designations. These designations allow for both vertical and horizontal
mixed use developments, with an emphasis on linkages to a range of
transportation options:
   The District Center (DC) land use designation includes the major activity
    areas in the City. Seven areas of the City, totaling 646.7 acres, are designated
    as District Center. The intensity standard for the District Center designation
    ranges from a floor ratio of 1.0 to 5.0.
    District Centers are designed to serve as anchors to the City’s commercial
    corridors, and to accommodate major development activity. District Centers
    are to be developed with an urban character that includes a mixture of high-
    rise office, commercial, and residential uses which provide shopping,
    business, cultural, education, recreation, entertainment, and housing
    opportunities. Residential developments within some District Centers are
    allowed at a density of up to 90 units per acre when developed as an integral
    component of a master planned mixed use project. In Harbor Corridor, Metro
    East, Downtown, and Transit Village District Centers residential
    development intensity is based on a combination of floor area ratio and
    zoning overlay and/or development standards. Some District Centers serve as
    major retail and employment centers locally and regionally, and should
    include development which promotes the City as a regional activity center
    while creating an environment conducive to business on a regional scale.
    District Centers in Santa Ana include the following:
            The Main Place/City Place District Center includes a regional
             shopping center and office complex, as well as high intensity housing
             and mixed-use development.
            The Museum District located between the Downtown and
             MainPlace/City Place District Centers is proposed as a major
             office/cultural center which will be developed over the next 15 to 20
             years. The area will focus upon the expanded Bowers Museum, the
             Discovery Science Center and the construction of additional
             museums and cultural centers.
            The Downtown District serves as one of the County’s major
             employment and governmental operations centers complemented
             with a mix of residential, commercial, and services uses to enhance
             its urban vibrancy. Emphasis on streets that accommodate all modes
             of transportation, including mass transit, pedestrian and bicyclist is
             key in this urban setting.

                                                                  LAND USE ELEMENT
            The South Coast Metro District serves as a regional retail shopping
             area which includes a range of commercial services and office
             projects.
            The MacArthur Place District Center contains an existing
             office/hotel complex and a proposed major mixed use project which
             will include professional offices, supporting commercial, and mid
             and high-rise residential components.
            The Metro East District is envisioned as a vibrant urban village with
             a balance of office, residential, and service uses. Pedestrian and
             transportation linkages are key in this urban setting.
            The Transit Village District is envisioned as a vibrant intense urban
             village with a balance of employment centers, residential and service
             uses. Pedestrian and transit linkages to the Santa Ana Regional
             Transportation Center is key in this district.
            The Harbor Corridor Mixed Use Transit Corridor creates a vision
             for a more livable, sustainable setting through higher intensity
             housing and mixed use development, convenient access to transit,
             complete streets, and amenities that promotes active lifestyles.
    District Centers are considered to be the City’s “major development areas.”
    The most intense development in the City is targeted to these areas. The
    Tustin Avenue corridor is a major development area even though it is not a
    designated District Center. This area has developed over the years as a prime
    office corridor and employment area. The PAO designation facilitates the
    continued development of this area with high intensity, high quality regional
    office projects.
            The Urban Neighborhood (UN) land use designation applies to
             primarily residential areas with pedestrian oriented commercial uses,
             schools and small parks. The Urban Neighborhood allows for a mix
             of residential uses and housing types, such as mid to low rise
             multiple family, townhouses and single family dwellings; with some
             opportunities for live-work, neighborhood serving retail and service,
             public spaces and use, and other amenities. Either vertical or
             horizontal integration of uses is permitted based on zoning
             standards, with an emphasis on tying together the uses with
             pedestrian linkages and street frontages. Street connectivity is
             desirable, allowing for a high degree of walkablity, transit options,
             and other forms of transportation including pedestrian and bicycle
             travel.
             The intensity standard for the Urban Neighborhood ranges from a
             floor area ration of 0.5 to 3.0; with residential density based on a
             combination of floor area ratio and zoning development standards.

LAND USE ELEMENT
              A total of 271.1 acres of land in the City are designated Urban
              Neighborhood.
Industrial
The Industrial designation applies to those areas developed with manufacturing
and industrial uses. The designation applies to areas which are predominantly
industrial in character, and includes those industrial districts in the southwestern,
south central and southeastern sections of the City. A total of 2,152.8 acres of land
in the City is designated as Industrial. The maximum floor area ratio for this
designation is 0.45.
The Industrial districts of the City are vital to its economic health. These areas
provide employment opportunities for local residents, and generate municipal
revenues for continued economic development. As one of the County’s oldest
cities, Santa Ana has long been an industrial center for the region. The City’s goal
is to maintain this strong industrial base by setting land use policies which
preclude the intrusion of less intensive commercial or residential uses. Typical
uses found in this district include the following:
    Light and heavy product manufacturing and assembly.
    Commercial uses which are ancillary to industrial uses in the district.
Institutional
The Institutional designation includes the Civic Center, other governmental
facilities, City facilities and public institutions such as schools, etc. Only public
properties of approximately five acres or more are designated as Institutional. The
maximum applicable floor area ratio standard for this designation is 0.5. The 0.5
FAR is used as a guideline since most development in this designation are State,
federal, and local governmental facilities that are not subject to local development
regulations. A total of 796.3 acres of land is included in this designation.
Open Space
The Open Space designation is applied to parks, water channels, cemeteries and
other open space uses. A total of 1,014.7 acres are included in this land use
designation. Of this total, 358 acres of public park land is included in this land use
designation.

SPECIFIC PLANS
The City of Santa Ana has established Specific Plan areas to provide greater
flexibility in the development standards contained in the City’s General Plan and
Zoning Ordinance. The Specific Plans were established for planning areas which
would benefit from a comprehensive development scheme otherwise not be
possible under existing land use regulations. These specific plans include:
    Harbor Mixed Use Transit Corridor Specific Plan applies to an
     approximately 305-acre area. First adopted in 1992 and updated in 2014, the
     Specific Plan outlines the planned land uses and development standards for
     this area, as well as public improvements needed to support the anticipated
     uses. The Plan promotes vibrant residential and mixed use development
     along Harbor Boulevard, and connections between activity areas and local
     transit opportunities, while striving to minimize incompatibility with
     adjacent residential uses.
    Bristol Corridor Specific Plan applies to the 3.9-mile section of Bristol Street
     in the central portion of the City. This corridor includes a portion of the
     project area for the Bristol Street Corridor Redevelopment Plan. The Specific
     Plan utilizes the potential redevelopment of the corridor as an opportunity to
     upgrade the development character of the area, and to enhance the viability of
     commercial businesses. The process is being undertaken in coordination with
     the widening of Bristol Street.
    Midtown Specific Plan regulates development within the northern section of
     Santa Ana’s downtown area in order to create a thriving and integrated
     district for civic, business, cultural and retail activities. The Specific Plan
     emphasizes the area’s role as the urban center of the City through standards
     for development and urban design that promote pedestrian activity.
The location of the three specific plan areas are noted in Exhibit A-6 in the Policy
Plan.

ZONING CODE
The City’s Zoning Code outlines development standards for buildings, site size,
height, setbacks, lot coverage, minimum unit sizes, landscaping, parking, signs,
fences, and other features. Table A-3 compares the zoning categories with the
land use designations in the Land Use Plan.

                                                                  LAND USE ELEMENT
OTHER IMPLEMENTING TOOLS AND PLANS
As indicated previously, a number of adopted plans will continue to be
implemented over the “life” of this Land Use Element. These plans are
summarized below, and described in further detail in this Appendix (Relationship
to Other Plans and Elements).
   The Citywide Merged Redevelopment Project Area that combined the
    following preexisting individual project areas into one:
                 Santa Ana Redevelopment Plan. This plan, consisting of 694
                  acres was adopted in 1973 to revitalize the downtown area,
                  improve traffic, re-establish businesses, and stimulate private
                  investment.
                 North Harbor Boulevard Redevelopment Plan. Adopted in
                  1982, the Plan covers 470 acres along Harbor Boulevard. A
                  Specific Plan has been adopted for this area which outlines
                  future development, as well as design standards for new
                  development in the area and proposed infrastructure projects.
                 Inter-City Commuter Station Redevelopment Plan. This plan,
                  also adopted in 1982, focuses on 525 acres designed to provide for
                  the development of a commuter rail station, and to promote
                  supporting uses.
                 South Main Street Redevelopment Plan. The plan covers 1,500
                  acres in one of the primary commercial districts of the City.
                 South Harbor Boulevard/Fairview Street Redevelopment Plan.
                  This 1,085 acre plan covers a key industrial area in the vicinity of
                  Harbor Boulevard and Fairview Street.
                 Bristol Corridor Redevelopment Plan. The plan, which
                  encompasses 781 acres, promotes the redevelopment of the
                  Bristol Street corridor of the City.
   Enterprise Zone. A 11,790 acre portion of the City of Santa Ana was
    designated by the State as a California Enterprise Zone and will remain in
    effect until June 8, 2023. This designation provides businesses with State tax
    incentive programs designed to promote new business development, and
    growth or expansion of existing businesses for revitalization of the economy
    of the zone.
   Metro East Mixed Use Overlay Zone. This overlay zone stretches over 200
    acres located just north of the confluence of the Santa Ana Freeway and Costa
    Mesa Freeway. The overlay zone allows the introduction of a high-intensity,
    mixed use urban village within a previously developed office environment.

LAND USE ELEMENT
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
This section serves as a guide for the Land Use Element’s implementation, and
contains a listing of programs which will be effective in meeting this goal. The
programs are arranged below in alphabetical order.
   Uniform Code Review. The City will periodically review, and attempt to
    modify the Uniform Housing Code to reflect safe occupancy standards.
   Code Enforcement. Code enforcement is an ongoing program designed to
    ensure that homes and businesses meet current zoning regulations, as well as
    safety standards. Structures and/or properties not in compliance with City
    codes and regulations must be upgraded to protect the safety and welfare of
    people living and/or working in the City. Code enforcement efforts will
    continue as applicable to maintain acceptable standards.
   Environmental Review. The City will continue to evaluate the environmental
    impacts of new development, and provide mitigation measures prior to
    development approval, as required by the California Environmental Quality
    Act (CEQA). Environmental review shall be provided for major projects, and
    those having the potential to adversely impact the environment. In
    compliance with CEQA, the City also assigns responsibilities for verifying the
    implementation of mitigation measures.
   General Plan Annual Status Report. Staff will conduct an annual review and
    develop a status report detailing the efforts completed to implement the Land
    Use Element.
   Historic Review Process. The City will implement a process for the review,
    and designation of historic structures. This process is intended to preserve
    architecturally significant buildings by encouraging their ongoing
    maintenance and rehabilitation.
   Interagency Coordination. Designated representatives from the City will
    meet with other responsible governmental agencies concerning issues related
    to planning and development in the City, as appropriate. The City’s project
    review process is a component of its ongoing interagency coordination
    process.
   Mitigation Fees. The City assesses fees on new development to ensure that
    the public does not incur an undue financial burden in providing services to
    the project. The City annually evaluates reasonable and fair methods of
    assessing new development for the cost of providing any additional
    infrastructure required by the development.
   Project Review. The City will continue to implement its current project
    review procedures. The purpose of the project review process is to ensure that
    building design, architecture, and site layouts are compatible with
    surrounding development. This process includes coordination by the
A-32                                                CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN

                                                                   LAND USE ELEMENT
     interagency Development Review Committee (DRC) to ensure consistent and
     comprehensive application of City regulations and policies for all projects.
    Redevelopment Plans. The City will apply redevelopment tools associated
     with the implementation of the adopted redevelopment plans, as appropriate.
     The City will encourage the further development of industrial, commercial,
     and residential projects in suitable locations to strengthen the City’s tax and
     employment base.
    Special Studies. In certain instances, a special study may be required to
     address a particular issue. In these cases, a specific effort to identify staff
     resources needed to conduct the appropriate investigation and analysis will be
     identified.
    Zoning Code Review. The zoning code serves as a primary tool used by the
     City to regulate development. The City will develop a program to revise the
     Zoning Ordinance to ensure that development regulations and standards are
     consistent with community needs and high quality development. The City
     will initiate appropriate changes to the ordinance to ensure, where
     appropriate, conformity between the Land Use Element and Zoning Map.
LAND USE PLAN BUILDOUT
As indicated previously, the City of Santa Ana has been almost completely
developed for many years. As a result, any new development will necessarily
consist of redevelopment and infill development on the remaining vacant and
underutilized parcels. Many parcels with nonresidential land use designations
will never be developed to the maximum intensity permitted under the General
Plan.
Table A-4 indicates the development possible under the build-out of the Land
Use Plan. The build-out for residential land uses considered two scenarios.
Effective build-out for residential development is calculated by adding the 16,893
units possible in the areas designated as District Center to the existing 74,588
units presently found in the City per Census 2000. Theoretical build-out for
residential development considered the development possible if all of the areas
designated as residential were developed according to the permitted Land Use
Plan intensities. Since the Land Use Element does not contemplate the
elimination of existing housing in the City, the effective build-out figure
represents a more realistic estimate of future residential development.
As indicated in Table A-4, three of the non-residential land use designations have
a range in FAR intensities. For the non-residential land use designations, effective
build-out considered the development possible under the lower range of FAR
intensities while theoretical build-out considered the upper FAR range. Typically,
parking and landscaping requirements will result in significantly less floor area
for commercial and industrial developments than that which is permitted under
the General Plan.
CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN                                                   A-33

LAND USE ELEMENT
As indicated in Table A-4, between 72,255 to 91,481 housing units are allowed by
the Land Use Plan. The additional units which presently exist in the City beyond
the maximum number permitted under the theoretical buildout scenario are a
reflection of the higher density multiple-family developments constructed in the
1970’s and 1980’s. However, the purpose of the Land Use Plan as it applies to the
residential areas is to preserve and maintain the stability of existing
neighborhoods, regardless of the character of development. The intent of the Plan
is not to create any displacement, nor decrease existing development densities.
Rather, it is to ensure a safe, healthy, and livable environment for City residents.
Existing residential development entitlements are protected through this Land
Use Element, applicable Zoning regulations, and sections of the City code
pertaining to legal nonconforming uses.
The Land Use Element’s implementation may result in an increase in the
amount of commercial, office, and industrial development in the City. As
indicated in Table A-4, up to 33,678,013 square feet of commercial and office

LAND USE ELEMENT
EXISTING CONDITIONS
LAND USE CHARACTERISTICS
The City of Santa Ana contains a variety of land uses, reflecting its maturity as a
commercial, employment, and administrative center for Orange County. Since,
the City has very limited vacant land available for development, most new
3projects consist primarily of infill development and redevelopment activities on
properties which are currently improved. Because of the City’s age, some
properties are undergoing development for the second or third time.
The City has a total land area of 27.3 square miles or 17,408 acres. Total land use
distribution is as follows: 10,216 acres (58.7%) is residential, 2,643 acres (15.2%) is
commercial (retail, office, and mixed use), 2,481 acres (14.3%) is industrial, and
1,538 acres (8.8%), contains public and institutional uses. The remaining 530
acres (3.0%) is undeveloped and open space areas. The distribution of existing
land uses within the City is summarized in Table A-5.

estimates, the City of Santa Ana is projected to grow to 350,172 persons by the
year 2020, if historic trends continue. Between 1990 and 2009, the City’s housing
inventory has decreased by 856 units while the population grew by 18 percent.

In addition to being the largest city in Orange County, Santa Ana now ranks 9th
in California and 52nd in the nation. The population of the City of Santa Ana
represents the largest percentage of the County’s total population, or
approximately 12 percent.
Population growth in the City since 1990 absent a corresponding increase in
housing units has led to a significant increase in the average household size. The
2009 average household size in the City was 4.7 persons per household. This
compares to 3.3 persons per household for the County as a whole. According to
the State Department of Finance, Santa Ana had the highest average household
size in the County in 2003.
Based on the 2000 US Census, the City’s population is relatively young, with
127,603 persons (38%) under 20 years old. This is a greater percentage of children
than is the case for the County (which is 29.7 percent). This condition is to be
expected given the rate of natural population increase and the high birth rate
experienced within the City during the 1980’s. Also, 18,565 persons (5.5%) are
over 65 years old. More than 76 percent or 257,097 residents are of Hispanic
origin, with only 12.4 percent Caucasian, 8.7 percent Asian, 1.3 percent Black,
and 0.4 percent of American Indians or other races.
The percentage of Hispanic residents is over three times greater than the overall
County average (22%). The County’s total population is approximately 51.3
percent white and 30.8 percent Hispanic. Race and ethnicity statistics are shown
in Table A-7.

HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
The 2000 housing stock of the City of Santa Ana consisted of 74,475 units. The
housing supply consists of 33,453 single-family detached units, 6,377 attached
units, 7,511 units in projects with 2 to 4 units, 14,125 units in projects with 5 to 49
units, 9,106 units in developments with 50 or more units, 3,879 in mobile home
units, and 24 in other dwelling units. According to the 2000 US Census, almost 50
percent, or 37,816 units, are renter-occupied, 49.3 percent owner-occupied with
the remainder (or 4.5%) vacant.
The State Department of Finance 2009 estimate for the City’s housing stock is
75,856 units. This represents an increase of 883 units from 1990. The current
housing inventory includes 33,743 detached single-family units, 7,135 attached
single-family units, 7,469 units in 2 to 4 unit projects, 23,600 units in projects with
5 units or more, and 3,909 mobile homes. The current vacancy rate is estimated at
4.7 percent. Table A-8 summarizes the change in housing unit characteristics
between 1990 and 2009.

LAND USE ELEMENT
LAND USE CONSTRAINTS
GEOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS
Soil conditions within the City are a direct result of stream and wind deposition.
A soil survey by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service
shows that there are a wide variety of soils existing in the City, some of which may
present constraints to future development.
In addition to soil constraints, numerous geological faults have been mapped
within the Southern California region, many of which are located within 50 miles
of the City. However, no known major fault traces are located in the City and
Santa Ana is not included in an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone. The most
significant issues warranting consideration include the following:
   Expansive Soils - Highly expansive soils require compaction prior to
    development to reduce the amount of swelling when wet. A high soil
    expansion hazard is present in Omni and Thapto soils which are found in the
    south central section of the City, south of Segerstrom Avenue between Susan
    Street and the Costa Mesa Freeway.
   Erosion - An erosion hazard is associated mainly with soils along the Santa
    Ana River and Santiago Creek. Since the Santa Ana River is channelized,
    erosion hazards remain only on Santiago Creek.
   Surface Rupture - Surface rupture refers to the tearing and/or displacement
    of the earth along a fault trace that has experienced an earthquake. No
    known or suspected faults are located within the City. As a result, the
    potential for surface rupture is considered to be low.
   Ground Motion - The intensity of ground shaking at a given location
    depends primarily on an earthquake’s magnitude, distance from the source
    (epicenter), fault characteristics, and the characteristics of soils, and geology
    of the impacted area. Most emergency preparedness planners and geological
    scientists expect a major damaging earthquake within the next 20 years. The
    greatest potential for earthquake damage is expected to come from a large
    earthquake along the Newport-Inglewood fault. A Magnitude 7 earthquake
    on the fault would be expected to cause significant damage regionally.
   Liquefaction - The City of Santa Ana is located in an area with relatively
    high groundwater. In the event of a major earthquake, liquefaction within the
    City is generally not considered to be a hazard if the water table is deeper
    than 50 feet, except for areas along drainage channels with shallow
    groundwater. There are some areas in the City with groundwater depths of
    less than 50 feet. The south-central portions of the City (shown in
    Exhibit A-7), and those areas along the Santa Ana River contain soils which
    are susceptible to liquefaction.

    Soil Subsidence and Settling - Soils in portions of the City along the Santa
     Ana River may be subject to settling since most of these areas contain
     unconsolidated and recent alluvium. Subsidence and swelling, and ground
     settlement are generally due to the withdrawal of fluids from the earth such as
     oil or water. Groundwater pumping may also lead to land subsidence.
     Subsidence hazards in Santa Ana are shown in Exhibit A-8.
FLOOD HAZARDS
The Santa Ana River is the major drainage channel flowing through the City and
many of the major storm drains in the City, are (directly or indirectly) connected
to it. The lower Santa Ana River from Weir Canyon Road to the Pacific Ocean
was improved as a part to the U. S Army Corps of Engineers’ Santa Ana
Mainstream Project. The reach through Santa Ana consists mostly of a
trapezoidal, concrete lined channel with a bottom width of 180 feet.
Santiago Creek is the main tributary to the Santa Ana River. The creek joins the
Santa Ana River just south of Garden Grove Boulevard. Areas of the City located
within 100 and 500-year flood plains are identified in Exhibit A-9.

AIR QUALITY
Based on recent data, the area has experienced improved air quality as indicated
by the low number of days in which clean air standards were exceeded. When
considering the overall trend, some improvements were observed for ozone,
carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide. This improvement is largely attributable to
more stringent vehicle emissions standards, the elimination of older polluting
vehicles, and cleaner burning fuels (leaded fuel is no longer permitted in the Los
Angeles Basin). Finally, larger stationary emission sources are gradually being
eliminated or undergoing retrofit with the best available pollution control
technology.
Future development in the City will continue to be subject to the “clean air”
requirements of the California Air Resources Board, South Coast Air Quality
Management District, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
Santa Ana’s roadways are experiencing increased traffic congestion as are most
areas of Orange County due to growth and development in the City and
surrounding region. The increased traffic projected for coming years will result in
additional congestion on local streets in the absence of mitigation. Key traffic
issues considered the following:
   Regional Transportation. The City of Santa Ana is served by five freeways:
    the Santa Ana (I-5), the Garden Grove (SR-22), the Costa Mesa (SR-55), San
    Diego (I-405), and the Orange freeway (SR-57). These freeways are situated
    near the northern, eastern and southern boundaries of the City, and carry
    many daily commuters into the City, as well as to the surrounding region.
   Local Roadways. Local roadways in the City generally form a grid pattern in
    north-south and east-west directions. Major streets are within one half-mile
    or one-mile intervals, and interrupted mainly by the freeways and the Santa
    Ana River. Key circulation and transportation issues include the following:
   Projected Traffic. The year 2010 traffic volume projections for year 2010 for
    area roadways are based on the CSF-CDR housing, population, and
    employment projections. These projections indicate that the subregion’s
    housing units will increase by 23 percent by the year 2010 creating a
    corresponding increase in vehicular traffic.
   Increased Traffic. The City has experienced significant population growth
    during the past several decades. At the same time, a number of major
    commercial and employment centers have been developed in the City while
    additional development is envisioned in the near term. The preponderance of
    this population growth and new development occurred years after the City’s
    roadway network was initially constructed. Because of the nature and extent
CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN                                                A-49

LAND USE ELEMENT
    of existing development, there are limited opportunities to expand, or
    otherwise improve the City’s basic roadway system.
   Roadway Improvements. The County of Orange and Caltrans are working
    with a number of Orange County cities to improve the efficiency, and/or
    expand the capacity of selected major arterial roadways. A number of
    widening projects are planned in the City, as well as realignments of selected
    roadway segments.
ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES
The City of Santa Ana is largely developed and there are few areas which have
not been impacted by urbanization. The majority of the remaining open space
areas within the City have been set aside for parkland, flood control, or other types
of utility easements. Most of this open space has undergone significant
modification and no longer reflects the native habitats which existed in the area
prior to original European settlement. Santiago Creek is not channelized in its
entirety, and some non-riparian habitats remain along this channel. Plant life in
the City of Santa Ana is limited to non-native, introduced, exotic, and ornamental
species which are used for landscaping.
   Sensitive Species. The California Department of Fish and Game maintains a
    listing (State and Federal) of endangered, rare, and threatened plants and
    animals, plus those which warrant listing by the scientific community. A
    review of the Natural Diversity Database indicated that sensitive species are
    limited to a possible occurrence of the San Diego Horned Lizard which is
    apparently found throughout the region but is restricted in range. The San
    Diego Horned Lizard was last sighted in 1922 in the northern section of
    Santa Ana, and is still presumed to be in existence today.
   Potential Habitat Impacts. The Natural Diversity Database identifies the
    San Diego horned lizard as an endangered species candidate. It was last seen
    in 1922 in the northern part of Santa Ana. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
    recommends early consultation with their office for development projects
    which are likely to impact any of the listed species, in order to avoid or reduce
    impacts to such species and to resolve potential conflicts early in the
    development process.
   Wetland Habitats. The Santa Ana River is channelized and no longer
    contains wetland habitat. No natural blue line streams are identified in the
    area according to topographic maps published by the U.S. Geological Survey.
   Locally Significant Species. The official City flower is the hibiscus, and the
    official tree is the Jacaranda, which can be found along a number of roadway
    medians and parkways throughout the City.

                                                                   LAND USE ELEMENT
ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES
At present, there are no mineral extraction activities in the City. Regionally
significant resources are found farther north of the City, along the Santa Ana
River within the cities of Orange and Anaheim. As an almost fully developed City,
Santa Ana has an established electrical and natural gas distribution system in
place.
    Significant Mineral Aggregate Resource Areas (SMARA) Designations. The
     Santiago Creek also provides aggregate resources in areas north of the City of
     Santa Ana. However, there are no SMARA areas designated within the City.
    Mineral Extraction Activities. While oil fields and drilling operations abound
     in Newport Beach and Huntington Beach, the City of Santa Ana is not
     known to lie above an oil or gas field.
    Natural Gas. The Southern California Gas Company (SCG) serves the
     entire region. An established network of gas supply and distribution lines
     provides natural gas service to most urban developments in the area. The
     Southern California Gas Company has stated that they will be able to service
     new development in Santa Ana without the need for expansion of existing
     facilities, except for properties which are currently within the pipeline
     network.
    Electrical Energy. Electrical service to the City is provided by Southern
     California Edison (SCE). SCE operates a comprehensive system of power
     generating transmission facilities. Utility easements and lines are located
     throughout the City providing electrical service to every parcel of land in the
     City. Underground utility districts have been established along most major
     streets under Southern California Edison’s Rule 20-A. The under-grounding
     of overhead lines is an ongoing process in the City.
    Energy Conservation. Compliance with Title 25 of the California
     Administrative Code on the use of energy efficient appliances and insulation
     has reduced energy demand stemming from new development. SCE also
     offers public information and technical assistance to developers and
     homeowners regarding energy conservation measures and programs.
MAN-MADE RISK
Land uses which handle hazardous materials are found throughout the City of
Santa Ana. These uses are generally located on industrial land and on some large
commercial sites which use or sell hazardous materials. Hazardous materials are
utilized, generated, or stored by commercial land uses such as gas stations, dry
cleaners, pest control services, photography shops, and other uses which store
chemicals and hazardous materials on-site. Issues requiring consideration include
the following:

LAND USE ELEMENT
   Cerclis Sites. The City of Santa Ana Fire Department, Regional Water
    Quality Control Board, the State Office of Planning and Research, and the
    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency maintain a listing of sites which use,
    store, or manufacture hazardous materials, or sites which have experienced
    contamination in the past. The list indicates sites which candidates for
    Superfund financial assistance.
   Fire Hazards. The City of Santa Ana is largely developed, and does not have
    any major areas containing flammable brush, grass or trees. Urban fire
    hazards may be expected in the City, such as those created by heavy industrial
    land uses, older structures which do not conform to current fire safety
    standards, human carelessness or accidents, the presence of hazardous
    materials, and arson.
   Aircraft. The John Wayne Airport (JWA) is located approximately one-half
    mile southwest of Santa Ana. Tall structures have the potential to cause
    obstruction to air navigation for JWA in specific areas as defined in the City of
    Santa Ana Airport Environs Element. The City of Santa Ana will submit for
    Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) review new development or
    redevelopment projects that contain amendments to the City’s General Plan
    or a specific Plan and/or adoption or approval of a zoning ordinance or
    building regulation, within the JWA planning area.
NOISE EXPOSURE
Persons living, working, or otherwise visiting the City are subject to noise from a
variety of sources. While traffic noise from major roadways and freeways within
the area are the greatest contributor of noise, stationary sources produce a
significant share. Noise is an important consideration in formulating the Land
Use Plan, in that the Plan must consider land use compatibility in order to ensure
that activities generating high noise levels are not located in areas where noise
sensitive land uses are found.

   City’s Noise Control Ordinance. The Santa Ana Noise Ordinance
    establishes standards for maximum noise levels within residential areas of the
    City. The exterior noise level standard is 55 dBA from 7 AM to 10 PM, and 50
    decibels (dBA) from 10 PM to 7 AM. The interior noise level standard is 55
    dBA from 7 AM to 10 PM, and 45 dBA from 10 PM to 7 AM. Standards for
    impact noise, simple tone noise, speech, music, and any other combination
    are 5 dBA lower than the above standards, and noise levels exceeding these
    standards are limited to relatively shorter periods of time.
   Building Insulation Standards. The California Administrative Code,
    Title 24, Building Standards, Chapter 2.35 outlines noise insulation
    performance standards in order to protect persons within new hotels, motels,
    apartment houses, and dwellings other than detached single-family
    dwellings. This section of the Government Code requires an interior noise
    level of 45 dBA or less for residential projects.
   Noise Land Use Compatibility. The State Office of Noise Control has
    prepared “Guidelines for the Preparation and Content of Noise Elements of
    the General Plans.” This publication provides a guide for gauging the
    compatibility of noise-sensitive land uses in areas subject to noise levels of 55
    to 80 dBA. Residential uses are normally unacceptable in areas exceeding 65
    dB CNEL (Noise Impact Zone 1) and conditionally acceptable in areas
    between 60 to 65 dB CNEL (Noise Impact Zone 2).
   Traffic Noise. The greatest source of noise affecting the City is vehicle traffic
    on major arterial roadways and area freeways. Many areas of the City are
    subject to high ambient noise levels in excess of 70 dBA. Most areas along
    major arterial roadways are subject to noise levels in excess of 65 dBA.
   Airport Noise. The City updated its Airport Environs Element detailing
    potential noise impacts for the Planning Area impacted by the John Wayne
    Airport. Although the area within the 60 and 65 CNEL contours (Noise
    Impact Zones 1 and 2) is relatively small, there are sound attenuation
    requirements to minimize the adverse effects on the community within the
    specified areas.

LAND USE ELEMENT
UTILITIES
The City of Santa Ana, because of its built-out character, has a well developed
system of public infrastructure which includes water supply and distribution,
sewer facilities, and storm drains and other flood control facilities. This section
provides an overview of those factors which were considered in the Element’s
preparation including water, sewer, and flood control infrastructure, as well as the
handling and disposal of solid waste.
   Water Service Purveyors. Domestic water services in Santa Ana are primarily
    provided by the City of Santa Ana Public Works Agency. There are two small
    mutual water companies which serve a minor portion of the City through
    groundwater wells. The Santa Ana Water Department delivers an average of
    43 million gallons of water daily to some 48,000 customers. This service is
    provided through 17 groundwater wells, 444 miles of water mains, and 8
    storage tanks or reservoirs with a combined capacity of 45 million gallons.
    Wells in the Santa Ana area withdraw water from between 600 to 2,700 feet
    below ground level.
   Water Supply. Santa Ana is a member city of the Metropolitan Water District
    (MWD). MWD receives water from the State Water project emanating from
    sources in the Sierra Nevada range, and the Colorado River via Lake Havasu.
    Santa Ana pumps approximately 70 percent of its water supply from wells,
    and purchases 30 percent of its supply from MWD. The City’s wells can
    provide a maximum of 71 millions gallons per day (mgd), and MWD can
    provide 65 mgd. In 1993, the City withdrew 29,704 acre-feet of water, and
    imported 11,007 acre-feet of water from MWD; 13.8 acre-feet of reclaimed
    water, and 4,614 acre-feet of water pumped through the In-Lieu
    Replenishment Program.
   Sewers. Approximately 500 miles of local sewer lines are maintained by the
    City of Santa Ana, with sewer trunks owned and maintained by the Orange
    County Sanitation District which provides trunk sewage collection, and
    sewage treatment services to the City of Santa Ana.
   Sewage Treatment. Sewage from the City is diverted into Reclamation Plant
    Number 1 in the City of Fountain Valley. This plant has a design capacity of
    60 million gallons per day with expansion planned to increase capacity to 120
    mgd. The Orange County Sanitation District has indicated that the District’s
    facilities are adequate to handle the present demand for sewage treatment.
    Increases in development will require the construction of additional facilities,
    and the District’s Master Plan provides for orderly development of the
    necessary facilities. Sewer connection fees from new developments pay for
    system improvements and upgrades, as needed, in accordance with the
    District’s Master Plan. The District’s Sewer Master Plan is currently
    undergoing an update which will generally provide for the provision of
    efficient and adequate sewage disposal services to the County.

                                                                  LAND USE ELEMENT
    Water Reclamation. The Orange County Sanitation District’s Green Acres
     Project allows for the reuse of reclaimed wastewater for industrial and
     landscape irrigation uses. Approximately 980 acre-feet of recycled water is
     currently used for irrigation in Fountain Valley, Santa Ana and Costa Mesa.
     As much as 7,500 acre-feet of wastewater is planned for treatment and reuse,
     and will extend this service to the cities of Newport Beach and Huntington
     Beach.
    Solid Waste Collection. Great Western Reclamation is the exclusive solid
     waste hauler in the City of Santa Ana. The company has approximately
     40,600 residential customers and 5,500 commercial, industrial and other
     customers, as of June 1997. Solid waste is brought by truck to the Sunset
     Environmental Service Transfer Station in Irvine and the CVT Transfer
     Station in Anaheim. Residual wastes are trucked to the Frank Bowman Brea
     Olinda/Alpha-Olinda Landfills.
    Waste Reduction. In 1995, the City generated approximately 293,117 tons of
     solid wastes. Some 55,941 tons of these wastes were recycled for a diversion
     rate of approximately 19%. This diversion was mainly due to the use of a
     materials recovery facility for all wastes. A curbside recycling program was
     started in 1996 and is expected to increase waste diversion. The City of Santa
     Ana has adopted a Source Reduction and Recycling Element (SRRE) in 1992
     which outlines the City’s commitment to a 25 percent solid waste reduction
     by 1995 and a 50 percent reduction by 2000. The plan calls for recycling,
     composting, special waste disposal, and education and public information
     programs.
CULTURAL RESOURCES
Cultural Resources include both archaeological resources for which the City has a
great potential, since the Santa Ana River flows directly through it. Most
prehistoric settlements were located near sources of water. The original town of
Santa Ana was founded in 1869 by William Spurgeon as an agricultural area of
citrus and walnut groves, with the town center consisting of a shopping area and
post office. By 1889, Santa Ana was the County Seat with development occurring
at a rapid pace. By the turn of the century, the City was the governmental and
financial center of Orange County.
    Archaeological Resources. An archaeological record search at the UCLA
     Institute of Archaeology indicated there is one recorded prehistoric site in the
     City. The site, near Santiago Creek in the northwest section of the City,
     contained grinding stones, and was disturbed by the development of a
     residential subdivision in 1965. An additional six prehistoric sites are located
     within one mile of City boundaries.

LAND USE ELEMENT
   Historic Sites. Eighteen post contact (following European contact)
    archaeological sites have also been identified in the area. Two sites are within
    the downtown area of the City. One site contained a large 19th Century
    cistern, refuse pits, and sub-surface architectural features. Occupation of the
    site was dated to around the 1870’s. The second site contains numerous refuse
    pits and architectural features. Occupation was also estimated to be in the
    1870’s, and assumed to be part of the first site.
   Cultural Resource Management. The UCLA Archaeological Information
    Center recommends that future development located adjacent to areas where
    archaeological resources have been found be reviewed by the South Central
    Coastal Information Center in order to identify sensitive areas. The
    assessment may include a records search, a physical walk-over, and test
    excavations. Potentially sensitive areas are indicated in Exhibit A-11.
   National Register Sites. There are a number of sites in the City which are
    considered to be National and State historic resources. These sites are shown
    in Exhibit A-12. Aside from the sites listed in the National Register of
    Historic Places, the City has developed a list of culturally significant sites
    which have been included in the Santa Ana Register of Historic Properties.
    The California State Historic Resources Inventory also includes some 1,500
    structures and sites in the City. Significant resources are specifically identified
    in the Land Use Element EIR.
   Historic Districts. There are a number of historic districts in the City. Aside
    from Downtown, French Park and Henninger Park , other historic areas of
    the City include North Broadway, Floral Park, North Central, Northeast and
    Wilshire Square neighborhoods.
   Locally Designated Sites. The City has recently completed a survey of
    historical properties (constructed prior to 1940) by neighborhood.
    Approximately 1,340 structures were identified as having potential historic
    significance which must be evaluated prior to demolition or alteration.
    Revised standards for historic structures are expected to be developed in the
    future. The City has formed a Historic Resources Review Committee to
    develop a new historical preservation ordinance in response to under-
    utilization of the present ordinance, as well as continuing occurrences of
    historic structure demolition.

OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION
The Open Space land use designation covers a variety of public and private land
uses including, but not limited to, parkland, golf courses, cemeteries, railroad
rights-of-way, riverbeds and creek beds. The common theme among these
properties is that they contain little or no development and provide opportunities
for the active or passive enjoyment of an open space. Open spaces are further
discussed in the Open Space and Recreation Element.
The City has 38 parks and recreation facilities, and operates playgrounds at
several school sites. The City parks cover approximately 358 acres. The City also
maintains three senior citizen centers and two community service centers. Key
issues considered in the formulation of this Land Use Element include the
following:
    Open Space Standards. The City’s current standard for parkland is 2.0 acres
     per 1,000 residents. This standard is relatively conservative. By comparison,
     the National Parks and Recreation Association recommends a standard of
     between 2.5 to 5.0 acres of parkland for every 1,000 residents. The parkland to
     population ratio is currently at 1.2 acres per thousand population. In 1980,
     the parkland ratio was 1.7 acres per thousand population, but with substantial
     increases of the City’s population during the 1980’s, new parks have not been
     developed at a rate sufficient to maintain or increase the City’s parkland ratio.
    Open Space Need. Based on the City’s current 2009 population of 355,662
     residents (State of California Department of Finance), a total 711 acres of
     parkland would be required to meet the 2 acre per 1,000 residents standard.
     The City currently has 358 acres of parkland.
    Park Utilization. Park use is very heavy during the late afternoon and early
     evening hours throughout most of the week particularly during the summer
     months. Because of the heavy use and the lack of funds available for capital
     improvements and routine maintenance, there is presently a need to replace
     and improve equipment at all existing parks, especially children’s playground
     equipment. The City has a park acquisition development fund which is
     utilized for new park development.
    Joint Use. Regional parks near the City of Santa Ana which may be utilized
     by residents include the Mile Square Regional Park in Fountain Valley and
     Fairview Regional Park in Costa Mesa. Mile Square Regional Park is located
     on a 640-acre site near the southwest boundary of the City. The Fairview
     Regional Park is located southwest of Santa Ana, and includes 210 acres of
     park land. In addition, the City of Santa Ana and the school districts have
     joint use agreements for school play fields and parks. Also, Newport Beach
     which has excellent public access and facilities is less than 20 minutes from
     Santa Ana.

LAND USE ELEMENT
   Trails. The Santa Ana River Greenbelt corridor includes various city and
    regional parks, flood control facilities, bicycle and hiking trails, and water
    district facilities. A one-mile segment of the Santiago Creek bicycle trail has
    been completed at this time. Once finished in its entirety, this trail will run
    northeasterly to the intersection of Black Star Canyon Road and Santiago
    Canyon Road. Other Class I bikeways in the City are found along the
    Southern Pacific Railroad (SPRR) tracks to the south, the Santa Ana Gardens
    Channel, Flower Street, and Maple Street. Class II bikeways (striped and
    dedicated bike lanes) in the City run along segments of Raitt Street,
    Greenville Street, Ross Street, Chestnut Avenue, Santa Ana Boulevard,
    Fairview Street, the Santa Ana Gardens Channel, the Santa Ana Gardens
    Channel, Flower Street, and Sunflower Street.

SUMMARY
The new City of Santa Ana General Plan was developed through an extensive
process of public participation involving citizens, elected and appointed City
officials and City Staff.
The General Plan has been developed to conform to state law and to meet local
planning needs through the year 2000. Periodic updates of the new General Plan
are anticipated.
The General Plan builds upon Santa Ana’s historical assets including the City’s
heritage as the governmental and financial center of Orange County and the
buildings, districts and streetscapes which reflect this heritage.
The General Plan anticipates two major potentials that can shape Santa Ana over
the next several decades. The plan anticipates and maximizes the probability of
the Countywide rapid transit system to be located in Santa Ana and encourages
mixed use development and preservation m corridors and centers relating to this
new access and visibility.
The General Plan has three major sections: the Framework Plan, Policy Plan, and
Environmental Impact Report.
1. The Framework Plan describes Santa Ana’s overall planning strategy and
     program. This strategy reorganizes the City’s land use and urban design
     structure to take maximum advantage of:
         the economic development advantages offered by Santa Ana’s historic
          regional location and functions
         an improved multi-modal transportation system including:
          –   Countywide rapid transit access to Santa Ana
          –   improved local transit
          –   improved auto access to major activity centers
          –   a new Amtrak station
          –   a downtown multi-modal transportation and bus center

        –    a downtown shuttle system
        –    new pedestrian connections within and between land use districts
             and to public transportation facilities.
    The Framework Plan provides an overview of the City’s implementation
    program which includes:
       continuing involvement of the community in developing the detailed
        implementation plans that will be developed for subareas of the
        Framework Plan
       efficient processing of development and rehabilitation proposals by
        means of a Development Review Team

PLANNING CONTEXT
HISTORICAL
Santa Ana’s rich history provides a legacy for community planning and
revitalization in the 1980’s. Santa Ana was founded in 1869 by William Spurgeon.
The original town, laid out by Mr. Spurgeon, consisted of 24 blocks. The town
served as a shopping center and post office for surrounding agricultural areas.
In 1878 the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived and the Santa Fe Railroad followed
in 1886. This encouraged development of the City. In 1889 the County seat was
located in Santa Ana and this further stimulated the development of businesses,
stores, financial institutions and hotels serving the metropolitan population.
Citrus and walnut farms were still plentiful and buying and selling land became
the number one enterprise. The First to 17th Street area was subdivided during
the building boom of the 1880’s. Many of the structures in downtown and the
surrounding bungalow homes were built in the early 1900’s and 1920’s.
The City is retaining and building upon its important governmental, retailing and
employment roles in the County and the rich architectural and streetscapes
heritage associated with the City’s history.
REGIONAL
Santa Ana is geographically central to the developable land within Orange
County. The City has excellent relationships to freeways, rail services via Amtrak
and air transportation at the John Wayne Airport. Because of Santa Ana’s
geographic centrality and functional importance to the County, the Orange
County Transit District is planning major fixed rail transit corridors in the Main
Street and Pacific Electric right-of-ways. These regional transportation
improvements, combined with improvements to freeway access points and local
streets, provide Santa Ana with abundant development opportunities for the
1980’s.

                                                                  NOISE ELEMENT
PLANNING PROCESS
The Planning Process used in creating the Santa Ana General Plan is
summarized in Exhibit 3 and related photographs. The process involved:
        a 150-person Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) to which all citizens
         applying were appointed by the City Council
        the Planning Commissioners who served as chairpersons of five CAC
         subcommittees: Land Use and Urban Design, Circulation, Housing,
         Economic Development and Environmental Factors
        the City Council who participated in goal setting and policy making
         workshops
        the public-at-large who participated in a series of Town Forums and
         Public Hearings
        City Staff who worked with The Arroyo Group (TAG) in conducting the
         planning process and who evaluated the program as it evolved.
The six key steps in the planning process were:
1. Data Collection and Analysis. The data base for the previous General Plan
    was outdated and up-to-date census data was not available. Emphasis was
    placed on community definition of problems and opportunities through CAC
    and Staff Steering Committee workshops and mapping. TAG subcontractors
    also gathered key data in areas such as market demand, traffic, seismic, etc.
    This data was summarized and analyzed in a separate Problems and
    Opportunities Report.
2. Formulation of Goals and Objectives. Initial goals and objectives were
    developed through workshops, with the CAC and City staff. Several cycles of
    refinement were done by TAG based on input from the Planning
    Commission, City Council, CAC and staff.
3. Formulation of Subarea Alternatives. Santa Ana has a large number of fixed
    elements such as streets and land uses. Therefore, subarea plans were
    developed to provide alternative land use patterns in different parts of the
    City. Each subarea plan was related to an urban design framework previously
    approved by the CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
4. Formulation of Areawide General Plan Alternatives. Areawide General Plan
    alternatives focused on different combinations of subarea plans.
5. Plan Selection Plan. Selection was done through a series of meetings with the
    CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
6. Plan Refinement. Plan refinement was accomplished by staff review of a
    Preliminary Draft, and CAC, Planning Commission and Public-at-Large
    comments on a Public Hearing Draft.

POLICY PLAN
INTRODUCTION
The Policy Plan section of the General Plan sets forth the detailed policies of the
City relative to the framework Plan described in Section 1.
Each element of the Policy Plan contains goals, objectives, implementation
policies and implementation programs.
Each element also contains a Planning Factors section which reflects the major
issues identified through the citizen participation process.
The Plan Components section of each element describes the planning and design
concepts illustrated in the maps and provides an overview of implementation
considerations.
Noise has many sources, including industrial processes, vehicular transportation,
use of amplified sound, construction, and human speech. Through careful land
use planning, Santa Ana can ensure that the activities which produce result in
minimal interference with the activities which are sensitive to noise.

                                                                                                  NOISE ELEMENT
The City’s goal is to minimize noise problems in areas sensitive to noise because
Santa Ana is almost fully developed, the main focus of the Noise section is on
remedial measures to deal with existing noise problems, prevention of new noise
problems through proper arrangement of noise sensitive land uses in relationship
to circulation systems and establishment of appropriate noise emission or
insulation standards for the various land uses.
PLANNING FACTORS
Definition of undesirable or unhealthful noise levels must precede the goal of
minimizing noise problems. The City adopts the following standards and
guidelines for noise levels for land uses:
                                                       Table 1
                                   Interior and Exterior Noise Standards

 Notes:
 1
   Interior areas (to include but are not limited to: bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, living rooms, dining rooms,
   closets, corridors/hallways, private offices, and conference rooms.
 2
   Exterior areas shall mean: private yards of single family homes, park picnic areas, school playgrounds,
   common areas, private open space, such as atriums on balconies, shall be excluded form exterior areas
   provided sufficient common area is included within the project.
 3
   Interior noise level requirements contemplate a closed window condition. Mechanical ventilation system or
   other means of natural ventilation shall be provided per Chapter 12, Section 1305 of the Uniform Building
   Code.
All Residential uses should be protected with sounds insulation over and above
that provided by normal building construction when constructed in areas exposed
to greater than 60 dB CNEL.
The above standards and guidelines represent an appreciation that higher
intensity land uses bring with them higher noise levels simply because more
people are using these areas. Insuring low noise levels will help to insure that
housing is kept will-maintained and keeps value over time, reducing municipal
expenditures and maintaining revenues.

NOISE ELEMENT
NOISE ABATEMENT
Some areas of Santa Ana are exposed to levels of freeway or rail noise that are
considered unacceptable for new residential development. Noise conflicts in such
cases can be mitigated by providing barriers between the noise source and the
residential use, or by providing sound insulation in existing residences. Generally,
barriers should be provided to protect residential uses.
Exhibit 4 illustrates transportation noise sources in the City and classifies arterial
streets by the expected distance from the arterial where the noise level will exceed
60 dB CNEL or Ldn and sound insulation or barriers should be provided to
protect residential uses.
NOISE PREVENTION
Potential noise problems may be prevented by ensuring that planning for
residential uses carefully considers proximity to major transportations corridors
and other noise generators. Adherence to proper noise-related setbacks for noise
sensitive uses can reduce noise to acceptable or desirable levels for those uses. The
distance required varies with the expected volume of traffic. The distance may be
reduced by providing walls or berms between the noise source and the use.
The graph below indicates the required distance from transportation noise
sources to achieve desired noise levels for a range of traffic flows. At the time
development takes place, developments proposed in zones that would be
incompatible under standards of the noise abatement plan are required to include
a report indicating how these standards will be achieved.

SUMMARY
The new City of Santa Ana General Plan was developed through an extensive
process of public participation involving citizens, elected and appointed City
officials and City Staff.
The General Plan has been developed to conform to state law and to meet local
planning needs through the year 2000. Periodic updates of the new General Plan
are anticipated.
The General Plan builds upon Santa Ana’s historical assets including the City’s
heritage as the governmental and financial center of Orange County and the
buildings, districts and streetscapes which reflect this heritage.
The General Plan anticipates two major potentials that can shape Santa Ana over
the next several decades. The plan anticipates and maximizes the probability of
the Countywide rapid transit system to be located in Santa Ana and encourages
mixed use development and preservation m corridors and centers relating to this
new access and visibility.
The General Plan has three major sections: the Framework Plan, Policy Plan, and
Environmental Impact Report.
1. The Framework Plan describes Santa Ana’s overall planning strategy and
     program. This strategy reorganizes the City’s land use and urban design
     structure to take maximum advantage of:
         the economic development advantages offered by Santa Ana’s historic
          regional location and functions
         an improved multi-modal transportation system including:
          –   Countywide rapid transit access to Santa Ana
          –   improved local transit
          –   improved auto access to major activity centers
          –   a new Amtrak station
          –   a downtown multi-modal transportation and bus center

        –    a downtown shuttle system
        –    new pedestrian connections within and between land use districts
             and to public transportation facilities.
   The Framework Plan provides an overview of the City’s implementation
   program which includes:
       continuing involvement of the community in developing the detailed
        implementation plans that will be developed for subareas of the
        Framework Plan
       efficient processing of development and rehabilitation proposals by
        means of a Development Review Team
       a carefully coordinated development program to foster and assist private
        investment through:
        –    land assembly

PLANNING CONTEXT
HISTORICAL
Santa Ana’s rich history provides a legacy for community planning and
revitalization in the 1980’s. Santa Ana was founded in 1869 by William Spurgeon.
The original town, laid out by Mr. Spurgeon, consisted of 24 blocks. The town
served as a shopping center and post office for surrounding agricultural areas.
In 1878 the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived and the Santa Fe Railroad followed
in 1886. This encouraged development of the City. In 1889 the County seat was
located in Santa Ana and this further stimulated the development of businesses,
stores, financial institutions and hotels serving the metropolitan population.
Citrus and walnut farms were still plentiful and buying and selling land became
the number one enterprise. The First to 17th Street area was subdivided during
the building boom of the 1880’s. Many of the structures in downtown and the
surrounding bungalow homes were built in the early 1900’s and 1920’s.
The City is retaining and building upon its important governmental, retailing and
employment roles in the County and the rich architectural and streetscapes
heritage associated with the City’s history.
REGIONAL
Santa Ana is geographically central to the developable land within Orange
County. The City has excellent relationships to freeways, rail services via Amtrak
and air transportation at the John Wayne Airport. Because of Santa Ana’s
geographic centrality and functional importance to the County, the Orange
County Transit District is planning major fixed rail transit corridors in the Main
Street and Pacific Electric right-of-ways. These regional transportation
improvements, combined with improvements to freeway access points and local
streets, provide Santa Ana with abundant development opportunities for the
1980’s.

PLANNING PROCESS
The Planning Process used in creating the Santa Ana General Plan is
summarized in Exhibit 3 and related photographs. The process involved:
        a 150-person Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) to which all citizens
         applying were appointed by the City Council
        the Planning Commissioners who served as chairpersons of five CAC
         subcommittees: Land Use and Urban Design, Circulation, Housing,
         Economic Development and Environmental Factors
        the City Council who participated in goal setting and policy making
         workshops
        the public-at-large who participated in a series of Town Forums and
         Public Hearings
        City Staff who worked with The Arroyo Group (TAG) in conducting the
         planning process and who evaluated the program as it evolved.
The six key steps in the planning process were:
1. Data Collection and Analysis. The data base for the previous General Plan
    was outdated and up-to-date census data was not available. Emphasis was
    placed on community definition of problems and opportunities through CAC
    and Staff Steering Committee workshops and mapping. TAG subcontractors
    also gathered key data in areas such as market demand, traffic, seismic, etc.
    This data was summarized and analyzed in a separate Problems and
    Opportunities Report.
2. Formulation of Goals and Objectives. Initial goals and objectives were
    developed through workshops, with the CAC and City staff. Several cycles of
    refinement were done by TAG based on input from the Planning
    Commission, City Council, CAC and staff.
3. Formulation of Subarea Alternatives. Santa Ana has a large number of fixed
    elements such as streets and land uses. Therefore, subarea plans were
    developed to provide alternative land use patterns in different parts of the
    City. Each subarea plan was related to an urban design framework previously
    approved by the CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
4. Formulation of Areawide General Plan Alternatives. Areawide General Plan
    alternatives focused on different combinations of subarea plans.
5. Plan Selection Plan. Selection was done through a series of meetings with the
    CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
6. Plan Refinement. Plan refinement was accomplished by staff review of a
    Preliminary Draft, and CAC, Planning Commission and Public-at-Large
    comments on a Public Hearing Draft.

POLICY PLAN
INTRODUCTION
The Policy Plan section of the General Plan sets forth the detailed policies of the
City relative to the framework Plan described in Section 1.
Each element of the Policy Plan contains goals, objectives, implementation
policies and implementation programs.
Each element also contains a Planning Factors section which reflects the major
issues identified through the citizen participation process.
The Plan Components section of each element describes the planning and design
concepts illustrated in the maps and provides an overview of implementation
considerations.
Open space land is a limited and valuable resource, one becoming increasingly
precious as the City takes on a more urban character. The Open Space, Parks and
Recreation element sets forth the City’s priorities for retention and treatment of
this important element of urban life.

PLANNING FACTORS
Santa Ana presently has about 400 acres of public park and recreation facilities
distributed generally uniformly throughout the City. Approximately two acres of
open space exists for each 1,000 residents, a rate consistent with prevailing
standards. Little current or future potential exists for the acquisition of additional
park lands and open spaces, both because the City is almost fully developed and
because demands on capital funds are highly competitive.
The Santa Ana River and Santiago Creek are part of a regional system of open
space corridors promoted by the Orange County General Plan Open Space
Element. Centennial Park is located in a relatively central position in the City and
also is an important node of open space within the regional system. These links to
a regional system of open space will become increasingly significant to Santa Ana
residents as the City builds out.
Many of the goals of the Conservation element can be promoted through Open:
Space policies. Parks provide increased vegetation and constitute one of Santa
Ana’s few readily-identifiable natural resources.
PLAN COMPONENTS
Since available vacant land is an increasingly scarce commodity, the primary
thrust of the plan into upgrade, enhance and improve the quality of existing park
and open space facilities, and to expand the range of programming and services
offered in connection with those spaces. lathe urban setting, reaching the goal of
high quality recreational and open space should take priority over objectives
relating to quantity. The plan also calls for multiple use of open space facilities,
such as flood control channels, reservoirs, and the like, for recreational as well as
conservation functions. Finally, in recognition of limited financial resources, the
plan suggests the development of means by which the private sector can more
readily participate in the provision of open space and recreation opportunities for
all Santa Ana residents.

SUMMARY
The new City of Santa Ana General Plan was developed through an extensive
process of public participation involving citizens, elected and appointed City
officials and City Staff.
The General Plan has been developed to conform to state law and to meet local
planning needs through the year 2000. Periodic updates of the new General Plan
are anticipated.
The General Plan builds upon Santa Ana’s historical assets including the City’s
heritage as the governmental and financial center of Orange County and the
buildings, districts and streetscapes which reflect this heritage.
The General Plan anticipates two major potentials that can shape Santa Ana over
the next several decades. The plan anticipates and maximizes the probability of
the Countywide rapid transit system to be located in Santa Ana and encourages
mixed use development and preservation m corridors and centers relating to this
new access and visibility.
The General Plan has three major sections: the Framework Plan, Policy Plan, and
Environmental Impact Report.
1. The Framework Plan describes Santa Ana’s overall planning strategy and
     program. This strategy reorganizes the City’s land use and urban design
     structure to take maximum advantage of:
         the economic development advantages offered by Santa Ana’s historic
          regional location and functions
         an improved multi-modal transportation system including:
          –   Countywide rapid transit access to Santa Ana
          –   improved local transit
          –   improved auto access to major activity centers
          –   a new Amtrak station
          –   a downtown multi-modal transportation and bus center

         –    a downtown shuttle system
         –    new pedestrian connections within and between land use districts
              and to public transportation facilities.
    The Framework Plan provides an overview of the City’s implementation
    program which includes:
        continuing involvement of the community in developing the detailed
         implementation plans that will be developed for subareas of the
         Framework Plan
        efficient processing of development and rehabilitation proposals by
         means of a Development Review Team
        a carefully coordinated development program to foster and assist private
         investment through:
         –    land assembly
         –    coordinated provision of public improvements
         –    Specific Plans
         –    citizen participation coordination
         –    low interest loans and grants
         –    project promotion
2. The Policy Plan spells out the:
        goals and objectives which underlie the Framework Plan
        greater detail regarding implementation policies and programs
         supporting the Framework Plan.
    Together, the Framework Plan and Policy Plan envision a new image for
    Santa Ana consisting of:
        increased economic activity to provide jobs and maintain a solid financial
         base for city services
        improvement of Santa Ana’s housing stock for a full range of income
         groups and lifestyles
        the finest multi-modal transportation system in Orange County
        a new physical environment consisting of:
         –    preserved and enhanced viable Neighborhoods
         –    District Centers combining new shopping facilities with
              recreational, cultural, education, employment and special housing
              types
         –    improvement of Santa Ana’s major Industrial Districts
         –    Mixed Use Corridors with a range of uses similar to the District
              Centers but with more facilities related to regional transit and auto
              access.

PLANNING CONTEXT
HISTORICAL
Santa Ana’s rich history provides a legacy for community planning and
revitalization in the 1980’s. Santa Ana was founded in 1869 by William Spurgeon.
The original town, laid out by Mr. Spurgeon, consisted of 24 blocks. The town
served as a shopping center and post office for surrounding agricultural areas.
In 1878 the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived and the Santa Fe Railroad followed
in 1886. This encouraged development of the City. In 1889 the County seat was
located in Santa Ana and this further stimulated the development of businesses,
stores, financial institutions and hotels serving the metropolitan population.
Citrus and walnut farms were still plentiful and buying and selling land became
the number one enterprise. The First to 17th Street area was subdivided during
the building boom of the 1880’s. Many of the structures in downtown and the
surrounding bungalow homes were built in the early 1900’s and 1920’s.
The City is retaining and building upon its important governmental, retailing and
employment roles in the County and the rich architectural and streetscapes
heritage associated with the City’s history.
REGIONAL
Santa Ana is geographically central to the developable land within Orange
County. The City has excellent relationships to freeways, rail services via Amtrak
and air transportation at the John Wayne Airport. Because of Santa Ana’s
geographic centrality and functional importance to the County, the Orange
County Transit District is planning major fixed rail transit corridors in the Main
Street and Pacific Electric right-of-ways. These regional transportation
improvements, combined with improvements to freeway access points and local
streets, provide Santa Ana with abundant development opportunities for the
1980’s.

PLANNING PROCESS
The Planning Process used in creating the Santa Ana General Plan is
summarized in Exhibit 3 and related photographs. The process involved:
        a 150-person Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) to which all citizens
         applying were appointed by the City Council
        the Planning Commissioners who served as chairpersons of five CAC
         subcommittees: Land Use and Urban Design, Circulation, Housing,
         Economic Development and Environmental Factors
        the City Council who participated in goal setting and policy making
         workshops
        the public-at-large who participated in a series of Town Forums and
         Public Hearings
        City Staff who worked with The Arroyo Group (TAG) in conducting the
         planning process and who evaluated the program as it evolved.
The six key steps in the planning process were:
1. Data Collection and Analysis. The data base for the previous General Plan
    was outdated and up-to-date census data was not available. Emphasis was
    placed on community definition of problems and opportunities through CAC
    and Staff Steering Committee workshops and mapping. TAG subcontractors
    also gathered key data in areas such as market demand, traffic, seismic, etc.
    This data was summarized and analyzed in a separate Problems and
    Opportunities Report.
2. Formulation of Goals and Objectives. Initial goals and objectives were
    developed through workshops, with the CAC and City staff. Several cycles of
    refinement were done by TAG based on input from the Planning
    Commission, City Council, CAC and staff.
3. Formulation of Subarea Alternatives. Santa Ana has a large number of fixed
    elements such as streets and land uses. Therefore, subarea plans were
    developed to provide alternative land use patterns in different parts of the
    City. Each subarea plan was related to an urban design framework previously
    approved by the CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
4. Formulation of Areawide General Plan Alternatives. Areawide General Plan
    alternatives focused on different combinations of subarea plans.
5. Plan Selection Plan. Selection was done through a series of meetings with the
    CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
6. Plan Refinement. Plan refinement was accomplished by staff review of a
    Preliminary Draft, and CAC, Planning Commission and Public-at-Large
    comments on a Public Hearing Draft.

POLICY PLAN
INTRODUCTION
The Policy Plan section of the General Plan sets forth the detailed policies of the
City relative to the framework Plan described in Section 1.
Each element of the Policy Plan contains goals, objectives, implementation
policies and implementation programs.
Each element also contains a Planning Factors section which reflects the major
issues identified through the citizen participation process.
The Plan Components section of each element describes the planning and design
concepts illustrated in the maps and provides an overview of implementation
considerations.
The basic needs of society for health, education, welfare, safety, and recreation are
met by a city’s public facilities, utilities and services. The types of facilities and
services, and the physical and structural relationships between them, expresses the
City’s institutionalized response to the desires and needs of the citizenry.
Accordingly, facility, utility, and service policies as addressed in this element are

points of departure for an on-going process of facility provision and service
delivery.
The Public Facilities Plan addresses the following facilities and services:
education, library, medical, cultural, government and public utilities. The Public
Safety Element deals with police and fire facilities and services, and the Open
Space, Parks and Recreation Element discusses park and recreation facilities.
PLANNING FACTORS
As a developed City, Santa Ana has already put in place most of its major public
facilities. The majority of the public investment needed to create a facilities system
appropriate to the community’s needs has already been made.
Santa Ana’s population is expected to gradually increase over the next twenty
years by about 45,000. As population growth occurs, some additional facilities
such as schools and libraries may be required. These requirements will depend in
part upon household formation and birth rate trends and the City’s land
development patterns.
Limited public financial resources constitute the largest single constraint upon the
City’s public facilities. Shrinking tax dollars strain the City’s ability to
accommodate desirable growth and expansion in its facilities and services. These
limitations give rise to the need for increased private sector support for
community facilities and the creation of a public-private partnership to aid in the
expansion and maintenance of adequate levels of services.
Education
The City of Santa Ana is included within the jurisdiction of four school districts:
Santa Ana Unified, Garden Grove Unified, Tustin Unified and Orange Unified.
The facilities of Santa Ana Unified School District account for over 90 percent of
school resources available in the City. These facilities are over-enrolled with
respect to current available space. Elementary enrollment (K-5) is over-enrolled
by approximately 2,500 students. Elementary schools now utilize 60 temporary
buildings, representing 15 percent of all elementary facilities. Intermediate and
high school facilities are adequate, although one intermediate school now
operates on a year-round basis. High school facilities are expected to be adequate
without major expansion or year-round operation only until 1986.
The lack of funds and available space for new facilities will cause increasingly
critical problems for the school district. More year-round operation of facilities
and the securing of funds from the State for building programs will aid in
resolution of this problem.
Although the City of Santa Ana has no jurisdictional control over funding for
school facilities, the over-enrollment and other deficiencies in City school facilities
are City problems, and negatively impact the community as a whole. Accordingly,
the City should enact an ordinance under the authority of S.S. 201 requiring a
school impaction mitigation fee from new residential development.

PUBLIC FACILITIES ELEMENT
Library
The City library system consists of a central library in Civic Center’ Plaza and
two branch libraries in the western portion of Santa Ana: the McFadden and
Newhope Branches. The library has a combined annual circulation of
approximately 900,000 volumes. The Central library Is approximately 40,000
square feet in size, and the branches are approximately 8,500 square feet each.
Hospitals and Community Health Facilities
The City is served by a total of seven hospitals; four are in Santa Ana and three
are in Orange. These hospitals, Santa Ana-Tustin Community, Doctor’s, Mercy
General, Riverview, St. Joseph’s, Children’s Hospital of Orange County, and
University of California at Irvine Medical Center, provide a combined total of
over 1,500 beds and all provide 24-hour emergency care. Health services are also
available through the Orange County Health Department located in the Civic
Center. Other community health facilities in the community include the County
of Orange East Regional Mental Health Services and Mental Health Association
of Orange County.
Cultural Facilities
The principal cultural facility in Santa Ana is the Bowers Museum. The Bowers
Museum describes the history and earlier culture of the Santa Ana Orange
County region Current plans call for expansion in two phases to approximately
four times its present size.
Governmental Facilities
Santa Ana has created an important multi-jurisdictional government center
which serves not only City residents but those of the County-at-large. The Civic
Center includes City Hall, central library and police facilities, as well as County,
State and Federal offices. The Civic Center is readily accessible to all City
residents, being located essentially in the center of the City. As discussed in the
Circulation Element, access for regional visitors will be improved via
recommendations made in that part of this General Plan.

                                                            PUBLIC FACILITIES ELEMENT
Public Utilities
Because the City is largely built-out, its utility system are in place and generally
fixed in nature. Increased development density resulting from land use objectives
of this General Plan may require expansion of systems capacities and/or
accelerated repair and maintenance programs. The City provides for such
improvements in a systematic manner through its Capital Improvements
Program, which is updated annually. Implementation of the Land Use element
will be carefully coordinated with the Capital Improvements Program so as to
ensure continuing adequacy of the public utility systems.
PLAN COMPONENTS
One of the most important recommendations of the Public Facilities Element is
the creation of a public-private partnership to expand and upgrade City facilities
and services. This recommendation is made in recognition of continuing
limitations on available public funds. Municipal tax revenue constraints impede
the City’s ability to provide all of the facilities and services its residents and
workers might otherwise enjoy. Therefore, means must be found to augment tax
receipts available for public facilities and services such as the utilization of tax
increment redevelopment funds.
A primary direction for creation of such a partnership lies in recent Federal tax
legislation which raises limits on corporate charitable contributions. The potential
exists for businesses and industries headquartered or otherwise doing business in
Santa Ana to take a positive, supportive stance in assisting the City to provide
higher levels of service by making financial contributions for that purpose while
simultaneously realizing tax benefits for themselves.
Additional support for school facilities can be obtained through enactment of an
ordinance requiring a school impaction mitigation fee from new residential
developments. At the time this Element was adopted, school overcrowding was
critical and new facilities badly needed. Such a measure can bring the
development sector more fully into the broad community improvement effort.
Important opportunities for public-private partnership will be created in the
Mixed Use Corridors and District Centers, where substantial new, relatively
intense development is planned. These development opportunities are attractive
and exciting ones and can provide new options for expansion of public facilities.
New office or retail complexes, for example, can be planned to include space for
public libraries and cultural facilities. Private properties can be designed to
include spaces used both by their occupants and the public-at-large, at different
times of the day.
As Santa Ana’s development opportunities are realized, it will be important that
the expansion, maintenance and repair needs of public utilities and other facilities
are integrated into the Capital Improvement Program process in such a way that
the new development does not overtax existing services.

Public Safety Element
SUMMARY
The new City of Santa Ana General Plan was developed through an
extensive process of public participation involving citizens, elected and
appointed City officials and City Staff.
The General Plan has been developed to conform to state law and to meet
local planning needs through the year 2000. Periodic updates of the new
General Plan are anticipated.
The General Plan builds upon Santa Ana’s historical assets including the
City’s heritage as the governmental and financial center of Orange County
and the buildings, districts and streetscapes which reflect this heritage.
The General Plan anticipates two major potentials that can shape Santa
Ana over the next several decades. The plan anticipates and maximizes
the probability of the Countywide rapid transit system to be located in
Santa Ana and encourages mixed use development and preservation m
corridors and centers relating to this new access and visibility.
The General Plan has three major sections: the Framework Plan, Policy
Plan, and Environmental Impact Report.
1. The Framework Plan describes Santa Ana’s overall planning strategy
    and program. This strategy reorganizes the City’s land use and urban
    design structure to take maximum advantage of:
        the economic development advantages offered by Santa Ana’s
         historic regional location and functions
        an improved multi-modal transportation system including:
         –   Countywide rapid transit access to Santa Ana
         –   improved local transit
         –   improved auto access to major activity centers
         –   a new Amtrak station
         –   a downtown multi-modal transportation and bus center

PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
        –   a downtown shuttle system
        –   new pedestrian connections within and between land use
            districts and to public transportation facilities.
    The Framework Plan provides an overview of the City’s
    implementation program which includes:
       continuing involvement of the community in developing the
        detailed implementation plans that will be developed for subareas
        of the Framework Plan
       efficient processing of development and rehabilitation proposals
        by means of a Development Review Team
       a carefully coordinated development program to foster and assist
        private investment through:
        –   land assembly
        –   coordinated provision of public improvements
        –   Specific Plans
        –   citizen participation coordination
        –   low interest loans and grants
        –   project promotion
2. The Policy Plan spells out the:
       goals and objectives which underlie the Framework Plan
       greater detail regarding implementation policies and programs
        supporting the Framework Plan.
    Together, the Framework Plan and Policy Plan envision a new
    image for Santa Ana consisting of:
       increased economic activity to provide jobs and maintain a solid
        financial base for city services
       improvement of Santa Ana’s housing stock for a full range of
        income groups and lifestyles
       the finest multi-modal transportation system in Orange County
       a new physical environment consisting of:
        –   preserved and enhanced viable Neighborhoods
        –   District Centers combining new shopping facilities with
            recreational, cultural, education, employment and special
            housing types
        –   improvement of Santa Ana’s major Industrial Districts

PLANNING CONTEXT
HISTORICAL
Santa Ana’s rich history provides a legacy for community planning and
revitalization in the 1980’s. Santa Ana was founded in 1869 by William
Spurgeon. The original town, laid out by Mr. Spurgeon, consisted of 24
blocks. The town served as a shopping center and post office for
surrounding agricultural areas.
In 1878 the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived and the Santa Fe Railroad
followed in 1886. This encouraged development of the City. In 1889 the
County seat was located in Santa Ana and this further stimulated the
development of businesses, stores, financial institutions and hotels
serving the metropolitan population. Citrus and walnut farms were still
plentiful and buying and selling land became the number one enterprise.
The First to 17th Street area was subdivided during the building boom of
the 1880’s. Many of the structures in downtown and the surrounding
bungalow homes were built in the early 1900’s and 1920’s.
The City is retaining and building upon its important governmental,
retailing and employment roles in the County and the rich architectural
and streetscapes heritage associated with the City’s history.
REGIONAL
Santa Ana is geographically central to the developable land within Orange
County. The City has excellent relationships to freeways, rail services via
Amtrak and air transportation at the John Wayne Airport. Because of
Santa Ana’s geographic centrality and functional importance to the
County, the Orange County Transit District is planning major fixed rail
transit corridors in the Main Street and Pacific Electric right-of-ways.
These regional transportation improvements, combined with
improvements to freeway access points and local streets, provide Santa
Ana with abundant development opportunities for the 1980’s.

PLANNING PROCESS
The Planning Process used in creating the Santa Ana General Plan is
summarized in Exhibit 3 and related photographs. The process involved:
        a 150-person Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) to which all
         citizens applying were appointed by the City Council
        the Planning Commissioners who served as chairpersons of five
         CAC subcommittees: Land Use and Urban Design, Circulation,
         Housing, Economic Development and Environmental Factors
        the City Council who participated in goal setting and policy
         making workshops
        the public-at-large who participated in a series of Town Forums
         and Public Hearings
        City Staff who worked with The Arroyo Group (TAG) in
         conducting the planning process and who evaluated the program
         as it evolved.
The six key steps in the planning process were:
1. Data Collection and Analysis. The data base for the previous
    General Plan was outdated and up-to-date census data was not
    available. Emphasis was placed on community definition of problems
    and opportunities through CAC and Staff Steering Committee
    workshops and mapping. TAG subcontractors also gathered key data
    in areas such as market demand, traffic, seismic, etc. This data was
    summarized and analyzed in a separate Problems and Opportunities
    Report.
2. Formulation of Goals and Objectives. Initial goals and objectives
    were developed through workshops, with the CAC and City staff.
    Several cycles of refinement were done by TAG based on input from
    the Planning Commission, City Council, CAC and staff.
3. Formulation of Subarea Alternatives. Santa Ana has a large
    number of fixed elements such as streets and land uses. Therefore,
    subarea plans were developed to provide alternative land use patterns
    in different parts of the City. Each subarea plan was related to an
    urban design framework previously approved by the CAC, Planning
    Commission and City staff.
4. Formulation of Areawide General Plan Alternatives. Areawide
    General Plan alternatives focused on different combinations of
    subarea plans.

5. Plan Selection Plan. Selection was done through a series of meetings
    with the CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
6. Plan Refinement. Plan refinement was accomplished by staff review
    of a Preliminary Draft, and CAC, Planning Commission and Public-at-
    Large comments on a Public Hearing Draft.

POLICY PLAN
INTRODUCTION
The Policy Plan section of the General Plan sets forth the detailed policies
of the City relative to the framework Plan described in Section 1.
Each element of the Policy Plan contains goals, objectives,
implementation policies and implementation programs.
Each element also contains a Planning Factors section which reflects the
major issues identified through the citizen participation process.

                                                          PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
The Plan Components section of each element describes the planning
and design concepts illustrated in the maps and provides an overview of
implementation considerations.
The Public Safety element aims to reduce to acceptable levels those risks
associated with activities over which the City has some jurisdiction
through the elimination of avoidable risks.
This goal can be made operational through assessment of acceptable
levels of risk for fire, flood, civil disorder, incidence of crime, and other
natural and man-induced potential safety hazards in the City,
identification of ways risk can be reduced or avoided, and establishment
of policies which will result in achievement of acceptable levels of risk.
Airport safety related guidance and policies may be found in the City’s
General Plan Airport Land Use Environs Element.
PLANNING FACTORS
The ability of the City to meet public safety goals is influenced by its
present risk management capacities, both in terms of needed physical
plant and personnel.
Crime Management and Protection
The City’s central police station is located in Civic Center. Built in 1997,
the four-level facility meets the administrative space requirements for 566
+ employees. The existing police administration facility promotes internal
efficiency and takes advantage of the proximity of Courts, County Jail and
other government facilities. In addition, the police department maintains
two Public Safety Satellite Offices or communications points in the
community rather than traditional precinct stations.
The increased use of non-sworn personnel in positions in which the
training and skills of sworn personnel are not critical can measurably
increase efficiency of the Department’s resources.
Continuing the current emphasis on increased citizen involvement,
through “Community Oriented Policing” programs and other outreach
activities, presents a significant opportunity to increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of crime prevention programs.
Fire Safety
Fires in residential, commercial and industrial structures is responsible
for substantial damage each year. The risk of property damage and
personal injury from fire can be reduced through a combination of fire
prevention measures and fire suppression.
CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN                                                9

PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
Fire prevention is obtained through building code restrictions on the use
of flammable materials, fire resistance of building construction
techniques and materials, installation of fire alarm and suppression
systems, and community education. These measures impose costs on
property owners and tenants through inspection fees.
Property maintenance standards including removal of excessive
vegetation and standards for storage and use of flammable materials also
are appropriate fire prevention measures requiring modest inspection
costs. Community education plays a primary role in providing fire and life
safety messages to the public.
Fire suppression is a major public safety cost for most cities. Fire
suppression costs can be significantly reduced by appropriate prevention
measures which reduce the incidence of fires and the severity and extent
of fires that do occur. Cooperative measures with other cities can reduce
the amount of equipment and manpower each jurisdiction must maintain
to be prepared for “worst-case” fires.
The City contracts fire department services with the Orange County Fire
Authority (OCFA) which fulfills both fire protection and emergency
medical responsibilities. The OCFA operates ten stations throughout
Santa Ana, and has access to an additional 61 stations in its service area.
These stations are well distributed, at an approximate of 1 ½ mile service
radii throughout the City. However, the overlapping responsibility of fire
companies allows adequate response to emergencies. The first Fire unit
response goal (travel time) is less than 5 minutes.
Emergency Medical Services
The provision of emergency medical aid by the OCFA is an important
adjunct to general medical care services in the City. Lower-income,
elderly, non-English speaking and undocumented persons depend on
medical services provided by paramedic personnel for many of their
medical needs. The paramedic service fulfills a need not efficiently met by
conventional medical services delivery systems.
Hazardous Materials
Transportation of hazardous materials through the City is an unavoidable
consequence of its location along several major transportation routes-
interstate 5, interstate 22, Interstate 55, the AT&SF rail line and Southern
Pacific rail line.
Transportation of hazardous materials is safest if national standards for
transportation of such materials are established and carefully monitored.
In addition, such national standards should require coordination with

local public safety officials so officials are prepared for emergency
problems involving release of hazardous materials.
Emergency Preparedness
A number of emergencies may result in a need for a coordinated
governmental response. Disasters can occur in many forms at unexpected
times and places and in most instances neither natural or man-made
disasters can be fully predicted or controlled. Continued readiness,
particularly on the part of the City, is necessary to cope with sudden and
varying exigencies of disasters.
Flood Safety
The City has two major drainage courses with potential for significant
flooding: Santiago Creek and the Santa Ana River. The Santa Ana River,
with its normally dry riverbed and broad engineered channel and
armored levees, does not appear to present a significant flood hazard.
However, the Santa Ana River has a long history of overflowing its banks
and flooding in the surrounding areas. To reduce this risk, the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (Corps) is constructing the $2.2 billion Santa Ana
River Mainstem Project which includes raising the height of Prado Dam
and constructing new gate-works allowing for controlled water releases
up to 30,000 cubic feet per second and constructing channel
improvements between Prado Dam and the ocean. Given the progress to
date, the Corps’ project provides 100-year flood protection for Orange
County. When completed, the project is designed to provide 190-year level
protection from flooding due to the Santa Ana River. Exhibit 4 shows
areas susceptible to flooding.
Throughout the Santa Ana River Basin in Orange County the potential
exists for massive downstream flooding from the failure of the Prado
Dam and overflow of the Santa Ana River. Located in Riverside County at
the head of Santa Ana Canyon, Prado Dam is a single purpose dam
designed to reduce the flood risk for metropolitan area in Orange County.
In order to assure acceptable levels of risk to people and property from
flooding, the City has established flood plain management regulations in
the flood prone areas. The flood plain management regulations require
that new construction or substantial improvements in the flood prone
areas must be elevated above the base flood.
Congress authorized advanced engineering and design studies for flood
control along the Santa Ana River in 1976. The Army Corp of Engineer
completed the lining improvements along the Santa Ana River in the
1990’s. Potential flood damage can be minimized along the Santa Ana

River and Santiago Creek by coordinating preparedness planning between
emergency response and disaster relief agencies.
PLAN COMPONENTS
Major thrusts of the Public Safety programs focus on crime, fire and
disaster prevention; involvement of the public in crime and fire
prevention programs; strict enforcement of safety features of building and
zoning codes; completion of physical improvements related to flood
control; maintenance of emergency preparedness programs, and
community education.
Throughout the recommendations runs a theme of efficient and effective
use of available financial, personnel and material resources. In an era of
limited financial options, the City is concentrating on maximizing the
impact of its existing facilities rather than depending upon expansion
activities.
The City maintains an Emergency Services Plan which provides direction
and guidance for officials and citizens in the event of emergency. The plan
covers emergencies related to earthquakes, floods, major fires and/or
explosions, industrial accidents, bomb threats and explosions, utility
failures, interruptions and reductions, radiological hazards, welfare and
mass care, water quality emergencies, traffic control and hazardous
materials spills.

SUMMARY
The new City of Santa Ana General Plan was developed through an extensive
process of public participation involving citizens, elected and appointed City
officials and City Staff.
The General Plan has been developed to conform to state law and to meet local
planning needs through the year 2000. Periodic updates of the new General Plan
are anticipated.
The General Plan builds upon Santa Ana’s historical assets including the City’s
heritage as the governmental and financial center of Orange County and the
buildings, districts and streetscapes which reflect this heritage.
The General Plan anticipates two major potentials that can shape Santa Ana over
the next several decades. The plan anticipates and maximizes the probability of
the Countywide rapid transit system to be located in Santa Ana and encourages
mixed use development and preservation m corridors and centers relating to this
new access and visibility.
The General Plan has three major sections: the Framework Plan, Policy Plan, and
Environmental Impact Report.
1. The Framework Plan describes Santa Ana’s overall planning strategy and
     program. This strategy reorganizes the City’s land use and urban design
     structure to take maximum advantage of:
         the economic development advantages offered by Santa Ana’s historic
          regional location and functions
         an improved multi-modal transportation system including:
          –   Countywide rapid transit access to Santa Ana
          –   improved local transit
          –   improved auto access to major activity centers
          –   a new Amtrak station
          –   a downtown multi-modal transportation and bus center

        implementation plans that will be developed for subareas of the
        Framework Plan
       efficient processing of development and rehabilitation proposals by
        means of a Development Review Team
       a carefully coordinated development program to foster and assist private
        investment through:
        –    land assembly
        –    coordinated provision of public improvements
        –    Specific Plans
        –    citizen participation coordination
        –    low interest loans and grants

       goals and objectives which underlie the Framework Plan
       greater detail regarding implementation policies and programs
        supporting the Framework Plan.
    Together, the Framework Plan and Policy Plan envision a new image for
    Santa Ana consisting of:
       increased economic activity to provide jobs and maintain a solid financial
        base for city services
       improvement of Santa Ana’s housing stock for a full range of income
        groups and lifestyles
       the finest multi-modal transportation system in Orange County
       a new physical environment consisting of:
        –    preserved and enhanced viable Neighborhoods
        –    District Centers combining new shopping facilities with
             recreational, cultural, education, employment and special housing
             types
        –    improvement of Santa Ana’s major Industrial Districts
        –    Mixed Use Corridors with a range of uses similar to the District
             Centers but with more facilities related to regional transit and auto
             access.

PLANNING CONTEXT
HISTORICAL
Santa Ana’s rich history provides a legacy for community planning and
revitalization in the 1980’s. Santa Ana was founded in 1869 by William Spurgeon.
The original town, laid out by Mr. Spurgeon, consisted of 24 blocks. The town
served as a shopping center and post office for surrounding agricultural areas.
In 1878 the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived and the Santa Fe Railroad followed
in 1886. This encouraged development of the City. In 1889 the County seat was
located in Santa Ana and this further stimulated the development of businesses,
stores, financial institutions and hotels serving the metropolitan population.
Citrus and walnut farms were still plentiful and buying and selling land became
the number one enterprise. The First to 17th Street area was subdivided during
the building boom of the 1880’s. Many of the structures in downtown and the
surrounding bungalow homes were built in the early 1900’s and 1920’s.
The City is retaining and building upon its important governmental, retailing and
employment roles in the County and the rich architectural and streetscapes
heritage associated with the City’s history.
REGIONAL
Santa Ana is geographically central to the developable land within Orange
County. The City has excellent relationships to freeways, rail services via Amtrak
and air transportation at the John Wayne Airport. Because of Santa Ana’s
geographic centrality and functional importance to the County, the Orange
County Transit District is planning major fixed rail transit corridors in the Main
Street and Pacific Electric right-of-ways. These regional transportation
improvements, combined with improvements to freeway access points and local
streets, provide Santa Ana with abundant development opportunities for the
1980’s.

PLANNING PROCESS
The Planning Process used in creating the Santa Ana General Plan is
summarized in Exhibit 3 and related photographs. The process involved:
        a 150-person Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) to which all citizens
         applying were appointed by the City Council
        the Planning Commissioners who served as chairpersons of five CAC
         subcommittees: Land Use and Urban Design, Circulation, Housing,
         Economic Development and Environmental Factors
        the City Council who participated in goal setting and policy making
         workshops
        the public-at-large who participated in a series of Town Forums and
         Public Hearings
        City Staff who worked with The Arroyo Group (TAG) in conducting the
         planning process and who evaluated the program as it evolved.
The six key steps in the planning process were:
1. Data Collection and Analysis. The data base for the previous General Plan
    was outdated and up-to-date census data was not available. Emphasis was
    placed on community definition of problems and opportunities through CAC
    and Staff Steering Committee workshops and mapping. TAG subcontractors
    also gathered key data in areas such as market demand, traffic, seismic, etc.
    This data was summarized and analyzed in a separate Problems and
    Opportunities Report.
2. Formulation of Goals and Objectives. Initial goals and objectives were
    developed through workshops, with the CAC and City staff. Several cycles of
    refinement were done by TAG based on input from the Planning
    Commission, City Council, CAC and staff.
3. Formulation of Subarea Alternatives. Santa Ana has a large number of fixed
    elements such as streets and land uses. Therefore, subarea plans were
    developed to provide alternative land use patterns in different parts of the
    City. Each subarea plan was related to an urban design framework previously
    approved by the CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
4. Formulation of Areawide General Plan Alternatives. Areawide General Plan
    alternatives focused on different combinations of subarea plans.
5. Plan Selection Plan. Selection was done through a series of meetings with the
    CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
6. Plan Refinement. Plan refinement was accomplished by staff review of a
    Preliminary Draft, and CAC, Planning Commission and Public-at-Large
    comments on a Public Hearing Draft.

POLICY PLAN
INTRODUCTION
The Policy Plan section of the General Plan sets forth the detailed policies of the
City relative to the framework Plan described in Section 1.
Each element of the Policy Plan contains goals, objectives, implementation
policies and implementation programs.
Each element also contains a Planning Factors section which reflects the major
issues identified through the citizen participation process.
The Plan Components section of each element describes the planning and design
concepts illustrated in the maps and provides an overview of implementation
considerations.
Scenic corridors are linear features of the City through which people and vehicles
move. They include streets, highways and waterways, with their associated
pedestrian ways and bike trails. This element of the General Plan is designed to
identify Santa Ana’s scenic corridors and thereby to designate them for special
treatment and improvements.

PLANNING FACTORS
No County-designated scenic highways run through Santa Ana. However, a
number of major transportation system and open space systems, such as the
freeways, the Santa Ana River, Santiago Creek and Harbor Boulevard are of
regional significance in that many residents of the County form their image of
Santa Ana from their travels along these corridors.
Enhancement of that image will accrue to the several levels of treatment possible
within scenic corridors, from paving, lighting and signage design, to careful
treatment of land use relationships and natural and man-made features visible
from within the corridors.
PLAN COMPONENTS
The foundation of the Scenic Corridors plan is the series of Mixed Use Corridors
which underlies the entire General Plan. As will be seen on the map, Exhibit 4,
the primary street corridors are First/ Fourth Streets, Main-Broadway, and
MacArthur Boulevard. These primary corridors are significant transportation and
activity features of the City, and are accessible from all freeways. At the edges of
the City, these primary corridors form major City entry points, where strong
statements of Santa Ana identity can and should be made.
Secondary corridors provide “stitching” to link neighborhoods, District Centers
and Mixed Use Corridors together. Their continuity is interrupted by the primary
corridors; these intersection points should be used to give the traveler a sense of
entering major activity centers.
Harbor Boulevard, the traditional north-south link from the ocean to inland
destinations, and Fairview Street, now proposed as a major, limited-access
thoroughfare, are designated as inter-city corridors in recognition of their
functions as major image-makers for the City.
The Newport, Santa Ana and Garden Grove Freeways are high-speed scenic
corridors operating at a regional scale. They influence Santa Ana’s image.
Therefore, the plan calls for two types of high-speed corridor treatment: buffer
edges to screen unsightly or unnecessary views from the freeways; and landscaped
edges designed to promote selected views into the City.
Additional regional corridors are the Santa Ana River and Santiago Creek, which
are part of the County Open Space network and which are specifically addressed
in the Open Space element.
A series of specific visual and aesthetic improvements are recommended for the
Scenic Corridors. Phasing priority should be given to the primary Mixed Use
corridors and/or to corridors in which near-term development is expected to take
place.

officials and City Staff.
The General Plan has been developed to conform to state law and to meet local
planning needs through the year 2000. Periodic updates of the new General Plan
are anticipated.
The General Plan builds upon Santa Ana’s historical assets including the City’s
heritage as the governmental and financial center of Orange County and the
buildings, districts and streetscapes which reflect this heritage.
The General Plan anticipates two major potentials that can shape Santa Ana over
the next several decades. The plan anticipates and maximizes the probability of
the Countywide rapid transit system to be located in Santa Ana and encourages
mixed use development and preservation m corridors and centers relating to this
new access and visibility.
The General Plan has three major sections: the Framework Plan, Policy Plan, and
Environmental Impact Report.
1. The Framework Plan describes Santa Ana’s overall planning strategy and
     program. This strategy reorganizes the City’s land use and urban design
     structure to take maximum advantage of:
         the economic development advantages offered by Santa Ana’s historic
          regional location and functions
         an improved multi-modal transportation system including:
          –   Countywide rapid transit access to Santa Ana
          –   improved local transit
          –   improved auto access to major activity centers
          –   a new Amtrak station
          –   a downtown multi-modal transportation and bus center

PLANNING CONTEXT
HISTORICAL
Santa Ana’s rich history provides a legacy for community planning and
revitalization in the 1980’s. Santa Ana was founded in 1869 by William Spurgeon.
The original town, laid out by Mr. Spurgeon, consisted of 24 blocks. The town
served as a shopping center and post office for surrounding agricultural areas.
In 1878 the Southern Pacific Railroad arrived and the Santa Fe Railroad followed
in 1886. This encouraged development of the City. In 1889 the County seat was
located in Santa Ana and this further stimulated the development of businesses,
stores, financial institutions and hotels serving the metropolitan population.
Citrus and walnut farms were still plentiful and buying and selling land became
the number one enterprise. The First to 17th Street area was subdivided during
the building boom of the 1880’s. Many of the structures in downtown and the
surrounding bungalow homes were built in the early 1900’s and 1920’s.
The City is retaining and building upon its important governmental, retailing and
employment roles in the County and the rich architectural and streetscapes
heritage associated with the City’s history.
REGIONAL
Santa Ana is geographically central to the developable land within Orange
County. The City has excellent relationships to freeways, rail services via Amtrak
and air transportation at the John Wayne Airport. Because of Santa Ana’s
geographic centrality and functional importance to the County, the Orange
County Transit District is planning major fixed rail transit corridors in the Main
Street and Pacific Electric right-of-ways. These regional transportation
improvements, combined with improvements to freeway access points and local
streets, provide Santa Ana with abundant development opportunities for the
1980’s.

                                                          SEISMIC SAFETY ELEMENT
PLANNING PROCESS
The Planning Process used in creating the Santa Ana General Plan is
summarized in Exhibit 3 and related photographs. The process involved:
        a 150-person Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC) to which all citizens
         applying were appointed by the City Council
        the Planning Commissioners who served as chairpersons of five CAC
         subcommittees: Land Use and Urban Design, Circulation, Housing,
         Economic Development and Environmental Factors
        the City Council who participated in goal setting and policy making
         workshops
        the public-at-large who participated in a series of Town Forums and
         Public Hearings
        City Staff who worked with The Arroyo Group (TAG) in conducting the
         planning process and who evaluated the program as it evolved.
The six key steps in the planning process were:
1. Data Collection and Analysis. The data base for the previous General Plan
    was outdated and up-to-date census data was not available. Emphasis was
    placed on community definition of problems and opportunities through CAC
    and Staff Steering Committee workshops and mapping. TAG subcontractors
    also gathered key data in areas such as market demand, traffic, seismic, etc.
    This data was summarized and analyzed in a separate Problems and
    Opportunities Report.
2. Formulation of Goals and Objectives. Initial goals and objectives were
    developed through workshops, with the CAC and City staff. Several cycles of
    refinement were done by TAG based on input from the Planning
    Commission, City Council, CAC and staff.
3. Formulation of Subarea Alternatives. Santa Ana has a large number of fixed
    elements such as streets and land uses. Therefore, subarea plans were
    developed to provide alternative land use patterns in different parts of the
    City. Each subarea plan was related to an urban design framework previously
    approved by the CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
4. Formulation of Areawide General Plan Alternatives. Areawide General Plan
    alternatives focused on different combinations of subarea plans.
5. Plan Selection Plan. Selection was done through a series of meetings with the
    CAC, Planning Commission and City staff.
6. Plan Refinement. Plan refinement was accomplished by staff review of a
    Preliminary Draft, and CAC, Planning Commission and Public-at-Large
    comments on a Public Hearing Draft.

POLICY PLAN
INTRODUCTION
The Policy Plan section of the General Plan sets forth the detailed policies of the
City relative to the framework Plan described in Section 1.
Each element of the Policy Plan contains goals, objectives, implementation
policies and implementation programs.
Each element also contains a Planning Factors section which reflects the major
issues identified through the citizen participation process.
The Plan Components section of each element describes the planning and design
concepts illustrated in the maps and provides an overview of implementation
considerations.
Seismic Safety consists of identification and appraisal of seismic hazards
including susceptibility to surface ruptures, groundshaking and ground failures.
The aim of seismic safety is to reduce deaths, injuries, damage to property, and
economic and social dislocation resulting from earthquakes and other geologic
hazards.

The Seismic Safety element is primarily a vehicle for identifying hazards that
must be considered in planning the location, type, and density of development
throughout Santa Ana.
PLANNING FACTORS
No faults, active, potentially active, or inactive are known to exist in Santa Ana.
However, Santa Ana is in close proximity to two major faults: the Newport-
Inglewood Fault Zone and the Whittier-Elsinore Fault Zone. The San Andreas
and Raymond Faults are also proximate to Santa Ana. Of these faults, the
Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone should be considered the most likely source for
future earthquakes. Seismic parameters associated with each of the active faults
(those most likely to produce the greatest earthquake shaking intensities within
the City) are listed in Table 1.

SEISMIC SAFETY ELEMENT
Historically, Santa Ana has been exposed to other geologic hazards not necessarily
associated with earthquakes. Subsidence and liquefaction are the two of primary
concern in Santa Ana.
Subsidence is a general lowering of the ground surface over a large area. Area
subsidence has occurred within various parts of the City and is generally
attributed to lowering of the ground water levels, settlement of peat and oxidation
of peat.
More localized or focal subsidence or settlement of the ground can occur as a
result of earthquake motion. This type of settlement and consequent differential
settlement results from compaction of loose cohesion less soils.
Exhibit 4 delineates those areas of Santa Ana with the greatest potential for
subsidence. The potential for ground subsidence is largely dependent on the
magnitude, duration and frequency of the earthquake waves. The design
earthquake in Santa Ana is one of along period rolling-type motion rather
intensive high frequency shaking making the occurrence of subsidence less likely.
The potential for area and focal ground subsidence due to earthquakes is
relatively low in Santa Ana.
Soil liquefaction is the phenomenon in which water saturated cohesionless soil
temporarily loses its strength when subjected to dynamic forces. The soils
primarily vulnerable to liquefaction are saturated sands in a loose to medium
dense condition.
The areas of Santa Ana estimated to be susceptible to liquefaction are shown on
Exhibit 5. The potential for liquefaction is believed to be the greatest in those
areas in which the ground water is less than 20 feet in depth, and the soils are
predominately clean, relatively uniform sands of loose to medium relative density.
The probability of liquefaction occurring is relatively small because of the type of
earthquake expected and the distance from active faults. However, the possibility
of soil liquefaction should be considered in the planning, design and construction
of structures located within potential liquefaction areas.

URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
ii                   CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN
Urban Design Element
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The Urban Design Element establishes a long range vision regarding the City’s
urban form. This Element, in coordination with other Elements of the General
Plan, orchestrates a safe, functional, and aesthetically pleasing urban
environment. Together with the other Elements of the General Plan, the Urban
Design Element aims to curtail obsolete, dysfunctional, and chaotic development.
This Element specifically addresses outdoor space and building form, and
establishes programs and measures to improve the physical setting in which
community life takes place.
Although the existing character of Santa Ana offers significant opportunities for
creative development, careful management is needed to protect Santa Ana’s
valuable historic heritage and established form. People’s perception of a unique
image is influenced by architectural styles, landscape treatments, open space, and
a building’s arrangement in relation with its surroundings. Key factors considered
in this Element’s formulation included the following:
   The City of Santa Ana has numerous districts, landmarks, nodes, streets and
    other elements that define its physical makeup and image. The organization
    of this Urban Design Element is arranged around these elements.
   A key objective of this Element is to create an attractive and functional “built
    environment” for the benefit of the entire community. This is accomplished
    through policies and guidelines that promote a high level of comfort,
    livability, and design throughout the City.
   The Urban Design Element, together with the Land Use Element, provides a
    foundation for Citywide development standards and design guidelines.
    Policies contained in this Element are intended to assist in the review and
    evaluation of new development to ensure that this development is compatible
    with the City’s character and overall urban form.

URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
FORMAT OF THE URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
The Urban Design Element contains four sections consistent in style and format
with the other General Plan Elements. The body of the Element contains a
summary of the opportunities and constraints affecting urban design in the City,
as well as the policy framework which guides the decision-making process.
   The Appendix provides information regarding the issues addressed within the
    policy framework. Each section of the Element is summarized as follows:
   The Purpose and Scope provides an overview of the element.
   The Community Factors summarizes the factors and community
    characteristics considered in the preparation of the Urban Design Element.
   The Policy Plan contains relevant goals and policies and the Urban Design
    Plan
   The Implementation Plan contains a listing of the actions, programs, and
    other measures which will be used to implement the Urban Design Element.
   The Appendix contains background information relevant to the issues
    considered in this Element. This section also includes the analyses and
    technical information considered in the formulation of urban design policy.

development patterns and places. In this way, new development may fit in within
their surroundings regardless of the age differences among surrounding buildings.
(Exhibit 1).
Districts with a consistent development pattern and streetscape design, also
provide the opportunity for creative contrast The selective use of contrast allows
for the development and preservation of important City features such as
entryways, landmarks and nodes. Contrast may be achieved through the use of
color, texture, form, scale, style, materials and structure. Since function and form
are strongly related, uniqueness in the function and the form of buildings, is often
necessary to create contrast. An example is the Old Orange County Courthouse
which is surrounded by the Downtown and Civic Center.
URBAN DESIGN PRINCIPLES: CONTEXT AND IMAGE
Imageability refers to a development’s ability to create and produce mental
pictures that become images in people’s mind. Good form, quality development,
and enhanced design creates memorable images. In general, people refer to
certain places, natural features, open spaces, or landmarks as reference points.
These reference points become mental images such as the Main Place, Civic
Center, South Coast Village; natural features such as Santiago Creek and the
Santa Ana River; open spaces such as Centennial Park, Willowick Golf Course,
and the Zoo; or landmarks such as the Old County Courthouse and the Spurgeon
Building.
New development must successfully provide a clear image that is attractive
memorable, vivid. Attractive architectural and site design characteristics provide
the elements a person needs to develop a positive mental image of the City.
Buildings, streets, sidewalks, and trees are examples of elements of the City’s
physical form that contribute to its image.

                                    COMMUNITY FACTORS
                                    The development of Santa Ana resembles a classic urban development pattern
                                    characterized by a series of concentric rings that radiate outward from the original
                                    settlement. The City center includes the downtown, residential neighborhoods,
                                    and older industrial areas located near the rail lines. Subsequent urbanization
                                    surrounds the core in a series of concentric rings with the most recent residential
                                    developments located in the southwest and northeast corners of the City. Santa
                                    Ana’s urban form, under this arrangement, has defined downtown center with
                                    other urban form components arranged around it. This urban form has become
                                    increasingly blurred with new infill projects such as the Main Place, and Hutton
                                    Center located on the City’s periphery. Striving for an urban village in the
                                    Downtown will help to re-establish the more traditional urban form.
                                    DESIGN ELEMENTS
                                    For planning purposes, the approach used in the identification of key urban

                                    intersections, landmarks, and gateways. The concept is illustrated in Exhibit 2. The
                                    existing City form contains these elements as shown in Exhibit 3.
                                    DISTRICTS
                                    Districts refer to those areas of the City that have consistent design features with a
                                    strong context and interrelationship of activities. For example, French Park, the
                                    Downtown, and the industrial areas, located in the southeast portion of the City,
                                    are generally referred to as districts. Tustin Avenue, between Fourth and
                                    Seventeenth Streets, contains professional offices and landscaped edges along
                                    with other qualities which create a sense of place.
                                    This similarity of physical characteristics can be expressed by any attribute which
                                    is repeatedly found throughout a district. These attributes may include
                                    architectural styles, scale, mass, pattern, and overall character. A strong district
                                    definition is often associated with a uniformity in land use or development
                                    patterns. The presence of these and other similar attributes reinforce a district’s
                                    urban fabric, cohesiveness, and identity. Key issues related to districts include the
                                    following:
                                    Santa Ana contains a variety of districts, the uniqueness of which is enhanced by a
                                    variety of physical characteristics such as architectural style, landscaping,
                                    similarity of land uses, and the arrangement of these characteristics in terms of
                                    harmony, homogeneity, and order.

                                                               URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
    Districts tend to be smaller and better defined near the City core. These
     characteristics tend to be less evident, the further away the district is from the
     City center. The older residential districts, located near the downtown center,
     serve as the fundamental basis for Santa Ana’s existing urban form. The
     exception to this however is Santa Ana’s newer commercial and mixed use
     districts: Main Place, South Coast Metro, Metro East, and MacArthur Place.
    Neighborhood associations have been formed throughout Santa Ana, and
     their creation is based on characteristics such as geographic location and ease
     of association. Most organized neighborhoods have development patterns
     similar to those found in adjacent neighborhoods. For example, Bristol
     Manor has similar street lights, lot sizes, subdivision patterns and building
     scale as the adjacent Wilshire Square.
    Although neighborhoods generally tend to be cohesive in architecture form,
     they may also be socially and politically organized. These neighborhood
     associations create perceived districts even though they are not necessarily
     defined by physical boundaries that would set the neighborhood apart from
     nearby neighborhoods. Floral Park and West Floral Park are separate
     neighborhood associations. Even though they are technically separate, they
     are more visually located in the same urban design district. Park Santiago or
     Riverview West are examples of where design districts and neighborhoods are
     the same.
PATHS
Paths are the means by which people travel throughout the City including
                                                                                        A pedestrian-oriented community

features, and open spaces. Key urban design issues related to “paths” include the
following:
    Paths include freeways and main thoroughfares and serve as the framework
     for the City’s urban form. Two of these streets, Main Street and First Street,
     also serve as the “axis” for the City’s street numbering system. These
     roadways are the primary east-west, and north-south transportation routes,
     intersecting at the heart of downtown Santa Ana.
    Some of the “paths” have both a local and regional function. Many major
     paths convey a good impression of progression as one travels through the City,
     providing a sense of movement across residential, industrial and commercial
     areas. Some examples include Main Street, Bristol Street and Seventeenth
     Street which become narrower and more intense at the City core. Some paths
     lack important attributes, such as a distinct hierarchy of uses, scale, and
     density of buildings.

URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
   The absence of a contextual relationship between a path and the adjacent
    land uses leads to a lack of cohesiveness and identity between business
    districts and nearby neighborhoods. A number of important paths in the City
    do not reflect their importance as major path. Seventeenth Street is an
    example of how its character does not relate to the abutting district to the
    north.
   Major paths include disruptions in the rhythm and context of development
    pattern. These interruptions reduce the feeling of progression of a corridor
    from less intense areas to the more intense City core. Uses such as used car
    lots on a street like South Main Street, which has a very strong development
    pattern, creates visual confusion. Those same uses on Harbor Boulevard with
    a tradition and development pattern that accommodate open activities do not
    create the same disruptions.
   The incompatibility between a building’s original function and its current use
    directly reduces the character and continuity of a path. Without appropriate
    remodeling, adaptive reuse of single purpose structures create a disjointed feel
    from the character of the path and the adjacent neighborhood to the new
    activity. On South Main Street, for example, service stations converted to fast
    food use create a break in the context and character of the corridor.
   Distinct major paths in Santa Ana include First Street, Seventeenth Street,
    Main Street, Bristol Street, and Harbor Boulevard. Each of these corridors
    contain unique design features that should be reinforced, such as the
    landscape setback and median of First Street, the small scale of structures
    along the South Main Street frontage, and the new R.O.W. improvements on
    the Harbor Boulevard. There are a number of paths in the City that are not as
    significant and visible as the major paths mentioned previously, but are very
    important in defining the City’s form. Some notable examples include
    McFadden Avenue, MacArthur Boulevard and Fairview Street. Fairview
    Street, for example is an important north-south arterial roadway in the
    western portion of the City with a weak relationship to its adjacent land uses
    in most parts.
   A very positive feature of many paths in Santa Ana is their ability to
    communicate, to travelers and pedestrians, the identity of the districts they
    traverse. These paths convey a better sense of place and facilitate the creation
    of a strong City form. This is due, in large measure, to the unique cultural
    diversity and historic heritage of the Santa Ana neighborhoods which are
    portrayed by the physical attributes and character of these paths. For example,
    Main Street, First Street, and Santa Ana Boulevard convey procession to the
    Downtown.
   Vehicle circulation is given precedence over pedestrian movement in strip
    oriented commercial development. The only significant pedestrian path is
    Fourth Street as it passes through downtown. This pedestrian path has a very
    strong presence in the City and the community, providing a variety of

     amenities, such as retail shopping, office, services, and entertainment uses
     which complement each other and attract people. Other streets have the
     potential to accommodate both vehicle and pedestrian movement, especially
     Main Street and other downtown streets.
NODES
Nodes are areas of compatible and intensive activities. Nodes typically have
identifiable boundaries which, through unique design characteristics, provide a
clear sense of place. A well- defined node, containing sharply defined boundaries,
is very effective in promoting unity of design, purpose, and aesthetics. Key design
issues related to nodes in the City include the following:
    Some nodes in the City are intended to serve as district centers as indicated in
     the Land Use Element; One Broadway Plaza District Center is an example.
     The District Center concept was developed to promote the concentration of
     assorted activities in specific areas of the City. Each of the district centers has
     excellent automobile, bus, and pedestrian access since they are intended to be
     destination points.
    Some examples of nodes include the Civic Center which accommodates
     numerous government agencies; Santa Ana College, which provides a mix of
     institutional uses; and a number of evolving recreational nodes such as the
     Santa Ana Zoo and Bowers Museum.
    Some locations are considered as nodes because they are anticipated to be
     centers of activity in the future. In reality, many of these areas currently have a
     weak presence and lack the activity, intensity and visibility characteristics of a
     node. These areas may be designated as nodes or landmarks, but they
     presently do not function as a node. Examples of this are the Regional
     Transportation Center and Metro East.
FOCUS INTERSECTIONS
Focus intersections are where two major paths intersect. There are numerous
areas in the City where the level of traffic and other activities intensifies because
they are located where two major roadways intersect. In a number of such
instances, surrounding lands uses may appropriately be developed at lower
densities, even with large volumes of traffic using the adjacent roadways. Some
areas however, require special attention in that they need to standout from their
surroundings because of high, traffic and pedestrian concentrations. Key urban
design issues related to the focus intersections include the following:
    The focus intersection is designed to foster and enhance the nature and
     character of certain crossroads in the City such as on South Main Street.
     Enhancing certain intersections will improve the aesthetic presence of those
     crossroads by creating a stronger presence and recognition on otherwise
     routine paths.

                                    URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
                                       The architecture and development intensity at key intersections serve to
                                        create a “rhythm” along a path, thereby enhancing the City’s image.
                                       A focus intersection is intended to eliminate the visual rigidity of. channel-
                                        like streets and the monotony of the gridiron pattern. The focus intersection,
                                        if properly designed, reduces the tunnel effect of the approach while reducing
                                        excessive openness perceived within typical intersections.
 People want the diversity choice,
                                       The focus intersection concept will take advantage of the potential observed
and independence of the city; and       in some intersections of the City. The intent is to highlight and capitalize on
the hominess and intimacy of the        those factors which will “strengthen” the corridors. Even though the

                                        prominence as they mature. Main Street at the corners of Warner Avenue,
                                        Edinger Avenue, McFadden Avenue and First Street are examples of
                                        opportunities for implementing this concept.
                                    LANDMARKS
                                    Landmarks are elements of the urban form containing design features that
                                    reinforce their uniqueness and memorability. Landmarks by their nature, attract
                                    and hold people’s attention. Landmarks communicate to observers that they are a
                                    special place. Surrounding land use and building design provide a background
                                    context for the landmark, reinforcing its role as an important visual element. Key
                                    design issues related to landmarks include the following:
                                       Most of the existing landmarks in the City are concentrated along the Santa
                                        Ana Freeway and in the downtown with relatively few in other locations. A
                                        number of prominent landmarks evoke very pleasant and memorable
                                        experiences in observers. Some of these landmarks have been in the City for
                                        many years, exhibiting a strong context that enhances their visibility. Good
                                        examples of this include the old Orange County Courthouse, located on
                                        Santa Ana Boulevard in the downtown area, and the water tower along the
                                        Santa Ana Freeway.
                                       Other landmarks in the City are newer, though they still have established a
                                        reputation as recognizable landmarks. A good example is the One Broadway
                                        Plaza, Xerox Center tower, Hotel Terrace, or the Vietnamese Catholic
                                        Community Center and Chapel located at Seventeenth Street and Harbor
                                        Boulevard. In addition, most neighborhoods have reference points which
                                        serve as local landmarks in the community. These local landmarks generally
                                        include schools, parks, church buildings, or even a well-established comer
                                        store.
                                       Some “landmarks” stand out in their surroundings and act as good reference
                                        points in people’s minds; however, they may fall short of conveying an image
                                        of community pride, historic significance, and architectural quality. An
                                        example of a “perceived” landmark is the radio antenna located next to the
                                    14                                                  CITY OF SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN

                                                                URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
     Santa Ana freeway. This “landmark” lacks architectural significance and
     attractive design features. Nevertheless, it is generally considered a local point
     of reference.
GATEWAYS
Gateways are located at the City’s entry points and help to define boundaries and
enhance the City’s identity, while reinforcing a sense of place. In some instances,
this is accomplished using an attractive monument or a landscaped median.
Gateways may also include developments with significant and attractive
architectural features, projecting positive images. For example, the Main Place
Mall and MacArthur Place, clearly project a positive image and are excellent
examples of important gateways. Issues related to “Gateways” include the
following:
    Gateways located in the northern and eastern portions of the City are100
     more clearly defined. The gateways in these areas have characteristics that
     create a sense of arrival by means of changes in the character and appearance
     of the area. An example is the sudden change in building height provided by
     the Bental tower as one approaches from the east on Seventeenth Street.
     Formal streetscape and landscaped yards (as people exit southbound I-5 at
     Broadway), or a significant land use (Main Place) announce a person’s arrival
     in the City.
    In entering the City, a sense of arrival does not occur at the City boundary
     with Garden Grove, Costa Mesa, and Irvine. Many businesses in the South
     Harbor industrial area identify themselves as being located in Costa Mesa due
     to the lack of differentiation with the community to the South. This also
     occurs east of the SR-55 with Irvine. In the northwest corner of the City,
     many residents relate easier with Garden Grove than with a Santa Ana
     identity.
    There are a number of gateways identified by posted signs or landscaped
     median monument signs at major intersections. Even with these posted entry
     points, some areas do not meet the definition of a gateway since they do not
     convey a sense of arrival in the City.
    There are several points where the sense of arrival is clear. For example, the
     northern part of the City has a distinctive gateway feature in the Garden
     Grove Freeway which serves as a perceptual boundary, and in the Costa Mesa
     Freeway along the east. Land uses such as Xerox tower or Main Place create a
     sense of arrival as does a change in subdivision pattern, setbacks, street trees
     and other physical characteristics.

URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
   The lack of gateways in some areas of the City, coincide with areas where
    districts expanded outside the City and merged with the surrounding
    communities. In many instances, these districts are perceived to be part of the
    neighboring cities. For example, the corner of Bristol Street and Sunflower
    Avenue is perceived to be located in Costa Mesa; Dyer Road and Red Hill in
    Irvine, First Street and Euclid Street in Fountain Valley; and Harbor
    Boulevard and Seventeenth Street in Garden Grove.

and northeast corners of the City.
The exception to this concentric pattern is foundin the west side. Development in
this area is characterized by an eclectic pattern of growth with a strong orientation
toward Harbor Boulevard. Santa Ana’s urban form, under this arrangement, has a
strongly defined downtown center with other major urban components arranged
around it. There is a subtle “balance” given to the City center by nodes and
gateway-type spaces. For example, Main Place Mall and MacArthur Place, located
at opposite ends of the City, are connected by a “spine” or “axis” created by Main
Street. This arrangement provides an excellent opportunity to enhance the City’s
future development pattern and has been targeted as an important goal in
strengthening Santa Ana’s urban form.

URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
REGIONAL CONTEXT
Santa Ana, founded in 1886 by William Spurgeon, was first subdivided in the
typical grid pattern which was a common development pattern at that time. In
1878, a railroad line was constructed between Los Angeles and San Diego, just
east/northeast of Santa Ana. The railroad right-of-way was placed at a 45 degree
angle to the existing street system. Since the railroad was the major influence on a
development pattern at that time, it was decided to change the Santa Ana’s street
pattern to be parallel with the rail line and this angled street grid is very evident
today.
In 1887, Mr. Spurgeon petitioned the State to allow the City and surrounding area
to secede from Los Angeles County and form a new County. Santa Ana was
ultimately named the County seat of the new “County of Orange. By 1997 Santa
Ana, was the largest city in Orange County with an estimated population of
310,000. Santa Ana is presently the ninth largest city in the State and is a
government center, containing the majority of the county, state and federal offices
located in the County of Orange. Santa Ana is also a major urban center of
Orange County, and is one of the densest cities in the state, with over 11,000
people per square mile.
As the City expanded and urbanization adjoined surrounding cities, development
in those areas assumed similar characteristics of the era that the development
occurred on both sides of the City line. For example, the southeast portion of the
City, which adjoins Irvine, is industrial in nature and is similar to the
development of Irvine. The west side, is primarily residential in character with
commercial uses found along the major corridors. This development pattern is
similar to that found in Fountain Valley, Garden Grove, and Westminster.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER ELEMENTS AND PLANS
The General Plan contains the policies that establish direction for the City’s
physical development over the next 20 years. Each element contains plans
programs, and regulations which will implement the City’s long range goals for
planning.
THE SANTA ANA GENERAL PLAN
The Urban Design Element contains policies related to design, appearance. and
                                                                                    Change shocks and dramatic
aesthetics. The Element’s chief objective is to supplement policies contained in    change shocks dramatically.

specific plans prepared by the City to guide development along Harbor
Boulevard, Bristol Street and the Midtown area. Other key elements germane to
the Urban Design Element include the following:
   The Land Use Element is the most often referred to Element of the General
    Plan, as it provides day-to-day direction for development projects and
    programs. The main tool of the Land Use Element is the Land Use Map
    which is a graphic description indicating the location, extent, and
    development intensity for permitted land uses in the City. The Urban Design
    Element, coupled with the Land Use Element reinforces and supplements
    policy for new development, focusing on design and appearance.
   The Circulation Element provides for the development of a transportation
    system designed to efficiently move people and goods throughout the City.
    The enhancement of the appearance of the circulation system encourages a
    pleasant traveling experience. The Urban Design Element also provides
    direction for maintaining a relationship between design and traffic circulation
    needs of the City.
   The Open Space and Recreation Element promotes the creation and
    maintenance of open space and recreational opportunities within Santa Ana.
    The physical appearance and design of open space must relate with the
    activities within open space areas and their surroundings.. The design
    principles which provide the policy framework enable the Urban Design
    Element to require attractive and usable open space as part of new
    development. This Urban Design Element incorporates those policies
    relevant to urban form and design from the previously adopted 1982 Scenic
    Corridors Element. The balance of the Scenic Corridors Element has been
    incorporated into the Open Space and Recreation Element.
   The Housing Element provides the policy direction for future housing
    within Santa Ana. The Urban Design Element, together with the Housing
    Element, will strive to create livable and aesthetically appropriate projects.

SPECIFIC PLANS AND OVERLAY ZONES
Certain areas of the City are unique and these areas lend themselves to the
development of a specific plan. Currently, specific plans have been prepared for
three areas of the City and include the Bristol Specific Plan, the North Harbor
Specific Plan, and the Midtown Specific Plan. These Specific Plans advance
General Plan policies to a higher level of detail not typically found in a general
plan element. These Specific Plans, as well as the Metro East Mixed Use Overlay
Zone, help to implement the Urban Design Element’s objectives by applying
urban design principles in future development these documents govern.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
Community commitment in upgrading the City’s image, and the creation of an
attractive and safe environment, is a fundamental objective of this Element.
Community concern for aesthetic considerations in development and public
improvements is a major motivation behind the preparation of this Urban Design
Element. With this in mind, a “Community Perception Survey” was developed to
obtain early community input concerning the Element’s policy direction. The
survey consisted of a slide show containing 80 images which were shown to the
respondents. The respondents then rated the images according to appearance,
attractiveness, etc. Attributes of the statistically significant slides, both positive and
negative, were identified. The results have been used to measure satisfaction with
the City’s built environment and understand people’s needs for pleasant and
functional space. The slide survey consisted of 80 slides of various images,
including commercial, industrial and residential developments as well as
streetscapes. Survey participants were asked to rate their impression of each slide.
A total of 232 respondents, representing a cross-section of the community,
completed survey. The key objectives of the survey included the following:
    To collect information concerning people’s preferences for urban spaces and
     various characteristics, including landscaping, colors, open spaces, bulk,
     textures.
    To collect information concerning preferences for places that can be
     remembered in many ways, for example, pleasant/indifferent/unpleasant.
    To collect information of what is perceived to be safe, attractive, and
     memorable; and
    To collect information of what types of spaces people identify as having an
     important image or identity.
The survey demonstrated that development which is sensitive to certain urban
design concepts, is generally perceived positively. Those slides illustrating
examples of quality architecture, pedestrian spaces, and well designed
landscaping, positively influenced the people’s impressions of an area. Key
findings of the survey included the following:
    Architectural detail scored high in the survey. Participants related to those
     buildings exhibiting a certain amount of flare, rather than plain vertical walls.
     Architectural style is not as important where building design offered
     something of interest such as enhanced building materials, texture,
     fenestration, etc.
    Pedestrian spaces, particularly well integrated plaza areas and seating areas,
     were identified by the participants as being a very positive attribute. Similar
     strong positive reactions were given to those developments exhibiting a

URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
     pedestrian scale, open spaces with a separation between people and cars, and
     facades or areas covered by canopies.
    Landscaped areas were also seen as a positive element, especially when other
     natural elements such as water, rocks, and plants were incorporated into the
     overall setting. Mature trees located in landscaped setbacks and yard areas
     and the use of berms, also received favorable responses.
    High negative scores were given for those buildings which were out of scale
     with their setting or those developments which lacked a pedestrian scale.
     Negative responses were given for those views containing examples of over-
     head utility lines, visual clutter from signs and billboards, poor street and
     sidewalk maintenance, and barriers in pedestrian areas such as fences along
     sidewalks, utility poles and equipment in sidewalks, resulting disjointed
     pedestrian movement. In addition, sites lacking landscaping scored very
     poorly.
DISTRICTS
The unique features of the various districts located in Santa Ana are created by
physical attributes, such as architectural styles, landscaping, similarity of land
uses, and the arrangement of these attributes in terms of harmony versus contrast,
homogeneity versus variety and order versus clutter.
Districts tend to be smaller and better defined near the City core. This district
definition diminish the further away the district is located from the City center.
The oldest residential districts located near the “downtown” serve as the major
component for Santa Ana’s existing urban form. These neighborhoods offer a
variety of architectural styles that range from classical to eclectic.
Neighborhood associations have been formed throughout Santa Ana with the
assistance of the City and these associations have led to the creation of other types
of districts. The formation of these neighborhoods is based on characteristics such
as geographic location and ease of association. Many of the organized
neighborhoods have development patterns similar to those found in adjacent
neighborhoods such as Bristol Manor with Wilshire Square. Although
neighborhoods tend to be cohesive in architectural features and development
form, they tend to be socially and politically organized. In other words, districts
are not necessarily formed or dependent on physical characteristics.
Historic Districts
Santa Ana’s historic districts are set apart from other areas of the City by age and
architectural styles. These districts consist of well defined neighborhoods like
Heninger Park, French Park. Most of these historic districts are located near the
City center. Historic districts generally contain a variety of lot sizes, 20 feet street
setbacks, historic single family structures, grid street pattern, gas lamp street
lights, and a variety of subdivision patterns.

buildings constructed during the 1960s and 1970s. Architectural styles in the
district are represented by a mix of older building structures, including Victorian,
French provincial, federal, and Midwest bungalow styles. Further to the south, the
subdivision patterns change to more narrow and deep parcels with Victorian era
and bungalow style homes on lots containing 20 foot front yards, a strong north-
south street orientation, garages located to the rear, landscaped parkways, and
historic street lights.
Residential Districts
Subdivisions located in northern areas of the City contains large parcels with
broad setbacks abutting streets, and one and two story homes along a street
pattern that flows with the form of the Santiago River causeway. This district has
gas lamp street lights and attractive landscaped parkways.
A number of other residential districts in the City exhibit a very “suburban”
development pattern. For example, the northeastern residential neighborhood,
located east of the Santa Ana Freeway and north of Seventeenth Street, contain
wide, shallow parcels, with 20-foot setbacks. The residences within these area are
characterized by large one-and-two story tract ranch style homes with the garages
usually facing the street. The urban definition in the southwest portion of the City
and the area west of the Santa Ana River is poorly defined. Most residential
districts located near the southeast, southwest, and northwest edges of the City,
seem to transition into adjacent communities and lack a sense of place, arrival,
and a strong identity, within Santa Ana. Theses areas were generally developed
under County standards and were not astringent as City standards.
The residential district west of Harbor Boulevard and south of First Street, is
comprised of remnant agricultural parcels which were developed over various
time periods. The development form in the area is characterized by a variety of lot
sizes, suburban style homes, and a street pattern that less compact compared to
that in the east side of the City. In the southwest area, residential development is
characterized by large subdivisions containing small, one story, single family post-
war tract homes, arranged along a grid street pattern.. Further to the south, newer,
large tract homes situated on wider and less deep lot sizes, are found along streets
with few parkways.
Office Districts
The office districts in Santa Ana have a relatively strong identity. The older
development within areas consist mostly of large residential homes which have
been converted to offices. This development trend has maintained the scale of the
remaining residences. These older districts, located along North Main, North
Broadway, and East Fourth Streets, maintain similar building scale as well as

other important urban form characteristics such as landscaped front yards, mature
canopy trees over the sidewalks, ornamental street light poles, parking areas
located to the rear of the properties, and rich architecture. The pedestrian
orientation of these districts is enhanced by a comfortable human scale.
A larger office district is located along North Tustin Avenue and the portion of
east Fourth Street between the Santa Ana and Costa Mesa Freeways. This area is
comprised of garden and mid-rise office complexes that maintain a strong
business-like character, a sense of place, and good contextual relationships. The
streetscape is uniform with wide building setbacks, mature street trees and
landscaped medians. Building scale and orientation consists of two and three-
story structures, located behind the front yard. Taller buildings and parking lots
are typically located at the rear of the property. Newer commercial office projects
have been developed without entrances oriented to the street which is detrimental
to pedestrian orientation. These corridors will enhance their urban presence by
improving pedestrian oriented features and activities at the street level.
Industrial Districts
Santa Ana’s industrial districts occupy approximately 20 percent of the City’s area.
Traditionally, these areas have been oriented towards vehicular access. Pedestrian
activity within these areas have been discouraged due to the nature of the
industrial operations. One of the oldest, and certainly unique industrial district, is
located east of the City’s Downtown and Civic Center. The industrial district was
developed adjacent to the first railroad lines. This area, referred to as the “Logan
Area,” is unique because of the unusual coexistence of residential uses and
industry. The Logan area contains smaller single family homes with front porches
and mixed textures (such as brick and wood siding) are interwoven among
warehouses, lumber yards and railroad tracks. Most of these- residences have a
strong relationship to the streets, which are poorly landscaped but very lively
because of heavy use by the local residents. The industrial activity is relatively
intense in nature with structures clustered on small sites situated along narrow
streets. Architecturally, the industrial buildings are characterized by small, older,
concrete block, and corrugated metal structures. The exterior treatment of these
structures lacks fenestration and other architectural details, resulting in a poor
relationship to the street. The streetscapes have little to no landscaping and
limited building setbacks, creating a somewhat harsh and minimalist
environment.
A large concentration of industrial activity takes form around the railroad line that
extends south and east through southeastern portion of the City. Grand Avenue is
a major arterial running north-south through this area as well. The urban form in
this district is characterized by large city blocks, wide streets mixed with cul-de-
sac and loops, landscaped front yards, and more contemporary architectural
design

Another industrial district is located in the southwest portion of the City. Mostly
adjacent to South Harbor Boulevard, the predominant images here include
landscaped setbacks and greenbelt buffers, typically associated with business park
development. As in the example of the Lake Center Business Park, the
development characteristics create a passive, park-like setting. While the character
of development is distinct and identifiable, it is fairly concentrated in space. On a
broader scope, this district is relatively homogeneous in design, with periodic
visual interruptions. These contrasting images include commercial activity nodes
characterized by more prominent building signage and a reduction in landscaped
open spaces.

neighborhood parks, and school sites. Many of these open space areas also serve
as nodes of intense activity, such as the Zoo. Each of these elements offer visual
relief from the surrounding built-up areas and project a positive image of the
community.
Open space, as a component of districts, nodes, landmarks, and paths is expressed
and experienced throughout the City by the urban forest nature of street trees,
vegetation at medians and parkways, and the landscape and shrubbery in front
and side yards surrounding properties. These elements of nature present in the
built environment, always play a significant role in establishing a relationship
between buildings and streets, providing an inviting atmosphere to pedestrians. In
older areas of the City, mature canopy trees frame special places of the past and
present. A number of newer developments in the City, include plazas, fountains
and landscaping. These private open space amenities, such as the lake in Hutton
Centre, create visual relief within the surrounding high rise office complex.
PATHS
Paths are described as major, minor, and pedestrian, depending on their function.
Major paths in the City include the freeways and main thoroughfares that carry
most of the traffic in the City. These major paths also serve as the supporting grid
structure of the City’s pattern. Two of these streets, Main Street and First Street,
provide the axis for the City’s reference orientation and street numbering system.
They are the primary east-west, and north-south transportation routes, and they
intersect at the edge of downtown Santa Ana. Other major paths in Santa Ana
include First Street, Seventeenth Street, Main Street, Bristol Street, and Harbor
Boulevard.

URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
Main Street
Main Street is predominately linear and development along this roadway is
characterized by historic structures located between First Street and Civic Center
Drive. These structures have retained the flavor of old Santa Ana while providing
a historic and functional link between the past and present. The placement of the
buildings on the property lines, as well as the similarities of architectural details
among the buildings, reflect the character of their period. The scale and massing
of the buildings, in relationship to the street, expresses a positive and uniform
visual impression.
Many of these buildings have interesting architectural details dating from their
periods of construction, including art deco canopies, fascias, cornices and
storefronts.
The buildings along South Main Street from First Street to Warner Avenue, are
mostly one and two story structures built to the property line. This development
pattern is interrupted by a few recent developments which have their buildings
located at the rear of the site with the parking lot directly adjacent to the street.
Building design and site development characteristics begin to change north of
First Street. The urban flair is very strong, peaking in the area considered to be
the financial district of Midtown, between Tenth Street and Washington Avenue.
North of Washington Avenue, the building-setbacks, located on both sides of the
street, varies because of surface parking lots and a few landscape strips. The
southern part has the charm of a small town main street and, as it continues to the
north, development is characterized by a highly urban downtown financial
appearance. As it progresses further to the north, it eases back to a small scale
specialty commercial area until the next major crossroads where the urban form
picks up again to continue north to the Museum District eventually reaching the
Main Place Mall and City Place.
First Street
The First Street corridor’s distinctiveness is influenced by the roadway’s
landscaped median that gives it a special appearance. First Street is associated
with the proliferation of strip commercial development lacking strong retail
anchors. Some segments of this corridor do not share common features such as
the landscaped median, front yard landscaping, or architectural style. Buildings
next to most of First Street’s major intersections exhibits various setbacks which,
along with the different architectural characteristics, present a confusing visual
impression. Disjointed development has led to a poorly defined streetscape as
illustrated by the corner of First Street and the Santa Ana Freeway. The
development of a high rise office tower tends to clash with the area’s generally low
rise character. The First Street corridor, which is a major to form the City, needs
visual statements to create a sense of arrival and a sense of place.

Seventeenth Street
The Seventeenth Street corridor has been incrementally developed over the years
and includes strip development and outdoor malls scattered along the length of
the roadway In fact, these uses are so prevalent that they create segments of
inconsistency. The entire length of this heavily traveled corridor has a tremendous
potential to convey strong community images. The mixture of new and old,
adjacent to one another, may provide an opportunity to define the public
streetscape for the enjoyment of pedestrians and people traveling vehicles along
the roadway.
The segment of Seventeenth Street, between Grand Avenue and the Costa Mesa
                                                                                        The challenge is to provide the

street trees along the roadway. This corridor offers opportunities for several
gateway elements intended to distinctly define and project the community’s
image at the regional level.
Harbor Boulevard
Harbor Boulevard, like Main Street, is a linear path composed of both
commercial and industrial segments along its length. The commercial
development is located between Seventeenth Street and Edinger Avenue and is
characterized by an eclectic mix development, building styles and public
improvements. There are no public spaces located along the corridor to create a
positive visual impression. The industrial component, on the other hand, projects
a better visual experience. The consistent building massing and streetscape
features together create a park-like environment with good potential for an
attractive path image.
Bristol Street
Bristol Street is also a linear roadway and its character is similar to Seventeenth
Street except for a narrower right-of-way. Bristol Street lacks sites with well
defined character and buildings with interesting design features. The variety of
building sizes, setbacks, and construction types along this corridor has been a
challenge to creating a definitive character. The poor affinity between the various
activities along this path also hinders opportunities to develop supporting
pedestrian linkages because these activities do not complement each other. The
Bristol Street Widening Project and Specific Plan promote the creation of
continuous linkages between individual developments. The proposed
characteristics of the new Bristol Street are such that it will become part of the
adjacent districts rather than a district in itself. The rationale for this widening is
to provide an efficient and pleasant vehicular movement, with occasional
pedestrian movement within a few targeted sites.

URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
Open Space Paths
Bike trails within the City offer a linear network of open space paths for
pedestrians joggers and bicyclists. They are anticipated to become strong-linkages
between various origin and destination points. The Santa Ana River Trail, which
is part of the Orange County Bike Trail System, dissects this portion the City. A
former Pacific Electric railroad right-of-way, now serves as a bike trail in the
Eastside neighborhood.
Rail Corridors
Rail transportation corridors consists of linear open spaces that cut across the
urban fabric of Santa Ana. The Amtrak Rail commuter line provides an
alternative means of transportation for the City residents and thus, is becoming an
important path through the City. The railroad corridor is also an open space path
that is not visually enhanced. In addition, adjacent properties have not been
developed in a manner so as to establish a relationship with the corridor.
Minor Paths
There are a number of paths in the City that are not as significant or as visible as
the major paths mentioned previously. These paths are identified in the city form
map as minor paths and include roadways such as McFadden Avenue, MacArthur
Boulevard, and Fairview Street.
A very positive feature of these minor paths is their ability to communicate to
travelers and pedestrian the identity of the districts they cross. These paths convey
a better sense of place and thus facilitate city legibility, because the users are better
able to tell their whereabouts. This is because the unique cultural diversity and
historic heritage of the Santa Ana neighborhoods are well portrayed by the
physical attributes and character of these paths.
Pedestrian Paths
The only significant path of a clear pedestrian nature is located in the downtown
area. This pedestrian pathway runs along Fourth Street, a few blocks east and
west of Main Street. The path has a very strong presence in the City and is one of
the most important elements of the downtown. Fourth Street, as a pedestrian
path, exhibits a number of important characteristics. The path provides for a
variety of activities, such as shopping, office, services, and eating establishments
that complement each other and attract all kinds of people. This path defines part
of a citywide community image and serves as the backbone of the Fourth Street
commercial node described later in this Element. This perception is so
pronounced that it is often perceived by the community as the downtown.

NODES
Neighborhood commercial nodes in Santa Ana are extremely vibrant with busy
activities throughout the day; however their physical setting often lacks clearly
defined form and context. These activity nodes, which are primarily strip malls,
have been developed in isolation from their surroundings and they are rarely
sensitive to the community’s character. They often disregard positive qualities of
the neighborhood they serve. The architectural characteristics that would
cohesively provide a sense of unity is often weak, breaking apart from the district
or the neighborhood. The lack of contextual relationships leads to poor
cohesiveness between nodes and districts centers located in the City.
MacArthur Place
The MacArthur Place development is located in the southeast end of the City.
The dynamic of this node continues to transform a predominately office setting to
an urban environment where housing and services are integrated within the office
campus. The southern portion of MacArthur Place, previously referred to as
Hutton Center, surrounds a central lake that provides a scenic amenity with
pedestrian linkages for all users. The collection of 10-story office buildings merits
architectural interest. The perimeter of the area is characterized by landscaped
setbacks and structures increasing in height as you move east from Main Street. A
future mix of activities and good pedestrian and visual links will integrate the
center as it develops. With the addition of the proposed high-rise residential
towers and mid-rise residences framing Main Street and MacArthur Boulevard,
this area will continue to be a prominent activity node within the community.
South Coast Metro
The South Bristol Street commercial area is known as South Coast Metro, and is
located in the vicinity of South Coast Plaza area. Each side of Bristol Street is
lined with long, linear, one-story retail centers with buildings located at varying
distances from the sidewalks. These centers contain a variety of landscaped
setbacks and large expanses of surface parking situated between the building and
the street. Despite the comfortable sidewalk space, there is not much pedestrians
because the relationship between street and buildings is hindered by excessive
distances to the building entrances. The area’s character is suburban and vehicle
oriented, for the most part. This area also lacks a clear sense of arrival at Santa
Ana, despite the monument signs.

URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
Downtown
The Downtown area contains some of the oldest buildings in Orange County.
The historical significance of many downtown buildings and its grid development
pattern, has much to do with this area’s charming character, image, and identity.
Problems do exist however with poor relationships between the old and the new.
The Downtown area is made up of three distinct districts, all of them having
different urban forms. The Historic Downtown has two-to four-story buildings
with no setbacks; the building extended up to the public sidewalk. This
downtown includes historic buildings, historic street-lighting, special sidewalk
paving, high pedestrian orientation, and smaller commercial parcels. In general,
there is a very high level of continuity, good context, and integration with the
overall Downtown area.
The Civic Center area is the center for government services and administration.
Despite being highly public service oriented, it is associated with poor pedestrian
and visual links with its surroundings. The Civic Center functions physically and
visually as an island in the City, its major design components are large concrete
buildings set in the middle of large expanses of concrete and asphalt, flanked by
concrete retaining walls. Special lighting, in contrast with the adjacent Historic
Downtown, surrounds the area and the lack of unifying elements contributes to
its isolation and poor relationship with the rest of the downtown area.
Midtown Area
The Midtown area contains a mixture of large office buildings, some with street
setbacks on Main Street, some with plazas and landscaping, and some small scale
retail buildings with no setbacks. Narrow blocks, with surface parking, visually
connect Main Street with the rear streets. Unfortunately, this visual link is at the
expense of landscape. In addition, there is no unique street furniture, this portion
of the street lights, or other stereoscope elements to enhance the character and
charm of Downtown.
North Main Street
Similar to the node at South Main Street, the North Main Street node lacks
cohesiveness in terms of architecture or pedestrian linkages. The area has a variety
of broad setbacks and tall isolated buildings with poor pedestrian circulation.
Main Place is a major regional mall and is an important activity center in the City.
The Mall and the Fidelity Federal Bank building, with its electronic time and
temperature sign along with a cluster of medium rise office buildings, serve as a
regional reference point and provide a strong presence and visual recognition of
the area. The mall however, is surrounded by a sea of parking, and lacks sufficient
landscaping.

The Fidelity Federal building, is similarly surrounded by a surface parking lot on
all sides but the front, which is close to the sidewalk with no setback. Across the
street, on the east side of Main Street, is the site of the proposed Main Street
Concourse development and the existing Lincoln Town Center Office project.
These developments are anticipated to function as a major activity node in the
future. Because of its location and visibility from three major highways, the entire
district represents great opportunity for the establishments of a cohesive, height
intensity, mixed activity center with a strong presence in the region.
Bowers Museum
The area known as the Museum District spans Main Street, between two other
identifiable district centers. The district designation highlights the area as a node,
though it does not exhibit the activity typical of the most nodes The Museum
District lacks the urban form, level of activity and character of a major activity
center. A collection of one-or two- story, low scale offices and retail stores line
Main Street with no sense of continuity. However, as with all of the nodes
identified in the City, this area is well served by paths for pedestrian, automobiles,
and mass transit. Heavy pedestrian and vehicular traffic is anticipated for the area,
mostly along Main Street as a linkage route between the Midtown and the
Downtown Districts. With the Bower’s Museum expansion, the development of
the Discovery Museum, and the implementation of the Specific Plan for the
Museum District, the area has the potential of becoming an essential node and
center, linking other nodes located along Main Street.
LANDMARKS
Santa Ana has a number of landmarks that evoke in observers, a very pleasant
and memorable experience even though most of the existing landmarks in the
City are concentrated along the Santa Ana Freeway. A number of landmarks have
been in the City for many years and have a strong context that enhances their
visibility. These include; the Old Orange County Courthouse (on Santa Ana
Boulevard in Downtown) and the Water Tower located on Penn Way near the
Santa Ana freeway.
Other landmarks in the City are new places that have established a reputation and
recognition as landmarks in the City. These include: the One Broadway Plaza,
Xerox Center Tower, Main Place Mall, the Regional Transportation Center
(RTC), Hotel Terrace, Hutton Center/MacArthur Place, the Federal Courthouse
(Centrepointe site), and the Discovery Science Center.
The City has no other citywide or regionally recognized landmarks, even though
at the local level, neighborhoods do have reference points that act as local
landmarks in their communities, often these are school sites, church buildings, or
a well established corner store.

URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT
GATEWAYS
Gateways located at the City’s northern and eastern borders are clearly defined.
The spaces in these areas have characteristics that create a sense of arrival by
means of changes in the character and appearance. For example a sudden change
in building height, generously landscaped yards, or other changes in amenities
and/or design, announce a different kind of place.
In arriving to the City from the south, a sense of arrival does not occur until well
into the South Main Street district, when the homogeneity of the urban form
begins to define the district. Gateways located within the west side of the City,
along Harbor Boulevard, exist because of the immediate loss of continuity and the
variety of activities and development specifically, there are a number of gateways
found in the City which are identified by posted signs, landscaped medians, or
monument signs situated at major intersections within the City limits. Some
posted entry points to the City do not meet the definition of a “gateway” because
they did not convey a sense of arrival to the City. On the other hand, there were
several points of entry where the “arrival at a special place” is more clearly
defined. For example, the northern part of the City has distinctive gateways at
Bristol Street, Main Street, and at the Santa Ana Freeway. There are also
recognizable gateways to the east, at Seventeenth Street, the Santa Ana Freeway,
and Edinger Avenue. Incidentally, the lack of gateways in many places coincides
with those areas where districts have gradually expanded outside the City as they
merged with the surrounding communities. In many instances, these districts are
perceived to be part of the neighboring cities. For example, the corners of Bristol
Street and Sunflower Avenue, Dyer Road and Red Hill Avenue, First and Euclid
Streets, and Harbor Boulevard and Seventeenth Street.
