SECTION 3.1: INTRODUCTION TO THE ELEMENT
3.1.1 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY
The State Legislature requires that every county and city in California prepare and
maintain a housing element to identify strategies that will be effective in conserving,
rehabilitating, and promoting the development of housing to meet existing and projected
needs. The Legislature and the California Department of Housing, and Community
Development (HCD) have established specific guidelines concerning the preparation of
housing elements. In compliance with this mandate, the City of Irwindale (City) adopted
its first housing element in 1973. In 1977, the Legislature revised the housing element
guidelines requiring the elements to undergo review and updating every five years. In
the case of this 2014 to 2021 update, if the Housing Element is approved by HCD and
the jurisdiction’s legislative body by October 1, 2013, the update goes to an eight year
cycle1. The intent of the State Legislature, with regard to Section 65581 of the
Government Code, is to accomplish the following objectives as part of the preparation
and implementation of housing elements:
     To ensure that local governments recognize their responsibility in contributing to the
     attainment of the State’s goals for housing;
     To ensure that local governments prepare and implement housing elements, which
     along with corresponding Federal and State programs, will move towards the
     attainment of the State’s housing goals;
     To assist each locality in determining what is required to enable the community to
     meet the existing housing need and future housing demand; and
     To ensure that local governments cooperate with other public agencies in order to
     address the region’s housing needs.
According to Section 65583 of the Government Code, a housing element must consist
of “identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement
of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial resources, and scheduled programs for
the preservation, improvement, and development of housing.” The State requires that
housing elements contain the following:
     An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints
     relevant to the meeting of those needs;
     A statement of the community's goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative to
     the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing; and
1
   Government Code Section 65588(e)(4) requires a jurisdiction to adopt a housing element no later than
120 days from the date the housing element is due. A 120-day extension may be granted by HCD. The
120-day deadline does not mandate the adopted housing element be submitted to HCD, reviewed by
HCD, or found in compliance by HCD.

    A program that establishes an eight-year schedule of actions the community intends
    to implement as a means to achieve the goals and objectives of the housing
    element.
Within the past several decades, the State Legislature has focused increased attention
on housing-related issues in California. This attention is due to the State’s continued
population growth, particularly in the urban areas. This significant growth has placed
increased demands on the existing housing resources and has accelerated the need for
new housing, especially affordable housing. While California in general and Southern
California in particular are among the fastest-growing regions in the country, the cost for
housing is considerably higher compared to other areas of the nation.
This Housing Element has been prepared in compliance with Section 65580 et seq. of
the Government Code and addresses the following major issue areas:
    An identification of the City’s current and projected housing needs;
    An identification of strategies that will enable the City to accommodate the identified
    needs;
    An identification of housing policies and programs with respect to housing; and
    An identification of specific actions the City intends to undertake to enable it to
    accommodate the identified needs.
The primary goal of this Housing Element is to promote the development of new
housing to meet the existing and projected demand while preserving the existing
residential neighborhoods in the City.
3.1.2 FORMAT AND SCOPE
The California Government Code states the following, "the General Plan and the parts
and elements thereof shall comprise an integrated and internally consistent and
compatible statement of policies." This Housing Element contains goals and policies
that both complement and support the other elements of the General Plan. The
provision of new housing is also related to the policies of the Community Development
(land use) Element that indicates the specific location, density, and standards for
residential development. Projected housing needs can only be achieved within the
framework established by both the Community Development (land use) and Housing
Elements. Therefore, the two elements support each other in the common goal of
achieving sound development, balanced growth, and new housing opportunities.
The Government Code (Section 65585) also requires that all housing elements
prepared by local governments be submitted to HCD for review. HCD in turn, must
submit comments to the City regarding the element’s conformance to State law.

The State Legislature understands the importance of local housing elements in
implementing statewide goals that will promote the development of decent and suitable
housing for all persons. The Legislature also recognizes the importance of providing
affordable housing to households with low or moderate incomes. The State’s housing
element requirements are based on the following concerns (Government Code Section
65581):
    Local governments should recognize their responsibilities in contributing to the
    attainment of the State’s housing goals;
    Cities and counties should prepare and implement housing elements that are
    coordinated with State and Federal efforts in achieving the State’s housing goals;
    Each local jurisdiction should participate in determining the necessary efforts
    required to attain the State’s housing goals; and
    Local governments must cooperate with other agencies to address regional housing
    needs.
The State’s housing element requirements, and the sections of this Housing Element
that address those requirements, are summarized in Table 3-1.

3.1.3 CITIZEN AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
In accordance with Article 10.6 of the Government Code, “the manner of assuring
citizen participation in the development and adoption of the housing element” must be
described in the Housing Element. The process the City followed as a means to
promote citizen participation consisted of the following:
     City staff conducted a public workshop to review preliminary housing element
     policies and programs. This workshop was held before the Planning Commission on
     May 15, 2013. Notices of the workshop were mailed to every resident in the City, as
     well as the following organizations that provide housing services to the City: Cory’s
     Kitchen; Pacific Clinics; Housing Rights Center; Beyond Shelter; and Habitat for
     Humanity.
     The Housing Coordinator presented the next phase of the City’s housing production
     program to the Irwindale City Council (Council) at a public meeting.
     Public notices of the abovementioned workshop and public hearings were posted at
     public facilities (the Civic Center, Library, and Post Office). Public hearing notices
     were published in the newspaper.
Throughout the course of the Housing Element’s implementation, the general public has
been kept abreast of the Element’s implementation. Copies of the draft and final
Housing Element were posted on the City’s website along with the other sections of the
City’s General Plan. In addition, copies of the draft Housing Element were provided to
the housing service providers along with pertinent information regarding public review
and comment periods.
The City will make a concerted effort to keep all service providers apprised of the
housing program’s implementation following the Housing Element’s adoption. Copies of
requests for proposals, programs, ordinance revisions, and other pertinent materials will
be sent to the service providers as a means of keeping them abreast of housing-related
issues being considered by the City.
3.1.4 USE OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
Following the adoption of the updated Housing Element, periodic review and updating of
the City’s General Plan may be necessary to ensure internal consistency is maintained.

SECTION 3.2: HOUSING NEEDS REPORT
3.2.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE HOUSING PROFILE REPORT
The Housing Element is structured to reflect the “Housing Element Building Blocks”
model development by the State Department of Housing and Community Development.
Although a State-mandated document, the Housing Element is to be used as a guide for
maintaining and creating housing opportunities for its existing residents and future
generations.
This Section of the City’s Housing Element provides an overview of the demographic,
housing, and socioeconomic characteristics of the City. The information contained in
this Section indicates those trends that have occurred in the City in the years following
incorporation in 1957. This Section of the Housing Element considers the following:
    Existing Housing Needs: an analysis of population and employment trends and
    documentation of projections and quantification of the City’s existing and projected
    housing needs for all income levels, an analysis of household characteristics,
    overpayment, overcrowding, and housing stock conditions.
    Special Housing Needs: an analysis of special housing needs associated with
    specific demographic and occupational groups including the elderly, disabled,

Multiple sources of data were used In order to address all aspects of State Housing
Element Law. The use of multiple data sources can create inconsistencies due to
methodologies of data collection, timeframe of the most current available data, and the
specific purpose of the data. The primary source of data used in the compilation of
demographic, housing, and socio-economic information for the City includes the
American Community Survey (ACS) and 1990, 2000, and 2010 United States Census
Bureau (Census). Where appropriate, the 2007-2011 American Community Survey by
the U.S. Census Bureau, for 2011 demographic data is used to provide updated
information on the City’s demographic and housing characteristics. Due to the small
sample size, the ACS typically contains a large margin of error and the results are least
accurate for detailed variables, therefore, ACS results are presented in this Housing
Element only for variables that generally describe the community.
A number of additional sources were referred to and relied upon in the preparation of
this Housing Element. These sources include:

    State Department of Finance (DOF) Demographic Research Unit was a source of
    population and housing information. The DOF publishes population and housing
    estimates for California cities and counties on an annual basis;
    State of California Economic Development Department (EDD) was a source for labor
    statistics including employment and wage data;
    Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is mandated under State
    law to prepare population, housing, and employment projections that are to be used
    in the development of the region’s Growth Management Plan. These projections are
    used in the determination of the City’s Regional Housing Needs Assessment
    (RHNA).
    Land use and housing condition surveys were conducted by the City of Irwindale
    during the preparation of this Housing Element;
    Dataquick for home sales; and
    Home Mortgage Disclosure Act for lending patterns for home purchase and home
    improvement loans.
3.2.2 POPULATION, EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
  Government Code Section 65583(a) requires an assessment of housing needs
  and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of these
  needs. The following assessment includes an analysis of population and
  employment trends.
3.2.2.1 Population Characteristics
   Government Code Section 65583(a)(1) requires an analysis of population
   trends including a discussion of the following:
           Current population and recent trends;
           Description of amount and rate of population growth;
           Comparison of population and rates of growth to the countywide or
           regional total and to surrounding jurisdictions; and
           Population by age.
Examination of demographic characteristics provides insight regarding the City’s
housing and community development needs. Factors such as population growth, age
characteristics, and race/ethnicity all help to identify and determine the need for
housing.

Population Growth
Incorporated in 1957, Irwindale’s history has been rooted in its rich and abundant
mineral resources. There are no disadvantaged unincorporated islands located in the
City. A relatively small community of approximately 9.5 square miles in size, the City’s
industrial history and development patterns have been primarily shaped by the local
mining industry and the abundance of both active and inactive quarries throughout the
community. Given the abundance of natural resources and limited size of the city,
Irwindale’s population has remained small in comparison to adjacent jurisdictions and
Los Angeles County as a whole. Irwindale has experienced a steady population growth
since 1980, as summarized in Table 3-2, with its most significant growth occurring
between 1990 and 2000. According to the American Community Survey2, the City of
Irwindale population was 1,525 in 2011, compared to 1,446 in 2000 (an increase of 5.5
percent since 2000).

Although Irwindale continues to be a relatively small community in comparison to
adjacent cities, it has experienced greater population growth than adjacent cities as
summarized in Table 3-3. Irwindale comprised less than 1 percent of the Los Angeles
County population in 2011.

   The American Community Survey is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. ACS is an on-going survey
that provides data every year to provide communities the current information to plan investments and
services. Information from the survey generates data that help determine how federal and state funds are
distributed annually.

Population Age Characteristics
Although the City’s population is younger overall, compared to the age of the County’s
population, the City residents continue to become more concentrated in the older age
cohorts. According to the ACS, the median age in the City in 2011 was 29.7 years,
significantly younger than the County average of 35.0 years, but continues to increase.
Figure 3-1 depicts the trend of increase of age of the City’s population based on the
City’s median age. Middle-age adults (ages 45 through 64) are currently the largest
age group in the City and comprised approximately 15.2 percent of the City’s population
in 2011.

 Survey
Although the City’s median age is lower than the County’s, the fastest growing
segments of the City’s population was the middle-age adults (55 through 64 years),
which increased by 116.7 percent between 2000 and 2011 and young adults (ages 20
through 24), which increased by 88.5 percent. The aging population will increase the
demand for a wider range of housing opportunities and community services.

Race and Ethnicity
The ACS also includes an enumeration of race and ethnicity. Race refers to the racial
composition of a population such as Asian or Black. As indicated in Table 3-6, there are
few racial minorities living in the City. According to the ACS, in 2011 approximately
49.1 percent of the City’s population was classified as White, while 1.0 percent was
classified as African-American, 1.4 percent as Asian or Pacific Islander, and 4.0 percent
as American Native or Alaska Native.
Hispanics are considered an ethnic group rather than a racial group. Hispanics may
include persons from a variety of races including Caucasians, African-Americans, and
Asians. Hispanics accounted for 92.5 percent of the City’s total population.

3.2.2.2 Employment and Economic Trends and Characteristics
       Government Code Section 65583(a)(1) requires an analysis of employment
       trends including a discussion of the following:
                     Employment by industry trends;
                     Recent and anticipated changes in employment and impacts on the
                     housing market;
                     Opportunities for promoting and improving jobs-housing balance;
                     Identification of larger employers in the city and typical types of jobs
                     and earnings; and
                     Discussion of wage ranges of major employers and employment sectors
                     and relative housing needs.
According to employment data from the State of California Employment Development
Department, the unemployment rate for the City as of December 2012 was 14.3
percent, compared to 10.2 percent for the County. At that time, there were 100 persons
in the City actively seeking employment, out of a total labor force of 700 persons.3
According to employment estimates and projections developed by SCAG, there were
13,400 jobs in the City in 2008.4 The City’s employment is projected to experience a
decline as indicated in Table 3-7. The SCAG projections indicate that 9,414 jobs will be
added in the City between 2010 and 2025. It is important to note that a majority of
people who work in the City do not live in Irwindale. The City’s employment base draws
employees from adjacent jurisdictions in Los Angeles County as well as Riverside and
San Bernardino Counties.

Although none of the mining companies are top employers (see Tables 3-8 and 3-9),
Irwindale has historically been a mining city. Many of the City’s larger mining properties
available for residential, commercial, and industrial development will be available for
redevelopment in the next 10 to 15 years. The City anticipates that these properties will
attract new businesses and support job growth locally and regionally.
A resident’s employment has an important impact on housing needs as it typically
results in an increase of housing demand. Incomes associated with different jobs and
the number of workers in a household determines the type and size of housing a
household can afford. The City’s resident’s primary employment industries are
concentrated in industrial industries with approximately 19.1 percent of employment
concentrated in the manufacturing industry according to the 2011 ACS.

3.2.2.3 Household Growth
   Government Code Section 65583(a)(2) requires an analysis of household
   characteristics including a discussion of the following:
         Number of households by tenure;
         Changes in proportion of renter and owner households;
         Households trends relating to needed housing types;
         Numerical annual household growth;
         How the housing needs of owners and renters are being met; and
         Number of renters in single-family units versus multi-family units.
Page 18 of 100
The U.S. Census defines a “household” as all persons who occupy a housing unit,
which may include single persons living alone, a family related through marriage or
blood, and/or unrelated individuals living together. As summarized in Table 3-11, the
City experienced the most significant household growth between 1990 and 2000, an
annual growth of 2.6 percent. Since 2000, household growth has become stagnant with
an annual growth of just 0.2 percent.

As discussed in the Population Growth Section, the City has experienced significant
growth since the 1990s due to both an increase in the average household size and new
residential construction. Table 3-12 compares the trends in the average household size
for Los Angeles County with those of the City since 1980. As indicated in Table 3-12,
the average household size for the City is significantly higher compared to Los Angeles
County as a whole. In the City, the average household size between 1980 and 2011
increased by 0.29 persons per unit.

Housing Tenure
The distribution of owner- and renter-occupied units (or tenure) within a community’s
housing stock influences several aspects of the local housing market. Residential
stability is influenced by tenure, as ownership housing is much less likely to turn over
than rental units. Housing cost burden is typically more prevalent amongst renters. The
Page 19 of 100

ability or choice to own or rent a home is related to household income, composition, and
age of the householder.
Table 3-13 summarizes housing tenure statistics for 1980 through 2011 in the City. The
percentage of owner-occupied units in the City continues to increase. Approximately
68.8 percent of the residential units in the City were owner-occupied in 2011 according
to the ACS.

1990 and 2001 (25.9 percent) than between 2000 and 2011 (1.9 percent). The City’s
household composition changed significantly, with a decline in family households with
children by approximately 27.2 percent between 2000 and 2011. The changing
demographics of the City is further illustrated upon review of the City’s age cohorts as
summarized in Figure 3-2 (see Table 3-5), as the number of persons under the age of
18 with the exception of those under the age of 5 continues to decline.

3.2.2.4 Overpayment and Overcrowding
  Government Code Section 65583(a) requires an analysis and documentation of
  household characteristics, including level of payment compared to ability to
  pay, housing characteristics, including overcrowding, and housing stock
  condition.
Overpaying
   Government Code Section 65583(a) requires an analysis and documentation
   of level of payment compared to ability to pay including a discussion of the
   following:
           Total households including the number of lower-income households, by
           tenure, paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing and the
           number of households who pay 50 percent or more of their gross
           income for housing;
           Where possible, identify households most significantly impacted by
           cost burdens (large families, seniors, etc.); and
           Identify potential resources and programs to address the need.
The cost for housing has increased significantly in the past five years throughout the
Southern California region. Historically, the Census and other service agencies have
indicated that those households that pay in excess of 30 percent of their total income for
housing are overpaying. The resulting effect of this overpayment is that these
households may not have the finances required for other necessities such as food,
clothing, education, medical insurance, transportation, or other basic needs.
As summarized in Table 3-15, 46 of the City’s households (12.3 percent) were spending
more than 30 percent of their incomes to cover housing costs in 2011 according to the
ACS. Housing overpayment was most prevalent among owner-occupied households
earning over $50,000 per year.

HUD’s Fair Market Rent (FMR) as indicated in Table 3-16, shows that rents for two,
three, and four-bedroom units experienced an increase followed by a decline in the mid-
1990s. This trend was largely due to the economic recession the region experienced in
the early 1990s.
The HUD-formulated Fair Market Rent (FMR) schedule is a guideline to maximum rents
allowable for units receiving Section 8 assistance. HUD uses the Consumer Price Index
and the Census Bureau housing survey data to calculate the FMRs for each SMSA.5

Household income is an important consideration when evaluating housing needs
because a low income typically constrains people’s ability to obtain adequate housing.
According to the ACS, the median household income in 2011 in the City was $65,455,
16 percent higher than the Countywide median income of $56,266. According to the
ACS, 222 persons or approximately 14.6 percent of the City’s population, were living
below the poverty level in 2011. Of this figure, 211 persons (95.0 percent) were under
65 years of age while 11 persons were 65 years of age or older.
The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) developed by the U.S.
Census by HUD provides detailed information on housing needs by income level for
different types of households. Housing problems included in CHAS are:
    Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
    Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room);
    Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30% of gross income; and/or
Page 24 of 100

       Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50% of gross income.
49% of the owner households had a housing cost burden of more than 50%. The
overpayment data by income for the City is summarized in Table 3-17.

  Data presented in this table are based on special tabulations from sample Census data. The number of households in each category usually deviates slighly form the 100.0%
count due to the need to extrapolate sample data out to total households. Interpretations of these data should focus on the proportion of households in need of assistance
rather than on precise numbers.

Overcrowding
    Government Code Section 65583(a) requires an analysis and documentation
    of overcrowding including a discussion of the following:
              The number of households by tenure type that live in overcrowded and
              severely overcrowded units; and
              Identify potential resources and programs to address identified needs.
Overcrowding may also be a contributor to the deterioration of housing units. A
household is considered to be overcrowded if the number of persons residing in the unit
exceeds 1.01 persons per room. A household is severely overcrowded if the number of
persons residing in the unit exceeds 1.51 persons per room.
According to the ACS, the average household size for owner-occupied units was 4.52
persons per unit and 3.13 persons per rental unit in 2011. Comparable figures for Los
Angeles County were 3.18 persons per owner-occupied unit and 2.81 persons per
renter-occupied unit. Table 3-18 provides a breakdown in the number of overcrowded
units that were identified by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2000 and the ACS in 2011.
Of the 372 occupied housing units identified in the 2011 ACS, 35 units were identified
as being overcrowded (9.4 percent of the City’s total number of occupied units) and 16
units (4.3 percent of the total occupied units in the City) were identified as being
severely overcrowded. Table 3-18 provides a breakdown of overcrowding according to
housing tenure. In addition, the ACS estimated the City’s average household size in
2011 was 4.09.

Resources and Programs
The City of Irwindale helps address overpayment and overcrowding by administering
affordable homeownership and rental housing programs. Applicable City programs
include the Substantial Rehabilitation Improvement Loan and Deferred Housing
Page 26 of 100

Improvement Loan programs that provide financial assistance for bedroom and/or
bathroom additions to alleviate overcrowding.
3.2.2.5 Extremely Low Income (ELI) Households Housing Needs
     Government Code Section 65583(a)(1) requires “Documentation of projections
     and a quantification of the locality’s existing and projected housing needs for
     all income levels, including extremely low income households”. Analysis
     should include:
              Estimate of the number of existing households with Extremely Low-
              Income;
              Estimate of the number of projected households with Extremely Low-
              Incomes; and
              Assessment of the kind of housing available and suitable for Extremely
              Low- Income households (including Supportive Housing and Single-
              Room Occupancy (SROs) units) and whether existing zoning permits
              those housing types.
There were approximately 49 households in the City that qualified as Extremely Low-
Incomes (“ELI”) in 2000 according to HUD’s Comprehensive Housing Affordability
Strategy (CHAS) (refer to Table 3-17). Households in this income category had
incomes of less than 30 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI). Extremely Low-
Income households primarily consist of households with minimum wage earners,
persons with disabilities, and elderly households on Social Security.
Extremely Low-Income households are the most often difficult to serve given the
substantial subsidies required to make housing affordable to this income group. As
identified in Table 3-17, 79.6 percent of the City’s Extremely Low-Income households
are renters and 61.5 percent of these households faced housing problems (defined as
cost burden greater than 30 percent of income and/or overcrowding and/or without
complete kitchen or plumbing facilities). All owner Extremely Low-Income households
faced housing problems.               In addition, 71.4 percent of Extremely Low-Income
households are elderly.6
As discussed in the Projected Housing Needs Section and identified in Table 3-32, the
City has a projected housing need of 2 units for Extremely Low-Income households7.
6
  Elderly households in CHAS are those headed by elderly persons 62 years of age or older.
7
  AB 2634 mandates the calculation of the subset of the Very Low-Income regional need that constitutes
the jurisdiction’s need for Extremely Low-Income housing. Local agencies may calculate the projected
housing need for ELI households by presuming 50% of Very Low-Income households qualify as ELI.
Page 27 of 100

The City’s existing affordable housing inventory includes units restricted for Extremely
Low-Income households, some of which are age-restricted. Availability of affordable
rental apartments is limited and prospective applicants are placed on an interest list.
The prospective applicants on the interest list are then notified of vacancies and the
application filing period.
Housing for Extremely Low-Income households is oftentimes provided by emergency
shelters, transitional housing, or supportive housing. The City’s Zoning Ordinance does
not currently provide for these types of housing uses. The City intended to complete an
amendment to the Zoning Ordinance to permit emergency shelters by 2014. The
amendment has not yet been completed due to a lack of staff and financial resources
due to a structural deficit to the City’s General Fund since 2008. The City is currently
processing a comprehensive update to the City’s Zoning Ordinance to be completed in
2014.
There is currently a 26–unit residential development in the City that has 9 units for
Extremely Low-Income senior households. The City also has 5 Extremely Low-Income
housing units in other housing projects in the City.
3.2.2.6 Housing Stock Characteristics
  Government Code Section 65583(a) requires an analysis and documentation of
  household characteristics, including level of payment compared to ability to
  pay, housing characteristics, including overcrowding, and housing stock
  condition.
Housing Stock Conditions and Age
  Government Code Section 65583(a) requires an analysis and documentation of
  household characteristics, including level of payment compared to ability to
  pay, housing characteristics, including overcrowding, and housing stock
  condition.
          Estimate of the number of substandard units (i.e. those in need of
          rehabilitation (repair) and those in need of replacement (demolition).
This part of the Housing Needs Section is concerned with the age and condition of
housing in the City. A physical condition survey of the City’s housing stock was
conducted by City staff in January 2013 to determine the overall condition of housing in
the City. A random sample of 200 units (out of a total of 390 units) was drawn. Housing
conditions were evaluated according to the following criteria:
Page 28 of 100

    Minor Fix-Up, Paint - general housing improvement needed including paint and
    minor repairs. Typically, improvements can be and are usually completed by the
    property owner.
    Moderate Repairs - this category includes major repairs such as replacement of the
    roof. Typically, such repairs would be performed by a contractor.
    Major Repairs - In addition or in lieu of the above categories, this category of
    housing condition requires extensive repairs and/or renovation.
    Beyond Repair - This housing condition category applies to those structures where
    the cost of repair is estimated to exceed the value of the structure.
The results of the housing condition survey are shown in Table 3-19.

In addition to the field investigations, the Census data is another source that may be
referred to in interpolating housing conditions in the City. The most widely referenced
variable is “age of housing unit.” The age of housing stock is commonly used by state
and federal housing programs as a factor to estimate rehabilitation needs. The use of
this information is based on the premise that the older the units, the more likely they are
to require some form of repair or maintenance. However, this is not always the case,
since many older units have undergone extensive renovation and/or remodeling. As a
result, the housing unit age data should not be exclusively used to determine the overall
condition of housing in the City.
Table 3-20 depicts the 2011 ACS data indicating the age of the housing units within the
City. The table shows that just over 11.9 percent of the housing units identified in the
2011 ACS were constructed prior to 1939.

                     residential units as of 2012. The ACS data is an
                     approximate.

Housing units that were constructed prior to 1960 are generally considered to be
potential candidates for rehabilitation since the structures are approaching fifty years in
age. As indicated in Table 3-20, a total of 163 units were constructed prior to 1960
according to the most recent ACS data. This represents 42.2 percent of the total
housing units in the City.
There are a number of other Census indicators that are useful in identifying potential
dilapidated units. These indicators include units without heating, units lacking
conventional plumbing, or units lacking complete kitchen facilities. The latter variable
may also be an indicator of bootleg units constructed illegally or legal second units.
According to the 2011 ACS, 24 units (6.5 percent of the City’s total) did not use any
form of heating fuel. The data also indicated that 3 units (0.8 percent) lacked any
plumbing facilities and 3 units (0.8 percent) were identified as lacking any kitchen
facilities.

Housing Stock
    Government Code Section 65583(a) requires an analysis and documentation of
    household characteristics, including level of payment compared to ability to
    pay, housing characteristics, including overcrowding, and housing stock
    condition. Analysis should include:
             Housing costs and affordability;
             Housing construction prices and trends;
             Housing units by type; and
             Vacancy rates.
Single family residences are the dominant housing type in the City. According to the
California Department of Finance, the City had a housing inventory of 418 units as of
January 1, 2012 of which 92.6 percent (387 units) of the City’s housing inventory was
single family housing. Of this total, 371 units or 95.8 percent were occupied units.

Vacancy Rates
Vacancy rates vary by tenure and often influence the cost of housing. As summarized
in Table 3-24, the City’s vacancy rate has remained consistently at approximately 4
percent which can be an indicator of a balance between housing supply and demand in
the City.

3.2.3 SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
    Government Code Section 65583(a)(7) requires an analysis of any special
    housing needs, such as those of the elderly, persons with disabilities, large
    families, farmworkers, families with female heads of households, and families
    and persons in need of emergency shelter. An analysis of each special needs
    group should include the following:
           Number of persons or households in the special housing needs group,
           including tenure, where possible;
           Quantification and qualitative description of the need, including a
           description of the potential housing problems faced by the special
           needs groups, a description of any existing resources, and an
           assessment of unmet needs; and
           Identification of potential program or policy options and resources to
           address the need.
Special housing needs groups are those households that contain the elderly,
handicapped, large families, overcrowded households, female heads of households,
and persons in need of emergency shelter. Pursuant to the Housing Element
Legislation, a housing element must include an analysis of special housing needs for
groups such as handicapped, elderly, large families, farm workers, and families with
female heads of households need to be considered.
3.2.3.1 Elderly
   An analysis of elderly persons should include the following:
          Number of elderly households by tenure;
          Number of seniors living at or under the poverty level;
          Listing of available resources and services addressing senior housing
          needs; and
          Identification of potential housing problems faced by the elderly and
          assessment of unmet needs.
The population over 65 years of age is considered elderly and presents four main
concerns:
   Income: people over 65 are usually retired and living on a fixed income and
Page 33 of 100
    experience difficulty in maintaining adequate living arrangements due to increasing
    rental payments.
    Health care: due to higher rates of illness, health care is important.
    Transportation: many seniors use public transit.
    Housing: many seniors live alone and many rent.
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, of the 404 units occupied, 106 units had a
householder 65 years of age or older as summarized in Table 3-25. As indicated
previously, the elderly are among the fastest growing population group in the City.
Trends toward an aging population indicate that there is likely to be a greater need
and/or demand for housing units suitable for the elderly in the near-term.

Affordable housing for elderly persons includes housing that is wheelchair accessible,
energy efficient, equipped with elevators and a number of safety and accessibility
features such as door handles, emergency pull cords, rails in bathrooms, walk-in tubs
with no-slip coating, and colors to heighten vision. Table 3-26 summarizes the City’s
population that is below the poverty level in 2011 according to the ACS. Persons at or
below the poverty level are primarily between 18 to 64 years old (123 persons). Less
than one percent (0.07 percent) of total population that is considered elderly is below
the poverty level. As summarized in Table 3-17, 20 elderly households reported having
a housing problem in 2000 according to CHAS data8. These elderly households are
reported to have extremely low incomes.
8 Elderly households in CHAS are those headed by elderly persons 62 years of age or older.

Programs and Resources for Elderly Population
There is currently a 26–unit residential development in the City that has restricted rents
affordable to Extremely Low-, Very Low-, Low- and Moderate-Income senior
households.
As discussed in Section 3.5.2 Housing Programs, the City intends to amend some of
the housing programs (Programs Nos. 1 through 7) to provide financial assistance for
the rehabilitation of units to accommodate the growing senior population.
3.2.3.2 Persons with Disabilities (Including Developmental Disabilities)
   An analysis of persons with disabilities should include the following:
         Discussion of resources, including existing housing and services for
         persons with disabilities;
         Housing types which can accommodate persons with disabilities and
         discuss zoning and capacity available to facilitate these housing types;
         and
         Housing programs and strategies planned to address identified needs.
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines a disabled person as having a
physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.
Physical disabilities can hinder access to conventional housing units. Mental and
developmental disabilities can affect a person’s ability to keep their housing. Moreover,
physical and mental disabilities can prevent persons from earning adequate income.
Therefore, persons with disabilities are more vulnerable and are considered a group
with special housing needs. Special housing needs for persons with disabilities fall into
two general categories: physical design to address mobility impairments, and social,
education, and medical support to address developmental and mental impairments.
Page 35 of 100

The Census defines sensory and physical disabilities as “long-lasting conditions.”
Mental, self-care, go-outside-home and employment disabilities are defined as
conditions lasting six months or more that makes it difficult to perform certain activities.
A more detailed description of each disability is provided below:
         Sensory disability: Refers to blindness, deafness or severe vision or hearing
         impairment.
         Physical disability: Refers to a condition that substantially limits one or more
         basic physical activities, such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or
         carrying.
         Mental disability: Refers to a mental condition lasting more than six months that
         impairs learning, remembering, or concentrating.
         Self-care disability: Refers to a condition that restricts the ability to dress, bathe,
         or get around inside the home.
         Go-outside-home: Refers to a condition that restricts the ability to go outside the
         home alone to shop or visit a doctor’s office.
         Employment disability: Refers to a condition that restricts the ability to work at a
         job or business.
A "developmental disability" is defined as a disability that originates before an individual
becomes 18 years old, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and
constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. This term includes Mental
Retardation, Cerebral Palsy, Epilepsy, and Autism. This term shall also include
disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require
treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but shall not
include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.
The San Gabriel/’Pomona Regional Center is the center for the developmentally
disabled that serves Irwindale. According to Center staff, a total of 178 clients from the
91706 zip code were served by the Center last year. The 91706 zip code encompasses
most of Irwindale and all of Baldwin Park. If the 178 clients are divided between the two
cities as a proportion of their total populations, an estimated four irwindale residents
were served by the Center.
Table 3-27 summarizes the number and proportion of City residents with a physical or
mental disability in 20009. According to the U.S. Census, approximately 17.5 percent
(230 persons) of the City’s population in 2000 that was 5 years or older reported to have
a physical and/or mental disability with 10.2 percent of the disabled population between
the ages of 16 and 64 years. Of those reported to have a disability, 54 persons
between the ages of 21 and 64 were employed.
9
  Disability status was not recorded in the U.S. Census for children younger than five years of age.

The disabilities affecting City residents are summarized in Table 3-28. Although 230
persons in the City are recorded to have a disability, some residents are affected by
more than one disability. There were 545 disabilities tallied in 2000 by the U.S. Census
with more disabilities recorded for residents between the ages of 5 and 64. Of the total
disabilities recorded, physical disabilities was the highest disability recorded with 129
persons or 23.7 percent of the total disabilities recorded.

Housing Needs of Persons with Disabilities
Disabled persons have special needs when it comes to housing. Often, these
households are occupied by elderly persons as discussed previously. Door frames must
be wider to accommodate wheel chairs, ramps instead of stairs are needed, hand rails
in bathrooms need to be installed, cabinet doors must be accessible, and light switches
and other devices also need to be within easy reach. The cost for retrofitting an existing
structure may be thousands of dollars and may be beyond the reach of lower income
households. The lack of such housing is even more pronounced when it comes to
market-rate rental units. Unless such provisions are made for disabled persons during
original construction, such facilities will not likely be provided in a typical rental unit.
Senior housing (both owner and rental) generally has many of the features outlined
above. The real constraints are associated with the housing for families and working-
aged adults.
Location of housing is also an important factor for many persons with disabilities, as
they often rely upon public transportation to travel to necessary services and shops.
“Barrier free design” housing, accessibility modifications, proximity to services and
transit, and group living opportunities are important in serving this group.
The City complies with all ADA and Title 24 requirements. These requirements permit
the City to make exceptions to the existing zoning requirements for households
containing a disabled individual. All of the City’s housing rehabilitation programs have
as a first priority the provision of facilities for handicapped access.
The definition of “family” in the Zoning Ordinance is as follows: “Persons, related by
blood, marriage or adoption, living together as a single housekeeping unit in an
apartment or dwelling unit. Family also includes a group of persons, including roomers
unrelated by blood, marriage or adoption, when living together as a single
housekeeping unit in a single dwelling unit.” This definition is in compliance with State
law.
Programs for Disabled Population
The City has a multiple-family affordable senior housing project (Las Casitas). The
second and final phase of this project (10 units) was recently completed. All of these
units are equipped for handicap access (e.g., wide doors; step-in showers, ability to
install grab bars in the bathrooms; and ability to convert the kitchen for wheelchair
access). The City has also recently adopted a Reasonable Accommodation ordinance,
In addition, the City’s housing rehabilitation loan and grant programs can be used to
make reasonable accommodation improvements.
As discussed in Section 3.5.2 Housing Programs, the City intends to amend some of
the housing programs (Programs Nos. 1 through 7) to provide financial assistance in the
rehabilitation of units to accommodate the growing senior population.

3.2.3.3 Large Families/Households
   An analysis of large families/households should include the following:
          Number of large families/households with lower-incomes;
          Number of large families/households by tenure;
          Housing stock by number of bedrooms; and
          Analysis of the impacts on large families/household families where the
          housing market does not meet the needs.
According to HCD and HUD’s definition, the term "large family" refers to a family
containing five or more persons. Large households have special housing needs due to
income and the lack of available, affordable, and adequately sized housing. To save for
necessities such as food, clothing, and medical care, low and moderate income large
households tend to reside in smaller units, often resulting in overcrowding.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, large families/households accounted for
approximately 34 percent of the City's households in 1980, 35 percent (92 households)
in 1990, and 37 percent (136 households) in 2000. Table 3-29 summarizes the number
of large families/households in the City by tenure in 2011 according the ACS. In 2011,
there were 136 large families/households in the City or 36.5 percent of total households.
Furthermore, 113 of the 136 large-family households (83.1 percent) reside in owner-
occupied units. The City’s housing production program gives priority to current City
residents as a measure directly tailored to address the issue of existing overcrowding.

The City’s housing stock by tenure and number of bedrooms as recorded by the ACS in
2011 is summarized in Table 3-30. Just over 70 percent of the City’s housing stock has
three or more bedrooms, units which are more suitable for large-family households.
Three or more bedroom units are concentrated in the owner-occupied housing stock
(223 units or 87 percent).

Resources and Programs
Housing assistance needs for large families/households include the City-administered
Substantial Rehabilitation Improvement Loan and Deferred Housing Improvement Loan
programs that provide financial assistance for bedroom and/or bathroom additions to
alleviate overcrowding and the provision of adequately sized and affordable housing.
Section 8 rental assistance is also available through the Los Angeles County Housing
Authority to income-qualified large families/households, particularly those living in
overcrowded conditions.
There are 99 units for Very Low-, Low-, and Moderate-Income households with 3 or 4
bedrooms, of which 61 units are 3 bedroom homes and 38 units are four bedroom
homes.
3.2.3.4 Female Headed Households
   An analysis of female headed households should include the following:
           Number of female-headed households;
           Number of female-headed households with incomes below the poverty
           level;
           Households with and without children 18 years and younger; and
           Identification of available resources and unmet needs.
Single-parent households are likely to have special needs for housing near day care
and recreation facilities and need access to public transportation. Low income female
heads of households with children experience an additional burden when combined with
limited transportation resources. Low-income workers, especially female heads of
households with children, have unique travel patterns that may prevent them from
obtaining work far from home.
Page 40 of 100
Female headed households generally refer to those households with a female that is a
single-parent. The number of families in the City with female heads-of-households in
the City increased from 44 households (17% of the total number of households in the
City) in 1980 to 70 households (19.2% of the total households) in 2000 and 104 in 2011
according to the ACS. In addition, 59 households or 56.7 percent of the female heads-
of-households in 2011 had children under 18 years old. More significantly, the same
Census figures for 2000 indicate that 6 of the female headed households had incomes
that were below the poverty level. More current detailed poverty data was not available
at the time this analysis was written. The City’s housing production programs give
priority to current City residents as a measure directly tailored to address assistance for
existing female headed households.
3.2.3.5 Homeless & People in Need of Emergency Shelter
    An analysis of homeless and people in need of emergency shelter should
    include the following:
             Estimate/count of the daily average number of persons lacking shelter;
             Number of the mentally ill, developmentally disabled, substance
             abusers, survivors of domestic violence, and other categories of
             homeless considered significant by the jurisdiction; and
             Inventory of the resources available including shelters, transitional
             housing and supportive housing units. The analysis should include the
             number, approximate location, and type of existing shelter beds,
             hotel/motel vouchers, and units of transitional housing available.
There are two categories of need that should be considered in discussing those persons
in need of emergency shelter; those requiring transient housing and those persons or
families that are in need of short-term housing. Transient housing provides shelter
usually on a nightly basis. Short-term housing usually includes a more comprehensive
array of social services to enable families to re-integrate themselves into a stable
housing environment.
In 2008, the San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments (SGVCOG) completed a
Regional Homeless Services Strategy (Homeless Strategy). The Strategy identifies the
existing services for the homeless in the San Gabriel Valley, an assessment of the
unmet needs of homeless residents, and the development of an integrated plan that
addresses those unmet needs. The Homeless Strategy reports approximately 20
homeless persons in Irwindale10.
According to service providers in the San Gabriel Valley:
10
   At the time the Homeless Strategy was completed.
Page 41 of 100

    61 percent of the San Gabriel Valley’s homeless population are men and 39 percent
    are women;
    Families with children constitute 36 percent of the homeless population;
    More than one-third of the adults reported suffering from physical and/or mental
    disabilities;
    Nearly 8 percent of the homeless adults are veterans; and
    One third of single adults are “chronically homeless”, meaning that they are disabled
    and have been homeless for more than one year or have experienced repeated
    stays in the streets, emergency shelters, or other temporary settings four or more
    times in the past three years.
The Homeless Strategy identified the following five year goals for the geographic area
that included the City (Cluster Group 1):
    Permanent Supportive Housing: 47 units of permanent supportive housing
    developed in small projects, and 100 scattered-site rent-subsidized units leased in
    the private market.
    Transitional Housing: 40-60 beds for singles, scattered-site master leased short-term
    housing for 125 families.
    Emergency Shelter: 60-90 emergency shelter beds for singles.
Implementation of these goals will be led by a Valley-wide council made up of
community and faith-based organizations and local government representatives which
will centrally organize and coordinate the homeless service delivery system. The City
participates in this council. In addition, the following public and private partners
expressed commitments to providing financial and technical support to implement the
goals: United Way of Greater Los Angeles; Corporation for Supportive Housing; Shelter
Partnership, Inc.; San Gabriel Valley Consortium on Homelessness; Los Angeles
Homeless Services Authority; the County of Los Angeles Board of Supervisors; County
of Los Angeles Chief Executive Office, and the Los Angeles County Community
Development Commission.
There are currently two homeless service providers located in the City. Cory’s Kitchen
provides food distribution and homeless prevention services such as classes in
household budgeting, job interview training, job skills training, and counseling. The
HOPE TAY (Transitional Age Youth) center at Pacific Clinics offers services to youth
ages 16-25 that are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.
The City Zoning Ordinance currently does not provide for emergency shelters,
transitional housing, or supportive housing. The City intended to complete an
amendment to the Zoning Ordinance to permit emergency shelters by 2012. An
amendment was not completed due to a lack of staffing and financial resources due to a
structural deficit to the City’s General Fund since 2008. However, the City is currently
Page 42 of 100

processing a comprehensive update to the City’s Zoning Ordinance to be completed in
2014. As a part of the comprehensive update, a land use matrix will be added to permit
emergency shelters as a permitted use without a conditional use or other discretionary
permit.
3.2.3.6 Farmworkers
Because of the extensive amount of agricultural activity in the State, the Housing
Element law requires the consideration of farm worker housing needs. As indicated in
the preceding section, the City’s population experienced a significant decline between
the 1960 and 1970 Census. The City’s population declined by 734 persons (a 48%
decline) during this period. This decrease was due to the closing of a farm labor
camp.11
According to the ACS, there were no City residents that were employed in the “Farming,
Forestry, and Fishing” occupations (see Table 3-8). As such, the City has no need for
farmworker housing and the affordable housing needs of those who held the “Farming,
Forestry, and Fishing” occupations would be accommodated under the City’s various
affordable housing programs.
3.2.4 PROJECTED HOUSING NEEDS
3.2.4.1 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA)
    The Housing Element shall contain a quantification of the locality’s existing
    and projected housing needs for all income levels. These projected needs
    shall include the locality’s share of the regional housing need in accordance
    with Section 65584 (Government Code Section 65583(a)(1)).
State law requires that a community provide an adequate number of sites to allow for
and facilitate the production of the City’s regional share of housing for all income levels.
HCD assigns a numeric regional housing goal to the Southern California Association of
Governments for the Southern California region which includes Imperial, Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura Counties pursuant to Section 65584 of
the Government Code. SCAG allocates the housing goal in individual city and county
jurisdictions in the region. The SCAG allocations were derived from population,
housing, and employment projections. The housing needs are categorized according to
household income groups. The incomes are based upon percentages of the area
median household income for the larger Los Angeles County region. The categories
include the following:
11
   City of Irwindale. City of Irwindale Housing Element. 1986.
Page 43 of 100

    Extremely Low-Income households refer to those households with incomes 30% or
    less of the median household income, adjusted for family size, for Los Angeles
    County;
    Very Low-Income households refer to those households with incomes of 50% or less
    of the median household income, adjusted for family size, for Los Angeles County;
    Low-Income households earn over 50% and up to 80% of the Los Angeles County
    median, adjusted for family size;
    Moderate-Income households have annual incomes ranging from 80% to up to
    120% of the Los Angeles County median adjusted for family size; and,
    Above-Moderate Income households with incomes greater than 120% of the Los
    Angeles County median income, adjusted for family size.
The housing allocation targets are not building requirements, but goals for each
community to accommodate through appropriate planning policies and land use
regulations. Allocation targets are intended to assure that adequate sites and zoning
are made available to address anticipated housing demand during the planning period.
Under State law adequate sites are those with appropriate zoning and development
standards, with services and facilities needed to facilitate and encourage the
development of a variety of housing types for all income types. The analysis included in
this section begins with a discussion of the City’s current (2008-2014) and future
planning period (2014-2021) RHNA, followed by a discussion of the City’s strategies to
accommodate the RHNA goals.
RHNA for 2008-2014 Planning Period
The current RHNA period uses January 1, 2006 as the baseline for growth projections
for the 2008-2014 period as adopted by SCAG on July 12, 2007. SCAG’s 2008-2014
RHNA planning period estimated the future housing construction need for the City
during this period at 67 residential units. Between January 2006 and May 2012, 46
housing units have been constructed in Irwindale of which 39 units have affordability
restrictions.12 Table 3-31 summarizes the City’s RHNA for the period and progress in
achieving these goals. Units provided to date include:
    29 units constructed in the Mountain-Meridian Planning Area of which 22 units are
    restricted to affordable incomes;
    9 units constructed with the Las Casitas Phase II project, all the units are age and
    income-restricted; and
    8 net new units constructed by Mayans Development (16 units total). Construction of
    these units will begin in 2013.
12
   Most of these units are in the Mountain-Meridian Planning Area.

RHNA for 2013-2021 Planning Period
The future regional allocation for the 2013-2021 planning period was adopted for the
SCAG region on October 4, 2012 and further approved by HCD on November 26, 2012.
SCAG’s 2013-2021 RHNA estimated the seven-year future housing construction need
for the City at 15 units (refer to Table 3-32, where the housing needs for the selected
income groups are shown). The RHNA allocation calls for these 15 units to be
constructed between October 15, 2013 and October 1, 2021. Of the 15 housing units to
be constructed to accommodate the City’s projected future need, 2 units should be
allocated to Extremely Low-Income households, 2 units should be allocated to Very
Low-Income households, 2 units should be provided for Low-Income households, 2
units should be provided for Moderate-Income households, and 7 units should be
provided for households with Above Moderate-Incomes.

As summarized in Table 3-31, 14 Low-Income units were produced during the 2008-
2014 RHNA period, resulting in a carry-over of three Low-Income units13 that may be
credited into the following RHNA period. Therefore, the City’s remaining RHNA to be
fulfilled for the 2013-2021 period is 6 units for Low-Income households, and 7 units for
Above Moderate-Income households. The remaining units will be provided through
upcoming City housing projects as described in the Section 3.3 (Site and Inventory
Analysis).
The Housing Authority ensures the long-term affordability of units by requiring a deed
restriction on all affordable units.
13 These units are located in Phase II of the Las Casitas senior housing project. Since they were recently
completed, they have not yet been reported to the State Department of Finance.

SECTION 3.3 SITE AND INVENTORY ANALYSIS
    Government Code Section 65583(a) requires local governments to prepare an
    inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites
    and sites having the potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the
    relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to these sites. The
    inventory of land suitable for residential development shall be used to identify
    sites that can be developed for housing within the planning period.
    Government Code Section 65583.2(c) requires a demonstration that the
    projected residential development capacity of the sites identified can
    realistically be achieved.
            Determine whether each site can accommodate some portion of the
            regional housing need by income level; and
            Include a description of methodology used to estimate the realistic
            capacity.
3.3.1 POTENTIAL SITES FOR NEW HOUSING
The Housing Element must include an inventory of resources and constraints affecting
housing development. Therefore, the City must prepare an inventory of land suitable for
residential development, including vacant sites and sites having the potential for
redevelopment, and conduct an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public
facilities and services to those sites.
A potential housing site may only be classified as “unsuitable” based upon its physical
characteristics, not because of some governmental control of an artificial and external
nature. The development capacity of the potential housing development sites was
determined by first calculating the total site area and then calculating the theoretical
capacity possible under the applicable General Plan land use designation. The
theoretical capacity was then adjusted downward 20% to take into account other
variables that would limit densities (infrastructure, streets, storm drainage, etc.). The
resulting effective density or net developable area was then used to calculate the
potential build-out capacity of a development site. It should be pointed out that the most
recent development in the City that has been approved and/or constructed was based
on calculations corresponding to the effective capacity definition.
The Mountain Avenue-Shrode Street properties (Site Nos. 1 and 2) are anticipated to be
available for new residential development during the RHNA planning period. One of the
properties (Site No. 1) is owned by the Irwindale Successor Agency, the other property
Page 47 of 100

is privately owned. A program has been put in place (see Program No. 11) to target the
acquisition of the privately-owned property during the planning period. Monies are
available from Housing Authority Funds to purchase these properties for consolidation
and redevelopment. These sites are identified in the Housing Element Appendix.
The Manning Pit (Site No. 3) is a 34-acre former aggregate mining pit located in the
southeastern portion of the City. The property was purchased by the dissolved
Irwindale Community Redevelopment Agency in 2007 and intended for future
redevelopment including residential and non-residential land uses. The Manning Pit is
currently owned by the City of Irwindale Successor Agency. Pursuant to the non-
residential property disposition requirements of the Health and Safety Code for the
dissolution of redevelopment agencies, upon approval from the Department of Finance,
the Successor Agency is required to dispose of the property in the near future. The
Successor Agency will either transfer or sell 3-acres of the Manning Pit to the Housing
Authority for residential development. The Manning Pit is currently zoned M-2 (Heavy
Manufacturing). The 3-acre portion designated for residential will be re-zoned to include
the Planned Development (PD) Overlay zone which would permit a maximum density of
21 dwelling units per acre, for the maximum development of 63 dwelling units. With the
development of Manning Pit alone, the City will exceed their RHNA requirements for the
2008-2014 and 2014-2021 periods without any reliance on vacant or underutilized
properties or the participation of private property owners.

3.3.2 VACANT LAND AND UNDERUTILIZED SITES
Page 48 of 100
    The inventory sites that have potential for residential developed can include
    non-vacant and underutilized sites (Section 65583.2(b)(3)). Describe the
    methodology used to establish the development potential within the planning
    period including:
            Existing uses may constitute an impediment to additional residential
            development;
            Development trends;
            Market conditions; and
            Availability of regulatory and/or other incentives such as expedited
            permit processing and fee waivers/deferrals.
State law requires that jurisdictions demonstrate that the land inventory is adequate to
accommodate that jurisdiction’s share of the regional growth. An underutilized site
includes properties with potential for recycling, scattered sites suitable for assembly,
publicly-owned surplus land, and portions of blighted areas with abandoned or vacant
buildings, areas with mixed-use potential, and substandard or irregular lots which could
be consolidated.
There are a number of residentially-zoned privately-owned properties in the City that are
either vacant or underutilized with the potential for residential development. Tables 3-
34 and 3-35 identify properties in the City that are currently vacant or underutilized and
owned by private property owners. Of the underutilized sites (see Table 3-35), all of the
houses on these sites are older, having been built between 1910 and 1944. Many of
the structures exhibit signs of deferred maintenance and the need for substantial
rehabilitation or replacement, making these older homes good candidates for
redevelopment. If all of these sites (both vacant and underutilized) were to be
developed, a total of 29 net new units could be developed, based on a minimum lot size
of 5,000 square feet.

It is not uncommon in the City for properties that have been in families for generations
to be subdivided and developed by the owners. Between 2005 and 2008, six parcel
maps for the subdivision of existing residential properties have been processed by
private owners that would result in 7 net new units. Requests to construct residential
units on these properties have not been submitted and the City is uncertain as to
whether the properties will be developed during the 2013-2021 planning period. The
City will continue to confer with the private property owners regarding plans to develop
the properties; until the property owners indicate their intention to develop additional
units, the City has not included these properties as contributing to the City’s RHNA
goals. The City will also continue to confer with private property owners regarding the
development or possibility of the Irwindale Housing Authority’s acquisition, subject to
available financial resources, of vacant and/or underutilized properties identified in
Tables 3-34 and 3-35. Aerial photographs of each of the candidate infill sites are
provided in the Housing Element Appendix. There are no known environmental
constraints on these properties.
An additional source of new housing development, especially affordable housing, is
related to the provision of second units on residential properties currently developed
with a single-family residence. The City recently amended its Second Unit Ordinance to
Page 50 of 100

ensure its conformance with current State law. This amended Ordinance and the
attendant implementation program encourages the development of new second units in
the future. Over the past year since the Second Unit Ordinance was adopted, no
applications for second units have been submitted. During the current planning period,
one second unit per year is anticipated to be constructed, although market trends could
affect this estimate in the future. The City has developed a program to market and
promote the Second Unit Ordinance to residents (see Program No. 8).
3.3.3 ZONING THAT WOULD ACCOMMODATE LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
    The densities of sites identified in the inventory must be sufficient to
    encourage and facilitate the development of housing affordable to lower-
    income households (Section 65583.2(c)(3)(A) & (B). The analysis must
    describe the following:
           Market demands and trends;
           Financial feasibility; and
           Information based on residential project experience within a zone(s)
           where the densities facilitated the development of housing for lower-
           income households.
The City’s Zoning Ordinance includes two land use designations and one overlay zone
that permit the development of higher density residential development. The R-2 zone
(light-multiple residential) requires a minimum land area size of 3,000 square feet per
unit which translates into a development density of 14 units per acre. The R-3
(medium-multiple residential) zone district requires a minimum land area of 2,000
square feet per unit that translates into a development density of 21 units per acre. The
PD Overlay zone district requires a minimum land area of 2,000 square feet per unit that
translates into a development density of 21 units per acre. For projects that are
affordable (non-market rate), the developer may take advantage of a density bonus of
up to 35% and development incentives to further increase the potential development
density.
The most recent higher density development in the City was the Las Casitas Senior
Housing development, an Extremely Low- to Moderate-Income age-restricted apartment
project. The project was approved for 26 units on 33,710 square feet of land, with a
density of 33.6 dwelling units per acre. Phase 1 of the project, which consists of 16
units was completed in 1996 and Phase 2 was completed in 2012 consisting of 10 units.
The project includes 9 Extremely Low-Income; 6 Very Low-Income; 5 Low-Income; 5
Moderate-Income households, and a manager’s unit.

3.3.4 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
    Government Code Section 65583.2(b)(4) requires a general description of any
    environmental constraints to the development of housing within the
    jurisdiction and the documentation for which has been made available to the
    jurisdiction.
           Any known environmental features that have the potential to impact the
           development viability of the sites;
           Status of the sites regarding environmental determinations; and
           Housing element policies or objectives that will result in outcomes with
           environmental benefits.
Environmental factors can constrain residential development in a community by
increasing costs and reducing the amount of land suitable for housing. The City is
relatively flat and does not consist of any known environmental features that have the
potential to impact the development viability of identified sites.
3.3.5 ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE
     Government Code Section 65583.2(b)(5) requires a general description of
     existing or planned water, sewer, and other dry utilities supply, including the
     availability and access to distribution facilities. The analysis must describe
     the following:
             General description of the public infrastructure necessary to serve
             housing development;
             How infrastructure capacity associated with the identified development
             potential can be accommodated;
             Whether housing development potential would require expansion or
             improvement of existing facilities or new infrastructure development;
             and
             Information based on residential project experience within a zone(s)
             where the densities facilitated the development of housing for lower-
             income households.

Lack of infrastructure and public services can constrain the development of housing.
Costs to extend infrastructure or to provide public services can deter the construction of
housing, negatively impact the cost of housing, and the timing of development. The City
has adequate domestic water service, public wastewater lines, roads, schools, trash,
public facilities, parks and recreation, fire and police services for the level of
development projected by the City.
3.3.6 ZONING FOR A VARIETY OF HOUSING TYPES
   Government Code Section 65583 requires the housing element to identify
   adequate sites for a variety of housing types including multifamily rental
   housing, factory-built housing, mobilehomes, housing for agricultural
   employees, supportive housing, single-room occupancy units, emergency
   shelters, and transitional housing.
3.3.6.1 Emergency Shelters, Transitional Housing, and Supportive Housing
State law requires local jurisdictions to identify at least one zone that permits
emergency shelters without discretionary review. Jurisdictions may apply limited
conditions to the approval of ministerial permits for emergency shelters. The identified
zone must have sufficient capacity to accommodate a minimum of one year-round
shelter. Development standards must be objective and encourage and facilitate the
development of or conversion of an existing building to an emergency shelter.
California Health and Safety Code Section 50675.2 defines “transitional housing” and
“transitional housing development” as buildings configured as rental housing
developments, but operated under program requirements that call for the termination of
assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at
some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than six months.
Transitional housing may include group quarters with beds, single-family homes, and
multi-family apartments and typically offer case management and support services to
help return people to independent living.
California Health and Safety Code Section 50675.14(b) defines supportive housing as
housing with no limit on length of stay that is occupied by a target population, and is
linked to on- or off-site services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining
the housing, improving their health status, and maximizing their ability to live and work
in the community. Target population includes adults with low incomes having one or
more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other
chronic health conditions, or individuals eligible for services.
The City’s Zoning Ordinance currently does not provide for emergency shelters,
transitional housing, or supportive housing. The City intended to complete an
Page 53 of 100

amendment to the Zoning Ordinance to permit these land uses by 2012. Due to a lack
of staffing and financial resources because of a structural deficit to the City’s General
Fund since 2008, an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance was not completed.
However, the City is currently processing a comprehensive update to the City’s Zoning
Ordinance to be completed in 2014. As a part of the comprehensive update, a land use
matrix will be added to permit emergency shelters, transitional housing, and supportive
housing as a permitted use without a conditional use or other discretionary permit.
Although the comprehensive update remains to be completed, the Zoning Ordinance
was amended to include provisions for the density bonus and reasonable
accommodation. This amendment was adopted on May 8, 2013 (Ordinance No. 669).
The City of Irwindale is in compliance with the Employee Housing Act (CA Health &
Safety Code Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6) in that the City’s Zoning Ordinance does
not place any restrictions on employee housing.
SECTION 3.4 CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING
DEVELOPMENT
    The element must identify and analyze potential and actual governmental
    constraints to the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for
    all income levels, including housing for persons with disabilities. The analysis
    should identify the specific standards, processes and evaluate their impact,
    including cumulatively, on the supply and affordability of housing. The
    analysis should determine whether local regulatory standards pose an actual
    constraint and must also demonstrate local efforts to remove constraints that
    hinder a jurisdiction from meeting the housing needs.
Many factors may affect the type, timing, and cost of new housing construction. The
State requires that housing elements identify those variables that may constrain the
development of new housing. The constraints considered in this Element include the
following:
     Governmental Constraints refer to those actions undertaken by the government that
     may restrict or otherwise impede the development of new housing, especially
     affordable housing; and
     Market Constraints refers to economic factors (land values, construction costs,
     interest rates, etc.) that may restrict or otherwise impede the development of new
     housing, especially affordable housing.

3.4.1 GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS: PERMITS AND FEES
       An analysis of permit and fee constraints should include the following:
       Fees:
               Identify and analyze permit processing and planning fees, and
               development impact fees and exactions and how they have been
               established relative to statutory requirements;
               Identify exactions such as land dedication requirements and other
               exactions imposed on development;
               Describe other sources of public finance used to balance development
               fees assessed for individual projects. Estimate and analyze total
               development fees imposed by the city by unit type;
               Include information on how fees are collected; and
               Identify any policies or efforts to moderate high fee impacts for housing
               for lower-income households.
       Permits:
               Describe and analyze the types of permits, extent of discretionary
               review including required approval findings, procedures, and
               processing time required for residential development by zoning district;
               Describe and analyze the total permit and entitlement process for a
               typical single-family unit, subdivision, and multifamily project.
               Description should include typical processes required for single-family
               and multi-family projects and an estimate of total typical time necessary
               to complete the entitlement process;
               Describe and analyze the permit requirements and process for
               emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, single-
               room occupancy units, and farmworker housing;
               Describe and analyze all permits applicable to residential development;
               Where discretionary approval from the local legislative bodies is
               required for permitted uses and how the standards of decision-making
               promote development certainty; and
               Describe and analyze other applicable regulations and processes such
               as design review and PUD districts.
Local governments may unintentionally influence the cost of housing through land use
controls, building codes, code enforcement, fee processing requirements, requirements
pertaining to on- and off-site improvements, and taxes. The fees considered herein
include fees for electrical connection, fire flow requirements, sewer construction, water
connection, plan checks, building permits, and school impact fees. The fees charged in
the City14 are identified below in Table 3-36.

In general, the planning and development fees are lower than those of surrounding
communities, and the amount of time devoted to the processing of new development is
consistent with that of the surrounding communities. Plan check for the processing of
building permits for residential projects is generally two to three weeks, depending on
the City’s workload. The City’s Department of Planning and Community Development
processes expedited plan checks for projects at no extra charge. The majority of
residential developments are processed administratively as opposed to discretionary
permits which require a public hearing. Residential projects that require a variance,
subdivision, zone change, and/ or general plan amendment are considered
discretionary permits and require a public hearing. For discretionary permits, there is an
initial internal review period of 30 days. Once the application is deemed complete, it is
then forwarded for the prescribed public review and noticing period. The Planning
Commission is the approving body for a variance request. The entire approval process
for a variance typically requires two to three months to complete. The Planning
Commission and the City Council are the approving bodies for all of the other
discretionary permits identified above. The entire approval process for these permits
typically requires three to four months to complete. The timelines for discretionary
permits are outlined in Table 3-37.
Not all projects require discretionary permits. If more than one discretionary permit is
required for a project, the permits can be processed concurrently. The City works
closely with developers to expedite approval procedures to minimize time constraints to
development. Through the comprehensive Zoning Code update anticipated to be
completed by the end of 2014, the City will consider eliminating the requirement for two
public hearings for parcel maps and subdivision maps (refer to Program No. 9).
Eliminating a public hearing will reduce processing times by 2 to 4 weeks.

Building codes are applied to new construction, and are monitored and inspected under
the City’s building permit process. There are no extraordinary regulations applied by
the City that would hinder future housing developments. The City contracts with Los
Angeles County for building plan check reviews and the City has adopted the County
Building Code for its use (the Los Angeles County Building Code, 1999 Edition title 26
of the Los Angeles County Code). The Los Angeles County Uniform Building Code as it
applies to the City is consistent with the Uniform Building Code. There have been
several revisions to the Building Code since 1999. Overall, the fees collected as part of
the development review and implementation account for well below 10% of the entire
development cost. In addition, the fees are the same for both single-family and
multiple-family developments. Code Enforcement activities related to housing are
based upon complaints reported by members of the public. The City has also
undertaken a number of other initiatives that were beneficial in terms of removing
governmental constraints:
    The City adopted a Second Unit Ordinance that is in conformance with current State
    requirements. This Ordinance is being promoted with a brochure that is available at
    City Hall and is also posted on the City’s website.
    Design review is not required for any residential development.
    The City recently adopted a Density Bonus Ordinance to encourage the
    development of affordable housing and is in conformance with current State density
    bonus law.
    The City recently adopted a Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance for housing
    intended for persons with disabilities.
The City provides on- and off-site improvements for City sponsored projects. These
improvements may include, but are not limited to, utility connections for water and
sewer lines, fire hydrants, relocation of utility lines, on-site drainage improvements, and
roadway curbs and gutters along the site frontage. In addition, no new or existing
residential development is burdened with special assessments or Mello-Roos districts.
The infrastructure improvements for all of the housing units constructed in the City since
1986 have been paid for by the now dissolved Irwindale Community Redevelopment
Agency. Future improvements for affordable housing projects will be funded by the
Housing Authority.
Page 57 of 100

All of the off-site improvements are installed pursuant to Los Angeles County standards.
In addition, the plan check services are provided by Los Angeles County personnel.
According to the City’s Municipal Code, all public roadways and related roadway
improvements must conform in workmanship and materials with those specifications of
the Los Angeles County (Standard Specification for the Construction of Street Lighting
Systems and Appurtenances in the County of Los Angeles, California) as approved by
the County Board of Supervisors.
3.4.2 GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS: LAND USE CONTROLS
    An analysis of land use controls should include the following:
            Identify all relevant land-use controls;
            Discussion of impacts on the cost and supply of housing and evaluate
            the cumulative impacts of standards, including whether development
            standards impede the ability to achieve maximum allowable densities;
            and
            Determination whether land use controls constrain the development of
            multifamily rental housing, factory-built housing, mobilehomes,
            housing for agricultural employees, supportive housing, single-room
            occupancy units, emergency shelters, and transitional housing.
The most significant constraint on housing production in the community is related to the
availability of land and other environmental factors. The Community Development (land
use) Element included in the General Plan indicates the location and extent of
residential development permitted in the City. The City’s Land Use Map is provided in
Figure 3-3. The City Zoning Ordinance further defines the types of housing that is
permitted. Each residential zone is described according to the type of permitted
residential use, the minimum lot size, the maximum development density, and the
parking requirements. The City’s history of developing affordable housing demonstrates
thAT current density standards and requirements provide for affordable housing. A total
of 106 affordable housing units have been constructed since 1986, representing
approximately 20 percent of the City’s total housing stock. The City’s Zoning Ordinance
contains three residential zone districts and two additional zone districts that permit
residential uses. These zone districts include the following:
    R-1: Single Family Residential. This zone district (which also includes the A-1 zone)
    is the most restrictive residential zone, permitting one single-family home per lot.
    This zone also contains base standards that are applicable to the remaining zone
    districts. Second units are also permitted in this zone. This zone permits a
    maximum density of 8 dwelling units per acre.
    R-2: Light-Multiple Residential. In addition to permitting those uses permitted under
Page 58 of 100

         the R-1 zoning, this district also permits two units on a lot. This zone permits a
         maximum density of 14 dwelling units per acre.
         R-3: Heavy-/Multiple Residential.    This zone district permits multiple family
         development including apartments and condominiums. The Las Casitas Senior
         Housing development is the only area of the City that is zoned R-3. This zone
         permits a maximum density of 21 dwelling units per acre.
         PD: Planned Development District. This zone encourages a creative and more
         efficient approach to the use of land by allowing innovative residential development
         that serves a variety of household types. This overlay zone permits a maximum
         density of 21 dwelling units per acre.
Table 3-38 indicates the specific development standards for those zone districts that
permit residential development. The Table indicates various development standards
such as setbacks, parking requirements, minimum lot size requirements as well as
permitted uses. The Table only considers those zone districts that permit some form of
residential development. The majority of the residential areas in the City are presently
zoned as A-1 (agricultural) although most of the actual development reflects smaller lot
single-family developments. One of the major programs that will be undertaken
following this Housing Element update is a comprehensive Zoning Ordinance revision.
At that time, both the map and Ordinance will be amended to reflect the Land Use
Element development standards. As is indicated in the Table, residential development
is permitted in the Commercial (C-3) zone.

If a Variance is required for a housing project, a public hearing before the Planning
Commission is required. A Variance typically takes approximately 2 months to process.
The following standard findings are required for a Variance:
    That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applicable to
    the property involved or to the intended use of such property, such as size, shape,
    topography location or surroundings, which are not applicable to other properties
    similarly situated;
    That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial
    property right possessed by other property similarly situated, but which is denied to
    the property in question;
    That the granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public
    welfare or injurious to the adjacent property; and
    That the granting of the variance will not adversely affect the general intent and
    purpose of the Municipal Code.
For an affordable housing project, instead of processing a Variance, a development
incentive(s) may be requested pursuant to the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance. This
eliminates the need for a public hearing, allowing faster processing of such projects and
incentivizing the development of housing for all income levels.
A Zone Change and General Plan Amendment require public hearings before both the
Planning Commission and City Council. These permits typically take approximately 3
months to process. The following findings are required for a Zone Change and General
Plan Amendment:
    The site is or will be adequate in size, shape, topography, location, and other factors
    to accommodate the use and development;
    Adequate street access and traffic capacity are or will be available to serve the
    proposed development and anticipated development in the surrounding area;
    Adequate utilities and public services are or will be available to serve the proposed
    development, as well as existing and anticipated development in the surrounding
    area;
    The use and development will be compatible with the existing and intended
    character of the area; and
    The proposed use will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious
    to the adjacent properties.
The City does not require a Conditional Use Permit or design review for residential
  projects.

Approximately 59.67 acres of the City’s total land area is designated for residential
development. The Town Center neighborhood, located near the Civic Center and
Parque del Norte, represents the greatest concentration of homes in the City with 232
housing units. The majority of the remaining residential neighborhoods are located in
the vicinity of the Civic Center area (in the Southeast Planning Area), in the Northwest
Planning Area near the City of Duarte, along Vincent Avenue in the Southeast Planning
Area, and along Park Avenue near Baldwin Park. Overall, there are six distinct
residential neighborhoods found in the City. These neighborhoods are shown in Figure
3-4 and include the following.
    Town Center Neighborhood. This neighborhood is located in the Southeast
    Planning Area, near the Civic Center, and Irwindale Park. This neighborhood is
    bounded by Arrow Highway on the north and Irwindale Avenue on the west. The
    Town Center neighborhood is the largest residential neighborhood found within the
    City with 216 single-family homes and 16 multiple-family units. These multiple-
    family units are contained within the Las Casitas senior housing development. The
    single-family homes occupy approximately 33. 9 acres.
    Hidalgo/Juarez Neighborhood. This neighborhood is located along Hidalgo Street
    and Juarez Street, west of the Town Center neighborhood. This residential
    neighborhood is located within the Southeast Planning Area, south of Arrow
    Highway and west of Irwindale Avenue. Within this neighborhood, are 49 homes
    occupying approximately 5.64 acres. A total of 27 homes are located along Juarez
    Street while 22 units are located along Hidalgo Street.
    Nora/Fraijo Neighborhood. The Nora/Fraijo neighborhood is also located in the
    Southeast Planning Area, north of Cypress Street between Azusa Canyon Road and
    Irwindale Avenue. This approximately 8.5-acre neighborhood is comprised of 39
    single-family residences.
    Mountain/Meridian Neighborhood. This neighborhood occupies 6.16 acres and is
    located in the City’s northwestern-most corner, in the Northwest Planning Area.
    There are 64 single-family homes in this area, 49 of which were constructed by the
    former Irwindale Community Redevelopment Agency.
    Morada Street Neighborhood. This neighborhood is located north of Arrow Highway
    and just over ½ mile east of Irwindale Avenue. This small neighborhood, consisting
    of 2.7 acres, includes 20 single-family homes located along Morada Street and 4
    homes on the property just to the east of Morada.
    Park Avenue Neighborhood. This neighborhood is located in the Southeast
    Planning Area, along a segment of Azusa Canyon Road. Five single-family homes
    are clustered together along a short segment of Azusa Canyon Road. This area, in
    its entirety, is zoned M-1 (Light-Industrial), thus making the properties legal non-
    conforming.

3.4.3 MARKET CONSTRAINTS
Market constraints include local housing cost components, such as the availability and
cost of land, as well as cost of construction. These constraints are often out of the
City’s control, and can result in housing that is not affordable to low- and moderate-
income households, or may render residential construction economically infeasible for
developers.
Land Costs
Land costs for vacant land can range from $35.00 to $54.00 per square foot15. While the
City has vacant land, much of it is not ready to be redeveloped with either residential or
non-residential land uses. These properties are former mining properties which would
need to be reclaimed prior to reuse. The reclamation process takes approximately five
to twenty-five years, depending on the site.
Few vacant lots remain in the City. Future residential development will primarily occur
as infill developments and redevelopment of existing underutilized properties.
Developing on previously developed properties is often times more expensive than
developing on vacant land given the higher site acquisition and demolition costs.
However, development on vacant land requires added costs related to infrastructure.
Construction Costs
The national average for construction costs ranges from $105.93 to $113.10 per square
foot. Construction costs vary according to the type of development, type of construction,
custom versus tract development, materials, site conditions, finishing details, amenities,
square footage, and structural configuration. Multiple family housing tends to be less
expensive to construct than single-family residential on a per unit basis due to
economies of scale. The International Conference of Building Officials provides
estimates for the average cost of labor and materials for typical Type V wood-frame
housing. Estimates are based on “good-quality” construction, providing for materials
and fixtures well above the minimum required State and local building codes.
Availability of Financing
The availability of financing may impact the ability of a household to purchase housing
or make improvements to existing housing. Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,
lending institutions are required to disclose information on the disposition of loan
applications by the income, gender, and race/ethnicity of the applicants. This applies to
all loan applications for home purchases, improvements and refinancing, whether
financed at market rate or with government assistance. The data was compiled by
census tract (Census Tract 4046.00) which generally encompasses the entire City
boundary. Table 3-39 summarizes information on loan applications in 2011 in the City’s
15 Source: San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments
Page 64 of 100

boundaries that were approved and originated, approved but not accepted by the
applicant, denied, withdrawn by the applicant, or deemed incomplete. In 2011,
approximately 54.5 percent of home loans applied for in the City were approved.

Conventional Home Purchase Loans
In 2011, 5 households applied for conventional loans to purchase homes in Irwindale, of
which 2 were for government-backed loans. The overall loan approval rate was 60.0
percent in comparison to the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale MSA/MD of 72.5
percent. In order to be eligible for government-backed loans, residents must meet the
established income standards, maximum home values, and other requirements.
Refinance Loans
The majority of loan applications submitted by Irwindale residents in 2011 were for
refinancing their existing home loans. In 2011, 27 applications were submitted and 14
applications (51.9 percent) were approved in comparison to 64.9 percent approved in
the MSA/MD.
Home Improvement Loans
The ability to maintain housing can often depend on the ability of households to obtain
home improvement loans for repairs and upgrades. To assist lower income households
in making improvements to their homes, the City offers assistance through rehabilitation
programs, which provides financial assistance to low and moderate income households
for approved home improvement projects. This program assists homeowners in need of
health and safety, building code, and accessibility-related repairs. As identified in Table
3-39, the application submitted for a home improvement loan by an Irwindale household
was approved in 2011; the MSA/MD’s approval rating in 2011 was 53.7 percent.

3.4.4 PUBLIC HOUSING AND THE RISK OF CONVERSION
    Government Code Section 65583(a)(8) requires an analysis of existing assisted
    housing developments that are eligible to change from low-income housing
    uses during the next ten years due to termination of subsidy contracts,
    mortgage pre-payment, or expiration of restrictions on use.
           Inventory of at-risk units – identification of development by project name
           and address, governmental assistance received, earliest possible date of
           change from low-income use, and number of elderly and non-elderly
           units that could be lost.
There are presently no public housing units at risk of conversion in the City. However,
in the last five years, two units that had affordability covenants with the former Irwindale
Community Redevelopment Agency have gone into foreclosure. The Housing Authority
monitors defaults and foreclosures in the City and takes action to assist these
homeowners by exercising its option to purchase the units in accordance with the rights
in the Housing Authority’s affordability covenants, by paying off the mortgages and
retaining the unit for the Housing Authority’s affordable housing stock. The Housing
Authority also attempts to investigate the availability of other homes, not subject to
Redevelopment Agency or Housing Authority affordability covenants, which are at risk
of foreclosure.      The Agency either considers purchasing such homes, where
economically reasonable, for inclusion in a future housing development for restricted-
income families or refers the homeowner to a counseling service (HOPE NOW) to assist
them with keeping their home. HOPE NOW is a non-profit alliance between counselors,
mortgage companies, investors, and other mortgage market participants. This alliance
maximizes outreach efforts to homeowners in distress to help them stay in their homes
and creates a unified, coordinated plan to reach and help as many homeowners as
possible.
3.4.5 OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
   Government Code Section 65583(a)(7) requires an assessment of housing
   needs and inventory of resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of
   these needs including an analysis of opportunities for energy conservation
   with respect to residential.
           Inventory and analyze the opportunities to encourage the incorporation
           of energy saving features, energy saving materials, and energy efficient
           systems and design for residential development.
Page 66 of 100

In recent years the cost of fuel has become increasingly more expensive and
homeowners have become more aware of energy-conserving measures. The most
readily available energy conservation alternatives are easily installed in new homes. As
in many cities, the older homes in the City were constructed with little concern for
energy conservation. However, there are numerous energy-conserving measures that
can be retrofitted into older units that conserve the use of non-renewable fuels and save
money.
To conserve heat generated by gas or oil-fired heating units and minimize the loss of
heat, older homes can be insulated in the attic and exterior walls. Windows and exterior
doors can be fitted with airtight devices, caulking, or other available means. To
conserve electricity and minimize costs, a properly-designed and installed skylight is a
helpful addition to existing housing.
Solar energy is practical, cost-effective, and an environmentally sound method used to
heat and cool a house. With proper design, this resource provides for cooling in the
summer and heating in the winter. Solar heating can also be used to heat domestic
water. Although solar energy is an unlimited resource that remains readily available,
retrofitting older units may be too costly for the average homeowner in the City. The
City will encourage the use of solar energy devices as well as other alternative energy
sources for new residential construction.
Water conservation techniques can save a family thousands of gallons of water per
year. The cost associated with these measures is minimal. There are many over-the-
counter plumbing products that eliminate waste by restricting the volume of water flow
from faucets, shower heads, toilets, sprinklers, etc. By repairing dripping faucets and
using water more conservatively, a family can save water and money. The local water
company can provide brochures that explain many of the water conservation measures.
The Southern California Edison Company provides free energy audits to local residents
on request. Energy audits are extremely valuable in pinpointing specific areas in the
home that are responsible for energy losses. The inspection results in specific
recommendations to remedy energy inefficiency. In addition, all City sponsored projects
have tankless water heaters, energy star appliances, low flow toilets, and double paned
windows. For the current planning period, the City has a new program to promote
energy efficiency to residents. The purpose of this program is to educate residents
about energy and water conservation and provide them with resources to retrofit their
homes. This program will also be used for City sponsored housing projects. In
addition, City sponsored housing projects will be required to exceed Title 24
requirements for energy conservation. As part of this program, new housing sponsored
by the City will be required to exceed Title 24 requirements and use green and
sustainable building materials and construction methods to the extent feasible. (see
Program No. 9). This program is related to the proposed Green Building Grant and
Loan Program – Program No. 10.

PROGRAMS
3.5.1 HOUSING ELEMENT POLICIES
State law requires that those “actions and policies included in the housing program”
address five key issue areas. As a result, the policies and programs that are
incorporated into the City’s Housing Element update will address the following issue

SECTION 3.5.2 HOUSING PROGRAMS
HOUSING REHABILITATION PROGRAMS FOR OWNER-OCCUPIED PROPERTIES
The City will continue implementing its Housing Rehabilitation Program for owner-
occupied units. The following programs are currently offered (collectively referred to as
“Rehabilitation Program”):
    Housing Grants for Very Low Income
    Deferred Housing Improvement Loans
    Substantial Rehabilitation Improvement Loan
The homeowner costs associated with processing the Rehabilitation Program
application (such as title policy, escrow, notary, recording documents, appraisals, loan
processing fee, and credit reports) would be paid for from the Rehabilitation Program
proceeds. If a Rehabilitation Program application is cancelled during the application
Page 70 of 100

process, any funds expended by the Housing Authority in conjunction with the Program
application (i.e. appraisal cost) are to be reimbursed by the property owner. All work
conducted under the Program is performed with approved building permits and by state
licensed contractors.
As discussed in the Housing Needs Section, the City’s elderly population is increasing,
resulting in changing resident needs. The City will be modifying these Rehabilitation
Programs to permit improvements to accommodate the needs of the elderly and
disabled such as wheelchair accessibility, door handles, emergency pull cords, rails in
bathrooms, walk-in tubs with no-slip coating, colors to heighten vision.
Program No. 1: Housing Grants for Extremely- and Very Low-Income (“Grants
Program”)
The goal of the Grants Program is to provide Very Low-Income residents with sufficient
funds to repair housing deficiencies to address exterior deterioration, as well as
conditions that could affect the resident’s health and safety. Under the Grants Program,
grants are provided in amounts of up to $25,000 for Extremely Low-, and Very Low-
Income single-family homeowners. No interest rate is charged on the grants. These
grants are intended to first address health and safety issues and exterior deterioration
and then other improvements that would improve the character and overall living
environment of the housing unit.
The home to be improved must be the primary residence of the person(s) applying for
the grant. The grant may not be combined with any other type of program assistance.
Applicants may only receive one grant during a 10-year period and the recipient must
retain possession of the property for at least a 12-month term or the grant must be
repaid in full. The Housing Authority safeguards its investment of the grant funds by
requiring that the property owner enter into an affordability covenant, in the form of a
trust deed for a 10-year period. The grant obligation would be forgiven in equal
amounts (1/10 of the Grant amount) over a 10-year period. If the property is sold during
the 10-year period to another qualified recipient, the covenant can be transferred to the
new owner. If the property is sold before the end of the 10-year period to a non-
qualified purchaser or is no longer in compliance or the new owner did not want to
assume the covenant (trust deed), the remaining grant obligation plus interest and
penalties would become due and payable to the Housing Authority (the proceeds would
be returned to the Housing Authority Fund). The grant proceeds may be used for
rehabilitation activities in the following order of priority.
    First Priority. Electrical, plumbing, heating, and air conditioning, and structural
    deficiencies that are in violation of current building codes. Correction of any safety
    problems not covered by codes, such as broken windows, lack of window screens,
    doors and the provision of facilities for handicapped access.
    Second Priority. New roofs, rain gutters, conversion of carports to garages, garage
    and entry door replacement, fencing replacement, and driveway/walk-way repairs.
Page 71 of 100

    Third Priority. Repainting, replacing dried or broken landscape materials and/or
    inoperable irrigation systems, and replacing broken or damaged awning
    improvements.
    Fourth Priority. Upgrade door and window locks, installing security lighting and
    doors and security-related fencing.
    Fifth Priority. Heating and cooling system replacement/upgrades, install insulation,
    ceiling fans, weather stripping, water heater replacement, and low flow plumbing
    fixtures.
    Sixth Priority. Interior paint, wall coverings, new flooring, repair of existing hardwood
    flooring, needed kitchen appliances (built in only), replacement of deteriorated
    kitchen or bathroom cabinets, replacement of counter tops with mid grade tile or
    Formica, replacement of inoperative lighting fixtures etc.
The quantified objectives for this Grant Program are summarized below:
Status/Timing of Implementation – This program is ongoing and will continue throughout
the Planning Period.
Funding Source – Irwindale Housing Authority.
Implementation Responsibility – Housing Coordinator
Quantified Objective – 7 grants between 2014-2021 (3 Extremely Low-Income and 2
Very Low-Income and 2 Moderate-Income)
Program No. 2: Deferred Housing Improvement Loans (“Deferred Loans
Program”)
The goal of the Deferred Loans Program is to provide Extremely Low- to Moderate-
Income residents with sufficient funds to address health and safety deficiencies and
exterior deterioration of their properties, and if funds are available, to fund other needed
improvements that will improve the quality of their lives through a deferred two percent
interest loan.
Deferred Loan amounts are provided in a maximum amount that is less than 25% of the
property’s after rehabilitation value not to exceed $60,000 for extremely low-, very low-,
low-, and moderate-income persons or households. Deferred loans are funded to first
address health and safety issues and exterior deterioration, and secondly, other
improvements that would improve the general character and living environment of the
housing unit, including providing room additions to alleviate overcrowding. The 2%
simple interest is accrued and if the home is held or the 10-year covenant period both
principal and interest are forgiven in full.
Page 72 of 100

The Housing Authority safeguards its investment of deferred loans by requiring that the
homeowner enter into all affordability covenants in the form of a trust deed or
promissory note to secure the 10-year obligation. The loan obligation, including
accrued interest, would be forgiven equally over a 10-year period. Affordability
covenants are recorded against the property and apply to all subsequent purchasers. If
the property is sold before the end of the 10 year period to a non-qualified purchaser or
the owner fails to occupy the property as their principal residence, the homeowner shall
repay to the housing fund the remaining loan obligation including principal and interest.
Permitted uses for the Deferred Loan funds include the following:
   First Priority. Correction of code violations including electrical, plumbing, heating
   and air conditioning, and structural building deficiencies that are in violation of
   current building codes. Correct planning or zoning code violations, such as illegal
   garage conversions. Correction of any safety problems not covered by codes, such
   as broken windows, doors and the provision of facilities for handicapped access.
   Second Priority. Improvements that will alleviate overcrowding (as defined in the
   United States Department of Housing and Urban Development Public Housing
   Occupancy Handbook) including the funding of bedroom addition(s) to alleviate
   overcrowding. Additionally, if a second bathroom does not exist in a home of four
   bedrooms or more and each bedroom is occupied, an additional bathroom may be
   provided.
   Third Priority. Includes various exterior improvements including new roofs, rain
   gutters, conversion of carports to garages, garage and entry door replacement,
   fencing replacement, and driveway/walkway repairs.
   Fourth Priority. Cosmetic improvements that include repainting, replacing dried or
   broken landscape materials and/or inoperable irrigation systems, and replacing
   broken or damaged awning improvements.
   Fifth Priority. Security improvements including upgrading of door land and window
   locks, installing security lighting and doors and security-related fencing.
   Sixth Priority. Energy efficiency improvements including heating and cooling system
   replacement and/or upgrades, insulation installation, ceiling fans, weather stripping,
   water heater replacement and low flow fixtures.
   Seventh Priority. Interior improvements including interior paint, wall coverings, new
   flooring, repair of existing hardwood flooring, needed kitchen appliances (built in
   only), replacement of deteriorated kitchen or bathroom cabinets, replacement of
   counter tops with mid-grade tile or Formica, replacement of inoperative lighting
   fixtures etc. All such interior items would be allowed only at mid-grade quality.

Quantified Objective - 7 additional loans processed between 2014-2021 (3 Extremely
Low-Income and 2 Very Low-Income and 2 Moderate-Income)
Program No, 3: Substantial Rehabilitation Housing Improvement Loan Program
(SR Loans)
The goal of the SR Loans is to provide the necessary funds for the substantial
rehabilitation of units that are owned and occupied by extremely low-, very low-, low-,
and moderate-income households. The SR Loans are available to homeowners that
have extremely low-, very low-, low-, or moderate-incomes. The home to be improved
must be the primary residence of the person or persons applying for the SR Loan.
Under this program, SR Loan amounts shall be provided in amounts of a minimum of
25% of the after rehabilitation value up to a maximum of $135,000 for extremely low-,
very low-, low-, and moderate-income households. The loan has a 3% interest rate.
The SR Loans are funded to address severe cases of` deterioration and/or
overcrowding. Loan proceeds must be used to first address health and safety issues,
overcrowding, and exterior deterioration, and secondly, other improvements that would
improve the general character and living environment of the housing unit, including
room additions as a means to alleviate overcrowding. Funds can also be used to abate
illegal garage conversions.
The SR Loan may not be combined with any other type of program assistance.
Applicants may only receive one SR Loan during a 45-year period and the recipient
must hold the property for a 12-month term or the Loan must be repaid in full with
interest. The Housing Authority safeguards its investment of SR loans by requiring that
the homeowner also enter into an affordability covenant, in the form of a trust
deed/promissory note to secure the 45-year affordability obligation. The SR Loan
obligation, including accrued interest, would be forgiven equally over a 20-year period.
Affordability covenants are recorded against the property and shall apply to all
subsequent purchasers. If the property becomes non-compliant by being sold before
the end of the 45-year period to a non-qualified purchaser or the owner fails to occupy
the property as their principal residence, the Homeowner shall repay to the Housing
Authority the remaining SR Loan obligation, plus a percentage of the increased equity
the property owner realized as a result of the SR Loan plus any interest that would have
accrued on the loan plus applicable penalties. SR Loan proceeds may be used for
substantial rehabilitation activities in the following order of priority:
     First Priority. Correction of code violations including electrical, plumbing, heating
     and air conditioning, and structural building deficiencies that are in violation of
     current building codes. Correct planning or zoning code violations, such as illegal

HOUSING REHABILITATION PROGRAMS FOR RENTAL UNITS
The City will continue implementing its Housing Rehabilitation Program for rental units.
Two such programs are currently offered and include the Below Market Rate Loans for
Tenant Occupied Units (BMR Loans) and the Substantial Rehabilitation Below Market
Page 75 of 100

Rate Loans for Tenant Occupied Units (SR-BMR Loans). The Housing Authority
imposes provisions under the BMR and SR-BMR loans to assure the funds are used to
increase or preserve the availability of affordable housing by tailoring the loans to
alleviate substandard conditions. For example. improvements that are not to be funded
by the loan proceeds include indoor and outdoor fireplaces, pools, Jacuzzis, hardwood
flooring, expensive counter tops, washers, dryers, barbecue pits. flower boxes,
greenhouses, family rooms, new patios or deck construction, decorative planters,
custom concrete work on driveways and walkways, detached workshops, and other
non-permanent structures and improvements considered to be a luxury as determined
by the Executive Director. All work conducted under the Loan shall be performed with
approved building permits and by state licensed contractors.
Program No. 4: Below Market-Rate Loans for Tenant Occupied Units
The purpose of this program is to ensure that renters live in safe and sanitary
conditions. Under this program, the Housing Authority provides loans to property
owners for general improvements to renter-occupied dwelling units. The maximum loan
amounts are $25,000 per unit, not to exceed a total of $100,000. The loan amount must
be less than 25% of the after rehabilitation value and the qualification is based upon
tenant’s income being less than 120% of County median income (51% of the units must
qualify). Owners who have breached or violated any affordability covenant of any loan
or grant provided by the Housing Authority at any time shall not be eligible to receive a
BMR Loan. This program will provide Below Market Rate Loans with interest rates of
6% per annum. BMR Loan funds are to be used to first address health and safety
issues and exterior deterioration, and secondly, other improvements that would improve
the general character and living environment or the housing unit. Funds will be
recaptured by monthly payments secured by a Deed of Trust. The BMR Loan may not
be combined with any other programs. An agreement must be signed by the owner to
rent the units at affordable rental rates for a period of 15 years. The ICRA will monitor
rental rate affordability and tenant income on an annual basis. Loan proceeds may be
used for substantial rehabilitation activities in the following order of priority.
    First Priority. The correction of electrical, plumbing, heating and air conditioning,
    and structural building deficiencies that are in violation of current building codes.
    Correct planning or zoning code violations, such as illegal garage conversions.
    Correction of any safety problems not covered by codes, such as broken windows,
    doors and the provision of facilities for handicapped access.

Program No. 5: Substantial Rehabilitation Below Market Rate Loans for Tenant
Occupied Units
The purpose of this program is to ensure that renters live in decent, safe and sanitary
conditions. The Below Market Rate Loans for Tenant Occupied Units Program provides
loans to property owners for general improvements to rented-occupied dwelling units.
Maximum loan amounts are $25,000 per unit, not to exceed a total of $100,000; the
loan amount must constitute 25% or more of the after rehabilitation value of the property
and an affordability covenant of 55 years is required. Qualification is based upon
tenant’s income being less than that of the County median income (51% of units must
qualify). Owners who have breached or violated any affordability covenant of any loan
or grant provided by the Housing Authority at any time shall not be eligible to receive a
SR-BMR Loan. This program will provide Below Market Rate Loans with interest rates
of 6% per annum. SR-BMR Loan funds are to used to first address health and safety
issues and exterior deterioration, and secondly, other improvements that would improve
the general character and living environment of the housing unit. Funds will be
recaptured by monthly payments Secured by a Deed of Trust. The SR-BMR Loan may
not be combined with any other programs. An agreement must be signed by the owner
to rent the units at affordable rental rates for a period of 55 years. The Housing
Authority will monitor rental rate affordability and tenant income level annually as
provided for in the CRL. At any time during the term of the SR-BMR Loan, the Housing
Page 77 of 100

Authority may require, and the owner and renters shall provide, proof and confirmation
of such information.
To safeguard the Housing Authority’s investment, the property owner must enter into an
affordability covenant, in the form of a trust deed/ promissory note to secure the 55 year
affordability obligation to rent at least 51% of the units to persons or families of low to
moderate income and to maintain affordable rents on all of the property units.
Affordability covenants are recorded against the property and shall apply to all
subsequent purchasers for the term of the covenant, unless released pursuant to state
law. If the property owner fails to comply with the loan terms including that 51% of the
units be occupied by low to moderate income persons, then the outstanding loan
principal plus any interest must be repaid to the Housing Fund along with any applicable
penalties. Loan proceeds may be used for substantial rehabilitation activities in the
following order of priority.
    First Priority. The correction of code violations including electrical, plumbing, heating
    and air conditioning, and structural building deficiencies that are in violation of
    current building codes. Correct planning or zoning code violations, such as illegal
    garage conversions. Correction of any safety problems not covered by codes, such
    as broken windows, doors and the provision of facilities for handicapped access.
    Second Priority. The refurbishment of exterior items including new roofs, rain
    gutters, conversion of carports to garages, garage and entry door replacement,

NEW HOUSING PRODUCTION PROGRAMS
New housing production goals have been set by the Housing Authority to be
accomplished during the years 2014 - 2021. These new production numbers are related
to the actual need in the City as well as official data and allocations received from
regional governing bodies. The new housing production programs include the following:
the Zoning Program, the Infill Housing Program, and the Second Unit Program. These
programs will be funded by the Housing Authority Fund and the programs oversight will
be the responsibility of the City’s Housing Coordinator.
Program No. 6: Zoning Program
This Program is a comprehensive review and revision to the City Zoning Ordinance to
ensure that it implements land use and housing policy. As part of this Housing Element
update, a number of issues emerged as potential governmental constraints that will be
addressed in a comprehensive Zoning Ordinance revision. The revision will be
comprehensive in scope though the following specific issues will be the focus of the
review and revision.
    The Land Use Plan, included in the Community Development Element, reflects an
    expansion of residential land uses, with the western portion (three acres) of the
    Manning Pit designated for residential use. The Zoning Ordinance will be amended
    to reflect the changes that have occurred as part of the Housing Element update.
    •Among the revisions to the Ordinance is adding definitions for such uses as single
    room occupancy units, supportive housing, community care facilities, emergency
    shelters, and transitional housing. Such housing for special needs groups, including
    housing for individuals with disabilities, will be permitted without regard for distances
    between such housing or the number of such uses in any part of the City. The Land
    Use Element of the General Plan does not restrict the location of special need
    housing.
    The current Zoning Code permits manufactured housing on permanent foundations
    within all residential zones. The Zoning Code will be updated to further address
    mobile homes, single room occupancy (SRO) units, supportive housing, and
    community care facilities consistent with the requirements of State housing laws.
    The City recently updated its Second Unit Ordinance to ensure it is in conformance
    with the most recent changes in State law. The new Ordinance has been reviewed
    by HCD and has been found to be in compliance with State law. This Ordinance will
    be integrated into the new Zoning Ordinance. Staff has prepared a summary of the
    permit process for a second unit for the public. Hard copies of the summary are
    available at City Hall and it is also available on the City’s website.
    On May 8, 2013, the City Council adopted Zoning Code Amendment No. 2-13
Page 79 of 100

     (Ordinance No. 669). This ordinance amended the Zoning Code to allow for density
     bonuses and reasonable accommodation. The City Zoning Ordinance currently does
     not provide for transitional and supportive housing. The City will modify the Zoning
     Ordinance to indicate that transitional and supportive housing uses will be permitted
     by right in all zones. Transitional and supportive housing will be subject only to
     those regulations that apply to other residential dwelling of the same type in the
     same zoning (i.e., multifamily in a multifamily zone).
     The City Zoning Ordinance will be revised to allow more variation from the
     application of its parking standards. Chapter 17.64 – Off-Street Parking will be
     amended to allow for a reduced number of parking spaces for unique uses such as
     senior housing projects and other housing for special needs households, including
     the disabled. Currently, the Zoning Ordinance requires two parking spaces for each
     dwelling unit, regardless of the number of bedrooms in the unit. The Zoning
     Ordinance will be revised to allow for flexible parking standards for studio and one-
     bedroom units.
     The City Zoning Ordinance currently does not permit emergency shelters. There is
     considerable variety in the types of shelters that could be operated in the City. The
     Zoning Ordinance will identify M-I (Light Manufacturing) zone as the zone where
     emergency shelters (including at least one year-round emergency shelter) will be
     allowed as a use by right, subject to written objective standards, such as stipulating
     the allowable length of stay; requiring security; and providing on-site management.
     No CUP or other discretionary permit will be required for such shelters. This zone
     will be appropriate for emergency shelters because all uses in the M-1 zone must be
     conducted in an enclosed building, no outdoor storage or activity is allowed. In
     addition, uses that are allowed in the City’s commercial zones (i.e., less intense
     uses, such as offices and retail) are also allowed in the M-1 zone. Uses allowed in
     the M-1 zone include those that provide services to the homeless population, such
     as medical and dental clinics, employment services, and counseling services. All
     properties that are zoned M-1 are along major thoroughfares in the City (i.e.,
     Irwindale Avenue, Arrow Highway, Azusa Canyon Road, and Cypress Street) that
     are served by public transit.
     There are currently two homeless service providers located in the City. Cory’s
     Kitchen provides food distribution and homeless prevention services such as classes
     in household budgeting, job interview training, job skills training, and counseling.
     The HOPE TAY (Transitional Age Youth) center at Pacific Clinics offers services to
     youth ages 16-25 that are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. There are two
     multi-service centers16 near the City of Irwindale: one in El Monte and one in West
     Covina. All of these facilities can be accessed via public transportation.
     The Appendix shows aerial photos of two groups of underutilized sites within the City
     that are zoned M-1. Each site is described below. In addition, there are a number of
16
   Also known as access centers, these centers generally function as “one stop shops” for homeless
clients to access basic services and obtain referrals to off-site services.
Page 80 of 100

    existing buildings used as offices and warehouses that could be converted to
    emergency shelters.
    4832-4954 Azusa Canyon Road – This area contains 14 separate parcels,
    consisting of a few nonconforming single-family residences and an assortment of
    outdoor storage and outdoor yard uses. The total area is approximately 10.8 acres.
    This area fronts on Azusa Canyon Road south of Arrow Highway, and is served by
    public transit.
    Los Angeles Street and Park Avenue (southeast corner) – This 5.80acre site is
    owned by the Housing Authority and is served by public transit along Los Angeles
    Street.
    City staff will review the Zoning Ordinance to determine what incentives and/or
    regulations can be implemented as a means to promote new residential
    development consistent with the objectives of this Housing Element and the General
    Plan.
    Among the revisions to the Ordinance is adding definitions for such uses as single
    room occupancy units, supportive housing, community care facilities, emergency
    shelters, and transitional housing. Such housing for special needs groups, including
    housing for individuals with disabilities, will be permitted without regard for distances
    between such housing or the number of such uses in any part of the City. The Land
    Use Element of the General Plan does not restrict the location of special need
    housing.
    The City will rezone all residential A-1 property to R-1.
The Zoning Ordinance revision is critical in ensuring that the General Plan may be
successfully implemented in addition to removing potential governmental constraints.
The City is currently in the process of drafting the revised Zoning Ordinance. The City
will make every effort to ensure that the comprehensive update of the Zoning Ordinance
is completed by the end of 2014 .
Status/Timing of Implementation – The Zoning Ordinance revision (including all of the
elements described previously) commenced in April 2009 and will be completed by
2014. The Program schedule consists of the following elements:
    1. Initial Work Effort (RFP preparation, review bids, select consultant to assist the
        City) completed by June 2013.
    2. Research and Analysis (review and preparation of Draft Zoning Ordinance)
        completed by winter 2014.
    1. Review of Ordinance (Review of Draft Ordinance by staff and Planning
        Commission) completed by spring of 2014.
Page 81 of 100

    3. Adoption of Ordinance Public Hearings and Adoption) completed during
         summer/fall 2014
Funding Source – General Fund
Implementation Responsibility – Planning Department will be responsible for managing
and overseeing the work program.
Quantified Objective – with the Planned Development Overlay, up to 63 units could be
provided.
Program No. 7: In-Fill Housing Program
The City, through the Housing Authority, is very proactive in providing new opportunities
for infill housing. Virtually all of the new housing that has been developed over the past
ten years has been City-sponsored projects by the former Irwindale Community
Redevelopment Agency and Housing Authority. All of the units that were identified in
Table 3-31 as being provided during the current planning period (2008-2014) are
Housing Authority assisted projects. This Infill Housing Program includes the following
elements:
    First Priority. Prospective developers will be identified to construct new housing
    within the existing Housing Authority -owned infill sites. An inventory of the available
    parcels was completed and an RFP covering the development of all of the parcels
    was completed and sent to prospective developers. The Housing Authority
    anticipates entering into a Disposition and Development Agreement (DDA) with
    Mayans Development by December 2013 for the development of 13 new housing
    units and the rehabilitation of 2 existing residential units.
    Second Priority. The Housing Authority will establish a mechanism to acquire infill
    sites in the future. Contacts with local realtors will be made to indicate the Housing
    Authority’s interest in buying certain properties. In addition, the Housing Authority
    will send out letters to owners of vacant property advising them of the Housing
    Authority’s interest in acquiring the property. Similar outreach efforts will be made
    using the City’s website.
    Third Priority. The City will establish a mechanism to ensure the affordability of infill
    residential developments through the use of a deed covenant. The covenant will
    guarantee a unit’s affordability for a minimum period of 45-years.
The quantified objectives for this program are summarized below:
Status/Timing of Implementation – Program has been established and is being
implemented during this Planning Period.
Page 82 of 100

Funding Source – The Program has been partially funded for this planning period. This
Program will be fully funded upon receipt of repayment of an outstanding loan
obligation.
Implementation Responsibility – Housing Coordinator
Quantified Objective –This Program was to be completed during the previous planning
period, however due to the elimination of Redevelopment, a DDA for the project could
not be executed. The Housing Authority is now serving as the Housing Successor
Agency to the former ICRA and as such, the housing assets once owned by the ICRA’s
Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund have been transferred to the Housing
Authority. In addition, the Housing Authority has also received $2.6 million in bond
proceeds from the Agency. As a result of these two events, the City may now proceed
with approving a DDA for the Infill Housing Project (8 net new units). Three of the five
properties for this project will require parcel maps. The City is committed to processing
these parcel maps in an expedited manner. These units are expected to be completed
by the end of the fourth quarter of 2014.
Program No. 8: Promotion of Second Unit Ordinance and Second Unit Deferred
Loan Program
The Second Unit Ordinance was adopted in 2007. To date, no applications to construct
a second unit have been submitted, most likely due to the recession, the resulting
unemployment, high mortgage interest rates, and the difficulty of obtaining financing for
residential property improvements. The purpose of this program is to market and
promote the ordinance to residents to encourage the production of second units. The
process to approve a second unit is ministerial and has priority processing. There is no
fee for processing the second unit application, although the regular building plan check
fees do apply. The second unit may be either attached to or detached from the primary
unit. Only one uncovered parking space is required for the second unit (the standard
requirement for single-family units is two covered spaces). In order to encourage the
production of second units during the fifth cycle, the Housing Authority will set aside
$1,000,00017 for loans to property owners to build second units.
The property owner will be charged 2% simple interest and if the second unit is held for
a 20-year period, both principal and interest will be forgiven in full.
The Housing Authority safeguards its investment of deferred loans by requiring that the
homeowner enter into an affordability covenant for the second unit in the form of a trust
deed and a promissory note to secure the 20-year obligation. The loan obligation,
including accrued interest, would be forgiven equally over a 20-year period.
17 Assuming an average construction cost of $113.00 per square foot and an average unit size of 500
square feet [$113.00 x 500 = $56,500 x 6 (the number of units to be provided during the planning
period) = $339,000] extra funds totaling $1,000,000 were added to account for cost overruns and to
correct any existing code violations on the properties.
Page 83 of 100

Affordability covenants are recorded against the property and apply to the second unit
for a 55 year period.
The quantified objectives for this program are summarized below:
Status/Timing of Implementation – A brochure explaining the ordinance was prepared
and has been posted on the City’s website; available at public counters; and mailed to
all residents. An announcement of the deferred loan program for second units will be
posted on the City’s website, available at public counters, and mailed to all residents.
Funding Source – Housing Authority .
Implementation Responsibility – Department of Community Development; Housing
Coordinator
Quantified Objective – An average of 1 new second unit per year (total of 6 units -
  4 very low-income and 2 low-income units
Program No. 9: Promotion of Energy and Water Conservation to Existing
Residents and in City Sponsored Housing Projects
The purpose of this program is to educate residents about energy and water
conservation and provide them with resources to retrofit their homes. This program will
also be used for City sponsored housing projects. In addition, City sponsored housing
projects will be required to exceed Title 24 requirements for energy conservation. The
City will consider the following as components of this program:

                          Sub-standard paved widths vary from 48‘ to 82‘, with the narrowest section (48‘) occurring across the
    Arrow Highway         San Gabriel River. A 60‘ paved width can be found between 215 and 1215 E. Buena Vista, and again,
                          on both sides of the river. Several locations of 70‘+ widths are also prevalent
                          Pavement widths vary from 42‘ crossing the San Gabriel River, from 57‘- 2‘ on either side of the bridge,
    Foothill Boulevard    and up to 82‘ for the remainder of its length through the City. A 100‘ ROW is fairly consistent but it is
                          unclear regarding the ROW near and over bridge.
                          The three narrowest segments (60‘-62‘ wide pavement) are located between Ballentine Pl. and
                          Queenside Dr., between Olive St. and Calle de Paseo, and between Calle del Norte and Arrow
    Irwindale Avenue      Highway. Otherwise, the roadway‘s pavement widths range from 80‘ to 88‘, with ROW‗s mostly meeting
                          or exceeding the 100‘ standard except for: the Olive/Calle de Paseo and Calle del Norte/Arrow Hwy.
                          The roadway segment in front of the Civic Center has a 65‘-70‘ ROW, although the pavement is 80‘.
                          From Peck Road to the 605 Freeway, the roadway has a pavement width of 78‘-80. However, from the
                          river to Arrow Highway, the pavement widths decrease to between 28‘ and 38‘. The roadway segment
                          between the freeway and the river is 67‘ wide. The right-of-ways in along Live Oak are all as required,

                          Highway, where the ROW varies from 25‘ to 94‘ due to Santa Fe Dam boundaries and the ROW from
                          the dam to Baldwin Park.
                          This majority of this roadway maintains the recommended 100‘ of ROW but only 72‘ of paved surface

                         In the vicinity of Live Oak Avenue and Longden Avenue, on the south side of Live Oak there are parcels
                         that do not have street access and are used as storage yards served by access easements. A roadway

                         that may consist of extending Longden eastward, perhaps ultimately as far as the Irwindale Speedway,
                         could provide this area with the needed access.
                         North of Arrow Highway, 4th Street is a partially constructed street that serves a business park on the east
                         side of the street. West of 4th Street west of Arrow Highway towards Santa Fe Dam is an old industrial area
   Fourth St.            that consists of landlocked parcels and various easements and old railroad spurs. This area extends
                         northerly to the back yard area of Davis Wire. Most of the land area is occupied by yard uses, including
                         truck yards that serve the sand and gravel industry.
                         Situated against the interchange of the I-210/I-605 Freeways and the City of Duarte, this area is mostly
                         landlocked properties. This area is comprised of mini-storage businesses, yards and nursery uses along

                         businesses that could take advantage of the freeway exposure.
                         This roadway intersects with Foothill Boulevard/Huntington Drive and with a potential extension southerly
   Encanto Dr.
                         into this area parcels within this area could be redeveloped with more viable uses.
                         These two local residential streets are narrow, uncompleted cul-de-sacs and both are in need of being

                         This is a substandard street which required the installation of a traffic signal installed on Arrow Highway to
   Morada Street         adequately protect the street‘s residents and users. The street is impacted by a sight distance barrier at its
                         intersection with Arrow Highway.
                         This street is a cul-de-sac that serves local businesses and the industrial park located to the north.
                         However, to the east is a landlocked property that lies adjacent to the I-210 Freeway, an excellent site for a
   Camino De La

   Cantera
                         Azusa. If Camino De La Cantera were extended easterly it could cross this site and connect with the
                         Costco Center in the City of Azusa.
                         North of the development on Montoya Street is the Metro Rail lines and then the Kinkaid South Pit lies
   Montoya St.           adjacent to the south side of the 1-210 Freeway. This site is directly south of the Camino de La Cantera
                         site discussed above. This property (Kinkaid South Pit) has direct freeway exposure.
