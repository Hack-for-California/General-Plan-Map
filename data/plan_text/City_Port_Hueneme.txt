2013-2021 Housing Element
1.	Introduction
The Housing Element establishes City housing policies for the 2013-2021 planning period. It guides City officials in decision making and sets forth an action program to implement the housing goals. This Housing Element is intended to direct residential development and preservation in a manner consistent with the overall requirements concerning state housing law.
1.1	Purpose of the Element
The Land Use Element is concerned with housing in a location and density context while the Housing Element identifies housing programs aimed at meeting the identified housing needs of the resident population. The Port Hueneme Housing Element includes the identification of strategies and programs that focus on:
1)	Conserving and improving existing affordable units;
2)	Providing adequate affordable housing sites;
3)	Assisting in the development of affordable housing;
4)	Removing governmental constraints; and
5)	Promoting equal housing opportunities.
The Housing Element Technical Report provides background information to the Element and is a supporting document for the Element.
1.2	Scope and Context of Element
The Housing Element sets forth housing goals and policies for Port Hueneme. Specific housing programs that will implement these goals and policies are identified in the section entitled Housing Plan which follows the Goals and Policies.
The California Legislature recognizes the role of the local general plans and particularly the housing element, in implementing statewide housing goals to provide decent and sound housing for all persons. Furthermore, the Legislature stresses continuing efforts toward providing affordable housing for all income groups. The major concerns of the Legislature with regard to the preparation of housing elements are:
•	Recognition by local governments of their responsibility in contributing to the attainment of State housing goals;
•	Preparation and implementation of City and County housing elements which coordinate with State and Federal efforts in achieving State housing goals;
•	Participation by local jurisdictions in determining efforts required to attain State housing goals; and
•	Cooperation between local governments to address regional housing needs.

The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) sets forth specifics regarding the scope and content of housing elements prepared by cities and counties.
1.3	Public Participation
Section 65583 (c)(6)(B) of the California Government Code states that "The local government shall make diligent effort to achieve public participation of all the economic segments of the community in the development of the housing element and the program shall describe this effort." Public participation played an important role in the formulation of Port Hueneme's housing goals and policies.

Public Hearings
A public hearing was held before the City Council on July 15, 2013 to review the Draft Housing Element. To publicize the meeting, the City advertised in the local newspaper and City website. Special invitations were sent to community stakeholders, developers, service providers, and other interested parties. No public comments were offered at the City Council hearing.
Following review of the draft Housing Element by HCD, a public hearing was held before the City Council on September 16, 2013 for the adoption of the Final Housing Element. To solicit community input, the public hearing was advertised in the local newspaper and City website. Notification about the public hearing was sent to housing developers, service providers, and other interested parties, including those who attended the previous public hearing.
1.4	Relationship to Other General Plan Elements

2.	Housing Goals and Policies
This section of the Housing Element articulates the City's goals and policies for addressing a number of important housing-related issues in Port Hueneme. Five major issue areas are addressed in this Element:
•	Maintain the supply of sound, affordable housing through conservation and rehabilitation of housing;
•	Ensure that a broad range of housing types are provided to meet the needs of both existing and future residents;
•	Increase opportunities for homeownership;
•	Remove constraints to the development of affordable housing; and
•	Promote equal opportunity of housing choice for all residents.
Each issue area and the corresponding goals and policies are identified and discussed in the following section.
Maintenance and Conservation of Existing Housing
Approximately 75 percent of the City's housing units are over 30 years old. In 2013 the City conducted a focused housing conditions survey, which found approximately 5 percent of units in targeted survey area were in need of moderate rehabilitation, and less than 1 percent were in need of major rehab or were considered to be so deteriorated as to be unsuitable for rehabilitation. Port Hueneme will continue to work through its Residential Rehabilitation Loan Program and Home Maintenance Incentive Rebate Program to ensure that aging and substandard housing units are rehabilitated and units that are currently sound continue to be maintained. The City will also strive to conserve the existing low-income housing stock as affordable housing.
Goal 1.0: Maintain and Enhance the Quality of Residential Neighborhoods in Port Hueneme.
Policy 1.1: Encourage the rehabilitation of substandard residential properties by homeowners and landlords.
Policy 1.2: Continue to utilize the City's code enforcement program to bring substandard units into compliance with City codes and to improve overall housing quality and conditions in Port Hueneme.
Policy 1.3: Work to preserve restricted low-income housing in the City that is at risk of converting to non-low income use.
Policy 1.4: Encourage the rehabilitation of existing housing to include energy conservation improvements.

2013-2021 Housing Element
Housing Opportunities
Port Hueneme encourages the construction of new housing units that offer a wide range of housing types to ensure that an adequate housing supply is available to meet the existing and future needs. The current housing stock consists of a mix of renter/owner units (51 percent owners and 49 percent renters) and a variety of housing types, including 2,648 single-family detached units, 2,371 single-family attached units, and 3,103 multi-family units. Continuing to provide a variety of housing in terms of tenure and unit type (single-family, multi-family, etc.), cost and style will allow the City to fulfill a variety of housing needs.
Goal 2.0: Encourage the Adequate Provision of Housing by Location, Type of Unit and Price to
Meet the Existing and Future Needs of Port Hueneme Residents.
Policy 2.1: Provide a variety of residential development opportunities in the City including small-lot single-family homes, moderate-density townhomes, high-density condominiums and apartments, and mixed-use developments to fulfill regional housing needs.
Policy 2.2: Encourage both the private and public sectors to produce or assist in the production of housing with particular emphasis on housing affordable to lower-income households, military families, the disabled, elderly, large families, and female-headed households.
Policy 2.3: Require that housing constructed expressly for low-income households not be concentrated in any single area of the City. Encourage housing built for low-income households to have on average the same number of bedrooms as other non-inclusionary units in a housing development.
Policy 2.4: Encourage the development of new residential units to be accessible to disabled persons or adaptable for conversion to accessibility.
Policy 2.5: Encourage the development of new housing units designated for the elderly and disabled persons to be in close proximity to public transportation and community services.
Policy 2.6: Encourage the use of rehabilitation loans for room additions to help alleviate overcrowded conditions and encourage the development of new units with three bedrooms to accommodate large families.
Policy 2.7: Encourage new residential development to utilize the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) rating system or similar design and performance measures and Ahwahnee principles to promote energy conservation.

Home Ownership
The option of home ownership in Southern California has become a privilege which is often not available to low-income households. Rising construction costs, limited land supply, and high coastal land values have contributed to the cost of housing in Port Hueneme. As a result of the elimination of its Redevelopment Agency in 2012, the City's efforts to assist low- and moderate-income first-time buyers were curtailed. The Redevelopment Agency was the primary source of funds for the home buyer program. The City continues the program in a very limited way utilizing a CalHome grant that is restricted to low-income first-time buyers.
Goal 3.0: Provide Increased Opportunities for Home Ownership.
Policy 3.1: Assist in the development of affordable ownership housing for lower-and moderate-income residents.
Policy 3.2: Provide favorable home purchasing options to lower-income first-time homebuyers through the CalHome program.
Removal of Constraints on Housing Development
Governmental and non-governmental constraints to development can impede both supply and affordability of housing. Certain governmental constraints can be minimized, such as development standards and fees, to facilitate new construction.
Goal 4.0: Remove Governmental Constraints on Housing Development.
Policy 4.1: Continue to implement the State-mandated density bonus law to provide for increased densities in exchanges for a portion of the project's units being reserved for lower- and moderate-income households, as well as for seniors.
Policy 4.2: Address governmental constraints to the provision of housing for persons with special needs, including seniors, disabled, female-headed households, large households, farmworkers, homeless, and military families.
Policy 4.3: Continue coordination of public works and engineering with planning and building functions to expedite project review.
Policy 4.4: Allow reduced development fees and modified development standards for affordable housing and development under the density bonus program.
Policy 4.5: Continue to encourage second residential units as a means of providing low-cost rental housing for small households.

Accessibility of Housing
To make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community, the City must ensure equal and fair housing opportunities are available to all residents.
Goal 5.0: Promote Equal Opportunity for All Residents to Reside in Housing of Their Choice.
Policy 5.1: Prohibit discrimination in the sale or rental of housing with regard to race, color, national origin, ancestry, religion, disability, income, gender, age, marital status, familial status, sexual orientation, source of income, and any other arbitrary factors.
Policy 5.2: Continue to participate in the Ventura County Fair Housing Program.

3.	Housing Plan
The previous section of the Housing Element sets forth Port Hueneme's goals and policies for housing production, conservation, and rehabilitation. This Housing Plan presents the specific programs the City intends to implement to achieve its housing goals, along with quantified objectives for the 2013-2021 planning period.
3.1 Housing Programs
The Housing Element Technical Report describes the housing needs of the City's current and projected population, as well as the specific needs resulting from the potential deterioration of older units, lack of affordable housing for lower-income groups and persons with special housing needs. The goals and policies contained in this Housing Plan address the identified housing needs. These goals and policies are implemented through a series of housing programs.
The City's overall housing program strategy for addressing its housing needs has been defined according to the following issue areas:
•	Conserving and improving the condition of the existing stock of affordable housing;
•	Providing adequate sites to achieve a variety and diversity of housing;
•	Assisting in the development of affordable housing;
•	Removing governmental constraints if necessary; and
•	Promoting equal housing opportunity
This section provides a description of each housing program and future program objectives for the planning period of October 2013 through October 2021.
Conserving and Improving Existing Affordable Housing
The goal of housing preservation is to protect the existing quality and investment in housing to avoid a degree of physical deterioration that will subsequently require more extensive efforts later to restore quality and value.
In addition to maintaining the City's existing housing stock, Port Hueneme must also conserve and improve affordable housing units in the community. The high cost of housing causes financial hardship for many individuals, especially the elderly, lower-income renters, and first-time homebuyers. The preservation of affordable housing is important in ensuring adequate housing opportunities for all residents.
1.	Residential Rehabilitation Loan Program (RRLP)
This program provides financial means to conserve and improve the housing stock in the City's mature neighborhoods, to eradicate substandard housing conditions, and to eliminate and prevent slums and blighting influences, principally for the benefit of low- and moderate-income
City of Port Hueneme

individuals and families. Housing rehabilitation efforts are targeted within the Neighborhood Strategy Area and the Bolker Park single family homes.
Eligible properties under this program are: 1) at least ten years old; 2) not a part of a Planned Unit Development governed by a homeowner's association; and 3) improved with no more than four units on a single parcel. Property improvements that correct code violations and deferred property maintenance have first priority for funding. Owners may also undertake general property improvements, energy conservation improvements, and in the case of overcrowding, bedroom and bathroom additions.
A typical project encompasses interior improvements such as electrical and plumbing work, heating and ventilation improvements, kitchen and bathroom remodeling, painting, and floor coverings, and exterior improvements such as roofing, stucco, windows, doors, driveways, garage doors, and front yard landscaping. There has been a weakening of RRLP loan activity in recent years. Declining equity resulting from the 2007-2008 mortgage crisis has likely been a contributing factor.
2013-2021 Objectives:
•	Assist 24 households (three households annually).
•	Annually explore other funding possibilities to expand the program implementation.
•	Continue to promote program via the City's website, the Hueneme Magazine, lawn signs at project sites, and targeted mass mailings of City brochures.

2.	Home Maintenance Incentive Rebate Program (HMIRP)
This program is a system of cash grants paid to eligible residential property owners who undertake certain property improvements in accordance with the City's Neighborhood Preservation Program Guidelines. The amount of each grant is based upon a percentage of the total verified amount spent by the owner on eligible property improvements. Eligible work under HMIRP is limited to improvements that are visible from the public right-of-way and enhance the exterior appearance of the property. Housing rehabilitation efforts are targeted within the Neighborhood Strategy Area and the Bolker Park single-family homes. Eligible properties under this program are: 1) at least ten years old; and 2) not a part of a Planned Unit Development governed by a homeowner's association.

3.	Acquisition/Rehabilitation/Conversion of Rental Housing
Many duplex units in the City are being used as rental housing. As a strategy to address overpayment and overcrowding issues among lower- and moderate-income households, the City has taken advantage of opportunities to purchase and rehabilitate two apartment buildings and several dilapidated duplex units listed or offered for sale and rents these units at affordable rates to lower- and moderate-income households. The rehabilitated units may be deed-restricted as affordable housing prior to conveyance to private ownership.
At this time, it is uncertain how the dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency in 2012 will affect this program over the next eight years. If the City, as Housing Successor Agency to the Redevelopment Agency, retains sufficient resources after the liquidation of the Redevelopment Agency, opportunity purchases may be pursued in the 2013-2021 period, particularly in the Jane Drive/Ann Avenue area, which has been identified by the City Council as a priority neighborhood for this type of activity.
2013-2021 Objectives:
•	Coordinate acquisition/rehabilitation/conversion efforts of properties at Pleasant Valley/San Pedro (Site A) to assist in the creation of an affordable housing block, and also the Jane Drive/Ann Avenue area.
•	Oversee the conversion and rehabilitation of the dilapidated 86-room Surfside Motel to 65 units affordable to lower-income tenants and monitor the developer's compliance with affordability covenants and the City's Crime Free Multi-Housing Program.
•	Encourage the use of LEED® or similar standards and Ahwahnee principles in the improvement or reconstruction of housing during the application review process. In publicly-financed projects, implement where practicable energy saving appliances, fixtures, and construction methods. A point of contact to facilitate meeting energy efficiency standards, technical assistance, and resources is the Ventura County Regional Energy Alliance.

4.	Code Enforcement/Property Maintenance
Port Hueneme adopted its Property Maintenance Ordinance and Uniform Housing Code to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City and to provide an orderly means of eliminating conditions and blighting influences that cause neighborhood deterioration. Code compliance is pursued through a combination of regular neighborhood canvassing, systematic inspections, the Crime-Free Multi-Housing Program, and response to citizen complaints. Particular emphasis is placed on property maintenance, landlord training, resident safety, eradication of substandard building conditions and abatement of inoperative and abandoned vehicles. The City employs a cooperative approach to code enforcement and successfully processes approximately 600 violations annually. The majority of these housing units attain compliance without necessitating legal action.
When a code violation is identified, the responsible party (owner or occupant) will be notified of the alleged violation either by telephone, mail or personal contact. For violations related to building or site conditions, brochures informing the responsible party of financial assistance through Home Maintenance Incentive Rebate Program and Residential Rehabilitation Loan Program are sent along with the first notice. Where a residential property is cited with code violation(s) and the housing unit is considered overcrowded, the occupants will be advised of available rental assistance and rehabilitation loans available for room additions.
2013-2021 Objectives:
•	Continue to connect code enforcement activities with the City's rehabilitation assistance.
•	Conduct housing condition surveys periodically to determine the nature and extent of housing deterioration and rehabilitation assistance needs.

5.	Conversion of Existing and Future Affordable Units
The Housing Element Technical Report contains an inventory of affordable housing projects in the City. The City has one privately-owned low-income housing project - Casa Pacifica, Casa Pacifica is a 90-unit project, with ten units designed for households with at least one physically disabled person. The project was assisted under HUD Section 221(d)(4) program and has a project-based Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher contract with the Housing Authority. The property owner renewed its Section 8 Family contract with HUD until 2031, therefore this project is not at risk of conversion during the next ten years. Although no affordable units are at risk of conversion, the City will continue to monitor existing affordable units and seek to preserve these units whenever feasible.

2013-2021 Objectives:
•	Continue to monitor existing affordable units and seek to preserve units that may be at risk of conversion in the future.

Providing Adequate Sites to Achieve a Variety and Diversity of Housing
The City will continue to explore opportunities for expanding the variety and diversity of its housing stock in order to address the varied housing needs of all socioeconomic segments of the community. Specifically, the City will ensure that it maintains adequate capacity to accommodate its share of the regional housing needs.
6.	Provision of Adequate Sites
A key element in satisfying the housing needs of all Port Hueneme residents is to provide adequate sites for the development of all types, tenure, sizes and prices of housing. Both the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance identify where housing may be located, thereby affecting the supply of land available for housing. Port Hueneme has limited undeveloped land remaining in its jurisdiction. A significant portion of future residential growth will therefore be accommodated through infill and conversion of existing uses.
A variety of residential types are provided in Port Hueneme, ranging from single-family residential (seven units per acre) to multi-family residential and mixed use (25 units per acre), with higher densities achievable through the City's density bonus provisions. Future population and residential growth in the City will likely occur in the former redevelopment area, which encompasses approximately one-quarter of the City's total civilian land area. The Housing Element Technical Report identifies key development sites within the redevelopment area for single-family, multi-family and mixed use residential. The City recognizes that the costs for coastal land acquisition, site assembly, relocation of displaced residents/businesses, and construction/development will likely exceed anticipated revenues. When feasible, the City will offer a variety of financial and/or regulatory incentives to facilitate development of new housing.
2013-2021 Objectives:
•	Continue to maintain a residential sites inventory to accommodate the City's Regional Housing Needs Assessment of 2 units (1 very-low-income and 1 low-income) for the current planning period.
•	Strategically acquire properties at Pleasant Valley Road/San Pedro Street as they become available on the market to create an affordable housing development, potentially consolidating with the five vacant lots already owned by the City acting as Housing Successor to the former Redevelopment Agency.
•	Pursue mixed use developments in the former Central Community Redevelopment Project Area. Facilitate the development of rental housing affordable to lower-income households when feasible.
City of Port Hueneme
13
2013-2021 Housing Element
•	Encourage lot consolidation by working with developers to explore lot consolidation opportunities and site designs to maximize lot use.
•	Annually monitor the residential sites inventory. If sites identified for lower-income housing are not being used for affordable housing, take proactive actions to identify additional sites to replenish the sites inventory and take actions to incentivize affordable housing.

Funding Sources:	General Funds; Housing Successor Agency (to the former Redevelopment
Agency) Funds
Assisting in the Development of Affordable Housing
New construction is a major source of housing for prospective homeowners and renters but generally requires public sector support for the creation of units affordable to lower-income households. With limited vacant land remaining for development in Port Hueneme, residential construction has slowed since the 1980s. The following programs assist in the development of affordable housing in Port Hueneme.
7.	Inclusionary Housing Policy in the Coastal Area
Pursuant to provisions under the Coastal Act, the City has established an inclusionary housing policy pertaining to housing development in the Coastal Zone. Through the Inclusionary Housing Policy, the City has facilitated the development of affordable housing for the workforce. For example, the John Laing Homes project at N. Surfside Drive and E. Hueneme Road will transfer nine townhomes to the City of Port Hueneme as rentals affordable to lower-income households, offering affordable homes suitable for families.
As a condition for approval on a Coastal Development Permit, residential developers must, where feasible, include affordable housing units in or within three miles of the Coastal Zone. Density bonuses or other incentives that can reduce development costs may be granted for developers. As an alternative to constructing low- and moderate-income units, Port Hueneme allows the option of an in-lieu fee currently set at $26,500 per unit on 25 percent of the units in a residential development in the Coastal Zone. The fee collected is used primarily to fund the City's affordable housing programs for down payment assistance and rehabilitation.
2013-2021 Objectives:
•	Continue to implement the inclusionary policy regarding housing in the Coastal Zone to fulfill Coastal Act requirements.
•	Encourage the creation and conservation of affordable housing in the City.

8.	Density Bonus
Consistent with state law, a local jurisdiction must offer density bonus incentives for senior housing projects and projects that reserve a portion of the units as housing affordable to very-low-, low-, and moderate-income households. In conjunction with the density bonus, the jurisdiction must also offer incentives or regulatory concessions to facilitate affordable housing development. Incentives and concessions considered by the City include modified development standards and reduced fees. The City updated its Density Bonus ordinance in 2011/12 to reflect current state law.
To qualify for a density bonus and concessions or other incentives, the developer of a proposed housing project (at least five units) must provide housing units affordable to very-low-, low- or moderate-income households, housing for seniors, donate land, and/or construct a child care facility. The City will continue to promote the use of density bonus to facilitate affordable housing production.
2013-2021 Objectives:
•	Continue to offer density bonus incentives to promote affordable housing development. Inform development applicants of opportunities for density increases in exchange for affordable units.
•	Provide materials about the City's density bonus program on City website; make information available at City Hall.

9.	Second Unit Ordinance
The Port Hueneme Zoning Ordinance defines a second housing unit as one which is attached to the primary dwelling on a lot zoned for single-family residential use and which is intended for occupancy by not more than two persons. The unit includes permanent provision for living, sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation.
The benefits of second units include additional income to homeowners, allowing homeowners who require companionship or non-specialized assistance to remain in their homes; facilitating family ties between generations; reducing construction costs by utilizing existing infrastructure; and providing low-cost rental housing.
Second units are of particular benefit in a community like Port Hueneme where limited land remains for new construction and second units can be integrated within existing single-family neighborhoods. In addition, many of the City's lower-income elderly reside in older neighborhoods, indicating that second units can help address the needs of elderly homeowners, as well as renters.

2013-2021 Housing Element
2013-2021 Objectives:
•	Continue to implement and promote the Second Unit Ordinance to encourage second unit construction.
•	Continue to provide technical assistance regarding placement of unit and compliance with City development standards.
•	Continue to provide materials about the City's second unit program on City website; make information available at City Hall.

10.	Housing Choice Vouchers
The Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers program extends rental subsidies to very-low-income families and elderly who spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent. The voucher recipients are able to locate their own housing and the program subsidizes a portion of the rent (typically equals the difference between 30 percent of the recipient's income and the payment standard established by HUD).
The Housing Authority administers the voucher program in the City and currently, 268 households are being assisted under the program. The program has a waiting list of 400 households. Households at the bottom of the waiting list can expect to wait 4 to 5 years for housing if they are Port Hueneme residents.
Five-year Program Goals: The Housing Authority will continue to pursue additional allocation of vouchers from HUD and will encourage apartment owners to list available rental units with the Housing Authority.
2013-2021 Objectives:
•	Continue to pursue additional voucher allocations to assist an increased number of households.
•	Encourage apartment owners to accept vouchers.
•	Continue to promote program via City website, the Hueneme Magazine, and other City brochures.
Responsible Agencies: Housing Authority
Funding Sources:	HUD Allocations
11.	Conventional Public Housing
The Housing Authority owns and operates 90 public housing units, 30 two- and three-bedroom family units at Hueneme Village and 60 studios and one-bedroom units for seniors and disabled persons at the Mar Vista Apartments. The majority of residents are extremely-low- or very-low-income. As the HUD operating subsidy was not sufficient to operate the public housing programs,
City of Port Hueneme
16
2013-2021 Housing Element
the Port Hueneme Redevelopment Agency previously supplemented the Housing Authority budget.
By itself, the HUD Capital Fund Program (CFP) is also insufficient to maintain the units. In recent years, all Hueneme Village units have been renovated using a combination of CFP and CDBG funds. The Mar Vista Apartments has undergone an exterior facelift recently funded with a CDBG allocation and a major re-plumbing was completed utilizing both CDBG and Housing Set-Aside funding.
2013-2021 Objectives:
• Where feasible, continue to balance the Housing Authority's budgets for both the operating costs and capital improvements with other funds such as CDBG and Housing Successor funds.

12.	Home Buyer Assistance Program (HBAP)
Down payment assistance for low-income first-time homebuyers is funded through a CalHome grant. Deferred payment second mortgages up to $40,000 or 20 percent of the purchase price or appraised value (whichever is lower) have a simple interest rate of 3 percent. . Loan proceeds may only be used toward the purchase of a single-family home, condominium, or townhome located within the City of Port Hueneme.
2013-2021 Objectives:
•	Assist two low-income households annually with home purchase until funds are exhausted. There are sufficient funds for only about seven loans. Thereafter new loans can be made to the extent that there is sufficient program income from loan repayments.
•	Continue to promote program via City website, the Hueneme Magazine, and other City brochures.

13.	Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC)
Port Hueneme is a participating jurisdiction in the Ventura County Regional MCC Program. The MCC Program is targeted to low- and moderate-income first-time home buyers. The MCC is a tax credit that increases the amount a buyer can qualify to borrow and increases the buyer's take-home pay by reducing federal income taxes. The MCC is registered with the IRS and continues to reduce federal taxes each year the buyer continues to own and occupy the home. MCCs may be used with FHA, VA, or conventional financing. No bond-backed financing such as CalHFA or Cal Vet loans may be used with an MCC.
2013-2021 Objectives:
•	Continue to participate in the MCC program and promote program via City website and publications.
•	Continue to promote program via City website, the Hueneme Magazine, and other City brochures.

RE: Review of the City of Port Hueneme’s 5th Cycle (2013-2021) Adopted Housing Element
Thank you for submitting the City of Port Hueneme’s housing element adopted September 16, 2013 and received for review on September 23, 2013. Pursuant to Government Code (GC) Section 65585(h), the Department is reporting the results of its review.
The Department is pleased to find the adopted housing element in full compliance with State housing element law (Article 10.6 of the GC). The Department’s review found the adopted element to be substantially the same as the revised draft element reviewed by the Department on September 11, 2013 and determined to comply with statutory requirements.
The Department is pleased to inform the City of Port Hueneme that 4th cycle housing element compliance meets one of the threshold requirements of the Housing Related Parks (HRP) Program which rewards local governments for approving housing affordable to lower-income households. The HRP Program, funded by Proposition 1C, provides grant funds to eligible local governments for every qualifying unit permitted since 2010. Grant awards can be used to fund park-related capital asset projects. The HRP Program 2013 Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA), released October 2, 2013, announced the availability of $25 million in grant funds to eligible applicants. Applications are due January 22, 2014. More information about the HRP Program is available on the Department’s website at http://www.hcd.ca.gov/hpd/hrpp/.
The Department wishes the City of Port of Hueneme success in implementing its housing element and looks forward to following its progress through the General Plan annual progress reports pursuant to GC Section 65400.

CIRCULATION/INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
Introduction The Circulation Element is one of seven mandated elements of the General Plan and is intended to guide the development of the city's transportation system in a manner that is compatible with the Land Use Element. A well-planned transportation system is important to a city's economic and social well-being, and the State of California has mandated the adoption of a citywide Circulation Element since 1955. To help meet future transportation demands and achieve balanced growth, the Circulation Element includes specific goals and policies and implementation measures.
Purpose of the Element: The purpose of the Circulation Element is to provide a safe, effective, and efficient transportation system for the city. The current State mandate for a Circulation Element states that the General Plan shall include:
"...a circulation element consisting of the general location for proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the plan."
The "General Plan Guidelines" (Section 65302 of the California Government Code), published by the State of California, Office of Planning and Research, suggests that the policies and plan proposals of the Circulation Element should:
•	Coordinate the transportation and circulation system with planned land uses;
•	Promote the efficient transport of goods and the safe and effective movement of all segments of the population;
•	Make efficient use of existing transportation; and,
•	Protect environmental quality and promote the wise and equitable use of economic and natural resources.

Scope of Content: The Circulation Element contains summary information on the existing and future conditions of the City’s transportation system. Goals and policies have been created to ensure that all components of the circulation system will meet the future needs of the City of Port Hueneme.
To meet the General Plan Circulation Element policy objectives, the Element's Plan section identifies the transportation improvements needed to provide adequate capacity for future land uses. It also addresses potential demand management strategies and mass transit services. In addition, the Circulation Plan establishes a hierarchy of transportation routes with specific development standards described for each category of roadway.
Related Plans and Programs: As part of the Southern California region, Port Hueneme is affected by regional plans and programs that are related directly or indirectly to transportation. Examples of these are Southern California Association of Government's (SCAG) Regional Mobility Plan and Growth Management Plan, and the Air Quality Management Plan prepared by the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD). These plans are intended to work in concert to reduce areawide traffic congestion and air pollutant levels. Planning strategies focus on reducing automobile and truck traffic on the regional transportation network, as well as at local levels.
Port Hueneme has included in this General Plan relevant policies and programs which reflect and respond to SCAG's and VCAPCD's regional goals. Policies in the Circulation Element are aimed at reducing traffic congestion, while Con-servation/Open Space/Environmental Resources Element programs are aimed at improving regional air quality. The policy with respect to transportation demand management (TDM) specifically addresses VCAPCD regulations regarding increased vehicle occupancy targets as a means of reducing pollutants.

The Ventura County Congestion Management Program (CMP) is an important program to coordinate traffic improvements throughout Ventura County. The CMP was prepared to meet State requirements in order for the County to continue receiving gas tax funds made available through the passage of Proposition 111, which passed in June 1990. The CMP is the first effort to manage traffic congestion by coordinating the many transportation, land use, and air quality programs in Ventura County. Because of the complexity in measuring and meeting traffic level of service standards, the CMP requirements for the Port of Hueneme Deficiency Plan are addressed in this element, see the final section of the element, "Deficiency Plan."

Circulation Issues A comprehensive network of local roadways and public transit routes serves the transportation needs of Port Hueneme and surrounding jurisdictions. The following paragraphs identify circulation issues in Port Hueneme. The "Goals and Policies" section of this element outlines the City's long-term aims and strategies for addressing these issues and the "Circulation Plan" section details programs the City will undertake toward fulfilling its goals.
Level of Service: The term "Level of Service" (LOS) describes the quality of traffic flow. LOS ratings range between A and F, depending on the efficiency of a particular roadway. A rating between A and C indicates that the roadway is operating efficiently. Minor delays are possible on an arterial with a Level of Service D. Level E represents traffic volumes at or near the capacity of the highway, resulting in possible delays and unstable flow. Level F is characterized by stop-and-go traffic with long delays.
As part of the General Plan update, level of service ratings were assigned to seven intersections in Port Hueneme and four in Oxnard. Traffic operations at these intersections are efficient (LOS C or better) during the morning peak hour traffic. Conditions deteriorate during the afternoon peak hour with one intersection in the City operating at LOS D.

Circulation Plan
This section of the Circulation Element describes the location and extent of circulation facilities and services, and identifies general standards that apply to each. Relationships of the Plan to land use policy are then discussed followed by implementation programs for the Element.
Roadway Facility Designations: The roadway system in Port Hueneme is defined using a hierarchy of roadway types which differentiate the function of each roadway link. Referred to as "facility-type" categories, they include three classifications ranging from "Major" highway with the highest capacity through "Local Street" with the lowest capacity. (See Figure C-l) A brief description of each facility-type follows:
Major Highways - These are primary circulation facilities which distribute and collect freeway bound traffic, accommodate intra-city trips, as well as serve other medium distance movements. Port Hueneme Road (east/west) Ventura Road (north/south) and Channel Islands Boulevard (east/west) are considered major highways.
Secondary Highways - These streets distribute and collect traffic which is generated in the area circumscribed by major highways. Pleasant Valley Road is the only secondary highway in the City, although on busy weekends and holidays, Surfside Drive may serve as a secondary highway for beach related traffic.
Local Streets - These streets provide local access and comprise the remainder of the streets within the City.

The desirable goal for every roadway in the Circulation Element is that it carry the existing and future volume of traffic at the desired level of service. To achieve this requirement, variation in design is expected, depending on factors such as the capacity needs and the adjacent land uses. Such variations will involve on-street parking, sidewalks versus pathways, bicycle lanes or paths, extra parkway or median landscape treatment, etc. For that reason, the facility-type descriptions offer general guidelines rather than detailed design specifications.
Circulation System: The goals and policies included in this Element emphasize the importance of developing a circulation system that is capable of serving both existing and future residents while preserving community values and character.
Roadways included in the planned street system are shown in Figure C-2. They are classified according to their facility-type designation. The map indicates all of the designated major highways, secondary highways and local streets.
Roadway Improvements: The goals and policies included in this Element emphasize the importance of developing a circula tion system that is capable of serving both existing and future residents while preserving community values and character. The City has developed a program of public improvements to adequately serve the anticipated future development, including the effects of development outside the City. The City will work with the City of Oxnard, Caltrans, and other agencies to share costs of improvements needed based on regional growth. Improvements to the existing circulation system include:
•	Channel Islands Boulevard/Victoria Avenue - Provide an additional westbound through lane and an additional eastbound left turn lane.
•	Channel Islands Boulevard/Patterson Road-USNCBC -Convert the existing westbound right turn lane to a westbound through-right lane. This can be accomplished by implementing striping modifications with minor signal modifications.

•	Wooley Road/Ventura Road - Significant modifications would be required at this intersection. In the northbound direction, add one additional left turn lane, one additional through lane, and a right turn only lane. In the southbound direction, add one additional left turn lane and one additional through lanes. In the eastbound direction, provide one additional left turn lane and convert the existing right turn lane to a through-right lane. In the westbound direction, add one additional left turn lane and a right turn only lane with an overlap. These improvements will be difficult to implement due to the proximity of an existing drainage channel adjacent to the intersection.
•	Channel Islands Boulevard/Ventura Road - In the northbound direction, provide a third left turn lane and a right turn only lane. In the southbound direction, provide an additional through lane. Provide a second left turn lane in the eastbound and westbound directions. Replace the eastbound right turn lane with a free right turn lane.
•	Sunkist Avenue-USNCBC/VenturaRoad - Convert the northbound paved shoulder area to a northbound through lane. This can be accomplished by restriping the roadway, with minor signal modifications.
•	Bard Road-USNCBC/Ventura Road- Convert the northbound paved shoulder area to a northbound through lane. This can be accomplished by restriping the roadway, with minor signal modifications.
•	Pleasant Valley Road/Saviers Boulevard - In the northbound direction, convert the existing through-right lane to a through lane and add a right turn only lane with an overlap. In the southbound direction, provide an additional left turn lane, convert the existing through-right lane to a through lane, and provide a right turn only lane with an overlap. In the eastbound direction, convert the existing through-right lane to a through lane and provide a right turn only lane.

• Port Hueneme Road/Saviers Boulevard - Many of the improvements associated with this intersection can be installed in conjunction with future development adjacent to the intersection. In the southbound direction, provide restriping to install an additional left-right lane. In the eastbound direction, provide an additional left turn lane and an additional through lane. In the westbound direction, provide an additional through lane, convert the existing through-right lane to a through lane, and provide an additional right turn only lane.
• Channel Islands Boulevard Corridor - Provide an additional westbound through lane and bike lane by widening the roadway from Ventura Road to Victoria Avenue.
• Ventura Road Corridor - Provide an additional northbound through lane by widening the roadway from Pleasant Valley Road to Channel Island Boulevards.
Preliminary cost estimates for circulation system improvements are found on Table C-2. Implementation of these measures will improve adverse levels of service (LOS) at all impacted intersections (i.e., LOS D, E, and F intersections) to LOS C.

Pedestrian and Bicycle Plan: Bubbling Springs Recreation Corridor serves as the City's primary pedestrian/bicycle pathway. This corridor includes one marked bicycle path and a lane system which links Bubbling Springs Park to the beach. This bicycle route, while marked, is not fully developed. There are no marked bicycle routes running parallel to the beach.
Major pedestrian activity is limited to usage of the Beach Park. Bubbling Springs Park and Moranda Park are not linked to the beach by pedestrian access routes.
Rail Plan: The southern portion of the City is traversed by a single-track railroad line which serves Port Hueneme Harbor and is maintained by the Ventura County Railway Company. The use of this rail line is sporadic and totally dependent on harbor related activities. On some days the line is not used, while on others one or two trains, with an average maximum length of four box or refrigeration cars unloads at a lemon warehouse in the harbor area. Railroad operations are restricted to between 7:00 AM and 10:00 PM; there are no nighttime operations.
Traffic on the Ventura County Railway could significantly increase with additional heavy industrial development in Oxnard or increased Port of Hueneme use.
Bus Plan: South Coast Area Transit (SCAT) organizes and monitors the regional bus transportation system in western Ventura County. SCAT developed as a result of a joint powers agreement between the Cities of San Buenaventura, Ojai, Oxnard and Port Hueneme in 1973. In 1977, the City of Santa Paula and County were added as participating members with Santa Paula discontinuing its membership in 1994. SCAT will continue to provide bus service to these communities.
Deficiency Plan: The draft Ventura County Congestion Management Program, 1993 (CMP) states that a "Deficiency Plan" is needed if a roadway section or intersection begins to operate at Level of Service (LOS) E or experiences a 4% or greater increase in the ratio of traffic volume to capacity. There is no such location in Port Hueneme (see Table C-l, page 5).

CONSERVATION/OPEN SPACE/ ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
Introduction California state planning law requires that every general
plan include an open space element (Section 65302(e)) and a conservation element (Government Code Section 65302(d)). The open space element emphasizes the preservation of open space land specifically utilized for the preservation of natural resources, managed production of natural resources, outdoor recreation, and the public health and safety. The conservation element deals primarily with the preservation of natural resources including a discussion of water, energy, and animal/plant life.
While air quality has not yet been made a mandatory General Plan element by the State of California, the Ventura County Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) contains specific requirements for air quality to be addressed by each municipal jurisdiction. This can be accomplished through development of a separate air quality element, or by integrating air quality as a sub-element within the appropriate sections of the General Plan or other documents.
Purpose of the Element: Open space to provide visual relief from urban congestion, to protect wildlife, to provide opportunities for recreation and to conserve resources is a high priority in Port Hueneme. This Element's purpose is to protect, conserve, and manage the City's natural and man-made open space resources.
The purpose of the Air Quality Sub-element is to provide guidelines and objectives for the City of Port Hueneme, consistent with the AQMP, to help improve local air quality conditions.

Scope and Content: Port Hueneme's Conservation/Open Space/Environmental Resources Element (COER) contains three sections: Issues Identification, Goals and Policies, and a Plan. Specific concerns, opportunities, and needs are examined in the Issues Identification section, formulating the base data to develop the element. Goals and policies are established to guide decision makers in future policy decisions regarding open space and conservation issues. The Plan provides specific measures to attain Port Hueneme's goals and policies.
Related Plans and Programs: A number of plans enacted through State legislation and other governmental bodies affect open space/conservation issues in Port Hueneme. A synopsis of relevant plans, programs, and other public policies follows.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Law and Guidelines: CEQA was adopted by the State Legislature in 1970 in response to a public mandate calling for a thorough environmental analysis of those projects that might adversely affect the environment. The provisions of the law, review procedures, and analysis of effects are described in the CEQA Law and Guidelines as amended. Proposed projects subject to CEQA must be evaluated for their potential effects on air quality, groundwater, water use, plant and animal life, energy consumption, and recreation. Other areas of environmental concern under CEQA, such as traffic and circulation, are closely linked with conservation issues (e.g. air quality). This Element's goals and policies will be applied on a project-by- project basis in accordance with CEQA.

Recreation, Park, and Open Space Standards and Guidelines (1983): The National Recreation and Park Association develops national standards for recreation, parks, and open space. Standards provide a national expression of recommended minimum facilities for communities, a guideline to determine land requirements for various types of parks, and a basis for relating recreational needs to location. These standards have generally been the most widely accepted and used standards of their type, especially by local governments.
Parks and Recreation Master Plan (1990): The Port Hueneme Parks and Recreation Master Plan provides primarily two types of information: a description of the existing recreation facilities and a plan to guide the future use and development of these facilities. The plan section outlines the physical improvements and maintenance that needs to occur at each facility, plus costs associated with each action. The report, although never adopted by the City council, provided significant information about the existing park system. As a result, the Master Plan was utilized as the base data source to create the parks and recreation portion of this element.
Urban Water Management Plan (1990): The City of Port Hueneme was required to prepare an Urban Water Management Plan as authorized by the Urban Water Management Planning Act. The Act requires that water purveyors utilizing more than 3,000 acre feet of water adopt an urban water management plan. The plan must include estimates of past, current, and projected water use; water conservation measures being practiced and those proposed; water sources and supply outlook; water management programs to implement in the next five years; and a discussion of the frequency and magnitude of supply deficiencies.

Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency Ordinance 5 (1990): Ordinance 5 requires all users of groundwater supplies, managed by the Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency, to reduce their pumping. The reduction is based on a formula requiring the agency to reduce their water consumption in 5% increments. Ultimately, each agency will achieve a 25% reduction in water consumption.
Evaluation of Alternative Future Water Supply Strategies (1992): This study evaluates alternative future water supply strategies to meet the City's water supply and quality goals. The alternatives arc evaluated on both economic and non-economic factors, including: project costs, cost-effectiveness, reliability, ease of implementation, and institutional issues.
Americans with Disabilities Act, Pub. L. 101-326 (1990): The Act provides comprehensive civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the areas of employment, public accommodations, State and local government services, and telecommunications.

Environmental Resources Inventory and Issues Identification
Open space lands are important for the preservation of natural resources, managed production of resources, outdoor recreation, and the public health and safety. This Element explores significant open space, recreation lands, and natural resources in the community.
Timber and Agricultural Resources: There are no timber or agricultural resources in Port Hueneme, so this element does not include a discussion of those issues.
Most of the trees in the City are imported normative species planted for shade and landscaping purposes. The City does not contain available land for large-scale agricultural production or livestock grazing. Long before urbanization, portions of the Port Hueneme area were used for agricultural purposes; however, all of the land so used has since been developed.

Biological Resources: Port Hueneme, surrounded by the City of Oxnard, a county island, and the Pacific Ocean, is approaching build-out with little vacant land remaining.
As a result, the only native biological resources are located within the undeveloped coastal area.
Terrestrial Biology: Port Hueneme is almost completely urbanized. The urban landscape includes non-native species of plants and smaller rodents and birds which have adapted to the city environment. However, the frequent disruptions caused by urban activities and frequent cultivation of plant life make these plant communities less than an ideal habitat for wild animals.
Due to the community's urban landscape, the coastal strand remains Port Hueneme's primary biological habitat. The beach, west of Parking Lot C at the terminus of Oceanview Drive, is characterized by a combination of public improvements and coastal strand. The improved portions of Hueneme Beach are vegetated by a variety of ornamental and non-native plant materials able to tolerate shoreline characteristics (unstable, dry, infertile substrate, persistent wind, high light, evaporation, and sea salt aerosol). The flat portion of the beach is devoid of terrestrial plants.
The portion of Hueneme Beach between the terminus of Oceanview Drive and the “J” Street and flood control channel is characterized by a combination of ruderal land, foredunes and backdunes, and coastal strand. Southern foredunes and backdunes are recognized by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) for their value as potential habitat for a variety of plant and wildlife. Southern foredunes are rated SI.1 by CDFG, the highest rating for preservation, while backdunes are rated slightly less at SI.2. Ruderal land, on the other hand, is not rated by CDFG and is composed chiefly of barren soil and nonnative weeds characteristic of historic and ongoing disturbances. As with the balance of Hueneme Beach Park, the sandy portions of the beach are devoid of terrestrial plants.

Several species of animals habitat the coastal strand, including the California legless lizard, California meadow mice, pocket gophers, and the cottontail and black-tailed hare. The coastal strand is also utilized by numerous bird species, especially gulls and certain shorebirds which spend long hours resting and/or feeding on the sandy beaches. Typical bird species found on the strand include pigeons, doves, blackbirds, starlings, certain sparrows, killdeer, homed larks, and gulls.
Several sensitive species are known to utilize or have been reportedly observed in the coastal strand, foredunes, backdunes, and watercourses at the southeasterly portion of Hueneme Beach Park (between the easterly terminus of Oceanview Drive and the “J” Street drainage canal). In addition, Hueneme Beach Park is adjacent to important plant and wildlife habitat in the Ormond Beach area of Oxnard. Sensitive plants that are known or reportedly occur in the wetlands of Ormond Beach include the salt marsh bird’s beak, Ventura marsh milk vetch and red sand verbena; sensitive wildlife includes the burrowing owl, California homed lark, California least tern, California brown pelican, American peregrine falcon, Belding’s savannah sparrow, Western snowy plover, Caspian tern, elegant tern, double-crested cormorant, black-shouldered kite, long-billed curlew, wandering skipper butterfly, southern California salt marsh shrew, black-tailed jackrabbit, globose dune beetle, salt marsh skipper and tidewater goby.
Marine Biology: The submarine topography immediately adjacent to the City is composed of a gently sloping, sandy bottom extending seaward approximately 1.5 miles to the 10-fathom line. Moving progressively deeper, a greater percent of mud is encountered, along with some shell fragments. The dominant submarine topographical feature of the area is Hueneme Canyon, a deepwater area approaching to within several hundred yards of shore.

The other important feature of this area is Port Hueneme itself, which was formerly an area of undisturbed wetlands supporting animal and plant associations. Its conversion into a usable port necessitated construction of wharves, breakwaters, and other structures which changed not only the harbor itself, but also the coastal zone. Breakwaters now provide an artificial rocky habitat.
The primary types of plant and animal habitats presently found within the study area include: a sandy beach surf zone, extending from the upper shore-washed beach to just seaward of the breaker line; a sandy muddy area beginning at the terminus of the surf zone and gradually sloping into deeper water; the Hueneme Canyon, an area where primarily deepwater or northern species may be found relatively close to shore; the overlying water mass, supporting primarily pelagic organisms; the Port Hueneme Harbor itself; and all the artificial solid substrate — including the breakwater, retaining walls, and outfalls.
Marine species in the Port Hueneme area include three primary types: Surf and Bay Fishes, Shallow Water Fishes, and marine mammals.
• Surf and Bay Fish - The most abundant fish are Northern anchovies, the primary food for virtually all large fish-eating carnivores in Southern California. Northern anchovies are ubiquitous, locally forming large, dense schools. Deepbody and Slough anchovies are also ubiquitous in their distribution, but not nearly as abundant as the Northern anchovy.
Silversides (California grunion, Jacksmelt, and Topsmelt) also figure prominently in the nearshore region. All are schooling fish, and may be locally abundant. Silversides are forage fish for other species.

The most important surf and bay fishes from a sportsman's point of view are the croakers and surfperches. Barred and Walleye surfperch, California corbina, and Spotfin croaker are the dominant, and the most sought-after, surf zone fishes. All of these species spawn in relatively shallow water along the shore or in bays.
•	Shallow Water Fishes - the present trawl data are sufficient to establish fish species dominance in shallow waters (from roughly 10 to 40 feet). Data suggest that surfperches are dominant in this zone, as they are in the surf zone. Drums are also important, although not as much in this zone as in the surf. The most important sportfishes are the Barred, Walleye, and White surfperches and White croaker. Other species are not normally included in the fisherman's bag, either because of small size or unpalatability.
•	Marine Mammals - The Harbor seal and California sea lion are occasionally seen in the area. California sea lions, in particular, feed in the offshore areas and haul up on the rocks of the jetty at the harbor mouth.
Riparian Corridor: The Bubbling Springs Creek, initially designed as a flood control channel, has undergone improvements to become part of the City's Recreation Corridor. a number of native and introduced plant species have been established in, and adjacent to, the watercourse, creating an environment suitable for animal life. Many water birds now utilize the area for resting and feeding. In addition, crayfish, small fish and frogs can be found in the creek.

Rare and Endangered Species: Five sensitive species and two sensitive vegetative habitats reportedly occur within Port Hueneme at the southeasterly end of Hueneme Beach Park. Sensitive species include the burrowing owl, California homed lark, Belding’s savannah sparrow, California least tern, and Western snowy plover; sensitive habitats include the southern foredune and southern backdune scrub. Of these, the least tern, snowy plover and associated dune habitats are particularly relevant to Port Hueneme.
The least tern is classified as both Federal and State Endangered. The Western snowy plover, on the other hand, is classified as Federal Threatened and a State Species of Special Concern. Least terns are known to nest within Ormond Beach, downcoast of Port Hueneme, and have been observed resting in the dunes and night roosting along the coastal strand at the southeasterly end of Hueneme Beach. Snowy plovers have been observed resting and foraging within the foredunes and backdunes, but no nests are known to exist within Port Hueneme.
Both birds have been observed foraging in the “J” Street drain and adjacent wetlands within the City of Oxnard.
The burrowing owl and California homed lark are both classified as a State species of Special Concern and reported sightings have placed these species within mderal portions of southeasterly Hueneme Beach Park. Field reconnaissance surveys in 1991 and 1993 failed to substantiate the presence of either bird. The type structure generally suited to the burrowing owl for nesting and protection (burrows in steep areas) is not present within Hueneme Beach Park. Homed larks, on the other hand, are known to occur in a variety of habitat types and maintain no feature that is particularly critical to its life history.

Finally, the Belding’s savannah sparrow is classified as endangered and unverified reports have placed this bird within Hueneme Beach Park. The Belding’s savannah sparrow ranges from Santa Barbara County south to Baja California and nests in salt marsh habitats dominated by pickleweed. This species is commonly observed within the salt marsh habitats of nearby Ormond Beach. However, it is unlikely that this species uses Hueneme Beach except as a transient to another forging location in the local area. The California Department of Fish and Game has identified California marsh as critical habitat for the Belding’s savannah sparrow. There is no suitable salt marsh or Salicomia within Port Hueneme.
Open Space Recreational Resources: Port Hueneme's open space and recreation resources include the beach strand, parks, schools, and community facilities. Combined these resources offer the community's residents a number of recreational opportunities.
These resources are described in the following section.
Beach Strand: The Pacific Ocean and the adjoining beach, known as the Hueneme Beach Park, are two of the most notable and important natural resources for the City of Port Hueneme. The beach provides a wide variety of passive and active public recreation opportunities from sunbathing to swimming.
Continuing to protect and preserve the shoreline, to protect public views, and to improve public access are desired goals of both the City and California Coastal Commission. The California Coastal Act requires:
CITY OF PORT HUENEME
GENERAL PLAN
CONSER VA TION/OPEN SPACE/
ENVIRONMENTAL
RESOURCES ELEMENT
10
•	The scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas shall be considered and protected as a resource of public importance. Development shall be sited and designed to protect public views to and along the ocean and scenic coastal areas, to minimize the alteration of natural land forms, to be visually compatible with the character of surrounding areas, and, where feasible, to restore and enhance visual quality in visually degraded areas.
•	Maximum public access must be provided to coastal beaches. Further, recreational opportunities are to be provided consistent with protecting the public's safety, maintaining the rights the public, protecting the rights of private property owners, and preserving natural resource areas from overuse.
As a result of these mandates and community concern, both ocean vistas and shoreline access are recognized as valuable resources in Port Hueneme. Ocean vistas in Port Hueneme include views along Surfside and Ocean View Drives. Both the California Coastal Act and California Environmental Quality Act review new development proposals for their effect on visual resources. Specifically, the Environmental Checklist, completed in compliance with CEQA, requires a jurisdiction to determine if the project results in the obstruction of any scenic vista or view open to the public, or if the proposal will result in the creation of an aesthetically offensive site open to public view.
Hueneme Beach Park follows the coastline, allowing the public unrestricted access to the beach. Non-vehicular (i.e., pedestrian and bicycle) access to the beach park from the residential neighborhoods in the central portion of the community is provided by the Bubbling Springs Recreation Corridor. However, pedestrian access from the City to the oceanfront adjacent to the Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory (NCEL) is limited.

The Master Plan for Hueneme Beach Park proposes to provide access to the entire beach by locating a bike/pedestrian path along the beach to the view point/lighthouse at the port entry. Both the NCEL and Port of Hueneme currently restrict access from the City to the harbor and oceanfront for security and safety reasons, such as:
•	The NCEL must remain secure from outside intruders.
•	The compatibility of Port operations (i.e. unloading and loading) and individuals utilizing the proposed bikeway/walkway needs to be explored.
•	If a seawall is constructed along the breakwater to allow pedestrian access, there is the potential for pedestrians to be injured during high ocean tides.
Parks and Recreation -. The City of Port Hueneme Department of Recreation and Community Services operates five park sites, a recreation corridor, a community center, an athletic club, and a cultural center. (See Figure COER-1) These facilities offer diverse recreation opportunities throughout the community.
The National Recreation and Park Association has established a series of standards to help communities evaluate land requirements for various kinds of parks (see Table COER-1). These standards classify parks as community, neighborhood, mini, regional/ metropolitan, regional reserve, linear, special use or conservancy depending on the size and activities at the park site. Based on this classification system, Port Hueneme contains four park types, including community, neighborhood, linear, and special use.

Community parks serve neighborhoods within one to two miles and generally encompass approximately 25 acres. Both active and passive uses are generally provided at these parks, offering recreation opportunities for large groups of people. Field sports, picnicking, play areas, and community centers are commonly found at these large parks.
Port Hueneme contains one community park, Bubbling Springs Park, encompassing 21 acres. The park offers a variety of facilities, including a community center, baseball diamonds, par-fitness course, play equipment, and picnicking area.

Neighborhood Parks are typically smaller in size than community parks, ideally covering 15+ acres. The park serves the immediate neighborhood within one-fourth to one-half mile. These parks typically include areas for intense recreation, such as play fields and courts.
Bolker and Moranda Parks are both small neighborhood parks, encompassing four and eight acres respectively. Table COER-2 outlines the facilities available at the City's neighborhood parks.
Linear parks are designed for recreational travel. These parks may include trails for hiking, biking, snowmobiling, horseback riding, or cross-country skiing.
The Bubbling Springs Recreation Corridor contains a shared bicycle and pedestrian path which runs along the course of the Bubbling Springs Waterway. The corridor links Bubbling Springs, Moranda, and Hueneme Beach Parks. The trail is utilized for jogging, walking, and bicycling.
Special use parks are areas for specialized or single-purpose recreational activities. Hueneme Park, the largest park in Port Hueneme, covers 50 acres which includes the beach and a 1,240-foot fishing pier. Sport fishing is a favorite on the pier and picnicking/barbecuing on the beach. Sand volleyball courts are also available on the beach. (See the Safety Element for policies to ensure continued safety at Hueneme Park and the ocean).
Dewar Park located between Market and Scott Streets encompasses less than 1/4 acre of land. The park contains benches providing residents a place to sit and relax.
School sites can offer additional acreage for recreational purposes. There are four elementary school sites within the City, each of which may have potential for some shared recreational use by City residents outside of school hours.

•	Sunkist School, located at the intersection of Teakwood Street and Ventura Road, occupies a site of 10 acres of which about half is developed. The remainder is used for play areas.
•	Parkview School, located at Bard Road and Sixth Place, occupies a site of 9.7 acres. About half is developed and the remainder has playground equipment and two baseball diamonds which are somewhat outdated. The location of this site, in close proximity to Bubbling Springs Park, makes joint use a particularly desirable option.
•	Bard School, is located on the south side of Pleasant Valley Road to the west of Florence Avenue. The school site comprises 10 acres of which about half are developed. There was at one time a Joint Powers Agreement between the City and the School District regarding the use of the Bard School site for parking for the adjacent Athletic Center/Boys and Girls Club.
•	Hueneme School is located at the intersection of Ventura Road and Clara Street. With 6.4 acres this site is probably constrained in terms of new uses. However, the play areas include a number of active recreation facilities such as basketball courts which are somewhat outdated. There may be some mutual benefit in the sharing of improvement costs in return for shared use.
Preliminary contact with the School District indicates a favorable disposition on their part for the formation of future joint use agreements.
The Port Hueneme Community Center adjacent the Bubbling Springs Recreation Corridor in eastern Port Hueneme contains a variety of facilities. The Center's largest facility is an auditorium with a stage and seating capacity of 350. Other facilities include two meeting rooms, two kitchens, a senior citizen's room with adjacent kitchen, a staff office, and rest rooms.

The Athletic Center/Boy's and Girl's Club is located in the eastern portion of Port Hueneme adjacent Bard Elementary School. The facility was constructed under a joint powers agreement between the City and Port Hueneme Boys' and Girls' Club for shared use and operation/maintenance of the facility. As a result, the facility provides a number of programs catering to youth ages 7-17 years.
The facility contains an indoor gymnasium for basketball and volleyball, weight room, racquetball/handball court, sauna, locker rooms, games room, workshop, li-brary/meeting room, kitchen, offices and rest rooms.
The Dorill B. Wright Cultural Center is located in the southern portion of the community near the Bubbling Springs Recreation Corridor. The Center includes a theatre, multipurpose areas, support facilities, and an outdoor patio area. The theatre can accommodate an audience of up to 564 people with the arrangement of fixed and move-able seating. Multipurpose areas are designed for banquets, conferences, and all types of meetings, and support facilities include a catering kitchen, dressing rooms, and a "green room".
The Naval Construction Battalion Center (CBC) encompasses over 57 percent of the City's land and employs over 13,000 employees earning the facility's reputation as the single most significant enterprise within Port Hueneme.
The CBC contains an extensive array of recreational amenities ranging from softball fields through to more unusual facilities such as a roller skating rink. The range of facilities available includes:
Softball fields (2);
Tennis courts;
Golf course - presently nine holes, being extended to eighteen holes at present;

At present, access to these facilities on a regular basis is limited to active duty military personnel and their dependents, retired military personnel, and Department of Defense civilian employees and their dependents. In addition to the annual SeaBee day, on which the base opens for general public visitation, the only current nonmilitary service related use of recreation facilities are golf tournaments open to public and military personnel participants, and use of softball facilities by some youths from the surrounding area who are admitted in order to make up sufficient numbers for Navy to operate a Youth Baseball League.
Private Recreation Facilities are included in a number of the City's large private residential communities concentrated in particular in the northern area and along the oceanfront. Nearly all of them provide some level of recreational facilities often including tennis courts and a small swimming pool. One of the condominium developments - Hueneme Bay - has a nine-hole putting course and a recreation building including a large swimming pool.
In addition to the residential developments' recreation facilities, there are a few commercial businesses in the City, such as the Channel Islands Athletic Club, which extend the range and availability of recreational opportunity in the City. The most significant feature of all the private recreational facilities in the City is that they cater primarily to adult recreational use. The two types of recreational activity least served by private recreation are children and family oriented activities, and group activities -particularly popular active sports activities.

Service organizations, such as the Women's Club and Veterans of Foreign Wars, also have meeting facilities that may be utilized by the public. These facilities offer community residents alternative locations to host meetings, receptions, and public affairs.
Although private recreation facilities cannot satisfy the need for public parks and recreation facilities, they clearly do contribute to the overall recreational opportunity in the City. In particular, the high number of tennis courts within residential complexes seems to ensure that additional public courts beyond those already in existence at Moranda Park are not necessary.
Evaluation of Existing Conditions: Port Hueneme's recreation facilities offer the community's residents diverse recreational opportunities. One measure to evaluate a park system is to examine the amount of parkland per 1000 residents (See Table COER-3) The City contains approximately 90 acres of local parkland which allows the community to well satisfy a standard of three acres of local parkland per 1000 residents.

In addition, park land is fairly well distributed throughout the City (See Figure COER-2). Each park classification has a related service area based on the size of the park, 1 Vi mile radius for a community park and 1/4 mile radius for a neighborhood park. According to these standards, almost all of Port Hueneme's residential neighborhoods are well served by parkland. However, some of the City's northern neighborhoods are not included within a parks service area.
Financial Resources: Funding sources for public recreation facilities, programs, or services are limited within most communities including Port Hueneme. Concurrently, many improvements identified within the Master Plan require large financial expenditures. The Draft Parks and Recreation Master Plan, 1990, identified $3,002,600 in capital expenditures needed for parks and cultural facilities between 1990 and 2000. Yearly operation and maintenance costs are estimated in the same plan at approximately $1,680,000. The dilemma is to provide adequate recreational facilities with limited funds.
Long-Term Maintenance and Operation: Financial and organizational concerns arise as facilities age. Without adequate upkeep, new facilities require extensive repairs. However, a high quality maintenance program requires substantial financial and organizational support. Provisions to maintain and operate recreational sites needs to be addressed.
Surrounding Jurisdictions: Public recreation does not conform to political boundaries. All park facilities belong to the people of California and efforts to restrict access have been uniformly defeated. Consequently, the attraction capability of a specific activity or resource becomes the dominating factor that dictates demand and attendance.
Residents in Port Hueneme can attend events hosted by the City of Oxnard and vice versa. However, the use of facilities and services by residents outside the community can contribute to over-crowding and over-use. However, the proper joint use of facilities and services can expand recreational opportunities for both communities.

Child Care Needs: Women have historically been the primary caretakers of children in U.S. society. This precedent has radically changed during the past three decades. Today, both parents typically work to financially support the family.
Both parents or a single mother/father working has created a number of new family issues, with child care being one of the most pressing. Limited options and the high cost of child care have created a serious problem. As a result, local parks and recreation facilities are increasingly becoming afternoon babysitters for many children.
Water Resources: The Water Resources section is comprised of both a discussion of water courses and water supply.
Water Courses'. The five water courses that traverse the City of Port Hueneme are illustrated in Figure COER-3. The most notable water course in the City, Bubbling Springs Creek, begins on the City's eastern border and empties into the Ocean. A recreation corridor adjacent the Bubbling Springs Creek connects three parks and provides public access to Hueneme Beach Park. The remaining five water courses include four improved channels located on J Street, Channel Islands Boulevard, Patterson Road and Ventura Road; and an approximately 2000-foot ditch on the Navy Construction Battalion Center.

Water Supply: Port Hueneme's potable water is supplied by the United Water Conservation District, which currently (1992) obtains all of its water from groundwater supplies. In previous years, the water district has utilized imported water supplies.
In 1991, Port Hueneme utilized 2,683 acre feet of water. Annual allocations from the United Water Conservation District to the City are approximately 3,500 acre-feet. Additionally, the City has purchased additional water rights for future development in the City.
At the present time, no reclaimed water is available to the City. Reclaimed water can be used for irrigation of street medians and other public landscaping. The possibility of providing reclaimed water to the City is under study. Reclaimed water would originate from the Oxnard Wastewater Treatment Plant.
Energy Resources: Conventional energy sources, especially fossil fuels, are limited. These resources shared by very large geographic populations place enormous demands on energy sources. Conservation of these resources and development of alternative energy forms is important to the country's future environmental quality.
Solid Waste Management: Rapidly diminishing landfill space is one of California's most pressing current problems. AB 939, enacted by the State legislature in 1989, mandates source reduction of solid wastes to prolong the life of existing landfills. The law requires each jurisdiction to prepare a comprehensive solid waste reduction plan.
The plan compels the jurisdiction to reduce solid waste 25 percent by 1995 and 50 percent by 2000. The plan must incorporate a number of methods including source reduction, recycling, and composting.
Mineral Resources: According to the California Division of Mines and Geology, no mineral deposits are known to exist in the City of Port Hueneme.

Cultural Resources: Cultural resources in a community can encompass many things, including archaeological sites and artifacts, fossils and historic structures or places. No paleontological or archaeological resources are known to exist in Port Hueneme. As a result, this section focuses on historic structures and places in the community.
Ventura County recognizes fourteen historic sites in Port Hueneme, two of which, the "Hueneme Women's Improvement Club" and the "Thomas Bard Estate" are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places (see Figure 4). All sites are designated as historical landmarks, except the Oxnard Insectary and Original Hueneme Grammar School Site, which are considered "points of interest" (sites designated as "points of interest" are historical sites where the structure has been removed).

The
Conservation/ Open Space/ Environmental Resources Plan
Biological Resources: Port Hueneme's biological resources primarily include ornamentals utilized for landscaping purposes. The City will implement its Landscape Design Guidelines to promote the development of water-efficient landscaping.
Two sensitive species (California least tern and Western snowy plover) and two sensitive vegetative habitats (southern foredunes and southern backdune scrub) are known or are expected to occur within Port Hueneme at the southeasterly end of Hueneme Beach Park. Although ruderal habitat is not rated for protection, CDFG considers such land downcoast of Oceanview Drive as biologically sensitive (see paragraph below). New developments occurring within and adjacent to Hueneme Beach may increase human activity in the area and disturb sensitive biological resources. Through its Local Coastal Program, the City will establish resource protection policies with the objective of accommodating public access, recreation and environmental protection.
In contrast to southern foredunes and southern backdune scrub, the biological significance of ruderal habitat at the easterly end of Hueneme Beach is less certain. There is nothing rare, unique or valuable in this particular habitat; no feature of ruderal lands within Hueneme Beach is deemed critical to the life history of the two sensitive species observed at this location (burrowing owl and homed lark); and the vegetative character of ruderal habitat does not provide a diverse structure, avian density or diversity. Although ruderal habitat is not rated for protection, CDFG considers such land downcoast of Oceanview Drive as biologically sensitive primarily because of its value as a buffer for the diverse, rare, sensitive, and important biological values of the Ormond Beach ecosystem. Through its Local Coastal Program, the City will postpone development of all ruderal land downcoast of Oceanview Drive pending further environmental study and Coastal Commission consultation.

Coordination and Cooperation: With limited opportunities for expansion of recreation opportunities in Port Hueneme, coordination with the school district and Construction Battalion Center (CBC) could provide additional recreation resources to the public. This Element's policies call for coordination with both the school district and CBC. According to the Parks and Recreation Master Plan (1990), the school district and CBC indicate an interest in the formation of future joint use agreements. However, the CBC stated that Navy personnel will obviously continue to have the top priority, service to civilian employees of the Base coming next, and the general public use to be considered only where the two prior categories leave gaps in facility use patterns.
Financial Resources: Funds for park development are limited and financing mechanisms for future facilities, programs, and maintenance must be explored. Financing options to investigate include a Mello-Roos District, Public Facilities Fee, Park Enterprise Fund, and Events Fund. (See the goals and policies section of this element for further explanation of these financing mechanisms.)
Long Term Maintenance and Operation: The City of Port Hueneme Department of Recreation and Community Services continues to explore various options to insure the continuous maintenance and operation of park facilities. The City will identify and pursue agreements with service organizations, businesses, and clubs to provide the manpower for park operation and maintenance. To ensure that proper maintenance is occurring, the City will conduct regular inspections of park facilities.
Water: The City of Port Hueneme reinstated a voluntary water conservation program in 1990. This program is still in effect; since 1991, this program has resulted in a 24 percent reduction in domestic water consumption. Additionally, the City has adopted a retrofit program requiring a zero net increase in water use for all new residential, commercial, and industrial projects.

In 1990, the Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency (GWMA) adopted Ordinance 5 to preserve the area's groundwater supplies. Ordinance 5 establishes a formula to reduce water consumption in 5% increments. (See Table COER-6) Each 5% reduction is calculated from the user's base year water consumption which is the average water usage by that particular user between 1985 and 1989.
Like all jurisdictions extracting water from groundwater resources within GWMA's jurisdiction, Port Hueneme is required to limit its water usage. The United Water Conservation District (UWCD), which provides water to Port Hueneme, has a base year consumption rate of 3,600 acre feet. According to the target dates, the following water consumption reduction schedule will be required:
Table COER-5
United Water Conservation District Water Allocation to Port Hueneme With Mandatory Reduction
Year	Future Water Allocations With Mandatory Water Reductions	Percent Reduction
1992	3,413 acre-feet	5%
1995	3,234 acre-feet	10%
2000	3,054 acre-feet	15%
2005	2,880 acre-feet	20%
2010	2,694 acre-feet	25%
Reduction each year is calculated from the base year consumption rate of 3,593 acre feet.
The voluntary water conservation and retrofit programs have helped Port Hueneme to reduce their water consumption. The City must continue to conserve water and coordinate with the GWMA and UWCD to create new programs to meet the year 2010 reduction goal.

The City is considering saving additional water resources through a Water Meter Program. The Program would charge individual users additional monies for water usage.
Energy: The Land Use and Housing Elements and the Air Quality Sub-Element all contain goals and policies to create a jobs/housing balance. This Element intends to conserve energy resources, such as fossil fuels, through jobs/housing balance, thereby reducing the number of home-to-work trips. The city will also require that new developments utilize energy-saving devices and that existing structures be retrofitted to conserve energy.
Solid Waste Management: In November 1991, the City of Port Hueneme completed a Source Reduction and Recycling Element (SRRE) to fulfill the requirements of Assembly Bill 939 (AB 939). AB 939 requires that each jurisdiction outline how they will meet the mandatory waste reduction goals.
The SRRE is comprised of five components or strategies to reduce waste, including source reduction, recycling, composting, special waste, and education/public information. These components outline how Port Hueneme will reduce landfill waste 25% by 1995 and 50% by 2000.
The Source Reduction Component involves a variety of programs to reduce waste. Six informal programs already exist in rudimentary form and are being implemented. For example, the local government non-procurement policy encourages double-sided copying, and the use of durable mugs. The reduced toxins program substitutes benign substances for toxic substances utilized by the City's Equipment Maintenance personnel. Other
non-government sponsored programs include thrift store diversion, cloth diaper services, and collection and distribution of surplus or dated food products. New programs the City will pursue include technical assistance to businesses, reuse of asphalt, government procurement policy, on-site composting, and advocacy for proposed state or federal legislation to encourage source reduction or recycling.

The Recycling Component has already been successful. In 1990, approximately 6,430 tons or 20% of the 31,546 tons of solid waste generated was recycled. The City will rely on the maintenance of activities such as buy-back and special materials collections to meet the 1995 mandates. The 50% waste reduction goal will be satisfied by creating recycling drop off centers for multi-family and mobile homes, drop off centers at school sites, and newspaper drop off centers. In addition, the City is interested in assisting the Construction Battalion Center curbside recycling and drop off programs.
The Composting Component is anticipated to achieve a 14-16% diversion for the City by the year 2000. Separate yard/wood waste drop-off centers and curbside collection of yard and food wastes are the primary programs pursued to reduce waste. These products may be delivered to a regional composting facility serving Port Hueneme, Oxnard, Ventura and possibly Santa Paula and Fillmore.
The Special Waste Component focuses on sewage sludge. The City of Oxnard Wastewater Treatment Plant handles all wastewater from Port Hueneme. Two strategies are considered to reduce sewage sludge, including: 1) The City will continue to maximize the potential for chemical fixation of sludge, exploring the potential for markets in conjunction with the contractor, and 2) Sewage sludge may be incorporated into a regional or subregional composting operation.
Lastly, the Education and Public Information Component outlines a number of approaches for educating the public regarding methods of waste reduction and recycling. The component targets three populations: residential-youth, residential-adult, and commercial sector. Formal education alternatives have been selected for educating youth; while broader public education/information activities are targeted for both the residential-adult and commercial sectors.

Cultural Heritage: Preserving Port Hueneme's heritage may be partially attained by protecting community historical sites. One mechanism to achieve this goal is through the Ventura County Cultural Heritage Ordinance. The Ordinance requires that any site recognized by the Cultural Heritage Board as a historical landmark or "point of interest" must obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness if the proposed action would adversely affect the historical significance of the County landmark, not be compatible with the use and/or exterior of the County landmark or remove or demolish a landmark that is significant to the County's history. If the request for a Certificate of Appropriateness is rejected by the Cultural Heritage Board, the property owner shall be prohibited from taking action for 180 days, so that the site may be recorded through photographs/ written accounts for historical records.

AIR QUALITY SUB-ELEMENT
Introduction Port Hueneme is part of the South Central Air Basin which
includes Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Obispo Counties. The Ventura County Air Pollution Control District's (VCAPCD) jurisdiction encompasses only Ventura County.
Purpose: While air quality has not yet been made a mandatory General Plan element by the State, air pollution conditions are increasingly being recognized as an important issue. Port Hueneme has created an Air Quality Subelement to address the upcoming issues confronting the community.
The purpose of the Air Quality Sub-element is to provide guidelines and objectives for the City of Port Hueneme, consistent with the Ventura County Air Quality Management Plan (VCAQMP), to help improve local air quality conditions.
Scope and Content: An Air Quality Sub-element was created to address the issues confronting the community.
In addition to the introduction, the Air Quality Sub-element is divided into two sections: Issues Identification and Goals and Policies. Historical climate and air quality levels are examined in the Issues Identification section. Goals and policies are created in consideration of the previously identified issues.
Related Plans and Programs. Air pollution is not limited by jurisdictional boundaries, a number of plans and programs have been created by governmental agencies, especially at the regional level, to address air quality issues, a synopsis of related plans, programs, and policies follows.

Ventura County 1991 Air Quality Management Plan: The Air Quality Management Plan establishes policies and programs for Ventura County to attain federal and state air quality standards, a number of stationary and mobile source control measures outline the County's strategy to reduce emissions of reactive organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, the two precursors to ozone. Each control measure has been evaluated for technological feasibility, control efficiency, cost effectiveness, emission reduction potential, enforcement, legal authority, and other environmental effects.
Ventura County Congestion Management Plan (CMP):
The CMP represents an effort to manage traffic congestion by coordinating the many transportation, land use, and air quality programs in Ventura County. The CMP contains a number of projects and programs to improve the County's circulation system, indirectly improving the region's air quality. If a city or the County cannot meet the CMP, they will have to prepare a "deficiency plan" to correct the unacceptable conditions. All the projects and programs in the deficiency plan must be specifically approved by the Air Pollution Control District.
Regional Mobility Plan: The Southern California Association of Governments has created this plan to address transportation issues on a regional basis. The plan includes growth management, demand management, system management, and facilities development strategies to recapture and retain the transportation mobility levels of 1984.

Air Quality This section discusses relevant air quality issues, including Issues Identification air quality standards, ambient air quality, existing and
future emissions, sensitive receptor areas, and air quality management.
Air Quality Standards: The City of Port Hueneme lies within the boundaries of the South Central Air Basin. The South Central Air Basin encompasses Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Obispo Counties. The City of Port Hueneme is located in the south eastern portion of the Basin.
The topography and climate of Southern California combine to make the basin an area of high air pollution potential. During the summer months, a warm air mass frequently descends over the cool, moist marine layer produced by the interaction between the ocean's surface and the lowest layer of the atmosphere. The warm upper layer forms a cup over the cool marine layer and prevents pollutants from dispersing upward and allows pollutants to accumulate within the lower layer. This situation is called a temporary inversion. Meanwhile, plentiful sunshine provides the energy to convert oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons into ozone and other pollutants. Ultimately, these factors have allowed emissions from a multitude of sources, including factories and motor vehicles, to result in a degradation of the Basin's air quality.
Both the federal and state governments have set health-based ambient air quality standards for the following pollutants: sulfur dioxide, lead, ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and PM 10 (PM 10 refers to fine particles with aerodynamic diameters of 10 micrometers or less). These standards are designed to protect persons from illness or discomfort with a margin of safety. The California standards are more stringent than the federal standards, and with respect to PM 10 and sulfur dioxide, far more stringent. California has also set standards for sulfate, visibility, hydrogen sulfide, and vinyl chloride. Table COER-7 outlines the current federal and state ambient air quality standards.

Ambient Air Quality: The Ventura County Air Pollution Control District monitors air quality throughout Ventura County at various monitoring stations. The eight monitoring stations in Ventura County are part of the State and Local Air Monitoring Stations (SLAMS) network which is designed to determine:
•	the highest concentrations expected to occur in the area covered by the network;
•	representative concentrations in areas of high population density;
•	the impact of ambient pollution levels of significant sources or source categories; and
•	general background concentration levels.
The El Rio and Ventura monitoring stations are the closest stations to Port Hueneme. According to the VCAPCD, the air quality data generated at the Ventura site most accurately represents the pollutants present in Port Hueneme because of its coastal location.
Tables COER-8 and COER-9 identify the number of days ozone and PM 10 standards have been exceeded. The state and federal standards for ozone have been consistently exceeded during the past ten years. In addition, particulate matter (PM 10) exceeded the state standard a total of 20 days. However, the federal standard for PM 10 at the Ventura Main air quality monitoring station has never been exceeded. Although ozone and PM 10 levels have exceeded established standards, conditions are generally improving.

Concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) occur close to heavily traveled roadways and freeways, particularly at locations where vehicles idle for prolonged periods. Since CO build-up typically occurs at locations where traffic is congested, CO concentrations correlate with levels of service at intersections. Concentrations of carbon monoxide may exceed 8-hour standards where an intersection's Level of Service is D or worse. Within the City of Port Hueneme only the intersection of Bard Road and Ventura Road operates at a Level of Service D or worse during the PM peak hour.
Two other pollutants are monitored extensively throughout the Ventura County Air Basin - nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Neither the national or state standards for these two pollutants have been exceeded in Ventura County.
Air Pollution Emissions: Air pollution forms either directly or indirectly from pollutants emitted from a variety of sources. These sources can be natural such as oil seeps, vegetation, or windblown dust. Emissions may also result from combustion, as in automobile engines; from evaporation of organic liquids, such as those used in coating and cleaning processes; or through abrasion, such as from tires on roadways.

Motor vehicles constitute the largest generator of air pollutant emissions in Port Hueneme. Vehicles frequently travel on Channel Islands Boulevard and Ventura Road, resulting in the production of local air pollutant emissions. Stationary sources located inland also diminish air quality within the region as a result of contaminants being transported by wind currents.
Sensitive Receptor Areas: High concentrations of pollutants pose health problems for the general population, particularly young children playing outdoors, the elderly, and the sick. These individuals that are especially vulnerable to air pollution are identified as sensitive receptors. Special consideration needs to be given to the areas where sensitive persons congregate, including schools, medical facilities, and parks.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
Introduction Purpose: It is the intent of the Economic Development Element to define a set of policies which will assist the City's elected leadership and management in the formation of deliberate initiatives for the maintenance and enhancement of Port Hueneme's economic development. An Economic Development Element is not mandated as part of the City's General Plan by State law. However, this Element will support the City's desire to provide a fiscally stable economic base and to maximize employment opportunities for residents so that a favorable jobs/housing balance is maintained, all within the context of safeguarding Port Hueneme's quality of life. Since rising costs and restrictions on revenue sources, as well as economic cycles and structural changes, have placed cities in competition with one another, the Economic Development Element provides the realistic framework within which Port Hueneme can pursue its economic goals. Much of the research for this element was conducted prior to the emergence of the State government's extreme budget/fiscal condition. The complete ramifications of this situation cannot be assessed in this document. The City should vigilantly monitor this situation as it unfolds.
Scope and Content: The General Plan as a whole provides a comprehensive strategy for the management of the City's diverse physical, economic and social resources, so there is a high level of interrelationship among the elements of the General Plan. The Land Use Element provides for the types, density/intensity and distribution of development.
The Economic Development Element provides for the manner in which the uses accommodated by the Land Use Element will be attracted to the City and/or maintained at a high level of productivity over time.

Other elements such as Circulation, Conservation/Open Space and Public Safety address in detail those services, resources and hazards that must be managed in order to facilitate activities specified in the Land Use and Economic Development Elements.
The Economic Development Element was developed through a process that involved a detailed Economic Audit of the City to identify the potential for, and the nature of, economic development over the next two decades. The Economic Audit included surveys of City residents, people from Port Hueneme and surrounding areas who shop in the City, retail business owners, and industrial business owners.
The data included in the Economic Development Element is based on an analysis conducted in 1992. Projections of growth and development in the element are based on the period beginning in 1992, and may therefore be different than other estimates in the General Plan.
Market Analysis/ This economic audit was undertaken to identify the potential for, Economic Audit and the nature of, further development in the City of Port Hueneme
over the next two decades. Through the process of the audit the opportunities available to Port Hueneme, as well as the constraints that face the City, were identified. The audit provides the basis for two subsequent tasks: the fiscal impact analysis which will identify the net impact of potential development on City financial resources and the Economic Development Element of the General Plan with specific goals and policies to guide City actions related to economic development issues.
Summary of the Economic Audit: The following section summarizes the Economic Audit by economic sector. The summary presents findings which suggest issues to be addressed by the City of Port Hueneme, opportunities on which to build future growth, and constraints to acknowledge.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT

Housing Sector
•	A shift in residential construction in Port Hueneme over the last decade from single-family to multi-family units reflects several concurrent trends: The continued construction of beach-oriented multi-family homes marketed to the second-home and local higher-end buyer; diminishing availability and/or size of parcels in undeveloped parts of the City; and infill construction on small parcels in developed areas of the City. These trends are expected to continue over the next two decades, resulting in construction of primarily multi-family units in the City.
•	Based on the 1992 audit, it is estimated that an additional 800 to 1,000 dwelling units may be constructed in Port Hueneme by 2010. Population growth provides valuable additional support for retail activity in the City.
•	About 10% of all units in multi-family structures are used as second homes by persons living outside the City. (This does not include units that are purchased by non-residents and then rented out on a yearly basis.) Although the second-home market dwindles dramatically in a sluggish economy, suitable sites exist for this use such that over time Port Hueneme can expect that 10% of its new housing stock will be used as second-homes.
Second-home buyers provide some additional support for housing in Port Hueneme, but they provide only marginal additional support for retail activity due to the shorter-term nature of their visits and the relatively small number of these part-time residents.
Retail Sector
• Currently, there are 463,000 square feet of retail space in the City, all of which serves local neighborhoods and communities.
CITY OF PORT HUENEME

•	High volume, discount outlets have recently proliferated throughout Southern California. Due to their size and merchandising techniques, these outlets draw from retail market areas that are geographically equivalent to regional centers; however, they are freestanding and do not depend on proximity to other commercial activities.
Many of these stores have site requirements that exceed the largest parcels in Port Hueneme. Other stores which may be physically accommodated in the City are satisfied with their existing location in the general area and are not planning to relocate or would not locate another store as close as Port Hueneme. A high volume discount outlet store is not currently located in the City.
•	The ability of local-serving stores on Channel Island Boulevard to capture consumer dollars from outside the City suggests that this is the most appropriate location for new retail development in the City of Port Hueneme relative to other locations within the City, should sufficient demand be identified.
•	New retail space supportable by population growth in Port Hueneme and nearby Oxnard is estimated to be 42,000 square feet by 2000 and 114,000 square feet by 2010. This is based on per capita income figures for new year-round and seasonal residents derived from recent sales data and a demand forecasting model which takes into account shopping patterns and typical sales volumes per square foot in local-serving space. Seasonal homeowners/users generate less than 5% of support for the projected space: since second homes are not occupied year-round, market support attributable to these units is less than that attributable to year-round units and may be an equivalent of four units to one unit occupied year round.

• Retail space in the City now has a vacancy rate of 11 %, most likely due to a combination of three factors: the slow economy, the relatively recent openings of two shopping centers, and older retail space that is becoming increasing non-competitive, particularly along Pleasant Valley Road and eastern Hueneme Road. Assuming that 4% of retail space in the city is vacant because of overbuilding and that this space will absorb new demand before additional space is needed, the amount of new supportable square footage by 2010 would be reduced from 114,000 square feet to 95,600 square feet.
Adjustments do not need to be made for vacant non-competitive retail space as it is a suitable target for re-cycling to other uses. As currently occupied older space is recycled, the potential amount of new space in the City is increased by an equivalent amount.
Hotel Sector
•	The overall occupancy rate in the market area in which the City is located (the Cities of Port Hueneme, Oxnard and Ventura) was 59% over the past year. There is only very slight variation in occupancy rates when examined by type of customer base, location and room rate.
An occupancy rate of 65% is the acceptable break-even level under normal hotel measurement criteria and 70% is considered an acceptable stabilized occupancy rate.
•	Approximately 70% of the customers of hotels in Port Hueneme and one in Oxnard closest to the Naval Base are Base-related. However, Base-related activity is not expected to increase so that support from this sector will not be a contributing factor to growth in the hotel market.
Overall, about 41% of all hotel clientele in the three-city area is business-related, while 36% is tourist-related. Sixteen percent of the customer base in the market area, includes mix of residential use, truckers, etc. Another 7% is attributable to Navy Base-related activity. Only the hotels in Port Hueneme and Oxnard in close proximity to the base mentioned clientele support related to the Base.

• Up to an additional 125 rooms in Port Hucncme may be supported by the market over the next 20 years. Market support for new hotels in the area will primarily be drawn from tourist activity. Some non-Base business support may be attracted by a facility in a particularly attractive location (i.e. with a water view) with meeting room facilities.
Given the source of market support, the location of a new facility in Port Hueneme is critical. A site on or within an easy walk to the beach can compete effectively with other facilities in the market. A location directly on the beach may actually be able to increase Port Hueneme's share of the market.
The extent to which the market is now overbuilt suggests that development of a new facility is not feasible until the latter part of this decade.
Industrial Sector
•	While the average annual amount of new industrial space increased over the last decade in Southern California, Ventura County captured a very small and declining share of the overall growth. In absolute terms, the average annual amount of industrial space developed in the County was 1.5 million square feet from 1980 to 1990 but decreased to 1.2 million square feet from 1986 to 1990.
•	The City of Port Hueneme captured less than 1% of the industrial growth in Ventura County throughout the last decade. In contrast, Oxnard captured almost one-third of the industrial growth from 1986 to 1990.
•	The vast majority of the 1,364 vacant acreage zoned for industrial use in Oxnard is located just south of Interstate 101. Discussions with local industrial real estate brokers indicate that the industrial areas in close proximity to Interstate 101 are considered prime locations. The Channel Islands Business Center on Highway 1 is considered a less attractive industrial alternative, while a location in the Hueneme Road Industrial Area, just east of Port Hueneme, generates relatively little interest.
CITY OF PORT HUENEME

ECONOMIC DE VELOPMEN1 ’ ELEMENT

•	The industrial area in Port Hueneme and the nearby industrial area in Oxnard are in a location that serves harbor-related activity. However, off-shore oil activity is not expected to expand. Further, the relatively small amount of land required to support current cargo shipments through the Port suggests that any changes in the level of cargo shipped through the Harbor District would most likely not result in a major change in land requirements. This does not preclude potential need for land by new users of the harbor. It does suggest that identifiable on-going land requirements will not be generated by harbor-related activity.
•	The industrial area in Port Hueneme and the nearby industrial area in Oxnard have historically provided a lower-cost alternative to Oxnard industrial areas that are closer to Interstate 101 or population centers.
(Historically land prices in the latter two areas have been $5.50 to $6.50 per square foot, while industrial land in the Hueneme Road area has sold for $4.50 to $5.00 per square foot). However, the relatively low level of industrial growth in the vicinity of Port Hueneme appears to indicate that the price level is not a widely accepted trade-off for sites that are some distance from prime locations.
•	Given the above considerations within the context of the particularly limited penetration of the City into the Countywide industrial market, as well as the limited penetration of the County into the Southern California industrial market, we have concluded that there is no practical basis for forecasting specific demand by industrial users at this time. Any such users would exhibit sporadic demand patterns related to some degree to overall demand for industrial land in southeastern Ventura County.
These practical marketing constraints indicate that the alternatives available to the City are: (1) to essentially landbank the industrial area for the long-term, or (2) to consider alternative land uses that may be more likely to generate near-term revenue to the City.
Aesthetically Pleasing Development
CITY OF PORT HUENEME
GENERAL PLAN
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
7
Landscaping, site planning, and architecture that is compatible with the surrounding community creates an aesthetically pleasing environment. The design and maintenance of commercial development is especially important as retail, office, and hotel/motel uses typically align major arterials. Achieving high quality design throughout a community contributes positively to consumers, workers, and residents' perception of a particular city, thereby attracting additional development to the area. As a result, design amenities influence economic development.
Relationship of the City to the Construction Battalion Center
This element recognizes the asymmetric fiscal/ relationship between the City and the CBC. As an example, the CBC has exclusive recreation facilities not accessible to City residents, while CBC residents and personnel have access to City parks. The CBC does not contribute property taxes to provide a proportionate share of revenue to provide such City facilities. The City should be ready to explore ways of increasing the level of reciprocity between the two entities.
Summary of the Market Analysis: The following section analyzes future residential, retail, hotel, and industrial development in Port Hueneme.
Housing Analysis
In 1980, there were 6,717 dwelling units in the City of Port Hueneme, of which 32% were single-family detached homes, and 68% were in multi-family structures—25% were attached singlefamily units and 43% were in other types of multi-unit structures. (See Tables ED-1 and ED-2).
CITY OF PORT HUENEME
GENERAL PLAN
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT

The housing stock in the City increased by 727 units between 1980 and 1990 to 7,444 dwelling units. Of the new units, 19% were single-family detached homes, 51% were single-family attached units, and 30% were in other types of multi-unit structures. Thus,
81 % of all new dwelling units were in multi-unit structures, compared to 68% of existing dwelling units in 1980. The shift towards multi-family units reflects several concurrent trends: the continued construction of beach-oriented multi-unit homes marketed to the second-home and local higher-end buyer; diminishing availability and/or size of parcels in undeveloped parts of the City; and infill construction on small parcels in developed areas of the City.
An average of 60 multi-unit homes was constructed per year between 1980 and 1990 in the City. In the larger housing market in which Port Hueneme is a part, which includes Oxnard and the City of Ventura, a total of 6,049 multi-unit homes were constructed at an average rate of 600 units per year. Port Hueneme captured approximately 10% of the total market for multi-family units.
An average of 13 single-family detached units were constructed per year between 1980 and 1990 in the City. A total of 6,506 detached homes was constructed in the larger housing market during this period, an average of 650 per year. Port Hueneme captured 2% of the total market for detached homes.

The vacancy rate in Port Ilueneme throughout the 1980's was higher than in surrounding communities and in most other communities in the County, most likely reflecting a higher relative number of second-homes. The overall vacancy rate in the late 1980s was approximately 10% while a vacancy rate of about 3% is typical in places with no second homes.
Discussions with realtors indicated that the second-home market is primarily a multi-family unit market. Assuming that the singlefamily detached segment in the City experienced the more typical 3% vacancy rate, the resulting vacancy rate for multi-family units is approximately 13%. Allowing for the same 3% typical vacancy rate in multi-family units, it appears that approximately 10% of all multi-family units are used as vacation or second homes. (More than 10% of all multi-family units may be owned by persons from outside the area but if they are rented out on an annual basis, they are not used as a vacation or second-home.)
Current Conditions - The housing market in Port Hueneme is impacted by the current recession as is the housing market in the rest of Southern California. Sales in both the second-home and the local market have slowed. The level and profile of current activity is not viewed as a relevant indicator of long-term market potential.
Projected Housing Activity - Projections of future demand for housing were derived by considering three approaches:
1.	The first approach utilized SC AG population projections for the County and the Oxnard-Ventura subregion (which includes Port Hueneme, Oxnard, Ventura, Camarillo, Santa Paula, Ojai and surrounding unincorporated areas). SC AG data shows that as of 1988, there were 636,900 persons in the County. Of that, 61% were in the Oxnard-Ventura sub-region. Port Hueneme represented 5% of the sub-region.
SCAG projections show that by 2010, an additional 271,800 persons will be living in the County and that the Oxnard-Ventura sub-region will capture 64% of the growth, or 173,000 new residents.

A constant capture rate by Port Hueneme of 5% indicates that the City would experience a population increase of 8,650 persons. Adjusting for the population increase since 1988 (approximately 800), the City would experience an additional 7,850 people over the next 18 years. At an average household size of 2.85, an additional 2,750 housing units would be in demand by 2010.
2.	The second approach utilized Port Hueneme's relationship to the housing sub-market in which it is located. As indicated above, the sub-market includes the Cities of Port Hueneme, Oxnard and Ventura. In the 1980s, Port Hueneme captured 6% of population growth. The General Plans of Oxnard and Ventura project an increase of 18,400 persons and 16,400 persons, respectively, by 2010. If Port Hueneme maintains its share of this submarket, the increase in population in the City would be 2,220 persons. At an average of 2.85 persons per unit, an additional 780 units would be required.
3.	The third approach reviews the absorption rate (as approximated by construction rates) of the time period of 1980 and 1990. (Construction rates over this extended period of time are considered an appropriate approximation of absorption rates, as over time all units were purchased and/or rented).
The last decade included both slow economic times (early part of the decade) and healthy economic times (the latter part of the decade) and provides a reasonable indicator of potential in the long-term. As indicated above, 60 multi-family units were constructed per year and 13 single-family units per year, thereby providing an additional 1,314 units by 2010.
Conclusion - SCAG projections are based on a "top-down" approach that begins with specifics of a very large area and then allocates to smaller areas in a more generalized manner. The magnitude of the projected housing demand for Port Hueneme derived from SCAG data (Approach 1) relative to projections based on more local data (Approaches 2 and 3), suggests that SCAG substantially overstates the City's housing potential. However, the Land Use Element provides adequate sites to satisfy SCAG's housing projections.

The approach that utilizes the absorption rate of the last decade may overstate the potential somewhat as it includes the absorption rate for single-family detached homes, a product for which there is a decreasing amount of suitable parcels. It is likely that almost all new units in the City will be multi-family units. Projections based on past multi-family unit absorption only indicates that there may be an additional 1,080 units by 2010. Thus, the approach based on local data provides a projected increase of dwelling units in Port Hueneme of 800 to 1,000 units between 1992 and 2010.
Retail Analysis
Types of Retail Outlets - A field survey undertaken by The Natelson Company, Inc., indicates that there are 463,000 square feet of retail space in the City of Port Hueneme. (This estimate excludes second-story space and buildings specifically constructed and/or entirely used for office activity.) As shown by Table ED-3, 40% of the retail space is occupied by two types of businesses:
25% of the total square footage is occupied by food stores and 16% by eating and drinking establishments.
Almost 20% is occupied primarily by commercial services—personal, business and health services. (Commercial services typically occupy approximately 20% of retail space in neighborhood and community shopping areas.)
Specialty and drug stores each occupy 9% of the total square footage and 5% of the space is occupied by apparel stores. The balance of the space is used by a mix of the following types of stores: home furnishings, appliances, packaged liquor and auto/boat supplies.
Occupancy Levels - The overall occupancy rate is estimated to be approximately 89%. This occupancy rate is considered high and may be reflective of the current slow economy, which began approximately mid-year 1990, as well as the relatively recent opening of Beachport Center (1989 through 1990) and Mandalay Village in 1989.

	Location of Retail Space - Almost three-quarters of all retail space in the City is located along Channel Islands Boulevard or on Ventura Road just north of Channel Islands Boulevard in the following shopping centers: Oliveira Plaza, Mandalay Village, Hardy Plaza, Town and Shore, Hueneme Bay Shopping Center and one small unnamed center. Another 15% of the retail space is located at the intersection of Hueneme and Ventura Roads in the Beach-port Center, Hueneme Center, and a few small buildings in close proximity to the Beachport Center. The balance is located primarily in the vicinity of Ventura and Pleasant Valley Roads, with a small amount along Hueneme Road, east of Ventura Road, and in the industrial area on Surfside Drive. Level of Retail Service - Examination of the size and type of outlets and the grouping of stores in shopping centers suggests that all retail commercial space serves local neighborhoods and communities. Profile of Retail Activity in the City Relative to Surrounding Areas - Comparison of total taxable retail sales per capita in the City of Port Hueneme to nearby city per capita figures suggests a low overall capture rate by the City. Total per capita retail sales in Port Hueneme in 1990 were approximately $2,500, compared to $6,400 in Oxnard and $10,800 in the City of Ventura (see Table ED-4). Some of the variation between Ventura and the other two cities may be explained by difference in income levels: 1990 estimated per capita household income of Port Hueneme, Oxnard, and Ventura was $12,771, $11,977, and $14,619 respectively, however, most of the variation has to do with relative lack of certain shopping opportunities. Currently, the City does not offer any shopping facilities that capture a regional market. Table ED-5 shows the type of location in which the eleven different types of retail purchases are likely to be made. Apparel, general merchandise, and specialty goods—purchases that are typically made in regional malls-will most likely be captured by the Esplanade Shopping Center in Oxnard and the Buenaventura Mall in Ventura.

The City of Port Hueneme is within the market areas of both malls, which offer a total of almost 1.5 million square feet of regional shopping space. In addition, the Center Point Mall in Oxnard, although more a large community center than a regional mall, is anchored by a 76,000 square foot general merchandise store and K-Mart Shopping Center is anchored by an 84,000 square foot general merchandise store. Both these latter two centers are located on Channel Islands Boulevard and easily serve the residents of Port Hueneme. The existing regional concentrations, the location of Port Hueneme at the southwestern edge of the regional market, projected low population growth in the City, and lack of a suitable size site for a regional center precludes this use in Port Hueneme.
In contrast to regional activity, some local-serving activity is well-positioned geographically to serve portions of Oxnard. Currently three major food stores in the City are located along Channel Islands Boulevard. While total per capita sales in Port Hueneme is relatively low, as indicated above, the per capita sales volume of food stores in the City is almost twice as high as that in Oxnard-$812 versus $414. Given the likelihood that the largest food stores in Port Hueneme serve areas of Oxnard as well, a weighted average (by population) of taxable food sales per capita in both cities was calculated. This resulted in a per capita food sales of $635, a similar figure to the $611 per capita in food sales in the City of Ventura. The ability of local-serving stores on Channel Island Boulevard to capture consumer dollars from the outside community suggests that this is the most appropriate location for new retail development in the City of Port Hueneme relative to other locations within the City, should sufficient demand be identified.

Projected Retail Activity - An increase in demand for retail space in the City will be generated by the population increase in Port Hueneme and the portion of Oxnard that is in reasonable proximity to Channel Islands Boulevard. The Housing Analysis Section projects a potential increase in housing units in Port Hueneme of 800 to 1,000 units by 2010. For the purpose of this analysis, the high end of the range and an overall household size of 2.85 is used to estimate an increase in population by 2010. In addition, it is assumed that 90% of all units are inhabited year-round. Thus, an increase in population of approximately 2,560 persons is projected for Port Hueneme by 2010.
Utilizing per capita income figures for new residents derived from recent housing sales data and a demand forecasting model which takes into account shopping patterns and typical sales volumes per square foot in local-serving retail space, retail space supportable by the new population by 2010 is estimated to be about 46,000 square feet. (This projection does not include demand for space in regional malls.)
Occupants of units used as second-homes will provide an additional source of demand for retail goods in Port Hueneme. As mentioned above, approximately 10% of all multi-family units in Port Hueneme are used as second homes. Since second homes are not occupied year-round, market support attributable to these units is less than that attributable to year-round units and may be an equivalent of four units to one unit occupied year round. Assuming that per capita income of occupancy of these units is about twice that of year-round residents, this source of demand is estimated to provide support for additional 3,200 square feet by 2010.
The household population in Oxnard is projected to increase by 15,770 by 2010. Assuming approximately one-fifth of the residential development will occur within an area served by commercial activity in Port Hueneme, 3,940 persons will be added to Port Hueneme's market area. Utilizing the same approach described above, the total amount of additional local-serving retail space supportable in the City by Oxnard residents by 2010 is estimated to be about 40,000 square feet.

A total of 114,100 square feet of new non-regional space will be supported by growth in Port Hueneme's market by 2010, as shown below:

(1) Based on capture of demand generated by 20% of growth in Oxnard household population
The vacancy factor in Port Hueneme must be accounted for in this analysis. Currently, retail space in the City has a vacancy rate of about 11%, most likely due to a combination of three factors: the slow economy, the relatively recent openings of two shopping centers, and older retail space that is becoming increasingly non-competitive, particularly along Pleasant Valley Road and eastern Hueneme Road. The degree to which the economy is impacting the vacancy rate can only be definitively determined as the economy improves. The extent to which the vacancy remains high in a healthy economy is the extent to which the market is now overbuilt and to which those is non-competitive space. Should there appear to be overbuilding of new space, the projected increase in supportable retail space would be reduced by that overbuilt amount. Assuming that approximately 4% of retail space in the City is vacant because of overbuilding, the amount of new supportable square footage by 2010 would be reduced by 18,500 to 95,600 square feet. This approach avoids plans that would impact existing space.

Adjustments do not need to be made for vacant non-competi-tivc retail space as it is a suitable target for recycling to other uses. As currently occupied older space is recycled, the potential amount of new space in the City is increased by an equivalent amount.
High Volume/Discount Outlets - A relatively new development in retailing can be seen in the high volume, discount outlets that have proliferated throughout Southern California. Due to their size and merchandising techniques, these outlets draw from retail market areas that are geographically equivalent to regional centers; however, they are freestanding and do not depend on proximity to other commercial activities. Almost all have specific locational criteria that pertain to size of lot, market support requirements, other locations of their own store and location of major competitors. Many of these stores have site requirements that exceed the largest parcels in Port Hueneme (i.e., PACE requires 13 acres, Price Club requires 12 acres, Walmart requires 12 to 14 acres). The consultant contacted the corporate offices of four stores whose site requirements may be accommodated in Port Hueneme on either Parcel 1 (4.45 acres) or Parcel 16 (10.08 acres) to identify any possible interest in locating new or relocating existing stores. Three of the stores—Home Depot, Home Club and Builders Emporium are satisfied with their existing location in Oxnard and would not locate another as close as Port Hueneme. The fourth store—CostCo—is not currently located in the County but is considering a location in Thousand Oaks at this time.

Comments:	The cost of land in southern California typically prevents Costco from remaining within their target overall occupancy/cost levels. Accordingly, they consider incentives from local agencies critical in their site selection decisions. The most attractive incentive from their peispeclivc is shared sales lax revenue (ratio varies depending on city) to cover short-fall in rate of return resulting from high land costs. Land is also an attractive incentive, as is any incentive which lowers overall occupancy costs (e.g. reduced traffic mitigation fees).			
Hotel Analysis
The Natelson Company, Inc. (TNCI) surveyed a total of 38 hotels and motels in the Ventura-Oxnard-Port Hueneme hotel market. We have excluded hotels of less than 20 rooms and those that primarily serve as long-term residences for local workers and welfare recipients (almost all of which have 20 or less rooms as well) as these facilities that are not representative of development options.
Location - The 38 facilities surveyed represent a combined total of 3,607 rooms and are located in the following five general areas:
•	On or near the beach or marina in Ventura
•	On or near Interstate 101, in Ventura
•	Along or near State Highway 1, in Oxnard
•	On or near the beach or marina, in Oxnard
•	In various locations in Port Hueneme
Approximately 11% of the facilities (four motels and hotels) and 8% of the rooms (294 rooms) are in the City of Port Hueneme. Oxnard has 32% of the facilities and 40% of all rooms. The balance of the facilities and rooms, 58% and 53%, respectively, are located in Ventura.
Size - As shown in the following table, two-thirds of the facilities in the market area are small scale, with less than 100 rooms in the establishment. Only 18% of the facilities have between 100 and 199 rooms and 15% have over 200 rooms.
The three facilities in Ventura with over 200 rooms are located on or within several blocks of the beach. Two of the three facilities in Oxnard with over 200 rooms are located in a marina or on a beach. The third facility is on a golf course. Port Hueneme does not have facilities with over 200 rooms.

Two of the four facilities in Ventura with between 100 and 199 rooms are either in a marina or within a few blocks of the beach. The other two are in the southern portion of the City of Ventura just off of Interstate 101. There are two facilities in Oxnard with between 100 and 199 rooms: one is just off Interstate 101 in the northern portion of the City and the other is on Highway 1. This latter hotel was the only one in the entire market area that indicated that truckers are a component of their customer base. The facility in Port Hueneme with over 100 rooms is located within several blocks of the beach.
Age - Just over one-half of all facilities in the market area were constructed during the 1980's. Twenty-two percent were constructed in the 1970s, 18% were constructed in the 1960s and the balance (9%) were constructed prior to 1960.

All facilities constructed prior to 1970 had less than 100 rooms with one exception-a 273-room facility on the water in Oxnard constructed in the late 1960s. The other twelve hotels with over 100 rooms were constructed in the 1970s and 1980s. In fact, 10% of the hotels constructed in the 1960s were over 100 rooms, as do 60% constructed in the 1970s and 57% constructed in the 1980s. Viewed from another perspective, we see that 45% of rooms constructed in the 1960s were in hotels with over 100 rooms, while in the 1970s and 1980s the comparable figure was 81 %. This is an indicative of not only a growth in a market but also the financial realities of hotel construction and operation.
Source of Business - Overall, about 41 % of all hotel clientele in the Port Hueneme-Oxnard-Ventura area is business-related while 36% is tourist-related. Another 7% is attributable to Navy Base-related activity. Only the hotels in Port Hueneme and one in Oxnard in close proximity to the base mentioned has clientele support related to the base.
The balance of the customer base in the market area (16%) includes residential use, truckers, etc.
Room Rates - Approximately 31 % of all facilities price their rooms at less than $40 per night, both in the summer and winter seasons. Another 24% price their rooms between $40 and $65 in the summer and winter while 5 % price their rooms between $40 and $65 in the winter but over $65 in the summer season. Forty percent of the facilities price their rooms over $65 in both the summer and winter seasons.
Occupancy Rate - An occupancy rate of 65 % is the acceptable break-even level under normal hotel measurement criteria and 70% is considered an acceptable stabilized occupancy rate. The overall occupancy rate in the market area was 59% in 1991. There is only a very slight variation in occupancy rate when examined by type of customer base, location, and room price.

Potential Hotel Facilities in Port Hueneme-Oxnard-Ventura Area - The potential for development of major hotel-motel facilities in Port Hueneme involves making a projection of the total demand in the future in the three-city area, and assessing the potential for the City to attract some share of the projected market.
The demand for hotel-motel facilities is a function of a number of component market forces, including: the growth of the employment base; popularity of the larger region as a destination for tourist and related recreation activities; the continued growth of office activities; and general growth of travel on the State Highway and Interstate Freeway through the area.
Given the projected expansion of the Ventura County economy (subsequent to general economic recovery in the nation and southern California) and the continued popularity of Southern California as a destination for recreation at tourist activities, the demand for hotel-motel facilities is projected to increase in the future at rates comparable to, but somewhat lower than, those experienced during the last 20 years.
While an average of 120 rooms per year were constructed between 1960 and 1991, the 1980s are generally seen as a period of over-building hotel rooms throughout Southern California. Thus, an average of 95 rooms per year are projected for the next 20 years.
Table ED-9 provides an analytical overview of the residual demand for hotel and motel facilities. Currently, there is a competitive inventory of 3,607 rooms with an overall occupancy 59% occupancy rate, whereas an occupancy rate of 65 % is the acceptable break-even level under normal hotel measurement criteria and 70% is the acceptable stabilized operating level. Thus, if this same number of rooms that are now in demand were in a market with an occupancy rate of 65% or 70%, the total inventory would be 3,274 or 3,040, less rooms than currently exist. Therefore, there is an estimated over-supply of 332 to 566 rooms.

Total supportable inventory at 65% occupancy rate	3,274

Projected absorption, 20 years	1,900
Total potential new supply, 20 years (absorption less current oversupply)	1,334 to 1,568
Given that the absorption rate is projected to continue at 95 rooms a year, the market could support an additional 1,900 rooms over the next 20 years. Adjusting for the current oversupply, a total of 1,334 to 1,568 rooms could be absorbed in the inventory over the next 20 years.
Potential Facilities in Port Hueneme - The City of Port Hueneme currently has 294 rooms, approximately 8% of the existing inventory in the larger area. Assuming a sustained continued capture of future activity, it is estimated that an additional 106 to 125 rooms may be built in the City over the next 20 years. While some of the hotels and motels in close proximity to the Navy base appear to have occupancy rates above the overall average, a large component of their clientele is related to the Base. Base-related activity is not expected to increase nor is the general level of business activity in Port Hueneme expected to increase substantially. Therefore, the market support for new hotels in the area will primarily be drawn from tourist activity. Some non-Base business support may be attracted by a facility in a particularly attractive location (i.e. with a water view) with meeting room facilities.

Given the source of market support, the location of a new facility in Port Hueneme is critical. A site on or within an easy walk to the car compete effectively with other facilities in the market. A location directly on the beach may actually be able to increase Port Hueneme's share of the market beyond 8%.
The extent to which the market is now overbuilt suggests that development of a new facility is not feasible until the latter part of this decade.
Industrial Analysis
Table ED-10 estimates the amount of industrial building space (in square feet) constructed between 1980 and 1990 in the entire five-county Southern California region. For this eleven-year period, industrial construction within the region totaled 246.9 million square feet, or an average of 22.4 million per year. During the latter five years of this period, regional industrial construction accelerated to an average 24.9 million square feet annually. These estimates were derived by dividing the total value of industrial development in each year (as reported in building permit data) by an average construction factor of $42.56 per square foot. The annual building permit valuation figures were adjusted to 1990 constant dollars to correspond to the $42.56 factor which reflects 1990 cost levels.
A shift in the location of industrial growth from Los Angeles County to Orange, San Bernardino and, Riverside Counties can be seen by examining shares of growth: Los Angeles County's share of growth over the eleven-year period was 47% but only 14% from 1986 to 1990. In contrast, Orange County's share of growth over the eleven years was 19% while its share was 45% from 1986 to 1990; San Bernardino county's share over the eleven-year period was 19% but 25% from 1986 to 1990; and, Riverside County's share was 9% over the eleven-year period but increased to 12% from 1986 to 1990.

Ventura County did not share in the overall increase in industrial activity in the region. Ventura County captured 6.8% of the growth in the eleven-year period—the smallest share of growth among all five counties. The County's share of growth decreased to only 4.8% of industrial activity from 1986 to 1990. In absolute terms, the average annual amount of industrial space developed in Ventura was 1.5 million from 1980 to 1990 while between 1986 and 1990 the annual average was 1.2 million.
Table ED-10 also estimates the amount of industrial building space constructed within Ventura County, by location. From 1980 to 1990, industrial activity within the County took place primarily in Camarillo, Simi Valley, Oxnard, Ventura, and in Moorpark. Eighty-five percent of all industrial activity took place within these cities. These same five cities captured 87% of the growth from 1986 to 1990. Both Moorpark and Oxnard increased their capture rate of industrial growth in the latter five years. Moorpark captured 11% of new industrial activity in the County from 1980 to 1990, however, it captured 19% of new activity from 1986 to 1990. Oxnard captured 16% of the growth from 1980 to 1990 while it captured 29% of the growth from 1986 to 1990.
In contrast to the above cities, the City of Port Hueneme captured less than 1% of the growth during the last decade.
Current Overview of Port Hueneme and Oxnard Industrial Areas - According to data developed in late 1989 for the Oxnard General Plan, Oxnard has 1,364 acres of vacant land zoned for various types of industrial activity. These included 473 acres for business and research park, 439 acres for limited industrial activity, 216 acres for light industrial activity, 50 acres in the central industrial acre, and 186 acres of industrial activity that is coastal dependent.

	The vast majority of this area is located just south of Interstate 101, thereby providing direct access to that freeway. Discussions with local industrial real estate brokers indicate that the industrial areas in close proximity to Interstate 101 are considered prime locations and have historically sold for about $5.50 to $6.50 a square foot. The Channel Islands Business Center on Highway 1 is considered a less attractive industrial alternative selling historically in the $5.50 range. The Hueneme Road Industrial Area, just east of Port Hueneme, historically has sold for about $4.50 to $5.00 a square foot, but has generated relatively little interest. The somewhat lower prices in the latter area do not appear to be a widely accepted trade-off for the location. (Historical prices are provided for purposes of comparison among areas as the current recession has drastically reduced the level of activity. Prices of sales that do occur are often very low. For example, a recent sale just south of 101 was $4.25 per square foot). The industrial area in Port Hueneme is on Hueneme Road (extending southward), just west of Oxnard's Hueneme Road Industrial Area. Currently, there are 10.08 acres of vacant land as well as some underutilized acreage. The Hueneme Road Industrial Area in Oxnard is host to a number of older heavy, industrial users. Newer users include ten harbor-related businesses (off-shore support, vehicle processing center, welding services, marine services), one naval base-related business, and five non-coast related businesses (two manufacturers of impression material for dental products, a component assembler of window shutters, a sand blaster, and a manufacturer of metal castings). Several of the harbor-related businesses had been located in the Harbor District or on the Naval Base but were required to move to accommodate other activity. The industrial area in the City of Port Hueneme is host to thirteen businesses, of which four businesses may be classified as harbor-related (a welding service, fish processor, boat builder, and marine industrial supply company), a manufacturer of metal castings, two self-storage businesses, an auto repair shop, an auto parts store, a dog obedience school, a dollmaker and a surfboard repair service. In addition, there are two businesses that have closed and a VFW post.
CITY OF FOR T HUENEME GENERAL PLAN	ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT 32
Projected Industrial Activity in Port Hueneme - The industrial area in Port Hueneme and the nearby industrial area in Oxnard are in a location that serves harbor-related activity. However, off-shore oil activity is not expected to expand. Further, the relatively small amount of land required to support current cargo shipments through the Port suggests that any changes in the level of cargo shipped through the Harbor District would most likely not result in a major change in land requirements. This does not preclude potential need for land by new users of the harbor. It does suggest that identifiable ongoing land requirements will not be generated by harbor-related activity.
The industrial area in Port Hueneme and the nearby industrial area in Oxnard also provide a lower-cost alternative to Oxnard industrial areas that are closer to Interstate 101 or population centers. However, the relatively low level of industrial growth in the vicinity of Port Hueneme appears to indicate that the price level is not a widely accepted trade-off for sites that are some distance from prime locations.
(A few industrial users in the Port Hueneme industrial area and Oxnard's Hueneme Road Industrial Area indicated that one of the reasons they had originally chosen their location was its rural surroundings. Although this may still be true for some sites in Oxnard, it is not true for industrial land in Port Hueneme.)
Given the above considerations within the context of the particularly limited penetration of the City into the County-wide industrial market, as well as the limited penetration of the County into the Southern California industrial market, we have concluded that there is no practical basis for forecasting specific demand by industrial users at this time. Any such users would exhibit sporadic demand patterns related to some degree to overall demand for industrial land in southeastern Ventura County.
These practical marketing constraints indicate that the alternatives available to the City are: (1) to essentially landbank the industrial area for the long-term, or (2) to consider alternative land uses that may be more likely to generate near-term revenue to the City.

Summary of Fiscal The fiscal impact analysis of General Plan land use identifies Impact Analysis incremental costs and revenues of the proposed new develop-
ment. Likely costs and revenues were identified through discussions with department heads, in conjunction with review of the City budget and the Cost Control System report. Given that the proposed new development will take place within an urbanized setting and represents a relatively small increase in overall development, additional costs to the City will be minimal relative to additional revenues. Thus, incremental and administrative cost categories such as Legislative Management Services and Finance are assumed to be negligible. The analysis uses constant 1992 dollars. (Only property tax revenue is adjusted and it is adjusted annually downward to represent the likelihood that the 2% cap on assessed valuation will prevent the value from rising at the same rate as other revenues and costs.)

The timing of development is based on findings of the market analysis as well as the mix of development under each Alternative.
	•	It is expected that housing starts will be stronger by the end of this year. Thus, housing development begins in Year 2 at a rate of 45 dwelling units per year. This start date and the annual average does not change with the total number of units, so that a higher number of units means that development will continue to occur further into the future. •	Hotel development is projected to occur around Year 10. •	Industrial development is projected to occur around Year 7. •	Commercial development is dependent to a very large extent on growth in the population of the City and nearby Oxnard. Due to the proposed density of 10 dwelling units per acre in all land use alternatives and the use of some sites for non-residential purposes, the potential increase in the City's population is not substantial. New retail development is projected to begin in Year 6 and possibly not be built out for another 10 years. General Plan Land Use policy provides for retail development that is supportable by the permanent and seasonal population in the City and surrounding areas. Visitor-supported commercial development includes a wide range of uses such as water slides, theaters, bowling alleys, etc. A set-aside of some sites for potential interest by developers may be appropriate but these uses should be viewed as possibilities in the long term. As each of these uses have particular site and market needs, the City may wish to solicit developers to determine needs and interest. Given the net fiscal surplus status of all the various development options, recurring cost recovery is adequate. Given the City's location on the Oxnard Plain, there is no anticipated development outside the City that would general fiscal impacts within the City, such as traffic impacts.

However, since the preponderance of developable land is in the redevelopment area, it can be assumed that most of the tax increment, less any passthroughs would be available to the redevelopment agency.

Goals, Policies The Economic Development Program is organized by three and Actions major topics or goals. They are:
1)	General Fund Revenue Enhancements through increasing property tax, sales tax and hotel tax revenues.
2)	Intergovernmental Revenue Enhancements with such entities as the CBC, Port District and City of Oxnard (e.g. Ormond Beach).
3)	Redevelopment Programming including the Market Street area and the Sunkist site.
Each goal, which sets an ideal for the future, is accompanied by a series of policies and actions. Policies give more specific direction than a goal and provide a clear commitment of intent. Actions are specific steps, programs, etc., which state the means to implement the policies. To ensure that the goals, policies and actions remain relevant, the Economic Development Element requires an update approximately every five years.
The following presents the goals, policies and actions for economic development in the City of Port Hueneme:
GOAL 1 : TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF SALES TAX REVENUE CAPTURED BY THE CITY OF PORT HUENEME.
Policy 1.1: Attract 114,000 square feet of new community and neighborhood-serving retail development by 2010 in order to maximize market potential.
Action 1.1. P. The City should encourage the types of community and neighborhood-serving stores that currently serve the City. This may involve such activity as direct solicitation of headquarters of chain stores and placement of advertisements in trade journals.

GENERAL PLAN
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
42
Action 1.1.2: The City should monitor interest in Port Hueneme by owners of independent stores through inquiries received by the Chamber of Commerce, City Business License section, Building and Safety Division, and Planning Division. The purpose of such monitoring efforts is to identify individual businesses that may not be identified through other means.
Action 1.1.3: The City should improve lines of communication between retailers and the City, through periodic forums or a designated City contact person, on issues of concern. Issues of concern to the current retail base may impact the perception of business owners considering Port Hueneme as a new location. On-going efforts to address issues provide a means not only for resolution, but for further understanding and clarification.
Action 1.1.4: The City should develop, in conjunction with the Chamber of Commerce, an on-going program to promote the City's shopping opportunities to residents of Port Hueneme and surrounding communities. Existence of such a program supports efforts to capture new retail activity in Port Hueneme.
Action 1.1.5: The City should retain high standards regarding landscape and design requirements for commercial buildings.
Action 1.1.6: The City should consider encouraging unique design features and/or amenities in future shopping centers.
This can be achieved through the planning review process during which the City indicates its wishes, formal design guidelines and design review process, or a height and/or density bonus.
Policy 1.2: Secure the City's existing community-serving commercial core along Channel Islands Boulevard and Ventura Road thus retaining sales tax revenue in the City, to meet the needs of the current and projected population.
Action 1.2.1: The City should implement an outreach program to encourage existing businesses to stay in the City and improve lines of communication between retailers and the City on issues of concern among the retail community.

43
Action 1.2.2: The City should develop, in conjunction with the Chamber of Commerce, an on-going program to promote the City's shopping opportunities to residents of surrounding communities as well as to residents of Port Hueneme.
Action 1.2.3: The City should monitor the condition/status of the older shopping centers and small, under-utilized commercially-zoned parcels and determine if and when public assistance is required. Conditions such as multiple ownership may inhibit the ability of developers to recycle without City intervention, regardless of development pressures.
Action 1.2.4: The City should continue provision and maintenance of such public amenities as median landscaping.
Policy 1.3: Explore methods, in addition to attracting and retaining retail activity within the City, to obtain sales tax revenue.
Action 1.3.1: The City should pursue industrial firms that generate sales tax revenue and are able to use Port Hueneme as their base for reporting tax receipts.
Action 1.3.2: The City should continue to monitor businesses in the City to ensure that sales taxes are reported accurately in respect to point of sales and method of allocation.
Action 1.3.3: The City should monitor hotel, lodging, and resort-related markets for indications of opportunities to attract such uses. Consideration should be given to the value of ocean views/proximity such as afforded by the Sunkist site, and other ocean front locations.

GENERAL PLAN
44
	GOAL 2: ENCOURAGE AND ACCOMMODATE GROWTH IN INDUSTRIAL OR RELATED OFFICE ACTIVITY OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES WHILE MAINTAINING FLEXIBILITY TO PURSUE ALTERNATIVE LAND USES AS MARKET OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES. Policy 2.1: Increase, as market conditions permit, the number of firms within the existing industrial area so that approximately 19 acres that are currently vacant will be developed by 2010. Action 2.1.1: The City should pursue, to the greatest extent feasible, industrial firms that generate sales tax revenue and are able to use Port Hueneme as their base for reporting tax receipts. Close coordination should be maintained with the CBC and the Port District. Action 2.1.2: The City should pursue industrial firms that are most likely to be good corporate citizens, i.e., voluntarily complying with regulations, participating in community events and organizations, etc. Such a likelihood can be evaluated during the planning process through contact with the jurisdiction from which the firm is relocating, if applicable. Close coordination will be maintained with the CBC and the Port District. Action 2.1.3: The City should establish a marketing program to contact and attract new industrial firms. This marketing program should incorporate an on-going means of evaluating the industrial climate in the nation and in the region to optimize effectiveness in relating market activity to Port Hueneme's goals. Action 2.1.4: The City should encourage the location in the City of firms in industries that are not specifically targeted by the marketing program, if these firms represent job-creation opportunities.

LAND USE ELEMENT
What is the Land Use Element?
The Land Use Element and Land Use Policy Map look to the Port Hueneme of 2015. The Land Use Element includes a Land Use Policy Map which presents a graphic representation - a snapshot - of the City's future.
The element text defines the goals the City will pursue toward this future. Together the text and the map provide the foundation for land use decision making into the next century.
Purpose of the Element: The Land Use Element and the Land Use Policy Map are the two most important components of the General Plan. Together, these two parts of the Plan establish the overall policy direction for land use planning decisions in the City. The Land Use Policy Map displays graphically the location and distribution of land use in Port Hueneme, whereas the element text describes the form these uses will take, as well as the programs the City will pursue to implement the land use goals.
Goals and policies set forth in the Land Use Element shape and reflect the policies and programs contained in the other General Plan elements. For example, the street system and circulation improvements described in the Circulation Element are designed to accommodate the intensity of use allowed by land use policy. Housing Element programs focus on neighborhood stabilization and rehabilitation of single-family units. This is being done to ensure the longterm viability of existing neighborhoods and provide a mix of housing types.
The City intends to achieve a number of objectives through implementation of the goals and policies contained in this element.

CITY OF PORT HUENEME
GENERAL PLAN

Scope and Content: To best address land use issues affecting Port Hueneme, this element is divided into six subsequent sections - Intergovernmental Relationships, Related Plans and Programs, Land Use Issues, Land Use Element Goals and Policies, Land Use Plan, and Implementation of the Land Use Plan. The first three subsections highlight related governmental agencies, plans, and programs which effect land use planning in the City and land issues facing the City. They set the framework for goal formulation and policy and program development. These goals and policies are stated in the fourth subsection.
Lastly, the Land Use Plan describes in detail the Land Use Policy map and identifies how long-term land use policy will be implemented in Port Hueneme while the Implementation subsection describes how the plan will be realized.
Focus of the Small Development Sites: Much of Port Hueneme is Land Use Element urbanized, with little likelihood of changing over the plan’s
time horizon. Preparation of this General Plan focused on vacant areas and areas which redevelopment plans identified as blighted and in need of being recycled to viable uses. Key development areas are summarized in the Land Use Plan subsection and specific redevelopment projects are prioritized in the Implementation subsection. With the exception of vacant retail commercial sites north of Channel Island Boulevard, several properties adjacent the intersection of Pleasant Valley Road and Evergreen Avenue, and a small site on Hueneme Road and "J" Street, all of the small development sites are within the Central Committee's Redevelopment Project Area.
Market Street: The area between the Port, Scott Street, Hueneme Road, and Ventura Boulevard is of special importance. New development in vacant portions of this area, i.e., the western half and along Market Street, must tie into existing commercial uses fronting on Ventura Road, the Museum, the Port, and the Beach area.
The Sunkist Site: . The Land Use Element proposes the Commercial - Visitor-serving category for this 11-acre site providing for visitor-serving and coastal-related commercial uses. This designation remains unchanged from the 1977 General Plan, as amended.

Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory (NCEL) Reuse Site: In April, 1996, the NCEL was operationally closed and its mission and personnel transferred to the adjacent USNCBC. The General Plan proposes the “Port” land use category for the former NCEL site to accommodate port and coastal-related industry. Seawall and waterfront access together with some recreation and visitor-serving uses are also included within the overall plan for this site.
Pleasant Valley Road Extension: The extension of Pleasant Valley Road across the US Navy Construction Battalion Center (CBC) to connect with Victoria Avenue is shown and addressed in detail in the General Plan Circulation Element.
The Military and the Port: An important objective of the General Plan is the establishment of stronger ties and ongoing linkages between the City, the Port and the Military. The 1987 Agreement between the City and Port, and numerous city/military improvements around the perimeter of the CBC have established a strong precedent for continued cooperation between the three primary jurisdictions in Port Hueneme.

Intergovernmental
Relationships
Government agencies at the local, regional, state and federal level influence and affect the City of Port Hueneme. A brief summary of the primary impacts that these agencies have on the City are described below.
Ventura County Air Pollution Control District: The
Ventura County Air Pollution Control District adopted the 1987 Air Quality Management Plan in July 1988. The California Legislature passed the California Clean Air Act (CCAA) shortly after the 1987 AQMP was adopted. The CCAA requires all nonattainment areas (areas which exceed the established air quality standards) in the State to develop plans to meet federal and state air quality standards. As a result, the 1991 AQMP was created. The Plan contains control measures to reduce pollution emissions.
The 1991 AQMP will be revised periodically to comply with new federal planning and additional CCAA requirements. Controls implemented through the Plan could increase business operation costs, making it less desirable for commercial and industrial developments to locate in Port Hueneme and the surrounding area. The Plan, as a result, may limit further development in Port Hueneme.
The City of Port Hueneme has incorporated goals and policies into the Conservation/Open Space/ Environmental Resources Element to adequately address air quality issues confronting the City.
City of Oxnard Wastewater Division: The Oxnard Treatment Plant, maintained by the Oxnard Wastewater Division, treats all wastewater generated within the City of Port Hueneme. The plant's processing capacity recently (1992) increased from 22.6 to 31.7 million gallons/per day.
LAND USE ELEMENT
CITY OF PORT HUENEME
GENERAL PLAN

As a result of structural improvements, the Oxnard Treatment Plant is able to more efficiently handle wastewater from the City. However, Port Hueneme will not currently benefit from capacity increases because the City in 1976 entered an agreement with the Oxnard Treatment Plant establishing a processing limit of 3.7 million gallons per day. Flow in 1996 was estimated to average 2.4 million gallons per day. As a result of capacity increases, Port Hueneme may re-negotiate their contract limit later, if necessary. (See the Circulation/Infrastructure Element for further discussion).
Ventura County Local Agency Formation Commission:
LAFCO is charged with the responsibility for encouraging an orderly formation and development of local government agencies within Ventura County.
The City of Port Hueneme's sphere of influence (the area designated by LAFCO that can be annexed by a jurisdiction) is contiguous with the City's existing boundaries. No additional annexations are anticipated to occur.
Ventura County Regional Council (VCRC): The Association of Ventura County Cities (AVCC) is in the processing of forming a new body - the Ventura County Regional Council - to address planning issues on a subregional level. Issues such as traffic, growth management, water conservation, solid waste management, and open space linkages are some of the issues that the VCRC1 may address.
VCRC policies may result in proposed amendments to the General Plan.
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG): In the latter half of the 1980s, growing regional concern and legislation regarding traffic, air pollution, rising housing costs, and other issues affecting the Southern California community as a whole led SCAG to prepare comprehensive regional plans which address these concerns.
LAND USE ELEMENT
CITY OF POR T HUENEME
GENERAL PLAN

Two plans which affect planning in Port Hueneme include SCAG's Regional Mobility Plan, and Growth Management Plan. These plans intend to work in concert to reduce traffic congestion and pollutant levels. Planning strategies focus on reducing automobile and truck traffic on the regional transportation network, as well as at local levels.
These regional plans contain strategies that directly affect the City of Port Hueneme.
Hueneme and Oxnard Elementary School Districts:
Both school districts educate students from Port Hueneme. Each district does not exclusively serve Port Hueneme and students from other communities attend schools within these districts. In addition, students in Port Hueneme may attend schools outside the corporate limits of the City but within the respective school district.
Hueneme School District operates eleven school sites.
Four of these sites - Bard, Hueneme, Parkview, and Sunkist Elementary Schools - are located in Port Hueneme. The Oxnard School District maintains eighteen school sites.
The Hueneme School District generally includes the eastern portion of Port Hueneme; the Oxnard School District, the northern portion.
New development occurring within Port Hueneme and the surrounding area may increase the number of students within each school district. The Public Safety/Facilities Element addresses these issues relating to schools and establishes goals and policies to guide the education system.
Oxnard Union High School District: The Oxnard High School District encompasses the entire City of Port Hueneme and extends into the Cities of Oxnard and Camarillo. The majority of students in Port Hueneme attend Hueneme High School.
Similarly to the elementary school districts, new development may increase the high school's student population. Refer to the Public Safety/Facilities Element for additional information.

City of Oxnard: The City of Oxnard has a population of approximately 156,000 persons, according to the 1998 California Department of Finance Estimates. Port Hueneme is almost completely surrounded by the City of Oxnard with only a small portion of unincorporated land situated on Port Hueneme's southwestern border.
Due to close proximity of the two cities, policies in either jurisdiction affect the neighboring City. The most significant new development that may occur in Oxnard is along Ormond Beach which is located southeast of Port Hueneme. Development occurring as a result of this plan may impact traffic, air quality, and other issues in Port Hueneme.
A joint planning agreement between the Cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme was created in 1991 to coordinate the development of the specific plan for Ormond Beach. The agreement established that both cities should work together to:
•	create compatible land development policies;
•	develop design standards for Hueneme Road;
•	create a waterfront development program;
•	link non-vehicular transportation networks;
•	evaluate cooperative redevelopment opportunities;
•	plan capital improvements; and
•	evaluate Ormond Beach's economic impact.
Oxnard Harbor District: The City of Port Hueneme and Oxnard Harbor District entered an agreement in March, 1987. The agreement requires the City to consider amending the City's General Plan, Local Coastal Program, and Zoning Ordinance to impose a single zoning classification upon the property owned by the Oxnard Harbor District within the City. The agreement also specifies that the City will institute development policies and standards which streamline permit processing.
LAND USE ELEMENT
CITY OF PORT HUENEME
GENERAL PLAN

In response to this agreement, the City of Port Hueneme is revising its General Plan to include one land use designation for property owned by the Oxnard Harbor District. In addition, the General Plan contains policies to streamline permit processing for District projects.
California Coastal Commission: Port Hueneme adopted a Local Coastal Plan in February 1983 and certified it in 1984. Prior to the adoption of the LCP, the California Coastal Commission had primary responsibility in the jurisdiction over the issuance of development permits for projects which are consistent with Coastal Act policies. Once the LCP was approved, approval of development projects within the coastal zone reverted to Port Hueneme.
Although the City of Port Hueneme has primary responsibility to issue building permits, the Coastal Commission retains discretionary review on appealable projects within the coastal zone.
The Plan section of this Element contains a discussion of Port Hueneme's Local Coastal Plan and the General Plan.
California Regional Water Control Board: The California Regional Water Quality Control Board is responsible for maintaining acceptable water quality.
Water in the City's water system as well as water emitted by sewage outfalls is subject to quality standards set by the Board. The Board also has overall responsibility for the Ventura County Storm Water Management Program implemented by the City in cooperation with Ventura County and the Ventura County Flood Control District under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program (page 17).

Port Hueneme Water Agency (PHWA): The Port Hueneme Water Agency is a joint powers agency formed in 1994 by the City of Port Hueneme and Channel Islands Beach Community Services District (CIBCSD). The purpose of the PHWA is to improve the quality and reliability of drinking water supplies, and to secure adequate water supplies for current and projected future water demands, for four project participants in the Port Hueneme area of coastal Ventura County. The project participants also include the Navy bases at Point Mugu and Port Hueneme.
The PHWA facilities are expected to be fully operational by the beginning of 1999. The project would involve the construction of a regional desalination water treatment plant and various pipelines to : (1) Treat groundwater currently received from the UWCD to meet current and anticipated drinking water standards; (2) Import State Water project water from the Calleguas Municipal Water District and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. These facilities would allow the project participants to meet projected furutre demands for drinking water quality standard with greater reliability and with less dependence on local groundwater resources which are threatened by seawater intrusion. UWCD groundwater would be used to meet minimum daily water demands, while imported state water would be used to meet peak daily demands. A PHWA Environmental Impact Report was certified by the Agency Board of Directors on May 22, 1996.

Related Plans and In addition to locally adopted plans, Port Hueneme is af-Programs fected by a number of regional policies. City and regional
plans which relate to the General Plan are discussed briefly in the following paragraphs.
Ventura County Air Quality Management Plan (1994 with 1995 update): The Ventura County Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) establishes policies and programs for the attainment of federal and state air quality standards. The Plan contains measures to reduce emissions of reactive organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, the two precursors to ozone. In addition to control measures, the report includes information about air quality trends, and emission forecasts.
Many policies and programs from the AQMP have been incorporated into the Conservation/Open Space/Environmental Resources Element.
Transportation Control Measures (1988): As an outgrowth of the 1987 Ventura County Air Quality Management Plan, the City of Port Hueneme is obligated to implement various transportation control measures which serve both to alleviate traffic congestion and reduce photochemical smog. A number of these measures (e.g. jobs/housing balance recommendations) influence policy direction for the distribution of land uses within the City and have been included in the Conservation/Open Space/ Environmental Resources Element.
Ventura County Congestion Management Plan (1991): State law requires that Ventura County create a Congestion Management Program (CMP) prior to the County receiving gas tax monies, made available through Proposition 111. The CMP represents an effort to manage traffic congestion by coordinating the many transportation, land use, and air quality programs in Ventura County. As part of this program, the City of Port Hueneme is required to adopt their own land use impact program and establish policies to maintain LOS standards which are outlined in the Circula-tion/Infrastructure Element.

Port Hueneme Risk Assessment (1990): The Port of Hueneme comprises a significant portion of the City's coastline. Operations occurring in the Port could affect residents and businesses in the City. In 1990, a risk assessment for the Port of Hueneme was prepared which analyzes the potential risk to the surrounding community from facilities and operations at the Port. The report includes specific measures to ensure the safety of Port operations. These measures are incorporated into the Public Safety/Facilities Element.
Seismic Hazards Mapping Act (1990): The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 calls for the delineation of seismic hazard zones bounding areas of high potential for liquefaction, earthquake-induced landslides, and other ground failures.
The principal role of the State is to identify seismic hazard study zones. Based on State prepared maps, the local government is charged with adopting policies to reduce the extent of earthquake damage. Preliminary policies are included in the Public Safety/Facilities Element to support the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act.
City of Port Hueneme Multihazard Functional Plan (1998): The Multihazard Functional Plan provides the basis for disaster response planning in Port Hueneme. (See the Public Safety/Facilities Element for additional information). The Plan addresses the jurisdiction's planned response to extraordinary emergency situations associated with natural disasters, technological incidents, and nuclear defense operations. Operational data, including a listing of resources, key personnel, essential facilities, contacts, and other data needed for conducting emergency operations is also provided.

Ventura County and Incorporated Cities Hazardous Waste Management Plan (1988): The Hazardous Waste Management Plan is designed to ensure that safe, effective, and economical facilities for the management of hazardous wastes are available when they are needed. To attain this goal, the Plan establishes goals, policies, and programs to encourage the safe handling, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials.
The Public Safety Element addresses the hazardous materials issue and incorporates policies from the County's Hazardous Waste Management Plan to manage hazardous materials.
Parks and Recreation Master Plan (1990): The Parks and Recreation Master Plan forms a framework for the future provision and operation of active and passive parks, pedestrian and bicycle paths, recreation and leisure programs, and community service facilities which physically relate to parks provisions. This Plan includes two parts: an inventory of existing recreation facilities in Port Hueneme and a plan that specifies improvements for the future operation of each facility. In addition, the Plan includes a summary of proposed expenditures and available funding sources.
This Plan served as the basis for the development of the parks and recreation portion of the Conservation/ Open Space/Environmental Resources Element.
Water Conservation Retrofit Program (1991): Port Hueneme has adopted a Water Conservation Retrofit Program to decrease the City's water consumption. The program requires all new buildings and all existing buildings which are altered to conform with the American National Standards Institute requirements for ultra-low consumption plumbing fixtures, such as low flush toilets and low flow showerheads. (See the Conservation/Open Space/ Environmental Resources Element).

Fox Canyon Ground Water Management Agency Ordinance 5,1990): State legislation (AB 2995) passed in 1982, created the Fox Canyon Ground Water Management Agency (GWMA) to manage the area's groundwater conditions. In August 1990, the GWMA adopted Ordinance 5 which requires all users of groundwater supplies in their jurisdiction to reduce their pumping from groundwater supplies in accordance with specific date and percentage goals.
Many elements including Land Use, Conservation/Open Space/Environmental Resources, and Circula-tion/Infrastructure address the water supply issue and Ordinance 5.
Urban Water Management Plan (1990): The Urban Water Management Act, adopted in 1985, requires that urban water purveyors serving more than 3,000 acre feet of water a year for municipal use must adopt an urban water management plan. Port Hueneme was one of the 12 water purveyors in the County that were required to comply with this law. In 1990, the City of Port Hueneme adopted an urban water management plan that encouraged water conservation techniques.
The UWMP is the City’s key water planning element which addresses SB 901 Water Supply Assessment requirements. The document assists the City in coordinating land use and water supply planning and helps to ensure that there are adequate water supplies to support proposed development projects. The PHWA water quality and supply improvement project is a key component of the UWMP and has resolved the City’s historical environmental constraints relative to its future water needs.

Port Hueneme Local Coastal Program (1984): Port Hueneme's current LCP was certified by the California Coastal Commission in 1984. The LCP exists as an amendment to the existing (1977) General Plan and discusses the allowable land uses and applicable coastal resource issues for the planning areas within the city's coastal zone. The LCP continues to be implemented as the primary planning document for the coastal zone. The updated General Plan incorporates policies from the LCP to preserve coastal resources. (See the Conservation/Open Space/Environmental Resources Element).
Community Redevelopment Law: California, through the Community Redevelopment Law (Health and Safety Code Sections 33000 et. seq.) authorizes a city to undertake redevelopment projects to revitalize blighted areas. An adopted plan provides additional tools to a city to effectuate productive change. (See the Economic Development Element). These include the use of tax increment (i.e., amount of additional tax revenue above a "frozen" base generated by increased property valuations resulting from new development on the project), property acquisition, consolidation of small parcels, joint public-private partnerships, clearance of land and resale to developers, and relocation of tenants.
A minimum of twenty percent of the tax increment, in most cases, is to used or the development of low and moderate income housing.
Ventura West Specific Plan (1978): The Ventura West Specific Plan, adopted in January 1978, serves as an important redevelopment tool in Port Hueneme. The Plan identifies target areas and outlines specific actions to be undertaken at each site. The objective of the plan is to improve Ventura West as a residential neighborhood through rehabilitation, new construction, and new public improvements, while maintaining the area's role as a housing resource for those of low and moderate income.

Five Year Implementation Plan (1998): Under the requirements of the Community Redevelopment Law Reform Act of 1993, the Port Hueneme Redevelopment Agency adopted a second Five-Year Implementation Plan in December, 1998. This plan covers all three Agency’s Redevelopment Project Areas, and describes the link between the elimination of blight and the proposed actions of the Agency. In summary, the plan describes the specific goals and objectives of the Agency, programs and expenditures to be made over the next five years, and the connection between the Agency’s intended actions and the alleviation of blight. In addition, the Plan serves as a Housing Fund Deficient Reduction Plan; that is, it describes the programs and expenditures to be made over the next five years in furtherance of affordable housing. Under operative statutes, the Five-Year Implementation Plan must conform with the Housing Element of the General Plan.
Cost Control System for the City of Port Hueneme (1992): The Cost Control System report provides the base data for the City of Port Hueneme to chart a future financial course that will preserve the quality of life which local citizens have come to expect. (See the Economic Development Element). The report examines revenue sources and the costs associated with operating existing and future programs and facilities.
City of Port Hueneme Administrative Supplement to the State CEQA Guidelines (1991): To administer CEQA, public agencies are required to adopt objectives, criteria and specific procedures consistent with CEQA and the State CEQA Guidelines. In compliance with this mandate, the City of Port Hueneme has prepared an Administrative Supplement which contains an overview of the environmental review process, a description of the planning department and city council's responsibilities, a discussion of projects that are exempt under CEQA, and an outline of the steps involved in preparing an EIR.

City Landscape Design Standards: The City of Port Hueneme Landscape Design Standards establish the minimum landscape requirements for all new private developments within the community. A plant palette and list of materials that can be utilized for landscaping are included within the document.
South Coast Area Transit Joint Powers Agreement:
South Coast Area Transit (SCAT) is the regional transportation system serving residents of western Ventura County. The system grew out of the merging of the City of San Buenaventura's Citizens Transit Bus Service (which provided transit services to the cities of San Buenaventura and Ojai) and the City of Oxnard's Municipal Bus Lines (which provided transit services to the cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme). A Joint Powers Agreement was signed in 1973 between these four cities. In 1977, the City of Santa Paula and County of Ventura were added as participating members. In 1994, Santa Paula discontinued its membership.
The Board of Directors meets monthly to provide policy formation and direction for SCAT operations. Each Board member has a weighted vote, which is based on the number of service miles traveled throughout each jurisdiction and thus, the amount of annual funds contributed to SCAT operations.
Ventura County Fire Prevention District Joint Powers Agreement: Since incorporation, the City has been serviced by the Ventura County Fire District (VCFD). Throughout the County, the District has 32 fire stations and employs 463 full-time staff and approximately 40 reserve personnel. The 856-square mile service area includes the cities of Port Hueneme, Camarillo, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Simi Valley, Ojai and the unincorporated areas of Ventura County. In addition to field operations, VCFD provides the City with fire safety planning and plan check services for new construction, fire code inspection and enforcement, and hazardous materials containment/cleanup.

Ventura County Storm Water Management Program.
Under provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program, the County of Ventura, Ventura County Flood Control District, and Ventura County cities have joined to adopt a program for managing urban pollutant runoff. The program is governed by NPDES permit No. CAS063339 administered by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board. The program includes specific mitigation measures to manage storm runoff for construction and public work projects as well as long-term measures to reduce pollutants entering waterways through urban runoff.

Land Use Issues As part of the update to the Port Hueneme General Plan, the General Plan Advisory Committee reviewed a number of issue papers. These papers presented key issues to be addressed in the General Plan. The committee met over a period of several months to discuss and present their opinions concerning each issue area.
The following section is comprised of two parts: general issues and environmental constraints. The section sets forth the primary issues to be resolved and serves as the background data to guide future policies in the City.
The issues identified in this section provide the foundation on which Land Use Element Goals and Policies are based.
Housing Trends: Single-family homes comprise a substantial portion (58 percent) of Port Hueneme's housing stock, according to the 1990 Census. However, the type of housing development in the City has shifted from singlefamily homes to multi-family units.
This intensification of land use occurred as a response to market demand, and the fact that land and development costs, coupled with redevelopment and state housing policy requirements, necessitated multi-family densities.
Population growth resulting from residential development provides additional support for retail activity in a City. However, a substantial portion of the residential development can be attributed to second-home owners. Second-home buyers provide some additional support for housing in Port Hueneme, but they provide only marginal support for retail activity as a result of the shorter-term nature of their visits.
Commercial Trends: Commercial development in Port Hueneme includes both retail uses and hotels.
Retail uses, located in Port Hueneme, serve local neighborhoods within the community. New retail space supportable by population growth in Port Hueneme and nearby Oxnard is estimated to be 42,000 square feet by 2000 and 114,000 square feet by 2010.
LAND USE ELEMENT
CITY OF PORT HUENEME
GENERAL PLAN
18
	New retail development will be similar to existing uses because limited opportunities exist to attract retail uses that serve the region, such as large discount stores. Stores with regional markets usually have site requirements that exceed the largest parcels in Port Hueneme. Opportunities for future hotel development in Port Hueneme are limited. Existing hotels experience low occupancy rates and clientele from businesses and the Navy Base are not anticipated to increase. Overall, the extent to which the market is now overbuilt suggests that development of a new facility is not feasible until the latter part of this decade. Industrial Trends: The City of Port Hueneme has experienced little industrial growth in recent years, primarily due to the amenities other sites in adjacent cities can offer. The industrial sector's slow growth is anticipated to continue because sites in the Cities of Oxnard and Camarillo are located closer to Interstate 101. However, harbor related industries, located in Port Hueneme, are anticipated to expand as a result of potential joint use initiatives with the USNCBC and Port acquisition of the NCEL site. U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Center: The U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Center (USNCBC) occupies over half of Port Hueneme's land area. The size and configuration of this property effectively fragments the north and south portions of the community. Although the City has no direct jurisdiction over the USNCBC, naval operations substantially impact the City's land use patterns. Some means of cooperation between the City and USNCBC can be accomplished through the General Plan. The General Plan focuses on areas of joint concern and benefit for the City and the U.S. Navy. Principal areas of interest include: 1. Potential consolidation, and possible relocation, of certain Base activities;

2.	Private/public use of select Base properties through sale, lease and joint use agreements; and
3.	Opportunity for traffic improvements including the widening of Channel Islands Boulevard/ Ventura Road intersection, widening of Pleasant Valley Road west of Ventura Road, and a street connection from Pleasant Valley Road to Victoria Street to improve north-south circulation and to create a link between Port Hueneme and the Channel Islands Marina.
Port of Hueneme/Harbor: The Port of Hueneme is an important commercial/industrial area of the City, under the jurisdiction of the Oxnard Harbor District. The Port is a facility of statewide significance, being the only deep water harbor between Los Angeles and San Francisco.
In 1978, the District adopted a Master Plan for the Port and had it certified by the California Coastal Commission. At that time, the primary cargo was liquid bulk petroleum products for the Southern California Edison (SCE) Ormond Beach Power Plant. Although the Port maintains the capability of handling the same level of through put, there has been a significant decrease in liquid bulk tonnage due to SCE's trend away from liquid petroleum and toward natural gas fuels. During this same period, however, general cargo has increased annually.
Today, the District's primary emphasis has shifted to general cargo (break bulk, neo-bulk, (i.e., cars) limited containers, and dry bulk). General cargo destined for world trade markets including imports and exports, is carried on larger vessels requiring 30 to 35 feet of water depth. Commodity types consist of bananas, automobiles, fresh fruit (California citrus), lumber products and wood pulp.
The District foresees a continuation of the present type and mix of commodities handled with an emphasis on world trade imports and exports. Consequently, it plans to modernize and upgrade existing facilities in line with its existing (1987) Master Plan, as amended.

Specific uses as to land, water and wharf areas within the confines of the harbor are governed by the Port Master Plan authored and administered through the Oxnard Harbor District. While the Oxnard Harbor District is the agency principally responsible for overall implementation of the Port Master Plan, the City of Port Hueneme, under its vested "police powers," retains development review and permit authority within the harbor.
Key Development Parcels: Figure LU-1 identifies those parcels where change is anticipated to be most likely to take place. These parcels, totaling nearly 100 acres in area, are believed to have the greatest development (if vacant), redevelopment or infill potential.
Five of the key parcels are wholly or partially vacant, nine include residential uses (often in conjunction with another use), and three are industrial. Commercial uses occupy the remaining parcels or portions. The largest parcel, the NCEL site, totals approximately 34 acres, and the others range from 11 acres down to 0.25 acre. The site acreage, current zoning, current use, future use options, and potential dwelling unit capacity is tabulated for each of the key development sites in Table LU-1. All but five of the parcels are within the redevelopment project area (i.e., parcel 1 on Victoria Avenue, parcel 7 fronting on Pleasant Valley Road east of Ventura Road, and parcel 18 at Port Hueneme Road and "J" Street).

Urban Design: Urban design plans and programs are included in various Port Hueneme projects, including the Hueneme Beach Master Plan, the Surfside Village Redevelopment Project, the Central Gate Improvements for the Port of Hueneme, the NCEL Community Reuse Plan, and development of the Market Street area.
The City has broadened its use of planned development zoning in order to evaluate private projects for site design and architectural quality. Also, the City's various landscape design standards have been consolidated into Landscape Design Guidelines.
The application of urban design standards is not intended to result in unnecessary delays in the planning process. The City continues its emphasis on permit streamlining, including the City Council assuming Planning Commission duties in 1992.
Evolving Land Use: The City has encouraged private reinvestment through density bonuses and zoning enhancements. This process has fostered, and will continue to foster, revitalization of under-used and "blighted" areas. Care is being taken to avoid adverse impacts on singlefamily neighborhoods, since the process of revitalization often requires an intensification of land use. Development at greater-than-prior densities is usually necessary to achieve an adequate return on investment.
Increase in land use intensity results in greater demands on city services. Fortunately, this is not a major concern in Port Hueneme, since basic utility systems and services are well established, and the compact nature of the city has an "economy of scale" effect.
While overcrowding is a concern in several older multifamily areas of the city, it has not caused an undo strain on city services. The principal problems with overcrowding are the adverse effect on public health and safety, and resultant blighting effects on property.

Environmental Environmental constraints in Port Hueneme include water Constraints availability and quality, sewage treatment capacity, sand
replenishment and the beach, seismic safety, flooding, hazardous materials, and noise. These constraints are considered in the General Plan to protect the environment and City residents.
Water Quality: The Port Hueneme Water Agency (PHWA, joint powers agency), on May 22, 1996, certified an Environmental Impact Report on its program to address the water quality and supply environmental constraints identified below. The City is underlain by a large ground-water basin called the Oxnard Basin. Groundwater is located in a series of multiple aquifers that are confined under artesian pressure and are separated from one another by continuous layers of silt or clay. Groundwater movement is normally toward the coast and natural discharge is offshore through submerged outcrop areas.
During 1995 and 1996, the City’s three standby emergency wells began to flow to the surface under artesian pressure. Two of the wells flow directly into the Bubbling Springs and one well discharge pipe has been capped. Possible causes of this condition include groundwater recharge by the United Water Conservation District and the fact that the City of Oxnard did not pump from local wells in 1995 and 1996.
Due to overpumping from irrigation of agricultural lands in the Oxnard-Port Hueneme area since the 1920s, groundwater levels decreased and sea water invaded aquifers near the coast. Since the late 1960s, sea water intrusion into coastal aquifers has been significantly reduced due to decreased irrigation pumping related to conversion of farmlands to urban uses. However, information developed by the United States Geological Survey found in the Regional Aquifer System Assessment (1996), indicates that there is an overall deficit of groundwater recharge into the Oxnard Plain groundwater basin, and an inflow of seawater into the upper aquifer system persists. Groundwater levels throughout the City are generally shallow, especially near the ocean and declining to the north.

Domestic water is purchased by the City from the United Water Conservation District, which has historically received both imported and well water. Water is brought into the City by a pipeline along Pleasant Valley Road. In addition to this source of water, three emergency wells are located within the City. Domestic water received from the United Water Conservation District meets all established primary water quality standards. However, not all secondary water quality standards have been met, including total dissolved solids (TDS).
The Port Hueneme Water Agency water quality improvement program was designed to mitigate the water quality environmental constraint. The PHWA water quality goal is to reduce the UWCD total dissolved solids and hardness from about 1,100 ppm and 500 ppm to 370 ppm and 150 ppm, respectively. The desalination treatment plant operations will ensure that anticipated future drinking water quality regulations are met. The PHWA will also import State Water Project water, which has the same water quality as the PHWA water quality goal, into the coastal Ventura County area.
The desalination plant will discharge brine which initially will be disposed of into the Regional Wastewater Treatment Facilities (RWTF). This brine discharge will consume part of the RWTF plant capacity allocated to the agencies obtaining water from the desalination plant. This issue is discussed further under Sewage Treatment Plant Capacity, below.
The Ventura County Flood Control District is pursuing a project to line both the Oxnard Industrial Drain and the J Street Drain. These projects are expected to be completed by 1999. Upon completion of the lining of these drains, PHWA is expected to be able to discharge brine directly into the drains, since the brine would no longer be able to enter the groundwater basin through this path.

Water Supply: State legislation (AB 2995), passed in 1982, created the Fox Canyon Ground Water Management Agency (GMA) to manage groundwater supplies overlying and underlying the Fox Canyon aquifer. GMA's jurisdiction encompasses a number of communities including Moorpark, Camarillo, Oxnard, Port Hueneme, and portions of Ventura. The GMA was formed as a condition to receiving a State Water Resources Control Board grant to deter sea water intrusion. (When groundwater is over-pumped, sea water can infiltrate the aquifer and degrade water quality.)
In August 1990, the GMA adopted Ordinance 5 which requires all applicable users of groundwater supplies to reduce their pumping. Reductions are based on a strict formula that requires users to reduce their water consumption in 5% increments every five years (see Table LU-2). The goal is to achieve a 25% reduction in groundwater consumption by the year 2010. Each 5% reduction is calculated from the user's base year water consumption (historical allocation), which is the average water usage by that particular user between 1985 and 1989.
Like all jurisdictions extracting water from groundwater resources within GMA's jurisdiction, Port Hueneme is required to limit its water usage. The United Water Conservation District, which provides water to Port Hueneme, has a base year consumption rate of 3,593 acre feet. According to the target dates, the following water consumption reduction schedule will be required:

1995	3,234 acre-feet	10%
2000	3,054 acre-feet	15%
2005	2,880 acre-feet	20%
2010	2.694 acre-feet	25%
Reduction each year is calculated from the base year consumption rate of 3,593 acre feet.
During the 1991-1992 fiscal year, Port Hueneme utilized 2,683 acre feet of water. Due to the implementation of water conservation best management practicies, this is greatly reduced from 1990-1991 consumption rate of 3,009 acre feet; and 1989-1990, 3,349. Ordinance 5, if fully implemented, requires Port Hueneme to reduce its water consumption to 2,694 acre feet in the year 2010. The City must continue to conserve water or obtain another source of water to achieve the year 2010 reduction goal.
The Port Hueneme Water Agency water supply improvement program was designed to mitigate the water supply environmental constraint. The project will provide two independent water supply sources, namely 75% groundwater from UWCD and 25% State Water Project water from CMWD/MWD.
The delivery pipelines from each of these supply sources would have adequate capacity to serve the entire future projected demands including peak hour and fire flow capacity required by the four project participants if the other source were curtailed. The water quality and quantity objectives of the PHWA would not be met if untreated UWCD water were the sole source of supply.

The treatment facility is only sized to meet current average day (1996) demand. Expansion of the treatment facility to meet future average day demand would require the installation of additional treatment facilities and would require additional enviromental review. Future peak demands could be met by expanding the treatment facilities or by increasing the amount of imported State Water Project water from CMWDZMWD (see Table LU-3).

Table LU-4 below summarizes treatment plant capacity and the relation of brine discharge to plant capacity ownership of each of the agencies participating in the Port Hueneme Water Agency improvements program. Total brine discharge from the desalination facility at peak performance is estimated to be 600,000 gallons per day (0.6 mgd). Port Hueneme Water Agency members are responsible for the following percentages of brine discharge: City of Port Hueneme, 54%; Channel Islands Beach Community Services District, 15%; US Naval Construction Battation Center, 16%; and US Navy Point Mugu 15%.

Sand Replenishment and the Beach: The maintenance of sandy beaches is critical because beaches serve as natural buffers between wave action and easily eroded uplands. Sandy beaches tend to dissipate wave energy, yet incur very little damage. Naturally occurring buffer zones (such as coastal sand dunes) are generally more effective at reducing wave damage and protecting the coastline than man-made protective devices. Extensive beach erosion can result in loss of recreational values and their contribution to tourism, and loss of protection from storm and wave damage.

Coastal and beach erosion occurs along the Ventura-Oxnard coast. The direction of littoral drift of sand is predominantly from northwest to southeast (downcoast), although temporary reversals do occasionally occur during summer and fall. The estimated annual sand transport rate for the Port Hueneme to Point Mugu littoral subcell is 1.254 million cubic yards. The Port Hueneme Harbor entrance has a major impact on this littoral transport as do flood control structures and reservoirs on the rivers and streams in Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. These structures reduce the peak waterflows, indirectly reducing the amount of sand reaching the coast.
Locally, the Port Hueneme Harbor was constructed in 1940 at the end of the Hueneme submarine canyon. The harbor jetties, acting in conjunction with the submarine canyon, intercept most, if not all, of the littoral transport. This sand is then effectively prevented from reaching Hueneme Beach and areas to the south.
To offset this erosion, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers initiated a sand bypassing project in 1953 to mechanically transfer sand past the harbor mouth. The construction of Channel Islands Harbor in 1960 included a sandtrap, from behind which sand is dredged every two years and deposited downcoast of the harbor entrance. Average annual volumes of sand that have been bypassed between the first maintenance cycle in 1960 to 1993 have been equivalent to a beach replenishment rate of about 1.06 million cubic yards per year. The width of the beach south of Port Hueneme is directly related to the amount of sand artificially delivered to it from the Channel Islands Harbor.
Seismic Safety: The entire Southern California region, including the City of Port Hueneme, is a seismically active area. An abundance of active, potentially active and inactive faults traverse the area. No faults are known to pass through the City; therefore, no part of the City is located within a designated Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone.

	However, regional faults capable of producing ground shaking within the City include the Oak Ridge fault, the Simi fault, the Santa Cruz fault, the Malibu Coast fault, the San Cayentano fault, the Santa Ynez fault, the Santa Susana fault, and the San Andreas fault (see Figure LU-2). Ground shaking, rather than surface fault rupture, is the cause of the most damage during earthquakes. The severity, or intensity, of ground shaking is largely dependent on the size (magnitude) of the earthquake; the distance from the fault that generated the earthquake; and the underlying geologic material. Ground shaking can cause considerable damage to structures, especially older unreinforced masonry buildings. A recent study undertaken by the City found no such structures in Port Hueneme. Newer construction techniques provide a greater level of protection from groundshaking. In addition to causing ground shaking, earthquake ground motion may also contribute to secondary seismic hazards including: subsidence, soil liquefaction and tsunamis. Subsidence is sinking of the ground surface caused by lowering of the groundwater table or removal of fluids (oil or water) from the subsurface strata. Several incidents of subsidence have occurred on the Oxnard Plain, but most have been manmade fill or very loose material, and were not seismically related. This potential is considered low within the City. Liquefaction is a condition which occurs when unconsolidated, saturated soils change to a near-liquid state during groundshaking. For liquefaction potential to exist, three principal conditions must usually be met: soil relative density less than 70 percent; the water table within the upper 40 feet of soils; and poorly graded soils. The Oxnard Plain has a high ground water table and is underlain by several saturated aquifers. A general potential for liquefaction exists throughout the entire area.

	Tsunamis, or seismic sea waves, are generated by undersea seismic movement. The Ventura County coast has a low tsunami damage potential, but may be unsafe during such an event. These waves are not common and Port Hueneme is somewhat sheltered from tsunamis generated in the North Pacific by the Channel Islands; however, it is relatively exposed to tsunamis generated in the South Pacific. Flooding: In Port Hueneme, potential flood hazards may result from overflow of natural watercourses and man-made drainage systems due to excessive and unusual storm run-off or high ocean tides. The storm drainage and flood control system within the City generally consists of surface drainage with limited storm drains. Bubbling Springs is the major flood control channel constructed in the City. Runoff through this system ultimately drains to the ocean. Other runoff collected is diverted to the harbor. The City's existing storm drain system and flood control facilities generally have sufficient capacity to protect developed areas from flooding. However, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified a localized area that is subject to flooding during the 100-year flood. The 100-year flood is based on historical records which suggest that a flood of this size would be expected to occur on the average of once within a 100-year period. Technically, a 100-year flood has a one-percent chance of occurring within a given watershed in any given year (Note: the 100-year flood designation does not mean that this level of runoff will occur only once every hundred years). In Port Hueneme, the 100-year flood area includes the harbor, flood control channels, and beach. The extent of potential flooding is shown in Figure LU-3. The City of Port Hueneme is a participant in the National Flood Insurance Administration Program through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which provides federal flood insurance subsidies and federally financed loans for property owners in flood prone areas.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), through the Flood Insurance Program has identified and mapped those areas of Port Hueneme at risk to periodic flooding. The resulting Flood Insurance Map (FIRM) is designed for flood insurance and floodplain management applications. The FIRM includes flood zone designations for special areas which may be subject to flooding and the anticipated floodwater depths in these areas.
Hazardous Materials: Hazardous materials are present in various forms and concentrations throughout the City of Port Hueneme. The major concerns regarding these materials include the activities at the Port of Hueneme and on Navy controlled properties; the transport of these materials through the City; and the storage and use of hazardous materials within industrial, commercial and residential areas.
The area of most concern relates to port activities. Operations at the port include storage and transfer of offshore drilling equipment, automobiles, petroleum fuels, produce and other products. Activities also occasionally include temporary storage of drilling muds. In general, the only potentially hazardous materials handled in bulk at the Port are petroleum fuels. This includes fuel imported for the Southern California Edison (SCE) electric power-generating plant, fuel for vessels, and fuel used by the offshore oil industry.
Petroleum fuel storage is limited to two tank facilities: the SCE tank farm northeast of the harbor and the Tesoro tank farm located along Hueneme Road immediately north of the Sunkist Site.

The results of the risk assessment prepared for the Port indicate that the probability of a fire or explosion at these facilities is extremely low. This is because the tanks are constructed with weak seam roofs which release under low pressure and direct explosions skyward; no flammable materials are handled (only combustible); there are no open flames or other sources of ignition present at the facility; and the most common cause of tank explosions is lightning which is not prevalent in southern California. The probabilities of accidental release at the SCE facility would be approximately the same as for the Tesoro facility.
Various hazardous materials such as drilling muds, chemicals, waste oil, etc. generated by offshore oil industry are periodically brought into the Port by support vessel and then transferred to truck for disposal. It is possible that combustible or flammable materials may be brought in and that a transfer spill could occur and ignite. The size of such a fire would not be large enough to create a radiant heat hazard footprint that would extend off the Port property.
Also, various hazardous materials such as acids and solvents are periodically brought into the Port by truck and transferred to oil industry support boats. Transfer accidents from these activities are possible and would be similar to those described above.
Noise: Excessively high noise levels endanger the public's health and welfare. Certain land uses are more sensitive to noise than others (i.e., schools). As a result, federal and state agencies have established noise/land use compatibility guidelines. These guidelines are all based upon cumulative noise criteria such as Leq (equivalent noise level), CNEL, or Ldn. These standards state that it is normally unacceptable for residential uses, schools, libraries, churches, hospitals, and nursing homes to be exposed to noise levels over 65 dB. Other land uses may be exposed to higher noise levels, such as playgrounds, neighborhood parks, golf courses, office buildings, industrial, manufacturing, and agriculture uses. The Noise Element contains an evaluation of the current noise environment and future noise levels in relation to established noise standards.

The Land Use Plan This section of the Land Use Element identifies the pattern of land use in Port Hueneme and describes the standards for future development. The Land Use Policy Map visually illustrates land use distribution, and the text indicates the types and intensities of uses permitted within each land use category depicted on the map.
Under the Land Use Plan, mixed-use development will be permitted along Pleasant Valley Road west of Ventura Road (see Figure LU-4, page 45). This strip of land contains commercial uses with some low and medium density uses and several vacant lots. The mixed-use designation would allow commercial uses fronting on Pleasant Valley Road with residential uses facing "C" Street. The vacant lots located south of Scott Street and west of Market Street (i.e., Market Street Landing) will be developed as commercial uses. (See Table LU-5, page 60).
Land Use Policy Maps: The General Plan Land Use Policy Map shows a community with diverse residential neighborhoods and broad opportunities for commercial enterprises. Figure LU-4 shows the Land Use Policy Map for the City's corporate limits at a parcel-specific level.
The map displays land uses for the entire General Plan planning area, which encompasses the City Limits/Sphere of Influence. The map divides the City into various land use categories and assigns each categoiy a name, or land use designation. Land use designations provide necessary information about the type and nature of development permitted at a given location. State law requires that the General Plan provide clear and concise definitions of the land use categories indicated on the Land Use Policy Map. These definitions are provided under the heading "Land Use Classifications".
The Port Hueneme General Plan establishes 11 land use categories. The three residential categories allow for a range of housing types for all density ranges. Three commercial designations and one industrial designation are provided to accommodate and encourage a range of income-generating businesses.

The Public Facilities and Open Space categories are intended, respectively, to protect public lands for necessary public service and open space uses. Finally, the Transportation designation applies to major transportation corridors which facilitate the movement of people and goods through and within Port Hueneme. This element uses specific urban planning terms to define the 11 land use categories. For residential uses, the term "density" means the population and development capacity of land. Density ranges are expressed in persons per acre or dwelling units (the individual residential living spaces) per acre.
Development "intensity," which applies to non-residential uses, refers to the extent of development on a lot - the total building square footage, building height, the floor area ratio, and/or the percent of lot coverage. The General Plan's Housing Element discusses the relationship between residential densities and factors including income level, family size, overcrowding, senior citizens, second homes, etc. The General Plan proposes replacing the City's current lot coverage and building height standards with floor area ratio standards for non-residential land use designations.
Simply stated, floor area ratio, or FAR, represents the ratio between the total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot and the total area of that lot. Gross floor area includes enclosed mechanical equipment, elevator shafts, lobbies, hallways, storage/maintenance rooms, as well as enclosed above- and below-ground parking. For example, a 20,000 square foot building on a 40,000 square foot lot yields an FAR of 0.50:1, as illustrated in Figure LU-5. The FAR controls use intensity on a lot. A 0.50 FAR allows a low-rise building which covers most of the lot, a mid-size structure with reduced lot coverage, or a tall building with ample surrounding open space. FARs encourage diversity in building design, such as articulated building facades and stepped-back structures.

Mixed-Use Residential - (15-25 dwelling units/acre, commercial 0.5 FAR). The Mixed-Use designation allows for a mixture of retail commercial, office and residential uses in the same building, on the same parcel, or within the same area. The primary uses within this designation are residential; however, commercial use is encouraged when developed in conjunction with residential development. When mixtures of uses occur in the same building, retail uses or offices are usually located on the ground floor with residential or office uses above. This designation applies to properties adjacent to the south side of Pleasant Valley Road west of Ventura Road and is intended to serve as a buffer between Pleasant Valley Road and the Ventura West residential neighborhood. All existing residential uses are allowable activities within this designation; however, the residential density cannot be increased.

Port - Port Activity (FAR 0.75). This category is comprised of all property owned or leased by the Oxnard Harbor district. Specific uses include ship off-loading facilities, warehouses, port related offices, port-related public open space and recreation uses, and fuel storage. Port activity is buffered from nearby residential areas and access is controlled to minimize impacts on city streets.
Open Space (D) - Dedicated Open Space. This open space category includes areas which have been dedicated to a public entity for use as open space. The Open space designation allows some physical development, principally for recreational purposes. This open space category includes City parks and Hueneme Beach.
Public Facility (FAR 0.50). This land use category includes all City, County and other government properties, such as post offices, the Civic Center, public schools and playgrounds, and fire stations. Public Facilities also include public utilities and utility rights of way. Churches are permitted in areas designated for Public Facilities, subject to a Conditional Use Permit.
Military - The military category applies to all properties owned by the federal government and operated by the U.S. Navy. This includes the U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Center (CBC).

Implications of The maximum permitted development intensities specified Land Use Policy in each of the General Plan land use categories enable the
City to anticipate the future level of development citywide and to plan public service and infrastructure needs accordingly. Such maximum intensities permitted by land use policy will not be achieved on every parcel of land. Existing, good quality construction at lower densities and intensities probably will not recycle within the 20-year plan period to more intense uses. Also, lot size constraints and configurations, individual development objectives, unique project designs, and other factors will lead to varying intensities throughout the City.
For the purpose of forecasting growth, certain assumptions must be made about the average level of development expected within each of the General Plan land use designations which allow development. Table LU-4 outlines density/intensity assumptions and indicates the number of residential units, square footage of commercial, industrial, and other anticipated development, as well as forecasts for the resident population of the City at build out.
The Land Use Element provides definitive statements of land use goals. But how does the City achieve these goals? What approaches and resources can be used in the short, medium, and long term to create a strong, viable City?
Land Use Policy represents the City's effort to balance housing choices and to further strengthen the re-tail/commercial sector in Port Hueneme. Compared to the existing condition, overall residential acreage designated under Land Use Policy will increase by 125 acres, resulting from an increase in medium density residential acreage and reductions in low and high density residential uses. Land designated for Retail/General Commercial uses will increase by more than 50 percent and industrial acreage will be doubled primarily as a result of the development of currently vacant land. In addition, four acres of land along Pleasant Valley Road will be designated as Mixed Use.

Relationship of the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance
A general plan establishes policies and goals to guide future development within a community. Once the plan is adopted, the City must implement the general plan through various strategies. One effective tool to implement a general plan is the zoning ordinance. The California Supreme Court has stated that "zoning is intended to represent a considered, specific, and lasting implementation of the broad policy statements of policy of the general plan" (United Outdoor Advertising v. Business, Transportation, and Housing Agency (1988) 44 Cal.3d 242).
Regulations contained in a zoning ordinance are required by law to be consistent with the policies established in the general plan. This requirement for zoning consistency applies to counties, general law cities, and charter cities with a population of more than two million (Government Code Section 658960).
Port Hueneme must ensure that its zoning is consistent with the General Plan. Table LU-5 shows the relationship between the Port Hueneme General Plan land use categories and zone districts. This table indicates how properties citywide should be zoned to be consistent with the General Plan.
On a regular basis, City staff will be using the zoning ordinance to review development proposals to ensure consistency with zoning requirements and, by relationship, General Plan policy. Code enforcement efforts allow the City to identify blight and unsafe conditions and thus implement City revitalization goals.

Relationship of the California Coastal Act and Port Hueneme Local Coastal Program
Adopted in 1976, the California Coastal Act is intended generally to protect the natural and scenic qualities of the California coastal zone. The coastal zone includes both land and water area. Approximately one-half of Port Hueneme's land area lies within the California coastal zone. Over half of the City area within the zone is part of the U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Center (USNCBC). Figure LU-6 illustrates the coastal zone boundaries in Port Hueneme. Except for USNCBC property, the area within the coastal zone is subject to the California Coastal Act.
To meet coastal act requirements, Port Hueneme must have a Local Coastal Program (LCP) certified by the California Coastal Commission. Port Hueneme's current LCP was certified by the California Coastal Commission in 1998. The LCP exists as an amendment to the existing General Plan and discusses the allowable land uses and applicable coastal resource issues for the planning areas within the City's coastal zone. The LCP continues to be implemented as the primary planning document for the coastal zone. Consistent with the coastal act's basic goal to "protect, maintain, and, where feasible, enhance and restore" the coastal zone, the Port Hueneme LCP identifies attainable goals and objectives specifically related to local conditions. The current LCP acts as the baseline for the revised program included as part of this General Plan Update.
The proposed General Plan document will constitute a portion of the City's LCP by including the necessary coastal resources and management policies within the General Plan elements.

Relationship of the General Plan and the California Environmental Quality Act
Within each General Plan element, parenthetical references identify sections of the California Coastal Act to which General Plan policies apply. For example, a policy statement relating to coastal visual resources will be followed by the parenthetical reference (Coastal Act/30251) to indicate that the policy addresses scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas as required by that section of the coastal act. Each General Plan element also contains a table that identifies the coastal act planning and management issue areas included in that element. Table LU-6 indicates where coastal act issues are included in the General Plan. Table LU-7 identifies in which Port Hueneme planning areas the coastal act issues apply.
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires that an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) be prepared if significant adverse impacts could result from a proposed project. The purpose of the EIR, under the provisions of CEQA is "...to identify the significant effects of a project on the environment, to identify alternatives to the project, and to indicate the manner in which these significant effects can by mitigated or avoided" (Government Code Section 21002.2 (a)). The EIR serves as an informational document for use by decision makers, public agencies, and the general public. It is not a City policy document; it does, however, discuss the potential relative impacts of the alternatives identified in the document.
CEQA and CEQA Guidelines recognize the difficulty in preparing an EIR for a General Plan, since it does not represent a specific development proposal with defined project characteristics. In accord with the Guideline provisions, a program EIR is typically prepared to evaluate the impacts of implementing a plan allowing the City to consider broad policy alternatives and program-wide mitigation measures (Section 15168 of CEQA Guidelines).

Redevelopment Redevelopment is the principal means by which cities can affect community revitalization, replacing dysfunctional land and buildings with uses which foster economic development, increase housing opportunities, provide public amenities, enhance urban aesthetics, and promote public health and welfare. To facilitate this process, State law provides a method for financing redevelopment known as "tax increment." At the time a project is created, the assessed value of properties within the boundaries of the designated project area is frozen. Property tax agencies (i.e., school districts, fire districts, etc.) continue to receive revenue based on the assessed value within the frozen base. As assessed property values increase beyond the frozen base, the "increment" of increase is funnelled directly to the Redevelopment Agency to retire accumulated debt. This debt is typically created by a combination of Agency borrowing and issuance of Tax Allocation Bonds. These funds, in turn, are reinvested into the project area to stimulate new development and provide necessary public improvements and supporting infrastructure. When all debt has been retired, all the tax revenue generated from the project area flows back to the appropriate governmental taxing entities. The theory behind this process is to allow cities to rehabilitate blighted areas using their own economic resources.
Harbor (R-70) Redevelopment Project: Redevelopment has long been the mainstay of community revitalization in Port Hueneme dating back to 1962 with creation of the Harbor (R-70) Redevelopment Project (see Figure LU-7). It was through this first project which the City acquired and cleared 37 acres of land for expansion of the Port of Hueneme. The project was carried out over a six-year period and included the acquisition of 120 separate properties along with the relocation of over 200 households and businesses. At a total cost in excess of $10 million, the Project was officially completed in 1972, more than doubling the land area then owned by the Oxnard Harbor District and greatly enhancing cargo throughput capacity of the Port.

Hueneme (R-76) Redevelopment Project: Utilizing dredge spoil from Harbor expansion, the City's first redevelopment effort was followed in 1967 by the Hueneme (R-76) Redevelopment Project, encompassing what later became the Seaview Apartments, Anacapa View Condominiums and Single Family Homes, and a portion of the Port Hueneme Country Inn (see Figure LU-7). The project area encompasses a total of 50 acres and has included the acquisition of 36 separate properties along with the relocation of 76 households and businesses. By 1996, the area was occupied by 90 units of City-owned below market rate rental housing, 200 market rate condominiums, 84 detached j ngle family beach homes and a 135-room full service hotel. At inception of the Hueneme (R-76) Redevelopment Project in 1967, total assessed valuation was calculated at $943,880. By 1996, assessed valuation had increased to $33,922,845. The 1991 tax increment derived from the Hueneme (R-76) project totaled $343,413.
Central Community (A-38) Redevelopment Project:
The Redevelopment Plan for the Central Community Project was adopted by the City Council pursuant to Ordinance No. 351 on February 14, 1973. The project area was expanded in December 1975 and in 1998 by adoption of City Council Ordinances No. 419 to encompass 415 acres and Ordinance No. 623 to add 17 acres. This project is located in the southeast quadrant of the City (see Figure LU-7).
Conditions within the project area prior to adoption of the Plan met the statutory tests for blight, with findings of substandard, deteriorating and obsolete buildings; inadequate public improvements, facilities and utilities; a prevalence of depreciated values, and economic maladjustment; and other conditions detrimental to public health, safety and welfare. Accordingly, the Central Community Project was created specifically to eradicate blighting influences within the project area through a coordinated program of new development and property revitalization.

The Plan's primary goal is to realize the City's full residential and commercial development potential by way of capitalizing upon the City's beach frontage, its most valued natural asset. A detailed discussion and ranking of individual sites within the Redevelopment Project area begins on page 76 of this element. Additional supporting information is contained in the General Plan's Economic Development Element.
The project area includes four major sub-areas: Surfside, a predominantly residential and visitor-serving area situated south of Hueneme Road; Market Street Landing, a commercial corridor between Hueneme Road and Scott Street extending westerly from Ventura Road to Ponoma Street; Ventura West, the City's oldest residential neighborhood situated westerly of Ventura Road between Scott Street and Pleasant Valley Road; and Ventura East, a predominantly residential area comprised of various housing types and densities situated easterly of Ventura Road between Hueneme Road and Pleasant Valley Road (see Figure LU-7).
The Surfside area has served as the focus of redevelopment since creation of the Central Community Project, replacing dysfunctional residential, commercial and industrial uses with new beach-oriented residential, public recreational, and visitor-serving commercial development. Market Street Landing is the remaining commercial nucleus of Port Hueneme's former downtown, the revitalization of which is intended to maximize the City's retail and professional office development potential. Ventura West is the most impacted area of the City wherein residential redevelopment is proposed on the periphery of housing rehabilitation and code enforcement proposed for the remainder of the area. Ventura East has been classified as a transitional neighborhood. A comprehensive program of housing rehabilitation assistance, commercial property revitalization, and code enforcement is active in this area.

Since adoption of the Plan in 1973, a wide variety of development has taken place. The following summarizes the developments which have occurred within the project area since adoption of the Plan, as well as proposed development, which will have a significant impact on the area's economic growth.
Hueneme Beach Park: Encompassing 60-acres of publicly controlled land, Hueneme Beach Park is the City's largest recreational facility and constitutes its most valued asset. Between adoption of the Central Community Project Redevelopment Plan in 1973 and 1991, the City has invested over $1.3 million in public improvements within Hueneme Beach Park including additional off-street parking; lowering of the main beach parking area to increase water visibility; enhancement of the existing fishing pier by development of a plaza at its entrance including concession area, thematic play area, and additional pieces of barbecue and playground equipment; sand stabilization improvements; and extensive landscaping and open turf throughout. In July of 1986, construction was completed on additional thematic beach improvements including scenic monumentation at the terminus of Ventura Road and a new mini-park at the northeasterly comer of Surfside Drive and Oceanview Drive.
Moranda Park: Located at the terminus of Moranda Parkway southerly of Hueneme Road between Ventura Road and Surfside Drive, Moranda Park was constructed by the City in 1979 at a total cost of $525,000. This seven-acre public recreational facility includes eight tennis courts, two softball diamonds, four basketball courts, two handball courts two volleyball courts two horseshoe pits, and a tot lot for children. A multipurpose building houses a recreation office, meeting room, and restroom facilities.

	Dorill B. Wright Cultural Center: Located along Surfside Drive between Hueneme Beach Park and Moranda Park, the Dorill B. Wright Cultural Center was constructed by the City in 1983 at a total cost of $2.2 million. This 20,000 square foot multipurpose building, situated strategically across the street from the City's fishing pier, provides amenities suitable for performing arts, exhibits, lectures, banquets, conferences, and a variety of meetings, both small and large. The Cultural Center includes an auditorium with a combination of movable and fixed seating for up to 750 persons, gallery area, three meeting rooms, kitchen and arts/crafts area. A new 151-space parking lot was constructed on property owned by the Agency adjacent to the Cultural Center to accommodate the facility's increased usage. Street Scene and Urban Design Improvements: Between 1976 and 1991, more than $1 million in public funds were expended in upgrading the appearance of major arterial streets serving the City. Within the Central Community Project, this program has involved Ventura Road, Hueneme Road, Surfside Drive and Pleasant Valley Road. Within these rights-of-way, the City has constructed raised landscaped median islands, thematic street trees, stamped concrete crosswalks, and city entrance signs. Currently in process is the acquisition and improvement of rights-of-way necessary for the widening of Pleasant Valley Road, west of Ventura Road. When completed, this four lane arterial will receive the same thematic treatment as has been accomplished elsewhere within the Project Area. Bubbling Springs Recreational Corridor: Extending northerly from the intersection of Surfside Drive and Oceanview Drive to its terminus within 20-acre Bard Park, the Bubbling Springs Recreational Corridor was constructed by the City in 1980 at a total cost of $1.1 million. This project entailed the conversion of a mile-long flood control drainage channel into an open space linear park complete with landscaping, bike and pedestrian walkway, and miscellaneous recreational improvements.

The Recreational Corridor fulfills a vital component of the Agency's urban design program by interconnecting Bard Park, Moranda Park, Dorill B. Wright Cultural Center and Hueneme Beach; integrating the redevelopment area with neighborhoods removed form the Central Community Project. These amenities, together with street scene and urban design improvements, serve as the impetus for private reinvestment elsewhere within the Central Community Project.
Surfside Village: Encompassing approximately 50 acres within the southeasterlymost portion of the Central Community Project, Surfside Village is the single largest private redevelopment project thus far undertaken since adoption of the Redevelopment Plan. Initiated by way of an Owner Participation Agreement in February 1978, Surfside Village is a multifaceted project involving three different private developers and encompassing three distinct residential, retail commercial, and visitor-serving components. The residential component of Surfside Village encompasses 339 single family, townhouse and condominium units.
The Port Hueneme Country Inn constitutes the visitorserving component of Surfside Village and is comprised of 135 hotel guest rooms on which construction was completed July 28,1986. To compliment the $4.2 million Country Inn, a 4,000 square foot restaurant is planned on an adjoining parcel.
The retail commercial component of Surfside Village consists of a neighborhood shopping center known as Beachport Commercial Center and is comprised of seven separate buildings encompassing a total of 53,974 square feet of leasable retail floor area. Phased construction of the $3.5 million Beachport Commercial Center commenced in February of 1986 was completed in 1991.

	Port Hueneme Athletic Center: Located on the south side of Pleasant Valley Road between Evergreen Lane and Maplewood Drive, the Port Hueneme Athletic Center was constructed in 1978 on land acquired with tax increment funds. This $700,000 facility is shared by the City's Community Services Department and the Boys and Girls Club and includes a gymnasium, indoor racquetball court, weight room, two locker rooms, workshop, games room, library, and office space. Casa Pacifica: Located southwesterly of the intersection of Ventura Road and Pleasant Valley Road, a 90-unit senior citizen complex was constructed in 1980 on land acquired with tax increment and federal CDBG funds. Under the auspices of the federally-assisted Section 8 New Construction Program, the $2.4 million Casa Pacifica was developed by Shappel Government Housing, Inc., a private for-profit syndication. Port Hueneme Municipal Service Yard: Located at the southeasterly comer of Hueneme Road and Surfside Drive, the Port Hueneme Municipal Service Yard was completed in 1983 at a cost of $2.2 million. This project entailed renovation of an abandoned 39,000 square foot industrial storage facility for subsequent reuse by the Hueneme School District and City of Port Hueneme who jointly occupy the southerly one-half of this facility. The northerly one-half of the renovated structure has since been leased by the City to offshore oil related business. Harbor Plaza: Located at the westerly terminus of Market Street Landing between Market Street and Ponoma Street, Harbor Plaza is a multi-phased garden office complex encompassing 65,000 square feet of leasable floor space. Under terms of a Disposition and Development Agreement entered into on March 7, 1984 by and between the Agency and IDM Corporation, the first phase encompassing 15,000 was completed on December 31, 1985. With IDM having decided not to proceed with the remaining phases, the Agency is currently entertaining development proposals for the balance of the site.

Harbor Village Apartments: Located at the northwesterly comer of Fifth Street and Hueneme Road is the site of a 60-unit apartment complex known as Harbor Village Apartments. Under terms of an Owner Participation Agreement between the Agency and Martin V. Smith & Associates, construction of the $2.5 million Harbor Village apartments project was completed in mid-1987.
Herbert C. Templeman Educational Center: Located at the northwesterly comer of Scott Street and Ventura Road, the Herbert C. Templeman Educational Center is a 8,765-square foot professional office building which serves as the administrative headquarters for the Hueneme Elementary School District. This project was a cooperative venture involving the City of Port Hueneme, Hueneme School District and Port Hueneme Redevelopment Agency, allowing the District to convert existing office space at Hueneme Elementary School into additional classrooms. Construction of this $700,000 office building was completed at the end of 1987.
Port Harbor Homes: Located at the northeasterly comer of Scott Street and Ponoma Street is the site of a 24-unit residential planned unit development known as Port Harbor Homes. One-half of the 1.84-acre site was owned by a group of local investors and the balance of the site, comprised of six parcels and ten dwellings, was acquired by the Redevelopment Agency under terms of an Owner Participation Agreement. Construction of the $5 million project was completed in early 1990.
Bubbling Springs Villas: Located at the northeasterly comer of Fifth Street and Clara Street is the site of ten townhouses and four apartments known as Bubbling Springs Villas. This site encompasses approximately one acre of land and served as the home of the City's former municipal service yard.

A unique feature of the Bubbling Springs Villas is the development of thematic landscape and fencing improvements to conceal the unsightliness of the City's water towner that is situated on the middle of the site. Equally unique is the thematic paint scheme that transformed the tower into a "hot air balloon". Under terms of a Disposition and Development Agreement, the entire project was completed in late 1989 by the Fuller Development Company.
La Entrada: Located along the northerly side of Pleasant Valley Road from Maplewood Court to Camellia Drive is the site of a 27-unit residential planned unit development known as La Entrada. The site was originally occupied by 43 World War II vintage duplex units and acquired for road widening purposes. The remnant right-of-way totaling 2.19 acres was subsequently conveyed by the Redevelopment Agency to the Fuller Development Company which completed construction of La Entrada in late 1990. A unique feature of the project was the involvement of 16 different property owners whose single family homes abut an adjacent alley used as primary access to La Entrada.
Surfside Annex: Located along the easterly and westerly sides of Surfside Drive in the vicinity of Industrial Avenue is the site of Surfside Village Annex. This project represents the final increment of Surfside Village encompassing a new assembly building for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, 39,000 square feet of commercial mini-storage, and 30 new townhomes (Beachport Cottages). Both the assembly building and mini-storage were completed in mid-1992. The Beachport Cottages were completed in early 1993.

Neighborhood Preservation Program: The Neighborhood Preservation Program encompasses a variety of activities which collectively serve to arrest neighborhood decline, remove blighting influences, and foster housing conservation. The Program is financed by a combination of tax increment revenues, developer in-lieu fees, and federal CDBG hinds and includes the following components: housing rehabilitation, compulsory building code enforcement, special refuse service, fair housing, commercial revitalization, and selective site acquisition and clearance.
From the Program's inception in 1978 to 1996, more than 1,000 loans and rebates were funded resulting in the improvement of more than 1,100 dwellings with a combined construction value in excess of $7 million.
Financial Impact: At inception of the Central Community Project in 1973, total assessed valuation was calculated at $15,140,495. By 1996, assessed valuation had increased to 194,509,950. The 1996 tax increment derived from the Central Community project totals $2,063,625.
Future Prospect: The Redevelopment Plan for the Central Community Project is due to expire in the year 2003; eminent domain must commence by 1997. With less than 10 years remaining, the Agency has identified 23 parcels which are likely candidates for future redevelopment.
Redevelopment Projects: The following is an evaluation of the separate parcels within the redevelopment area.
This analysis is a site-by-site comparison of the incremental fiscal impacts which would be generated by the redevelopment of each site. All sites should generate a positive recurring fiscal impact. The parcels are sorted in descending order based on net recurring revenue.
Parcel 19 shows the highest net recurring revenue of $65,000 annually. This parcel is designated for industrial development with a 0.5 FAR.
CITY OF PORTHUENEME
GENERAL PLAN

76
	The residential parcels were assumed to be developed with up to 25 dwelling units per acre. The net recurring revenue associated with the residential parcels range from $28,395 to $1,428 annually. Primarily, the parcels with the highest net recurring revenues are also the largest in acreage. This does, however, vary for some parcels due to different assessed values. Since the analysis takes into account the incremental costs and revenues, the current property tax revenues are deducted from property tax revenue which will be generated by the redevelopment. Therefore, the most recently sold properties have higher assessed values and higher current property taxes leading to a smaller incremental increase in property tax revenue. Parcel 11 is designated for retail development with a 0.25 FAR. This parcel is expected to generate an incremental net recurring revenue of $7,065 annually. The recurring costs include the following cost items: •	Community Development; •	Recreation and Community Service; •	Public Works; and •	Police. Recurring revenue items include the following: •	Property taxes; •	Transfer taxes; •	Sales taxes; •	Franchise Fees; •	Business Licenses; and •	Other Miscellaneous Revenues. The one-time fees consist of a bed tax levied per residential unit in the amount of $450 per unit. At the time of this analysis, an accurate fiscal analysis of redevelopment costs compared with anticipated revenues was not feasible given the then current expectation of major state policy changes to redevelopment law. No significant off-site infrastructure costs are anticipated due to the nearly built-out nature of the City.

PUBLIC SAFETY/FACILITIES ELEMENT
Introduction The Public Safety and Facilities Element explores issues involving both natural/ environmental hazards and public facilities, utilities, and services. Both facets of the element are concerned with protecting the public's health, safety, and welfare.
The urban and natural environments of Port Hueneme contain a number of hazards which require special consideration and treatment in the land use planning process to protect the public's safety. These hazards include flooding, seismic hazards, urban fires, crime, and hazardous materials.
Public facilities and services are also related to protecting and preserving the public's welfare. Public facilities include fire and police stations, schools, landfills, and flood control facilities. Related services include police and fire protection (including emergency medical care), education, government, administrative services, solid waste disposal and flood control. These facilities and services strive to maintain the quality of life in Port Hueneme.
Purpose: The purpose of this element is twofold: l)To identify potential safety hazards and to establish appropriate policies to protect life and property from hazardous conditions, and 2) To provide guidelines for the continued provision and enhancement of adequate public facilities, and utility infrastructure.
Scope and Content: The Public Safety and Facilities Element contains four sections: Introduction, Issues, Goals and Policies, and The Plan. The Introduction explains why this element is being prepared and describes other plans and programs that address similar issues. The Issues section identifies potential hazards within the community and areas of concern, regarding the provision of public facilities and services. Goals and Policies, and The Plan focus on how to solve the issues identified in the element.

Related Plans and Programs: A number of local, state, and federal plans and programs affect Port Hueneme. A discussion of related plans and programs follows.
Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zones Act: The Alquist-Priolo Act, which took effect in 1973, is intended to prohibit the location of most structures for human occupancy across the traces of active faults and thereby mitigate the hazard of fault-rupture.
Building Codes: Local building codes contain specific measures relative to seismic safety, including foundation design criteria. State codes govern the construction of sensitive structures such as hospitals and schools.
AB 3897-Seismic Mapping Act: The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act of 1990 (AB 3897) increased the importance of seismic hazards in land use and development decisions. The mandates imposed by the law and the challenges of enforcing them will affect all new development in Port Hueneme.
The Act calls for the delineation of seismic hazard zones bounding areas of high potential for liquefaction, earth-quake-induced landslides, and other ground failures, which collectively account for most earthquake losses. Hazard zone maps which include Port Hueneme and the surrounding region are expected to become available in the mid-1990s. As in the case with the Alquist-Priolo Act, construction within the hazard zones is permitted only when development has been demonstrated to be safe by determining the severity of the hazard at the site and implementing appropriate mitigation measures. The law requires the State Geologist to perform three critical tasks:
1.	Compile maps identifying seismic hazards and submit them to the State Mining and Geology Board (SMGB) and to all affected cities, counties, and state agencies for review and comment.

2.	Revise the maps and provide final maps to affected jurisdictions within 90 days of receipt of SMGB comments on draft maps.
3.	Create archives of all geotechnical site investigation reports required by local governments and use the new findings in the reports to prepare new maps or revise existing ones.

Public Safety Safety Issues: Safety issues include flood and seismic and Facilities Issues hazards, risk of upset/hazardous materials, fire hazards, and
crime. The following section explores how these issue areas affect the City of Port Hueneme.
Flood Hazards: Land use decisions should be directly tied to the Safety Element to reduce injuries and property damage resulting from natural hazards. The Land Use Element, therefore, contains a detailed discussion and map of potential flooding that may occur in Port Hueneme.
Flood hazards typically result from an overflow of natural watercourses or man-made drainage systems. The Federal Emergency Management Agency identifies areas that are subject to flooding during a 100 or 500-year storm. These floods are based on historical records which suggest how often a flood this size could be expected to occur. In Port Hueneme, the 100-year flood includes the harbor, flood control channels, and the beach. In addition, the City is within the 500-year flood zone, similar to most coastal cities. (See the Land Use Element)
Seismic Hazards: Similar to flood hazards, a discussion of seismic hazards is included in the Land Use Element.
Refer to the Land Use Element for additional information about seismic hazards.
Two principal seismic considerations for most areas in Southern California are: 1) surface rupturing of earth materials along fault traces, and 2) damage to structures and foundations due to seismically-induced ground shaking. Other seismic considerations include liquefaction, subsidence, potential dam failure resulting from a seismic event, and tsunamis.
Fault Rupture - Port Hueneme lies within a seismically active belt that rings the Pacific Ocean. Figures PSF-1 and LU-2 show the geographic relationship with the surrounding known major active and potentially active faults. An active fault is one which has exhibited earthquake activity in the last 11,000 years. A fault which has moved during the last two to three million years (Pleistocene time) but not

PUBLIC SAFETY AND
FA CILITIES ELEMENT

proven by direct evidence to have moved within the last 11,000 years is considered to be potentially active. Any fault older than Pleistocene (one which has not displaced rocks two to three million years old or younger) is considered inactive.
The fault rupture risk in Port Hueneme is considered minimal because no known faults are located in the City.
Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act - The
Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act requires the State Geologist to delineate "special studies zones" along known active faults in California. Cities and counties affected by the zones must regulate certain development "projects" within the zones. No Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zones have been identified within the City of Port Hueneme.
Ground Shaking - Ground shaking generated by an earthquake causes, by far, more damage over a wider area than does surface rupturing by faults. Important factors which determine the shaking intensity at a given location are:
•	Distance from the epicenter;
•	Size or magnitude of the earthquake; and
•	Local soil, geologic, and ground water conditions.
Other parameters which are measured or calculated include ground acceleration, predominant period, duration of strong motion, velocity and displacement.
The concept of maximum credible earthquake is the controlling seismic event for the design of very critical or important structures such as a nuclear reactor or hospital. The maximum credible earthquake is the largest event likely to occur on an active fault and having a recurrence interval of greater than 200 years. Although the probability of such an earthquake is considered low, it is within the realm of possibility. From a potential ground shaking perspective, the City is most susceptible to ground shaking from the Oak Ridge Fault, Simi Fault, Malibu Coast Fault, San Cayentano Fault, Santa Ynez Fault, Santa Susana Fault, and San Andreas Fault.

Table PSF-1 lists the estimated maximum credible magnitudes for faults in the region.
Liquefaction - Liquefaction, one of the more important secondary seismic hazards, can be described as a "quicksand" condition in which there is a total loss of foundation support caused by a shock (typically an earthquake of significant magnitude). This condition results from a sudden decrease of shearing resistance in a cohesionless soil (such as sand) accompanied by a temporary increase in porewater pressure. Important factors in determining liquefaction potential are the intensity and duration of shaking, and the presence of relatively low-density fine sand and silt, in an area of shallow ground water.
The actual effects of liquefaction on structures and City infrastructure varies, depending on the amount of groundshaking and soil conditions. During liquefaction, buildings may gas, experience settlement, tilting, or in extreme situations, gradual sinking. Underground utilities (i.e., water, sewer, and electrical lines) may also rupture causing service disruptions. Similarly, streets may buckle or shift, thereby limiting emergency vehicle movement or evacuation procedures.
Another type of liquefaction, which occurs at some depth from the surface, can result in ground lurching (movement of earth along a fault trace), Assuring (separation of land along a fault trace) or cracking instead of causing widespread loss of foundation support. These effects are ascribed to flow landsliding or lateral spreading landslides which can occur at very low angles.
Areas having the highest relative liquefaction potential are based primarily upon alluvial areas having ground water depths less than about 30 feet and, under some conditions, up to 50 feet. The Oxnard Plain has a high ground water table and is underlain by several saturated aquifers. A potential for liquefaction exists throughout the entire region.

Note: Refer to Figures PSF-1 and LU-2 for the location of active and potentially active faults.
Subsidence - The phenomena of widespread land sinking, or subsidence, is generally related to overpumping of ground water or petroleum reserves from deep underground reservoirs. Subsidence is not related to any surface activity. No recognized subsidence has been identified in the City. The likelihood of significant subsidence occurring in the City is considered very minimal.

Potential Inundation Due to Dam Failure - The State Office of Emergency Services, since the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, has been charged with the responsibility of delineating all areas subject to inundation due to dam failure (for all those dams under state jurisdiction). The State Division of Dam Safety of the Department of Water Resources has a program to identify those dams most susceptible to seismically caused failure, mainly according to their age, type of construction, and present physical condition. These factors, and others, will be specifically investigated for seismic stability on a priority basis.
The City of Port Hueneme could be affected by dam failure from the Bouquet Canyon Reservoir, Castaic Reservoir, Pyramid Reservoir, and Santa Felicia Dam (Lake Piru).
(See Figure PSF-2)
Flood waters from these dams generally will follow one of two routes. The majority of the flooding will either be along the Santa Clara River which is to the north of the Oxnard Plain, or along Calleguas Creek which is to the east of the Oxnard Plain.
This could severely limit evacuation from Port Hueneme during a crisis situation.
Tsunami - Tsunamis, or seismic sea waves, are generated by undersea movement. The Ventura County coast has a low tsunami damage potential, but may be unsafe during such an event. These waves are not common, and Port Hueneme is somewhat sheltered from tsunamis generated in the North Pacific by the Channel Islands; however, it is relatively exposed to tsunamis generated in the South Pacific. The largest tsunami wave amplitude recorded at Port Hueneme was 8.8 feet, associated with the Chilean earthquake of 1960.

Risk of Upset/Hazardous Materials: The quantity and type of hazardous materials in Port Hueneme varies considerably. The following section explores the storage, use, and transportation of hazardous materials in Port Hueneme.
Household, Commercial, and Public Use of Hazardous Materials - Uses, such as dry cleaners and automotive service shops, routinely utilize solvents and other toxic substances, which must be properly disposed in compliance with strict federal and state regulations. Households also utilize and store materials which could be considered hazardous, although usually not of the same type and quantity as commercial and industrial uses. Homeowners need to be properly informed about the proper use, storage, and disposal of consumer goods containing hazardous materials.
The Oxnard Sewage Treatment Plant utilizes a number of chemicals during the treatment process of which sulfur dioxide and chlorine present the greatest hazard to the surrounding community. The plant contains a 20 ton tank and two one-ton cylinders of sulfur dioxide, and a 90 ton tank and four one-ton cylinders of chlorine. The on-site emergency response team is trained to respond to any hazardous materials incident at the plant and has access to an EPA approved Level A Repair Kit to repair damaged valves or leaking tanks.
Port of Hueneme's Use of Hazardous Materials - A
primary concern in Port Hueneme regarding hazardous materials involves the activities at the Port of Hueneme and on Navy properties. However, the evidence is minimal for classifying materials at these sites as hazardous.
The commercial portion of the Port of Hueneme is owned and administered by the Oxnard Harbor District. This area includes about 110 acres of land and water. Operations at the port include storage and transfer of offshore drilling equipment, automobiles, petroleum fuels, produce and other products.

Activities also occasionally include temporary storage of drilling muds. In general, the only potentially hazardous materials handled in bulk at the Port are petroleum fuels. This includes fuel imported for the Southern California Edison (SCE) electric power-generating plant, fuel for vessels, and fuel used by the offshore oil industry.
Petroleum fuel storage is limited to two tank facilities: the SCE tank farm northeast of the harbor and the Tesoro tank farm located along Hueneme Road immediately north of the Sunkist Site.
The Southern California Edison tank farm is located approximately 1,200 feet north of the Sunkist Site. This tank farm is used to temporarily store Bunker C fuel as it is offloaded from tankers and pumped to tanks at the SCE Ormond Beach generating station where it is used as fuel to generate electricity. The tank farm consists of three tanks in a single diked area. Two tanks, each with a capacity of 80,000 barrels (bbls.), have floating roofs. The third tank has a weak seam roof and has a capacity of 30,000 bbls.. The containment area is approximately 125,000 square feet.
Bunker C fuel is brought into the Port by tanker or tank barge and pumped to the storage tanks via a 16-inch pipeline. These tanks essentially act as surge tanks. As the tanks are being filled, the product is also being pumped out of the tanks to the SCE Ormond Beach generating station. Normally, the tanks are left with about ten feet of product to keep the roof floating.
The Tesoro Tank Farm is on the north side of Hueneme Road, directly across from the Sunkist Site. This tank farm consists of seven tanks, separated by two diked areas. All tanks are designed to API 650 standards with weak seam cone roofs. One diked area contains four, 1,000 bbl. tanks. Three of these tanks are normally used to store Number 2 diesel, and the fourth is normally used for cutter stock.
CITY OF PORT HUENEME
GENERAL PLAN
PUBLIC SAFETY AND
FACILITIES ELEMENT
13
The second diked area contains two 8,800 bbl. tanks, and one 2,640 bbl. tank. One of the 8,800 bbl. tanks is normally used to store Bunker C, while the other is normally used for co-mingled Number 2 diesel. The 2,640 bbl. tank is used to store cutter stock.
Presently, the majority of the products are brought into the facility by truck and sent out by pipeline to the wharfs where they are loaded onto ships. There are tow truck transfer stations, one for the four diesel tanks and one for the other three tanks. Truck deliveries are somewhat seasonal averaging around 50 to 60 per month in the winter and 80 to 100 in the summer.
There are no plans to increase the size of production of the Tesoro facility. Currently, there is an agreement between the City of Port Hueneme and the Port prohibiting any increase in the size of the facility.
The potential hazards associated with these uses are known as "hazard footprints." The potential for fire or explosion is a partly a function of flammability of material stored. Flammable products are those materials that have flash points below 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Combustible products have flash points between 100 degrees and 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
Because of the materials stored at these tank farms, the following four hazard footprints have been identified: 1) personnel radiant heat from a fire; 2) flying debris; 3) blast overpressure; and 4) occupied building radiant heat from a fire. These footprints can vary depending on the type of fuel being stored, the type of materials and construction technique of the storage tanks, and prevailing wind speed and direction.
Personal radiant heat from a fire deals with the flammability or combustibility of a product. The personal radiant heat level that can begin causing second degree bums to human skin exposed for 30 seconds defines this hazard footprint.
CITY OF PORT HUENEME
GENERAL PLAN
PUBLIC SAFETY AND
FACILITIES ELEMENT
14
A higher radiant heat level would be required to cause harm to people wearing clothing or shielded by objects or located indoors. The radiant heat hazard footprint for storage areas is calculated assuming the entire diked area is flooded and on fire. The radiant heat hazard footprint for tankers is calculated assuming a single tank is on fire.
Vapors can be present inside fuel tanks and if ignited, an explosion can occur resulting in a shock wave (blast overpressure) and flying debris from tanks. Blast overpressure and flying debris hazards could occur from all types of fuel tanks, other than floating roof tanks and tankers equipped with inert gas systems, containing flammable or combustible materials. The blast overpressure hazard footprint extends to the distance beyond which the overpressure has decreased to below 2.5 pounds per square inch. Blast overpressure at this level can begin causing eardrum ruptures. Determining the flying debris hazard footprint is much more problematic. This hazard footprint involves determining the distance debris may travel. The actual distance flying debris may travel is highly variable. The flying debris hazard footprint for a storage tank designed and constructed to American Petroleum Institute (API) 650 standards with a weak seam roof is between 680 and 800 feet depending on tank size. A weak seam roof is designed to blow off in the event of an explosion, relieving pressure vertically rather than horizontally.
The hazard footprints associated with these two tank farms are shown in Figures PSF-4 and PSF-5. There is some overlap between these two facilities, but more importantly, these hazard footprints extend into adjacent residential areas.
CITY OF PORTHUENEME
GENERAL PLAN
PUBLIC SAFETY AND
FA CILITIES ELEMENT

The results of the risk assessment prepared for the Port indicate that the probability of a fire or explosion at these facilities is extremely low. This is because the tanks are constructed with weak seam roofs which release under low pressure and direct explosions skyward; no flammable materials are handled (only combustible); there are no open flames or other sources of ignition present at the facility; and the most common cause of tank explosions is lightning which is not prevalent in Southern California.
In addition, the tanks are designed and built to meet the latest codes. The primary codes governing such tanks are the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code, and the American Petroleum Institute (API) Standard 650, Welded Steel Tanks for Oil Storage. The probabilities of accidental release at the SCE facility would be approximately the same as for the Tesoro facility.
Various hazardous materials such as drilling muds, chemicals, waste oil, etc. generated by offshore oil industry are periodically brought into the Port by support vessel and then transferred to truck for disposal. In most cases, these materials do not require the calculation of hazard footprints. It is possible that combustible or flammable materials may be brought in; and it is possible that a transfer spill could occur and ignite, creating a radiant heat hazard footprint. The size of such a fire would not be large enough to create a radiant heat hazard footprint that would extend off the Port property.
Also, various hazardous materials such as acids and solvents are periodically brought into the Port by truck and transferred to oil industry support boats. Transfer accidents from these activities are possible and would be similar to those described above.

Underground Storage Tanks'. The United States Navy Construction Battalion Center (U.S.N.C.B.C.) contains 13 active and approximately 55 inactive underground tanks. The majority of these tanks contain gasoline, diesel, or bunker fuel. The USNCBC has initiated an intensive effort to remove inactive tanks. As of December 1992, 45 of the original 100 inactive tanks have been eliminated. The remaining 55 tanks will be removed as the clean-up program proceeds.
Urban Fires: Fire protection services are currently provided by the Ventura County Fire District (VCFD). Throughout the County, the District has 32 fire stations and employs 463 full-time staff and approximately 40 reserve personnel. The 856-square mile service area includes the cities of Port Hueneme, Camarillo, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Simi Valley, Piru, and Ojai, and the unincorporated areas of Ventura County.
Within the City of Port Hueneme, the District maintains one fire station; Station 53 located at 304 Second Street. The Fire Department also maintains a hazardous material (HAZMAT) team at Fire Station 40 located in Moorpark at 4185 Cedar Springs Street. The HAZMAT team is specially trained and equipped to respond to emergencies involving potentially hazardous materials. The HAZMAT unit is staffed around the clock by three people.
Additional fire protection equipment and staffing is available from the 31 additional fire stations, and the adjacent City of Oxnard and the U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme.
Urban fires can result from a number of causes, including arson, carelessness, home or industrial accidents, or from ignorance of proper safety procedures. Urban land uses with inappropriate building materials are potential fire hazards.

The Insurance Services Office (ISO), a private insurance company, establishes ratings of firefighting agencies through its audit of fire districts' facilities, location, and their ability to respond to emergencies. ISO ratings range from Protector Class 1 (excellent) through Protector Class 10 (poor). The current ISO rating for the City of Port Hueneme is Protector Class 5.
An important component of fire fighting ability is having sufficient water pressure. City public works staff indicate that the City maintains pressures around 58 pounds per square inch (psi). This is considered adequate pressure for fighting fires.
Crime'. The Port Hueneme Police Department serves the City with a staff of 21 officers and nine non-swom employees which includes support personnel. The Department has established and maintained a level-of-service standard of approximately one officer per 1,000 residents. In comparison, surrounding communities generally have more officers, such as the City of Ventura which has 1.3 officers/ 1,000 residents. According to the Port Hueneme Police Department, this is reflective of higher crime rates and larger populations in surrounding jurisdictions. However, as Port Hueneme continues to grow, additional personnel may be required.
Table PSF-2 records the type and number of crimes committed in Port Hueneme between 1982-1992.
As Port Hueneme's resident and business population continues to grow, the City Police Department will need to service a larger community. Additional personnel and equipment may be required for the Department to maintain its high level of service.

Public Facility Issues: Public facility issues focus on how Port Hueneme can continue to provide or support the continued provision of adequate facilities and services to the community's residents.
Education Services: Oxnard and Hueneme Elementary School Districts and the Oxnard Union High School District educate students from Port Hueneme. Each district does not exclusively serve Port Hueneme, and students from other communities attend schools within these districts. Figure PSF-6 illustrates the location of each school district and the schools within Port Hueneme.
All three school districts are experiencing overcrowding problems as individual school sites are approaching their design capacity (see Table PSF-3). Portable classrooms have been located at a number of these schools to accommodate additional students. However, future expansion plans are limited by site and funding constraints.

Water Service: Water facilities in Port Hueneme are maintained and operated by the City's Public Works Department. Figure PSF-7 outlines the location of the basic facility structure. However, individual lines connecting each neighborhood are not illustrated.
Water is currently supplied to Port Hueneme by the United Water Conservation District (UWCD). The UWCD water supply line enters Port Hueneme at Pleasant Valley Road. The City's 12" line runs along Pleasant Valley Road, serving as the backbone to the water system. See Figure PSF-7 for additional information about the water facility infrastructure.
In 1994, the City of Port Hueneme and Channel Islands Beach Community Services District (CIBCSD) formed a joint powers agency - the Port Hueneme Water Agency. The purpose of the PHWA is to improve the quality and reliability of drinking water supplies, and to secure adequate water supplies for current and projected future water demands, for four project participants in the Port Hueneme area of coastal Ventura County. The project participants also include the Navy bases at Point Mugu and Port Hueneme.
Sewer Service: The City of Port Hueneme operates and maintains sewer lines in the City, Hollywood by the Sea, and Silver Strand (see Figure PSF-8). The City of Oxnard also owns and operates a 27" trunk line down Ventura Road and Channel Islands Boulevard. All wastewater generated in Port Hueneme is processed at the Oxnard Treatment Plant. According to the Port Hueneme Public Works Department, the system with proper maintenance will serve the City's future population, and the Oxnard Treatment Plant has adequate capacity to process all wastewater from Port Hueneme.

AB-939 mandates source reduction of solid wastes to prolong the lifespans of California's existing landfills. The law requires each jurisdiction to prepare a comprehensive solid waste management plan which would enable the jurisdiction to reduce its waste stream 25 percent by 1995 and 50 percent by 2000. Recycling and composting are key methods of source reduction encouraged by the law. The City of Port Hueneme has prepared a Source Reduction and Recycling Element (SRRE) in compliance with AB-939. An outline of the strategies included in the City's SRRE are contained in the Conservation/Open Space/Environmental Resources Element.
Energy Utilities: This section explores both electrical power and natural gas service to the City of Port Hueneme.
Electrical Service - Electrical power is provided to the City by the Southern California Edison Company (SCE). Port Hueneme contains both underground and above ground distribution lines, and SCE's electrical substation located at Third and Seaview Streets serves as a distribution center for electricity in Port Hueneme. All new residential developments and lines along Ventura and Pleasant Valley Roads are underground. However, the area above Hueneme Road east of the U.S.N.C.B.C. generally contains above ground lines.
The policies in this element will ensure that SCE maintains distribution lines throughout the City. This element will also promote the use of available energy conservation technologies and practices which have the capacity to reduce the consumption of electricity.
Electromagnetic Fields - There is controversy about the possible health hazards resulting from the delivery and usage of electric power. No conclusive data is available about the effects of electromagnetic fields.

Public Safety and The Issues Section has identified a number of concerns, Facilities Plan relating to flooding and seismic hazards, hazardous materi-
als, urban fires and crime. The Plan section addresses these issues through an emergency response action plan. Additional information is provided for the handling and storage of hazardous materials and preventative measures to be undertaken prior to a seismic event. The Plan section does not include a discussion of public facilities, services, and utilities because these issues are addressed in the Goals and Policies section.
Emergency Response: Port Hueneme is part of the Ventura County Fire District and has its own police department to adequately provide the needed fire and police protection to the City. Information concerning both these services is contained in the Issues section of this element and the Goals and Policies section outlines steps to provide improved service.
The City's Multihazard Functional Plan designates the proper procedures that are to be followed during a major emergency. Emergency procedures include evacuation routes, care and shelter operations, and medical facilities.
Evacuation Routes: The City of Port Hueneme's Multihazard Functional Plan has designated routes to be utilized in emergency situations. Pleasant Valley Road is the eastern evacuation route, Ventura Road, the northern route, and Channel Island Blvd., the east/west route. During a crisis situation, residents would evacuate along these routes.
Care and Shelter Operations: The American Red Cross provides disaster relief in peacetime. The agency is charged with emergency lodging, food and clothing for individuals in shelters, food for disaster workers, and regis-tration/inquiry service.

Refer to Figure PSF-10 for the location of Sunkist School and the Recreation Center in Port Hueneme that can be preferably utilized during crisis situations.
Medical Facilities: Port Hueneme residents have access to a number of hospitals regionally. However, only St. Johns Regional Hospital in Oxnard is located within a short driving distance of the City.
Hazardous Materials Plan: The Ventura County and Incorporated Cities Hazardous Waste Management Plan establishes goals, policies, and programs to ensure the safe handling, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials. Hazardous waste will be handled and stored according to the Hazardous Waste Management Hierarchy where source reduction is the first priority, followed by onsite recycling, onsite treatment, offsite recycling, offsite treatment, with disposal being the last resort. (See Figure PSF-11)
The Plan also designates the routes to be utilized for the transport of hazardous materials. (See Figure PSF-12)
As identified in the Issues Section, materials utilized at the Port of Hueneme may be considered hazardous. A series of mitigation measures have been adopted to ensure the continued safe operation at the Port. If the mitigation measure applies specifically to either the SCE or Tesoro facility, this is indicated in parenthesis.
1.	Install a sensing system and alarm to detect a spill early and notify the fire department. Examples of such systems include high and low alarms on the storage tanks, liquid detectors in the dike, and hydrocarbon vapor detectors. Any system should be developed in conjunction with and approved by the fire department. Such a system would allow rapid response to reduce the potential for ignition. (SCE, Tesoro)

2.	Purchase and store on site an adequate amount of AFFF foam to be used by the fire department in the event of a petroleum fire or spill. The amount of foam required and the storage location of the foam should be approved by the fire department. (SCE, Tesoro)
3.	Investigate the feasibility of SCE minimizing the long term storage of cutter stock in the tank. In addition, investigate the feasibility of having SCE notify the District, if the flash point of the stored product is below 200 Fahrenheit. (SCE)
4.	New facilities or developments that would allow or encourage members of the public to congregate within existing hazard footprints should not be allowed unless mitigation measures are incorporated. In particular no schools, rest homes, day care centers, hospitals, or other facilities involving the congregation of children or mobility-impaired people should be allowed within the hazard footprint. (Tesoro)
5.	Any development of the vacant property across the street from the Tesoro facility should be done so taking into consideration the potential hazards from the facility. In particular, no buildings should be allowed within the occupied building radiant heat hazard footprint. In addition, no parks or other places of public assembly should be allowed within the blast overpressure hazard footprint. All buildings constructed within any of the hazard footprints should contain tempered glass throughout. (Tesoro)
6.	The Oxnard Harbor District and the County of Ventura Fire Protection District should finalize a fire prevention action agreement.
7.	Because of the unique requirements for fighting shipboard fires, it is recommended that the Ventura Fire Protection District consider stationing a piece of fire equipment equipped with elevated nozzles near the Port.

8.	The Oxnard Harbor District should continue to closely regulate the handling and storage of flammable materials within the confines of the Port. It is recognized that the Port and its users need some degree of flexibility when it comes to handling flammable or combustible products because the needs and requirements of industry change. The risk analysis previously conducted was based on the current products being handled at the Port. None of these products were classified as flammable, i.e., have a flash point less than 100°F. Hence, it is recommended that any proposal to bring flammable liquid bulk materials into the Port be treated on a case-by-case basis.
9.	All of the storage tanks at Tesoro and the cutter stock storage tank at SCE are weak seam cone roof tanks designed to American Petroleum Institute (API) Standards. The tanks are designed such that in the event of an explosion inside the tank, the resulting pressure will lift the roof off preventing the sides of the tank from blowing apart. One known explosion resulting in flying debris was proven to be the result of improper tank installation, hence, one way to further reduce the possibility of flying debris from an explosion is to have a qualified engineer verify that the tanks meet API standards. (SCE, Tesoro)
Despite these preventative measures if an accident does occur, the Multihazard Functional Plan outlines steps to be undertaken during a hazardous material incident. The City will cooperate and assist in emergency operations as required.

Seismic Hazard Mitigation: The City of Port Hueneme cannot directly mitigate groundshaking hazards (e.g., liquefaction) because it is an inevitable effect of living in a seismically active region. The City requires that housing and other structures are designed to be as shock resistant as possible or feasible through the implementation of the City's building codes. Special review procedures will be incorporated on structures designed for human occupancy, critical service structures, and vital emergency facilities which are essential during periods of emergency.
