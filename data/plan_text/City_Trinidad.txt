                                        I. INTRODUCTION
A. OVERVIEW
   Every City and County in California is required to adopt and periodically update a Housing
   Element, one of several General Plan Elements mandated under State law. Although State standards
   dictate much of the Housing Element's form and structure, local governments are primarily
   responsible for Element preparation and implementation.
   A Housing Element must adequately address a variety of housing issues while establishing plans for
   meeting local housing needs. The Trinidad Housing Element is designed to meet State requirements
   by discussing the city's current housing situation and predicting future housing trends and needs.
   The Element also addresses Trinidad's share of the Regional Housing Need, as determined by the
   State Department of Housing and Community Development.
   This document represents Trinidad's initial, unamended Housing Element and is intended to
   supplement the City's Residential Land Use Policies (Land Use Element). Combined, the Land Use
   and Housing Element policies work to assure adequate housing for all segments of the city's
   population. They also stress the importance of maintaining the unique quality of life that Trinidad
   has to offer.
   State legislation requires that the City review and, if necessary, amend its Housing Element at least
   once every five years. The first revision of this Element should be completed by June 30, 2002 and
   utilize updated census information, where available. Each review will evaluate the following:
   1.      The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives and policies in contributing to the
           attainment of the State Housing Goal.
   2.      The effectiveness of the Housing Element in the attainment of the City's housing goals and
           objectives.
   3.      The progress of the City in the implementation of Housing Element policies.
B. DOCUMENT CONTENTS
   The Trinidad Housing Element is composed of the following eight sections:
   Section I., INTRODUCTION, introduces the document, delineates document contents, provides a
   record of public participation, and cites the Element's statutory authority.
   Section II., DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, describes the population trends and household
   characteristics of Trinidad.
   Section III., HOUSING MARKET INFORMATION, discusses the city's housing stock and those
   housing-market characteristics that affect the affordability and availability of land and housing.
   Section IV., CONSTRAINTS, describes both governmental and natural constraints to construction,
   rehabilitation, and housing provision in general.
                                                    1
   Section V., HOUSING NEEDS SUMMARY, summarizes Trinidad's housing needs as indicated by
   previous sections.
   Section VI., GOALS, POLICIES, AND OBJECTIVES, presents the City's proposed program for
   meeting housing needs.
C. STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR THE HOUSING ELEMENT
   Section 65580 of the Government Code declares that,
              "(a) The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance and the early
          attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every
          California family is a priority of the highest order.
              "(b) The early attainment of this goal requires the cooperative participation
          of government and the private sector in an effort to expand housing
          opportunities and accommodate the housing needs of Californians of all
          economic levels.
              "(c) The provision of housing affordable to low and moderate income
          households requires the cooperation of all levels of government.
              "(d) Local and state governments have a responsibility to use the powers
          vested in them to facilitate the improvement and development of housing to
          make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the
          community.
              "(e) The Legislature recognizes that in carrying out this responsibility, each
          local government also has the responsibility to consider economic,
          environmental and fiscal factors and community goals set forth in the General
          Plan and to cooperate with other local governments and the State in addressing
          regional housing needs."
   The Housing Element is written in response to the standards set forth in Government Code Section
   65583(a), as amended, and in conformance with the Guidelines prescribed by the California
   Department of Housing and Community Development.
D. CONSISTENCY WITH THE GENERAL PLAN
   This document serves as an extension to the Housing section of the 1978 General Plan (pages 28-
   32). It has been prepared in accordance with the goals, policies, and implementation measures
   established throughout the General Plan, and every attempt has been made to assure consistency
   between the two documents. (The General Plan is discussed further in Section VI. GOALS,
   POLICIES, AND OBJECTIVES.)
E. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
   A Review Draft of this Housing Element was circulated in March of 1995 and six study sessions
   were held before the City Planning Commission and City Council. Copies of this current Draft will
   be circulated to the Humboldt County Planning Department, California Coastal Commission and
   local housing advocacy groups.

B.   POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
     1.    Growth Trends
           a.   Population Trends
                Trinidad's land area of approximately one square mile remained constant between 1980 and
                1990. The city's population also showed stability over that decade. United States Census
                information indicated that the population of 379 in 1980 dropped to 362 in 1990, a 4.5%
                decrease. Given current constraints to development, the projected maximum population for
                the city is not expected to exceed 400 (see Section IV. CONSTRAINTS).
                The city of Trinidad has historically supported a commercial fishing industry. It now
                serves increasingly as a retirement community, recreation area and bedroom community.
                Many (24%) of the city's year-round residents are retirees. The general population has
                historically increased substantially during the summer due to immigration of fishing-
                industry professionals and tourists. This occurs to a lesser degree with the decline of the
                fishing industry.
                Table 1 compares the population composition in 1980 with that of 1990, according to U.S.
                Census information.

*These figures refer to the actual number of residents between 16 and 64 years and do not reflect the size of
Trinidad's work force (see b. Employment Trends).
**This category includes all residents 65 years and over, regardless of employment status.
                 According to the 1980 and 1990 Censuses, a slight decrease in the number of working-age
                 residents occurred simultaneously with a rise in the number of retirees. It is likely that some
                 working-age residents        moved into the Retiree category over the past decade, and others
                 may have relocated from outside the city.
                 With limited pressure to expand in population and area, Trinidad is not faced with many of
                 the housing concerns experienced by quickly-growing cities. The City is primarily
                 concerned with conserving its adequate supply of affordable housing, both now and into
                 the future.
           b.    Employment Trends
                 Trinidad's local economy is largely dependent on three key industries: tourism, recreation,
                 and commercial fishing. The city has only 37% of its total population in the work force,
                 with the remaining 63% of residents being retirees, disabled, or children below working
                 age (15 years and under). The majority of the employment base is currently not in the City.
                 According to the 1990 Census, the mean travel time to work for Trinidad residents was 16
                 minutes. This implies that many Trinidad workers are employed in the nearby cities of
                 Arcata and Eureka. The Census also indicates that 24% of workers traveled less than 10
                 minutes to reach their work places and were therefore employed locally (within 4 miles of
                 their homes). Twenty six percent (26%) of Trinidad's working residents were self-
                 employed in 1990, although Census information did not indicate how many workers were
                 self-employed within city boundaries.
                                                           7
         The County unemployment rate has been rising steadily with the national and state
         recessions since 1991. This trend is expected to continue until economic stabilization
         occurs. Locally, recent cutbacks in timber harvest practices on public land have added to
         increased unemployment levels.
         Due to Trinidad's success as a recreation and commercial fishing center, its economy
         remains fairly independent of the cyclical influences of the timber industry. However, the
         city is affected by seasonal surges in tourism and fishing.
         Recent government imposed limitations on the duration of the salmon fishing season have
         impacted the Trinidad economy. Many longtime, seasonal, commercial-fishing
         professionals now find it infeasible to justify the costs of traveling to the city to fish. An
         ebb in commercial fishing activity has also decreased the amount of fishing-related,
         summer tourism.
         Another drop in tourism was experienced by the closure of the city's only existing gas
         station in 1993. The station reopened in 1994. Trinidad's small size makes it especially
         sensitive to small-scale business closures.
2. Age of Population
   Census information from 1990 indicates that the largest Census-defined age classes in the city
   were 40-44 (11% of total population) and 35-39 (10%), respectively. The next largest age class
   was the 70-74 group (7%). Fifty-eight (58) persons (16%) were 15 years or younger. It is
   important to note that Census data also indicate that 85 residents (24%) were 65 or older in
   1990. This represents a 5% increase in residents over 65 in ten years.
   Of householders 65 and older in 1990, 5 (9%) were renters and 52 (91%) owned their homes,
   indicating that only a small proportion of the renting population is made up of seniors.
   Conversely, most householders between the ages of 25 and 34 rented and few owned homes;
   specifically, 17 (89%) rented and only 2 (11%) were homeowners. The 1978 General Plan
   states that Trinidad is composed mainly of single family dwellings owned by retirees or by older
   white collar workers. Where this is still generally true, many residents, primarily renters are
   students attending Humboldt State University, in the nearby City of Arcata.
3. Ethnic Population
   The ethnic population of Trinidad is composed of 13 residents who make up 4% of the city's
   total population. Six housing units are listed as ethnic (nonwhite) occupied; two owner-
   occupied and four renter-occupied.
   Table 2 compares the city's ethnic population characteristics over the past decade with County
   and State figures.

* Includes Asian, Pacific Islander, American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut in 1980 census information.
           These data indicate a similarity of residents by race over the past ten years. The data also show
           disparity between City figures and averages of the County and State. However, due to the City's
           small population, averages can fluctuate greatly with the addition or subtraction of only a few
           people.
           Economically, the housing needs of ethnic people in Trinidad most likely mirror the needs of
           young families and first-time home buyers. In this respect, increasing housing opportunities for
           the latter groups should also increase opportunities for ethnic residents.
           State law mandates that local housing programs include policies to "promote housing
           opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion, sex, marital status, ancestry, national
           origin or color." This issue as it applies to Trinidad is discussed in Section VI., GOALS,
           POLICIES, AND OBJECTIVES.
      4.   Group Quarters/Shared Housing
           Group quarters refer to living arrangements where rooms are rented individually and a kitchen or
           meals are shared. The 1990 Census reported that only one Trinidad resident was living in group
           quarters at that time. However, the 1990 Census also indicated the existence of 17 non-family
           households containing two residents each, and one non-family household containing three
           persons. These households may represent units occupied by some of the 22 college students
           residing in the city (see Students (C.)(7.) below). These shared households are not classified as
           group quarters in the Census.

C.   HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS/HOUSING NEEDS SUMMARY
     1.   Number and Size of Households
          According to the U.S. Census, a "housing unit" is defined as a house, apartment, mobile home,
          group of rooms, or single room which is occupied (or vacant but intended for occupancy) as
          independent living quarters. "Household" is a term used to describe a group of persons who
          occupy one housing unit. Table 3 shows the number of housing units and the size and number
          of households in Trinidad according to the two most recent Censuses.
                            Table 3 - Total Households and Housing Units
                                              1980*             1990              May 1993**

* The 1980 households data were taken from the 1980 summary tape file 1, page 2. However, there is a discrepancy
between these data and those on the 1980 summary tape file 3, page 2, which state that there were 180 total
households and 83 families.
**From City and County Summary Report of January Population and Housing, prepared by the State Department of
Finance, May 1993.
***Data not available.
              Household size can be expected to remain stable unless the entrance of younger families into
              the community is facilitated. The majority of Trinidad residents are currently past child-
              rearing years.
              Based on 1990 Census information, 170 households were occupied in Trinidad, and 30 were
              vacant during that year. Of the occupied households, 108 (64%) were owner-occupied and
              62 (36%) were renter-occupied. Rental units in the city tended to have slightly higher
              household sizes (2.18) than owner-occupied units (2.09). Table 4 compares household size
              in the city between 1980 and 1990, according to Census information.
                           Table 4 - Household Size in the City of Trinidad
                             SIZE                    1980               1990
                             1 person                   47 (28%)          51 (30%)
                             2-4 persons               118 (68%)         115 (68%)
                             5 or more                   7 (4%)            4 (2%)
                                                      10
         As noted above, the number of one-person households increased slightly over the last decade
         while the numbers of larger households decreased slightly. This moderate change indicates a
         trend of relative stability in household size between 1980 and 1990.
     2.  Income Characteristics
             Household income characteristics are a vital element in analyzing the affordability of housing. 1990
             Census information indicates that 120 (70.6%) of households (consisting of 149 workers) had
             earnings of some sort, 56% of households had wages or salaries, 39% received social security
             benefits, and 9% received public assistance.
D.   HOUSEHOLD NEEDS SUMMARY/SPECIAL HOUSEHOLDS
     1.  Low Income Households
         Lower income households ("low" and "very low"), those with incomes below 80% of the County median
         income, find more difficulty locating affordable housing than those with moderate or high incomes. The
         Humboldt County median income rose from $16,563 in 1980 to $23,586 in 1990, a 42% increase. The
         City of Trinidad median income rose much more dramatically, from $12,500 in 1980 to $29,583 in
         1990. This represented a 137% increase.
         According to 1990 Census information, 15 persons in Trinidad (4% of the total population) were at or
         below the poverty level in 1989. Of these 15 residents, all were white and 5 were 75 years or older. No
         residents at or below poverty level were married couples or single-parent heads of household.
         Table 5 illustrates 1980 Census information compared to the "Regional Housing Needs Plan for
         Humboldt County", May 28, 1992, prepared by HCD.

 Very Low Income Households                              68               57     58 (35%)

 Total                                                   98               84     87 (55%)
                                                   (57%)             (49%)
         Table 5 indicates that the percentage of low-income households dropped by 8% between 1979 and 1991,
         although the projected housing need for 1997 includes an additional 6%. The fact that roughly half of
         the city's total households are classified as low- or very-low income suggests that a substantial amount of
         affordable housing does exist in the city. Data regarding the percentages of households overpaying for
         housing support this theory (see Overpayment table below).
         Based on census information alone, Trinidad fell short of the County's projected regional share
         objective in providing new housing during the 1984-1992 period. According to the previous
         Humboldt County Housing Needs Plan (1984), Trinidad was to add 22 housing units between
         1984 and 1992. However, there exists some confusion as to the actual number of units added
                                                      11
     during that time.
     The 1984 Housing Needs Plan indicates that there were a total of 185 units in 1984. The most
     recent Department of Finance City and County Summary Report of January Population and
     Housing states that there were 203 total housing units in 1993. This suggests an increase of 18
     units between 1984 and 1993. However, The 1990 Census section regarding "Year Structure
     Built" shows that only 5 units were constructed between 1985 and March 1990. Adding to the
     confusion, Census information regarding total number of units indicates a mere 3-unit
     cumulative increase between 1980 and 1990.
     A third source, Exhibit 3 of the Coastal Commission's Report to the City on the Implementation
     of the Local Coastal Program, July 28, 1989, presents the following data regarding Coastal
     Development Permits issued by the City between 1980 and 1989: In addition to the SFD's
     (Single Family Dwellings) and second unit listed below, one residence was converted to a
     boarding house between 1980 and 1989.

*One unit replaced a demolished unit.
**Through June 29, 1989.
     The Coastal Commission information indicates an addition of nine units between 1984 and June
     29, 1989, and a total of 22 added units during the entire 9.5-year time. These data probably
     represent the most justified of all those considered, as they pertain directly to development
     permits issued. The figures also correspond with the 1990 Census report that 23 units were built
     between 1980 and March 1990. Together, this supports the likelihood that Trinidad can meet
     its regional housing responsibility for the 1984-1992 time. The city was apparently able to
     rectify this deficiency by 1993.
     Table 7 compares the City's regional housing responsibility for the 1984-1992 time period with
                                                 12

          The 1984 Regional Housing Needs Plan states that Trinidad receives special consideration by
          the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) due to its high percentage of
          elderly households. HCD considers elderly households to be predominantly low income.
          Therefore, the city's allocations for very low income housing were adjusted upward from the
          North County average by 5% for 1989 and 1990.
          Even with these increased allocations, Trinidad's lower-income housing responsibility remains in
          the lower percentages. Lower-income percentage requirements increased for the 1991-1997
          period; however, the majority of regional housing responsibility still remains in the moderate to
          above moderate range.
          Between 1980 and 1990, the city median housing unit value rose from $73,500 to $150,000.
          Median contract rent rose from $238 per month to $475. By State definition, a household
          overpays for rent if it contributes more than 25% of its annual income to housing costs.
          Table 8 compares the percentages of the population that paid most their income in 1980 and
          1990. Corresponding income groups are indicated.

  City Overpaying
                                                       13
 *Based on County Median Income figures.
           According to this data, the percentage of homeowners overpaying for housing decreased
           14% over the past decade. Likewise, the percentage of renters overpaying for rent fell
           19%. This trend strongly suggests the existence of affordable housing in the city. These
           numbers do not reflect, however, the number of people who may have moved out of the
           City to find more affordable housing only to be replaced by others with higher incomes.
2.   Elderly
     The total number of residents over age 64 in 1990 was 85, or 23.5% of the total population. At
     that time there were 59 households (34.5%) in the city with at least one person over age 65. Of
     these 59 households, 21 (32.3%) were one-person households, and 57 (96.6%) reported a person
     65 or over to be the head of the household. Of the 57 households headed by seniors, 52 owned
     their homes and 5 rented.
     There exists some need to address the concerns of the city's elderly population, especially those
     elderly persons living alone and those living at or below the poverty level (see II. D. 1. Low
     Income Households). Of the 21 seniors living alone in 1990, 9 (43%) were male and 12 (57%)
     were female. The majority of senior households own their homes, implying that the burden of
     mortgage payments and maintenance costs lies with them. No group quarters for senior citizens
     exist in Trinidad at this time.
     Like members of other special-needs groups, affordable housing should be available for senior
     households in Trinidad. Since these households tend to be smaller, they could occupy smaller
     units which are less expensive to maintain than larger-family homes. Programs which promote
     the availability of smaller units or shared housing for seniors would help to meet this need.
     However, noting that some seniors in Trinidad live in larger homes by choice is important. In
     addition, many seniors may remain in their homes to retain Proposition 13 tax rates which could
     currently be lower than taxes now required for smaller units.
     The creation of a limited care facility or provision of such services (visiting nurse) in town
     would reduce the need for city seniors to leave the area when additional care is necessary.
3.   Female-Headed Households
     In 1990, 29% of Trinidad households were headed by women. Table 9 summarizes the female
     heads-of-household information provided by the 1990 Census:
                         Table 9 - Female Heads of Household, 1990

   Female heads of household below the poverty level                       0                -
     The lack of female householders living below the poverty level in Trinidad could suggest that
     affordable housing is not readily available to them; however, information on low income
     households (Sec II(D)) would indicate that this is not true. Their absence may more likely be
     due to other factors such as lack of local employment opportunities.
     There are currently at least seven child care providers (including after-school programs) in the
     city or nearby areas. Cumulatively, these centers can accept more than 100 children per day.
     Some of these providers are full. Others need additional enrollment to assure continuation.
     Provisions for low-income family subsidies are available and utilized at some of the facilities.
     The City allows limited licensed day care facilities as Home Occupations in residential zones.
     Larger facilities can occur in the Public and Religious Zone or with a use permit in the PD Zone.
4.   Disabled
     Disabled persons tend to encounter housing problems similar to those of other residents with
     special needs. Because their incomes are often limited, people with disabilities are more likely
     to pay a disproportionate share of their incomes to housing than other residents.
     Disabled persons may also exhibit unique societal needs not experienced by other groups. For
     example, some disabled persons require access to special care facilities that provide them with
     needed physical and emotional assistance. Such facilities can also serve as more convenient
     housing situations than can be offered through conventional housing.
     The State Department of Rehabilitation prepared a report in 1986 on the types of disabilities
     found in Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, and Mendocino Counties. According to the report, the
     most common disabilities (39% of all cases) were muscular/skeletal--those affecting personal
     access to and movement within buildings. For this reason, it is important that local buildings are
     wheelchair accessible.
     Special care facilities are generally designed to provide wheelchair accessibility by offering
     extra-clearance doorways, reinforced handrail bracing, low counter tops, and switches and
     outlets at convenient heights. Unfortunately, very few preexisting residential housing units
     exhibit these features and must be remodeled in order to meet wheelchair-access standards. The
     extra expense of such remodeling makes it an uncommon practice in most communities.
     The 1990 Census identified disabled persons in Trinidad as those persons between ages 16 and
     64 (working age) with official work disabilities. This group totaled 33 residents--including 12
     males and 21 females--representing 9% of the city's total population and 24% of its potential
     work force. Table 10 compares numbers of disabled working-age persons in Trinidad in 1980
                                                 15
        and 1990.

                                                                                 7
            With work disability         14                 33             5.5        16.
                                                                                 3
        According to these data, the number of working-age disabled persons in the city more than
        doubled over the past decade. Although the Department of Rehabilitation (1986) reports that
        97% of disabilities in the state occur in the working-age population, Trinidad represents a
        special case due to its relatively large proportion of retired persons.
        Census information from 1990 indicates that in addition to the 33 working-age disabled persons,
        there were 20 disabled persons over the age of 64. This implies that 14.6% of the city's total
        population is disabled, a figure 2.8% above the County average. All disabilities in Trinidad
        were reported to be associated with self-care or mobility limitations.
        Several seniors who used to reside in Trinidad have relocated near Mad River Hospital to be
        close to needed services. It is possible that the creation of a special care facility would benefit
        some city residents. This could be especially true for those older residents who would like to
        remain in Trinidad when they are no longer capable of maintaining their homes.
        Some assistance for disabled persons is provided by Mad River Hospital in the nearby town of
        Arcata (14 miles away). The Adult Day Care Program provides daytime care for disabled adults.
         Transportation between participants' homes and the hospital is generally provided through the
        Program. A phone interview with a hospital employee revealed that no Trinidad residents are
        currently enrolled in the Adult Day Care Program. The hospital contends that if two or more
        Trinidad residents express interest in joining the program, transportation for them will be
        provided.
   The U.S. Census routinely reports the number of persons not physically able to use basic public
   transportation in the city. In 1990, no persons in Trinidad between the ages of 16 and 64 were
   disabled to such an extent, which can be compared to the State average figure of about 17%. Of
   persons over age 64, 6% had disabilities preventing them from using public transportation.
   The City of Trinidad is aware of State requirements and specifics regarding the American Disabilities
   Act and will continue to review new development for compliance.
5. Large Families
                                                    16
            According to census information, there were only four households (2%) in 1990 consisting of five or
            more persons. All were family households of whom three were renters and one was a home owner.
            The four units were occupied by a minimum total of 23 people, or 3.6% of the total population. (See
            overcrowding for additional discussion.)
      6.    Overcrowding
            Overcrowded housing is defined as any residence with more than one person per room. (A room
            refers to any room in a unit which is not a bathroom.) In 1990, six units in Trinidad (3%) were
            overcrowded. Of these, three were owner-occupied and 3 three renter-occupied. Three of the six
            units were severely overcrowded with more than 1.50 persons per room. One of these was a rental.
            This overcrowding is likely attributable to college students at Humboldt State University who share
            housing costs in order to be able to enjoy the scenic and recreational attributes of the City of Trinidad.
            Well over half of the total housing units in Trinidad (57%) contain five or more rooms. However,
            only 11 units contain four or more bedrooms, with the majority of units (91%) containing one to three
            bedrooms.
            Table 11 compares the size of rental units with persons per rental household in 1990, according to
            Census information:
                       Table 11 - Rental Unit Size and Persons per Rental Household
                  Rental Unit Size            vs.               Renter Household Size

                      0                   0                        1                        21
                      1                  12                        2                        24

                      4                   0                   5 or more                      3

                  TOTAL                  56                                                62*
* 1990 Census STF 3, H1/2/3 states that there are 56 total rental housing units. STF 1, H18 indicates that there are 62
rental units. This apparent discrepancy accounts for the discrepancy in totals above.
            The above data indicate a substantial shortage in 0-1 bedroom rentals, a surplus of 2 and 3 bedroom
            units, and an absence of rental units with 4 or more bedrooms.
            According to census data, no studio rental units existed in Trinidad in 1990. From the data it would
            appear that the addition of studios and 1-bedroom units would better meet the requirements of the
                                                               17
current renting population, especially for 1- and 2-person households and seniors. However, as
mentioned previously in regard to seniors (and would be relevant to other household types), some
small households reside in larger-than-necessary units by choice.
                                           18
7.   Students
        College students are typically single persons with limited incomes who seek housing opportunities.
         Students from nearby Humboldt State University (HSU) make up a small portion of Trinidad's
        population. In 1990, 22 residents (6%) were enrolled in college. Most college students are from
        outside the area and reside in secondary units, mobile homes, trailers, or shared single-family
        dwellings both in the city as well as surrounding vicinity. Many of the lodging facilities north of
        the city that cater to summer tourism also provide housing opportunities in the off-season (which
        correspond to the school year). Only 4 rental units in the city had householders below the age of
        25 in 1990.
        The demand for student housing in Trinidad is not expected to rise substantially in the near future.
         This is due, in part, to Trinidad's less-than-convenient location in relation to local colleges. Also,
        substantial on- and off-campus housing is provided in the city of Arcata, the site of HSU.
8.    Farm Workers
        According to 1990 Census information, no Trinidad residents are defined as "persons on rural
        farms.@ The city's total population is defined as "rural, non-farm.@ No labor-intensive farming
        activities occur within or near Trinidad, making migrant worker labor unnecessary.
        Census information does indicate that there are 4 residents involved in "farm self-employment."
        The mean annual farm-related income generated by these residents is well below $3,000. This
        suggests the existence of only small, hobby or supplemental-income farm-type operations within
        the city, such as canning preserves, sauces, etc.
9. Persons Employed in Forestry and Fishing
        A disparity exists in Census information regarding numbers of residents with occupations in
        forestry and fishing between 1980 and 1990. In 1980, 12 and 19 persons were employed within
        the forestry or fishing industries. These figures dropped in 1990 to 5 and 3 persons, respectively.
        Census information, therefore, implies that the majority of persons presently employed in
        commercial fishing, one of the key industries of the city, reside in areas outside of Trinidad.
 10. Housing for Homeless Persons
        The City's Zoning Ordinance contains no language that would preclude development of housing or
        services for homeless persons. Contact with several Humboldt County social service agencies and
        review of City records indicate that housing for the homeless is not a problem in Trinidad.
        The city is located adjacent to Highway 101, the primary corridor through Humboldt County;
        nevertheless, harsh winter climatic conditions, remote location, lack of social services, and the
        absence of a centralized downtown area probably deem the area less desirable or convenient to
        most homeless persons.
        Like other small cities in the vicinity, Trinidad utilizes the local service groups and churches as
        well as the Eureka Rescue Mission to temporarily accommodate the homeless when necessary. In
        addition, Women for Shelter provides emergency shelter for women and children, especially those
        suffering from abuse.
                                                   19
                                      III. HOUSING MARKET INFORMATION
The Trinidad housing market is part of the North Humboldt County Market Area. This statistical area also
includes the Cities of Blue Lake, Eureka, and Arcata and the community of McKinleyville.
Trinidad exhibits a distinct housing market due to its physical size constraints and its unique, scenic location
along the Pacific Coast. Demand for housing in the city is remarkably high, accounting for the rise in property
values over past years.
Trinidad has been known historically as a small community composed mainly of single-family dwellings. Its
distinctive lack of manufactured homes, condominiums, townhouses, and apartments, as compared to other
cities, is attributable to its rural location and early build-out.
The 1976 Environmental Impact Report (EIR) to the city's General Plan concluded that many alternative
housing types were "not consistent with the character of the city" and that they "should not be permitted" within
city boundaries. These statements provide historic insight into the nature of local attitude toward the city.
However, a small number of apartments and mobile homes, a trailer park, and an RV park have been developed
in Trinidad since the 1976 EIR. The use of such units has benefitted Trinidad's housing program in assuring
affordable housing for all income levels and special needs groups.
A.    HOUSING STOCK
      According to the 1989 Coastal Commission LCP Report, approximately 23 units were added to the
      Trinidad housing stock between 1980 and 1989. This represents a 13.5% increase in number of housing
      units within 9.5 years, assuming the 1980 Census figure of 170 units is correct.
      Information from the 1990 Census indicates that of the 170 occupied-year-round housing units, 108
      (63.5%) were owner-occupied and 62 (36.5%) were rental units. There were also 30 vacant units in 1990,
      2 of which were occupied seasonally. Other than the 2 seasonal units, Trinidad's vacancy rate was a high
      14% (32% of which were rental units). This is 9% above the minimum 5% rate necessary for regular
      rental mobility and 12% above the normal rate of 2%. All available information indicates that there is no
      immediate shortage of rental units.
      Tables 12 and 13 list numbers of vacant units according to vacancy status and numbers of units per
      structure containing a vacancy in 1990.

According to this information, 76.8% of vacant units in 1990 were detached single family dwelling units.
The fact that no vacant units were for sale suggests a shortage of owner-occupied units, another indication
of the need for more housing available to home buyers.
The high number of "other vacant" units may be a result of homes temporarily vacated for remodeling or
other improvement. It may also include a number of seasonally-occupied units whose owners were out of
town during the time of Census polling. (This group also includes the 2 seasonally-occupied units
recorded by the 1990 Census.)
The Trinidad City Clerk is usually made aware of new vacancies and turn-over rates through water bill
changes. Inquiries regarding available rental units in the city are often directed to her. She indicated that
vacancies have been low in number and high in cost. Generally, available rental properties are listed with
local real estate offices.
According to the 1990 Census, half of Trinidad's housing units were constructed prior to 1958. At least
55.8% of all units were constructed more than 30 years ago (see III. B. HOUSING CONDITION). The
majority of Trinidad homes are older and moderately sized, most with 1 to 3 bedrooms. Table 14 lists
numbers of units with respective numbers of bedrooms:

Approximately 80% of the current housing stock is made up of conventionally built, single-family homes.
Mobile homes account for about 10% of the housing stock. Table 15 describes the numbers of different
housing-unit types in the city according to 1990 Census information.

B.  HOUSING CONDITION
    The bulk of the housing stock in Trinidad can be generally described as aging. Table 16 lists the number
    of units constructed in corresponding time intervals and provides a running mean of total units.
                                            Table 16 - Housing Age
                        Year Built                    Total Units      Running Mean

                        1980-1984                            18              97.4
                        1970-1979                            41              87.9

                    Total                                 190
These data indicate that 87.9% of total housing units were constructed prior to 1980, 66.4% prior to 1970,
and 55.8% earlier than 1960. Approximately 14% of units are very old, having been built before 1940.
The greatest increase in number of units occurred between 1950 and 1959.
The 1976 EIR to the city's General Plan states that the main sources of affordable housing in Trinidad at
that time were numerous small, older homes. The EIR stressed the importance of preserving these units
and reported that many of them were in need of some repair.
A visual survey of the exterior condition of Trinidad-area dwellings was performed prior to the preparation
of the Trinidad General Plan Project, Community Infrastructure (1976). The survey revealed that very few
units in the city were in poor condition, although approximately 45 units just outside city limits were in
need of major repairs--including 18 duplex units. In addition, many cabin units which were currently
occupied by college students were in need of improvement. The surveyors concluded that these houses
and cabins represented clusters of deteriorating housing units surrounding Trinidad.
Due to lack of funds and limited staffing, no recent survey of housing conditions has been performed.
However, future housing assessments would benefit from the information provided through such a survey,
and one should be completed prior to the first Housing Element Review in 2000.
In lieu of surveying each individual property, discussions were conducted with local realtors and
contractors to gain insight as to the condition of the Trinidad housing stock. The general conclusions
reached through this interview were:
-      Many of the "old" homes (over 35 years) need at least minor rehabilitation. "Ungrounded" electrical
       systems common in old homes may need to be grounded or replaced.
-      Many of the city's homes, including some of the newer units, need roof repair. Leaky roofs seem to
       be a common problem and, in conjunction with other problems, could require major rehabilitation
       efforts.
-      Most of the older homes have not been constructed to withstand shaking resulting from earthquakes
       as was experienced in nearby Ferndale and Rio Dell in Spring, 1992. Similar shaking in Trinidad
       could result in a loss of much of the older housing stock.
-      Many of the older homes have old septic systems that, although not necessarily indicating problems
       are below current standards. Some of these lots are small and offer few alternatives should the
       system fail.
The high cost of rehabilitation is a discouraging factor for households with limited incomes. Households
eligible for low-interest rehabilitation loans are referred to as "targeted households" by the Department of
Finance. The agency defines targeted households using area median income statistics. Specifically, the
definition quotes:
                                                  23
   *     The Targeted Group is persons/families whose income is 80% of the estimated/adjusted median
         family income for Humboldt County.
   *     The Lowest Targeted Group is persons/families whose income is 50% of the estimated/adjusted
         median family income for Humboldt County.
   An important housing improvement, aside from overall rehabilitation, is weatherization. Adequate
   weatherization of units minimizes household heating expenses. Many Trinidad residences have not yet
   been weatherized to meet energy conservation standards. Any available programs should be advertized
   within the City.
   Approximately 70 Trinidad households (35%) currently utilize wood heat, 47 (24%) use electricity, and 27
   (14%), utilize bottled, tank, or LP gas. The City recognizes that all residents should be made aware of
   energy conservation measures which pertain to their specific living situations.
C. AFFORDABILITY
   The average cost of purchasing or constructing a home in Trinidad has increased over the last decade.
   According to the 1980 Census, the median sales price for a single-family home was $73,500. By 1990, the
   median sales price had more than doubled to $150,000.
   In 1980, nearly half of existing housing units had values in the $50,000 - $80,000 price range, and another
   third were in the $80,000 - $150,000 range. The 1990 Census reveals a substantial increase in the value of
   Trinidad homes: only 5% had values between $50,000 and $75,000, and no homes had values lower than
   $50,000. About a third of homes were within the $100,000 - $150,000 range, and over a third exceeded
   $200,000 in value.
   According to U.S. Census data, median contract rent has also risen, increasing 100% from $238 in 1980 to
   $475 in 1990. Table 17 lists percentages of rental rates in specific rent categories in 1980 and 1990.
                                        Table 17 - Contract Rents
         Price Range                   % of Rents 1980          % Rents 1990 (Total 62 Units)
                    $200                       35.9%                           6.5%
                $200 - $399                    42.2%                           16.1%
                $400 - $599                12.5% ($400+)                       37.1%
                   $600 +                                                      37.1%
               No Cash Rent                    9.4%                            3.2%
                    Total                      100%                            100%
   The rental vacancy rate, according to census information, increased substantially from 1.5% in 1980 to
   14.5% in 1990. This may signal the beginning of a stabilization period in contract rents, as the market
   mechanism will ultimately determine optimal rental rates. However, this higher rate may be more
                                                   24
reflective of the time the census was taken or census error and does not reflect what is perceived to be a
low vacancy rate in the City.
It is also important to note that rental rates all throughout the county have risen dramatically over the past
ten years. The median rate for the nearby town of Arcata has increased about 300% since 1970 (to $382).
Even with the increases in contract rents, many lower-income residents occupy rental units. According to
the 1990 Census, contract rents are generally less than monthly mortgage payments in Trinidad, with the
median contract rent ($475) substantially lower than the median mortgage payment ($875).
Overall, the most important element in assessing housing affordability for a city is the ability of its
residents to pay for housing. The city of Trinidad has retained approximately half of its population as
long-term residents over recent years. Both the 1980 and 1990 Censuses indicated that about 50% of the
total population were living in the same units they had occupied five years earlier, with the remaining 50%
having moved into the community within the past five years.
Those residents who have owned their homes for some time and whose incomes have risen over past years
are not dramatically affected by inflation of housing costs. In contrast, those with fixed incomes must pay
increasingly greater percentages of their incomes to non-housing costs. The residents most affected by
inflation are those who rent units and are restricted by fixed incomes.
Overpayment for housing has become a very serious problem in California, affecting primarily moderate,
low, and very-low income households. Residents within the lowest income groups pay the largest
proportions of their incomes for housing.
Census data from 1990 indicates that in the city of Trinidad, 26% of renter households were paying more
than 25% of their respective incomes for rent (see Overpayment table above). All of these households
were classified as low- or very-low income. This figure represented a 19% drop in number of overpaying
rental households from 1980.
Of homeowners in 1990, only 9% paid in excess of 25% of their incomes to mortgage costs. Eight percent
(8%) were overpaying low- or very-low income households. This marked a 14% decrease in number of
overpaying homeowner households since 1980.
Overpayment has more recently been measured as at least 30% of household income contributed to
housing--the definition formerly used solely by the federal government. According to the 1990 Census, 5
homeowners and 26 renters earned less than $20,000 annually but paid more than 30% of their incomes
toward housing. These figures represent 3% of homeowners and 23% of renters overpaying under this
new 30% standard. Of households with annual incomes $20,000 or above, an additional 9% of
homeowners and 23% of renters overpaid.
Although overpayment does not appear to be a substantial problem in Trinidad, it does merit consideration
and continued review. Judging from available information, overpayment seems to affect renters to a
greater degree than homeowners. This suggests that lower-income households have difficulty purchasing
homes (possibly including difficulties securing home-loans) and often rent by necessity. Decreased rates in
mortgage loans and government assistance to first-time home buyers have increased opportunities for
lower-income households to purchase housing.
State law requires each city and county to analyze the status of existing housing units which, through the
availability of subsidies, are provided to moderate low or very low income households at below market
rates. The purpose of the analysis is to determine whether such units are at risk of being converted to
                                                    25
   market rates within the next ten years. If so, a plan must be prepared to deal with this reduction in assisted
   housing units.
   State law also mandates that local governments plan for the conservation of at-risk units. "Conservation"
   refers to actions taken to assure the future affordability of currently affordable units.
   The CA Department of Housing and Community Development developed a document titled Housing
   Element Analysis Preservation of Assisted Units, November 15, 1991. This, along with information in the
   Department's December 5, 1991 letter regarding "Preserving Subsidized Housing Projects,@ was reviewed
   to determine whether the City had any at-risk units, those units that have been subsidized in the past but
   may not be subject to income restrictions in the near future. Furthermore, the City checked HUD and
   FmHA inventories through an HCD representative who identified no units at risk. The City has no locally
   subsidized units at risk, as the City has not issued mortgage revenue bonds, has not approved any density
   bonuses with financial assistance, does not have an in-lieu fee program, and has not assisted multi-family
   housing with redevelopment or CDBG funds. Public subsidies for renting could benefit many of the
   renters in Trinidad.
D. LAND AVAILABILITY
   This section discusses vacant and underutilized properties in Trinidad which have the potential for
   residential development. As shown by the table Inventory of Land Available for Residential
   Development below, as of August 1994 there remained 20 potentially-developable residential lots within
   city boundaries. Each of the twenty lots is subject to Trinidad's program of pre-development review
   (including sewage disposal suitability) but is zoned to accommodate such lower-cost housing types as
   manufactured houses/factory built housing. Some other areas (designated PD, C) are large enough to
   allow clustering of multi-family units and improvements.
   Trinidad's inherent land-use constraints severely limit the developability of all vacant land (see IV.
   CONSTRAINTS). The developable lots described above are considered to be the build-out for the city.
   These lots are zoned for single family dwellings and carry a minimum lot size of 8,000 to 20,000 square
   feet and dependant on lot constraints. Manufactured housing is permitted on all sites on a single-family
   use basis.
   No redevelopment areas are currently defined within the city. Public facilities, such as the school and
   Town Hall, are available for use as temporary emergency shelters in the events of natural disasters.
   Emergency shelter or transitional housing is not designated in the City because of lack of expressed need
   and close proximity to similar services in Arcata and Eureka. Aside from the existence of four currently
   undeveloped commercial parcels, no non-residential property in the city is available for conversion to
   residential use. The City has no industrial or agricultural zones. Most surrounding undeveloped property
   is within State park boundaries or is unsuitable for development due to geological instability or sensitive
   habitat constraints.
   Largely as a result of septic-system capability and slope stability constraints, few previously developed
   parcels are available for subdivision for the purpose of creating more developable parcels. New housing

                                               IV. CONSTRAINTS
This section attempts to identify the factors that may contribute to difficulties in meeting housing needs.
Generally, such factors are attributed to governmental and non-governmental limitations. Housing constraints
in Trinidad can best be described as:
-        Developmental Constraints, including economic factors such as inability to pay and physical factors
         limiting housing development opportunities; and
-        Governmental Constraints, such as permitting difficulties and land use controls.
A.         DEVELOPMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
           1.   Market Constraints
                Housing supply and demand are the market constraints most likely to affect housing affordability
                in Trinidad. (Residents' ability to pay for housing, as well as housing availability are discussed
                in Section III. Housing Market Information, C. Affordability.)
                In addition to actual construction costs, housing costs include (or reflect, for rentals) those
                associated with financing, marketing, profit to developer or homeowner, infrastructure, utility
                hookups, property taxes, land division, and permit processing costs. Interest rates also impact
                housing costs and affordability.
                Increasing land values and costs of constructing or purchasing a home are prevalent in Trinidad,
                as well as in the rest of the County and State. However, concurrently-rising area incomes
                somewhat offset the seemingly drastic increases in housing costs over the past 20 years. It is
                important to note that property values in Trinidad may tend to exceed those in many surrounding
                areas due to the city's unique scenic location and inherent recreational opportunities.
                Although market constraints are the least limiting of developmental constraints, lower income
                groups may continue to require assistance in order to obtain affordable housing opportunities.
                The City does attempt to mitigate the factors described above by encouraging the creation and
                preservation of affordable units. For example, the City adheres to State regulations which allow
                manufactured home placement on all lots suitable for single family dwellings. Because
                manufactured housing generally incur lower housing costs than do traditional, "stick-built"
                homes, they serve as favorable sources of affordable housing. The City also allows (when site
                conditions allow) the creation of second dwelling units as additional sources of affordable
                housing.
                In addition to assuring availability of affordable housing within city limits, the City encourages
                Humboldt County to allow a variety of housing types in residential areas surrounding Trinidad.
                Currently, there are numerous mobile home parks, single mobile homes, trailer parks, and at
                least one multi-family development (consisting of 9 duplexes) in these outlying areas. Housing
                opportunities like these assist lower-income households in securing housing within the scenic
                Trinidad area.
                Both State and Federal agencies continue to offer financial support for lower income groups in
                California. Subsidized rent and low-interest loan programs from these agencies are made
                available to Trinidad residents who meet specified criteria.
                                                       30
2. Circulation Infrastructure
   The majority of vacant and developable lots in the city are accessible by existing roads and
   would not require substantial increases in road surfaces if developed. A possible exception to
   this is the Twoomey subdivision in the southeastern portion of town. The proposed subdivision
   would require the construction of additional access roads; however, the developer is responsible
   for such construction and such roads would be short in length with only minor traffic (less than
   five units). The Trinidad General Plan and background information discusses them.
3. Service Infrastructure
   The primary constraints to development in Trinidad are limited septic capability and water
   availability. Individual septic tanks are currently the only means of sewage disposal in the city.
   Soil conditions and lot sizes limit the number and distribution of septic tanks, and thereby
   restrict the feasibility of new development.
   The 1976 EIR to the General Plan concluded that the construction of a sewage disposal system
   would cost the City approximately $1 million (in 1976 dollars). The potential expense today is
   estimated to be substantially higher.
   Since this time, funding sources for a sewage treatment plant are unavailable and the City must
   do what it can to prevent the possibility of overloading the capacity for septic treatment. The
   potential for septic tank failures could present a significant problem for the city in future land
   use decisions.
   Trinidad withdraws its municipal water supply from Luffenholtz Creek, located 1.5 miles
   southeast of the city. All development within city boundaries, and some just outside the city, is
   connected to this system. As mandated in the Trinidad Land Use Plan, city residents are given
   preference over nonresidents for service connections. Storage capacity, treatment, pumping
   capacity and minimum creek discharge all limit the number of hookups available from the City
   system. Based on a 1995 assessment, there were approximately 300 water hookups. An
   additional 228 hookups could be available only if substantial wet weather storage capacity or
   treatment facilities are developed. Only a limited number of hookups (100+) are available
   without such improvements.
4. Seismic/Slope Conditions
   The City of Trinidad lies within a geographic area laden with numerous seismic faults and shear
   zones. The fault zones nearest the city are the Freshwater Fault zone to the southwest and the
   Falor-Korbel Fault zone to the east. However, a total of 8 active or potentially-active faults lie
   in the northwestern portion of the state and may affect Trinidad in the event of an earthquake.
   The City of Trinidad is also listed as having an active fault rupture zone per the Alquist-Priolo
   Mapping. This zone occurs within much of the listed vacant Commercial or Planned
   Development designated areas.
   The maximum earthquake magnitude which may be experienced in the Trinidad area is
   estimated at 8.0 on the Richter scale. The estimated maximum bedrock acceleration (%g) is .48.
    These figures must be considered during the design and construction of all structures in the city.
   Trinidad is also vulnerable to damage resulting from earthquake-induced sea waves known as
                                          31
          "tsunamis." In addition to occasional tsunamis, the city is susceptible to violent wave attacks
          during harsh winter storms. Development in the lower, more exposed portions of the near shore
          area must continue to be avoided to ensure its protection from waves.
          Portions of the Trinidad area are composed of moderately to highly unstable slopes. Such slopes
          are prone to accelerated erosion and mass movement during earthquakes, storms, and as a result
          of nearby construction. The City requires geologic reports for new development within these
          areas.
   5.     Construction
          Financing opportunities and construction costs remain generally consistent County-wide and are
          not considered a constraint to development in Trinidad. However, land values in the city are
          continuing to rise with demand for housing. FmHA (Farmers Home Administration) is available
          to assist homebuilders in financing the construction of new homes. Other Trinidad residents
          may qualify for FmHA or other subsidy programs.
          Most physical limitations can be translated into cost-related constraints. Many of these cannot
          be overcome in Trinidad due to the city's unique location and restricted size. This suggests that
          the city can best fulfill its housing obligations into the future by encouraging the use of existing
          units as affordable housing.
          Zoning classifications, estimated amount of vacant land, and estimated amount of vacant land
          subject to specific constraints are outlined in the Inventory of Land Available for Residential
          Development (III. Housing Market Information, D. Land Inventory).
B. GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
   Many of Trinidad's governmental constraints to development are directly related to the physical
   limitations described above. The most notable of these constraints are the mandates set forth by the
   California Coastal Act.
   The entire city of Trinidad falls within the California Coastal Zone, meaning that all proposals for
   new development are subject to the standards and regulatory procedures included in the City's Local
   Coastal Plan (LCP). At the heart of the LCP is the Trinidad Land Use Plan (LUP), which establishes
   numerous land use regulations relevant to the city's coastal location and characteristics.
   In general, the purpose of an LCP is to allow for a partnership between the State and local
   governments in protecting the Coastal Zone from expansive, environmentally detrimental
   development. Several general Coastal Act policies may apply to development proposals in Trinidad.
   These should be considered when assessing governmental constraints to development within the city.
    They are as follows:
   - Maximum public access and recreational use of the coast, with consideration of private rights and
       the environment, must be provided;
   - Marine and land resources, including riparian areas, tide pools, wetlands, and rare and endangered
       habitat areas must be protected;
       - The scenic integrity of the coastal landscape must be preserved;
   It is also important to note that, under the Coastal Act, coastal-dependent development proposals
                                                  32
(such as those oriented toward recreation or tourism, or those involving the organized study of
coastal/marine resources) receive higher approval priority by the State Coastal Commission than do
non-coastal-dependent developments (such as residential dwellings) in certain designated areas such
as the harbor area.
1.   Regulations Regarding Physical Limitations
     a.    Service Infrastructure
           The current minimum lot size in Trinidad, as determined primarily by limited septic
           capabilities, is 8,000 s.f. for Urban Residential and 20,000 s.f. for Suburban Residential
           designation. Under the city's Land Use Plan, all new individual septic systems must meet
           the minimum standards set by the State and Regional Water Quality Control Board.
           Existing vacant lots which are below minimum lot size, but are otherwise considered
           developable, may be considered for development where an acceptable individual waste
           water treatment system (as determined by the County Department of Environmental Health)
           can be provided.
           The Trinidad water system was brought into accordance with minimum state requirements
           in 1986. The improvement was conditionally approved by the Coastal Commission, which
           set a limit of 402 service connections for the upgraded system. Connections beyond this
           limit may be authorized by the Executive Director of the Coastal Commission upon
           submission by the City of a special hydrological study.
           Similarly, in 1980, the Trinidad Citizens' Water Service Committee recommended that no
           more than 400 to 450 total connections be allowed without the completion of specific
           feasibility studies involving the local watershed.
           A recent reevaluation (January 1995) by the City Engineer was completed. The number of
           water service connections in Trinidad currently stands at 214 within the city and 88 in
           outlying areas for a total of 302. This leaves room for an additional 98-148 hookups before
           improvements will be required. Based on flow alone and with specified improvements this
           could be increased to 228 additional hookups.
     b.    Seismic/Slope Conditions
           Much of the Trinidad area lies within a Special Study Zone, as designated by the State
           Division of Mines and Geology under the Alquist-Priolo Act. The purpose of the Zone is
           to ensure that local development patterns do not create seismic hazards.
           According to the Alquist-Priolo Act, no buildings may be constructed within 50 feet of any
           active fault in the Zone. All buildings outside this buffer, and throughout the rest of
           Trinidad, are subject to specific design guidelines established by the City.
           Trinidad's Building Code contains a numerical formula that relates building weight to
           foundation design, anchoring, and wall reinforcement in the development of structures. By
           combining these factors in buildings plans, structures can be made to withstand potential
           earthquake damage. However, construction costs may be increased by these special design
           requirements.
           The Trinidad Land Use Plan states that no new development may occur on unstable lands.
           Such development may include the construction of buildings and driveways or the
                                             33
         placement of individual septic systems. These specific development types may not occur
         on sites of questionable stability, or within 100 feet upslope of such sites, unless the
         proposed development is analyzed and found not to be detrimental by a registered
         geologist. In addition, no new structures may be located on the shoreline less than 20 feet
         above the Mean Lower Low Water line, with the exception of harbor and public access
         facilities.
         Most development of unstable and shoreline sites is restricted by the City's zoning
         regulations. The Open Space and Special Environment Zones prohibit most development
         in these locations.
2. Fiscal Restraints
   Aside from the physical limitations listed above, development in Trinidad falls subject to overall
   financial constraints. These are mainly related to the City's fiscal limitations which have been
   recently exacerbated by cutbacks at the State level.
   The City of Trinidad is presently experiencing difficulties in providing for even the highest
   priority maintenance activities--including street and utility system improvements.
   Appropriations for site improvements and fee relief are not expected to become available at the
   local level within the next 5 years.
   Planning permit costs (averaging $200-$500) are not unreasonably high in Trinidad, although
   they may seem so to small-town property owners and developers. Because of its small size and
   limited staffing capability, Trinidad relies on private consultants (and consulting firms) to
   perform necessary project review activities. This can, at times, result in higher fees than those
   incurred by larger cities, although Trinidad fees generally remain lower than the County average
   and those of some surrounding communities.
   There is evidence to suggest that the City's permit fees do not prevent development. In recent
   years, no proposed projects have been abandoned as a result of developers' inability to pay
   permitting fees. Fees can be reduced only to the degree that the City subsidizes actual costs, a
   position it is unable to take at this time. Although it may slightly impact fees, the use of
   consultants does not increase permit processing time (normally 1-3 months). All project reviews
   are completed well within the maximum time allowed by the State Permit Streamlining Act.
   The City adopts the most current Uniform Building Code. There are no local amendments to the
   Codes; hence, building codes are not excessive and do not present a constraint. Historic
   structures in the city have been formally designated but special historic preservation codes are
   not in effect. Whether this occurs or not will have only minor affect on housing affordability.
   New development near these structures is reviewed for its impact on historic structures.
   The City's Local Coastal Plan implements Coastal Act policies which include review of new
   development for compliance with design review and view protection findings. These tend to
   result in design restrictions in development. However, there are no known cases where
   development was precluded. All policies are applied equally regardless of the type of
   development proposed.
                                            34
        On- and off-site improvement requirements consist primarily of paving of off-street parking and
        construction of drainage facilities. These requirements are comparable with other surrounding
        communities and are not excessive. Setbacks and lot coverage restrictions are also reasonable,
        comparable and do not represent a constraint to development.
        Off-street parking requirements may limit the number of potential new residential units added to
        existing commercial structures (as promoted by policies to encourage mixed use. To some
        extent, parking requirements (1 additional space) may limit the development of second units on
        residential lots in other areas of Trinidad. This is not considered a significant constraint,
        however, due to the high level of build-out on these properties and the low number of inquiries
        desiring second units. Recent changes to the City's Zoning Ordinance have allowed parking-in-
        lieu alternatives when there would otherwise be a shortage of off-street parking.
        Building permits are generally processed in less than two weeks. Planning permits generally
        take 1-2 months to process, depending on the date of application and the date of the once-a-
        month Planning Commission meeting.
        The City typically requires a $4,500-$7,500 water improvement fee for all new construction.
        There are no school impact fees in the City of Trinidad.

                                  AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REVISIONS
     A.   REVIEW OF EXISTING HOUSING RELATED POLICIES
          1.   State Objectives
               Every county and city in California is required to develop a housing program which meets State
               standards for adequacy. These programs must be delineated in each locality's General Plan as its
               official Housing Element. The State mandates that measures be included in all Housing
               Elements to accomplish the following objectives (summarized from CA General Plan
               guidelines):
               a. Create and identify adequate amounts of land with Zoning and Development Standards for
                     a range of housing types, sizes and prices.
               b.    Encourage housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households.
               c.    Minimize governmental constraints on the maintenance, improvement and development of
                     housing.
               d.    Conserve and improve existing housing stock.
               e.    Promote housing opportunities for all segments of the city's population.
               This document represents the City of Trinidad's first Housing Element. The Trinidad General
               Plan section entitled Housing contains the city's official housing program prior to the adoption
               of this Element.
          2.   Existing City Housing Policies
               Since the adoption of the General Plan in 1976, the City has strived to meet the above objectives
               through a program dependent on the following policies:
               44.    Vacant land in existing residential areas is sufficient to accommodate the desired level of
                      residential expansion during the planning period. [Policy removed since it is a finding
                      rather than policy]
               45. Trinidad's role in the effort to provide adequate housing is focussed on three areas:
(a) Attempting to keep the cost of existing moderate cost housing down so it can continue to be available to
                      people with limited incomes who desire to live in Trinidad; [Replaced with Policies 3, 4,
                      10, 11]
(b) Protecting the unique character of the City as a single-family owner occupied fishing village; [Replaced
                      with Policy 2]
               (c)    Encouraging the County to allow a variety of housing types in the residential areas
                      surrounding the City consistent with septic tank limitations. [Revised in Policy 5]
                                                          36
          46.  The City should continue to maintain a rural life style because it is preferred by residents
               and also because it allows for a low level of public services and thereby keeps property
               taxes and utility charges at a minimum. This helps to keep the cost of operating a
               residence as low as possible. [Replaced with Policies 1, 8, 11, 13, 14]
          47.  Only single-family residences should be permitted in the Urban Residential, Suburban
               Residential, Rural Residential and General Rural categories. [Amended Ord. 166; 12-
               12-84] [Replaced with Policy 2]
          48.  Multiple family developments such as condominiums, townhouses and apartments with
               from one to four dwelling units in a building may be appropriate in the Planned
               Development category provided the density does not exceed that of the Urban Residential
               category or waste disposal constraints, whichever is most restrictive. Mobile home parks
               are not consistent with the character of the intensive development area and should not be
               permitted in the City. [Replaced with Policies 3, 4, 5]
          49.  The City should investigate and cooperate in implementing appropriate programs
               providing assistance which will enable low and moderate income persons to find and
               retain suitable housing. [Revised with Policies 7, 10, 11]
          50.  Subdivisions should be encouraged in the intensive growth area to increase additional
               building sites for those who wish to live near Trinidad. Lots adequate to support larger
               homes for families with children can be provided and low cost housing (mobile home
               subdivisions or Farmer's Home Administration assisted housing) can be accommodated.
               [Revised with Policies 7, 11]
          51.  Soil limitation for septic tanks, local hydrology and topography are critical determinants
               of the size of any new housing lots and may require that lots be larger than minimum lot
               size requirements contained in the General Plan or Zoning Ordinance. Where residents
               want to protect the character of a residential area minimum lot sizes greater than might
               be allowed based on site conditions are justified. The following minimum lot sizes are
               consistent with the preferred character of the designated residential areas while allowing
               flexibility in adapting lots to varying soil conditions. In the Rural Residential
               classification new lots should not be less than one acre in area. In the Suburban
               Residential area minimum lot sizes should range from .5 acre to 1 acre depending on the
               character of the neighborhood. In the Urban Residential classification new lots can be
               less than .5 acres. In any case, the minimum lot sizes in Suburban Residential areas
               should not be smaller than the minimum recommended in the Wastewater Facilities Plan
               (see Policy 29).1 [Policy retained but not as part of Housing Element]
          52.  Where commercial timber is acting as a visual buffer between residential uses or between
       1
         "Minimum lot sizes for the Resource Production classification should be large
enough to protect the economic viability of management units. The minimum lot size
for the General Rural designation can range upwards from two acres. For the purposes
of this Plan, no further divisions of existing parcels in the General Rural
designation is recommended.@
                                                     37
residential uses and other activities, the County should not approve conditional use
permits to allow harvesting the timber in the buffer strip unless replacement of shrubs is
provided which will, within a few years, reestablish an adequate buffer. [Policy retained,
but not part of Housing Element]
                                     38
53.     Except as provided in the discussion of commercial development, commercial uses in
        residential areas of the City and County should be limited to home occupations where the
        activity is confined to the residence or accessory building and signs are kept to a
        minimum. Storage of crab pots, fishing boats, campers and trailers within required yard
        areas should be allowed provided visibility at street intersections and access to the
        perimeter of the dwelling is not hampered. [Policy retained, but not part of Housing
        Element]
54.     The County should inspect all motel and cabin units being used as permanent residences
        to determine if they are suitable for permanent occupancy. Rental of suitable motel and
        cabin units by college students should be encouraged. [Policy removed/not applicable to
        City Housing Element]
These policies have been retained, revised, replaced or removed (as indicated) in order to bring
the City's Housing Element into conformance with current goals and State requirements and to
separate out those policies not directly related to housing. See Section VII for the Goals,
Policies and Implementation Measures proposed as part of this Housing Element.
The Housing section of the General Plan makes no mention of any effort to minimize
governmental constraints to maintenance, improvement, and development of housing. However,
the 1976 General Plan Project, Community Infrastructure, addresses several related issues.
First, the Report states that many existing housing units which fail to conform with current
building codes are protected under the "grandfather clause"--meaning that they were established
prior to the adoption of current codes and therefore need not be brought into conformity until a
structure remodel or expansion is proposed. This protection of non-conforming units minimizes
housing costs for many city residents.
Community Infrastructure also stresses the importance of careful judgement on the part of the
City and County when imposing expensive code requirements on older buildings. It is noted
that these older buildings are the primary source of affordable housing for limited income
households within the city.
As noted throughout this Element, a major housing conservation measure taken by the City of
Trinidad is the attempt to limit housing costs for residents of older, moderate-cost dwellings.
Preservation of the rural character of the city, allowance for existing nonconforming structures,
and avoidance of expensive code requirements on older buildings (for new homeowners) all
work toward this end.
At the time of General Plan adoption, no concerted effort was put forth by the City to improve
the condition of deteriorating units, as very few of these units were reported to exist at that time.
 To date, the City has not developed an organized rehabilitation program, and no State funds for
such a program have become available. However, FmHA does offer financial assistance for
home improvement to qualifying homeowners. Three types of FmHA funding are currently
available to Trinidad residents:
Section 504 - Home Repair: Provides grants to senior citizens and very low-interest loans to
lower-income owner/occupants for health and safety related housing repairs. (Administered by
FmHA, Eureka office.)
                                             39
        Section 502 - Rehabilitation: Similar to the 504 program, with the same loan maximum.
        Rehabilitation must bring entire house up to FmHA standards. (Administered by FmHA,
        Eureka office.)
        Section 502 - Home ownership: Provides loans to low-and moderate-income households for
        purchase of single-family dwellings. (Administered by FmHA, Eureka office.)
        Within the past 20 years there has been no evidence of any restrictions on housing choices to
        special needs groups in Trinidad, except in cases where property values exceed those affordable
        by limited-income households. No concentrations or groupings of minority or poor-quality
        housing exist within the city. Furthermore, no fair housing or housing discrimination
        complaints have been received by the City since the adoption of the General Plan.
        The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Renewal (HUD) provides rent subsidy assistance to
        low-income households in certified existing housing units in Trinidad. Locally, this assistance
        is administered through the Humboldt County Housing Authority.
B. EFFECTIVENESS
   The goals and objectives of the Housing section of the General Plan are relatively broad in nature.
   They provide an overview of Trinidad's unique housing situation and the make up of its population.
   The Housing section also defines the City's general policies regarding the assurance of affordable
   housing to all income groups. The existing City housing program does not, however, specifically
   address all issues currently required for analysis by the State in preparing an official Housing
   Element. This Housing Element attempts to remedy the inadequacies of the previous housing
   program.
                                                    40
                                     VI. HOUSING NEEDS SUMMARY
Previous sections have described the factors contributing to Trinidad's position with respect to meeting its
housing needs.
In view of these factors, the City should focus its housing efforts on the following:
A.   GENERAL
     1.   Facilitate the ability of limited-income households to improve the condition of their living
          quarters through financial and technical assistance, as feasible.
     2.   Continue to promote the conservation of affordable housing through policies aimed at
          minimizing overall housing costs for residents, with special focus on limited-income households.
     3.   Provide opportunities for construction of affordable housing on developable vacant lots.
      4.  Encourage the utilization of available subsidy programs such as HUD Section 8 and FmHA
          construction/rehabilitation programs by qualified city residents.
B.   SPECIAL NEEDS
     The "special needs" households described in previous sections should be specifically considered in
     the City's housing programs as follows:
     1.   Encourage the provision of access for handicapped persons in new and rehabilitated residential
          structures. Where handicapped access provisions are not provided with initial construction,
          building design should not preclude the possibility of such future remodeling.
     2.   Encourage adequate supply of local day care/nursery school programs.
     3.   Encourage shared housing opportunities, particularly for seniors, female-headed households, and
          the disabled.
     4.   Increase public awareness of local assistance opportunities including public subsidized housing
          programs, shared housing, day care and nursery facilities, social services (for transitional or
          homeless persons), housing rehabilitation programs, weatherization practices, fair housing
          policies, local employment opportunities, and energy conservation methods.
     5.   Further investigate the feasibility of establishing a limited care facility in Trinidad to assist local
          seniors and the disabled.
     6.   Encourage tourism, to a reasonable extent, to help bolster the city's economy. The primary focus
          should be on counterbalancing revenues lost due to drops in commercial-fishing-related tourism.
                                                      41
                   VII. GOALS, POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTATION -- 1996-2001
The State has suggested the following broad "goals" for local housing elements:
1.   To promote and ensure the provision of adequate housing for all persons regardless of income, age,
     race, or ethnic background.
2.   To promote and ensure the provision of housing selection by location, type, price, and tenure.
3.   To promote and ensure open and free choice of housing for all.
4.   To develop a balanced residential environment which includes access to jobs, community facilities,
     and services.
5.   To serve as a guide for municipal decision-making regarding issues that effect housing stock quality
     or supply.
In addition to these goals, recent legislation encourages local Housing Elements to address emergency
housing and housing for the homeless.
The City's goals, policies and objectives are intended to accomplish the broad State housing goals as
appropriate for Trinidad's particular needs and circumstances. [Note: Under AGoals@ (P) followed by
numbers indicate the policies that pertain to the goal. Likewise, under APolicies@ (I) followed by numbers
indicate implementation proposed for each policy.]

                                     VIII. ENERGY CONSERVATION
Energy costs are often immense household expenses, second only to rent or mortgage payments.
Combined with energy costs, home insurance premiums and mortgage/rent payments can easily exceed
50% of a household's total income.
Although Trinidad's proximity to the Pacific Ocean ensures its stable year-round temperatures, conditions
are such that artificial heating systems are necessary in all residences. According to the 1990 Census, the
primary modes of space heating for housing units in Trinidad were wood stoves/fireplaces and electricity.
Use of wood stoves for heating has increased over the past several years in Trinidad, as it has in other parts
of the County. Traditionally, local sources of firewood were relatively plentiful. The booming lumber
industry assured the availability of cut mill ends, many of which were donated to local residents free of
charge. Also in large supply were trees subject to individual harvest for firewood.
Recent cutbacks in the timber industry and the enactment of strict regulations on timber harvest have now
caused the once-abundant supply of firewood to diminish. It is expected that the cost of locating and
purchasing acceptable firewood will continue to heighten in the future.
Even in light of the problems surrounding firewood availability, many households may find wood-burning
economically beneficial due to its otherwise low energy costs.
All new construction in Trinidad meets California Title 24 Building Energy Standards. The rigorous and
conservative Title 24 guidelines mandate housing that requires only a fraction of the energy needed to heat
most older homes. The City of Trinidad recognizes that careful design and construction are integral
components of any successful energy-conservation program.
The Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), the local utility gas supplier, commonly offers financing
programs to assist households with the implementation of residential energy conservation measures.
Qualifying property-owners are eligible to receive cash rebates or no-interest loans for weatherization
improvements to their homes. Such improvements might include weatherstripping, use of water heater
insulation blankets, caulking, or installation of storm windows, low-flow showerheads, or automatic
setback thermostats.
It is important to note that low-income households may have difficulty meeting the criteria for these
programs. Common criteria include a mandatory high credit rating and the "up-front" purchase of
weatherization materials with only partial, subsequent reimbursement.
The Redwood Community Action Agency (RCAA), a local community service agency, offers free
weatherization service to low-income residents of Humboldt County and has serviced several residences in
Trinidad. Aside from offering this Low Income Weatherization Program, RCAA maintains an energy
demonstration center and utilizes various methods of public education. The agency also assists low-
income households with emergency payoff of utility bills.
In order to help implement energy conservation and innovative energy-use within the city, some Trinidad
residents have installed solar water-heating systems and/or attached solariums to their units. Use of such
solar heating systems is encouraged by the City, both for new construction and as retrofits for existing
structures.
In addition to the above-mentioned services offered through RCAA, the agency has operated a "Municipal
                                                       48
Solar Utility" in recent years. This leasing mechanism allowed low- and moderate-income households to
retrofit their residences (including rentals) for solar energy use by assisting them with initial equipment
purchase costs. Due to implementation barriers, this program is not currently in use.
Overall, as of this writing, the City encourages energy conservation by:
1.    Requiring compliance with State energy conservation standards;
2.    Reviewing site plans and subdivision designs for solar access;
3.    Suggesting and supporting solar design through the Design Review Process.
