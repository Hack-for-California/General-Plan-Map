          SECTION I      INTRODUCTION TO THE CONSERVATION ELEMENT
I Purpose The purpose of the Conservation Element is to identify
          and examine the community's natural resources and to
          develop policies for the protection and preservation of
I         these resources so that they may be available for the use
          and enjoyment of the community in the years to come.
I         In addition to the natural resources shared in the
          community, there are man-made resources, which are of a
          common public value as well. These resources include
          public utilities and infrastructure. Sewer lines, water
I         supply lines, drainage channels and energy transmission
          lines are critical components of a city's man-made
          resource base. A portion of this element will be
I         concerned with these resources.

I              SECTION II     EXISTING CONDITIONS
               Incorporated in 1922, the City of Hawthorne is a highly
I              urbanized community, and as a consequence native plants
               and animals, minerals and natural water courses, are
               virtually non-existent. Soils have been highly disturbed
               as a result of development.
I  Climate     Hawthorne is located in the Los Angeles Basin, which is
               characterized by a mediterranean, semi-arid climate.
I              This is typified by mild, sunny winters with occasional
               rainfall, and warm, dry summers. Most of the rain falls
               from December through March.
I              Hawthorne's close proximity to the Pacific Ocean has a
               great influence on its climate. Temperatures in the
               summer months are somewhat lower than in communities
I              located further inland. Average temperatures range from
               49' Fahrenheit (F) to 67'F in winter, and from 65'F to
               78'F in summer. Average yearly rainfall is approximately
               12.08 inches, with the wettest months being January and
I              February, averaging 2.75 inches, and the driest months in
               July and August, averaging 0.05 inches. The City enjoys
               prevailing cool west-southwesterly breezes from the
I              Pacific Ocean. Daytime velocities average eight miles
               per hour (m.p.h.) with late night breezes from one-to-two
               m.p.h. increasing to 12 m.p.h. in the late afternoon.
               During the late fall and early winter months, the warm,
I              dry Santa Ana breezes occasionally blow in from the
               deserts located to the east.
I  Air Quality Air pollution is the presence of substances in the air
               which exceed naturally occurring levels and are
               detrimental to the community_ Air pollution can cause
               direct impacts on human health, cause poor plant growth,
I              accelerate deterioration of buildings, and impact visual
               aesthetics. The main source of air pollution is from
               motor vehicles, natural gas used for cooking and heating,.
I              and electrical generating plants that provide electricity
               to the City.
               Due to Southern California's geophysical form, the Los
I              Angeles basin experiences frequent summertime temperature
               inversion layers which aggravate air quality levels.
               Photochemical smog, a result of vehicle emissions
I              reacting with sunlight, obscures views and creates a
               health hazard.

                                                              March 1989

I             .Because of their regional nature, air pollution control
               activities represent joint efforts between local, state
               and federal governments. Coordination of these
               activities is the responsibility of the California Air
I              Resources Board. While the responsibility for the
               control of motor vehicle emissions is shared by the Air
               Resources Board and the Environmental Protection Agency,
I              local authorit ies are charged with responsi bility for the
               control of pollutants emitted by stationary sources. The
               South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD)
I              monitors and enforces air quality standards for
               stationary pollutant sources.
               The Lennox air monitoring station services the Hawthorne
I              area. The SCAQMD .reports that air quality levels in this
               part of the western Los Angeles Basin exceed California
               ambient air quality standards for all pollutants except
I              sulfur dioxide and that the most widespread number of
               violations are associated with ozone and carbon monoxide.
               Ozone problems typically occur in the warm summer and
               fall seasons; carbon monoxide levels are typically
I              highest in the fall and winter seasons. Suspended
               particulates also pose problems.
I              In terms of the land use characteristics of the City of
               Hawthorne, with the major industrial centers, the airport
               and heavy vehicle traffic as a result of these employment
               centers, Hawthorne faces major challenges in meeting its
I              regional responsibility to controlling air quality. For
               this reason it is imperative that Hawthorne consider air
               quality in the planning process, as well as in day-to-day
I              activities, by considering the environmental impact of
               major traffic generating projects, by locating sensitive
               land uses away from major arterials streets, and by
               encouraging alternate modes of transportation, such as
I              light rail, vanpooling, carpools, mass transit buses,
               trolleys, jitneys, etc.
I              Maintaining ambient air quality levels is of paramount
               concern to many Californians. The South Coast Air Basin
               will continue to be a nonattainment area for those
               pollutants that are monitored. Yet it should be
I              recognized that air quality has improved somewhat in the
               South Coast Basin over the last decade, despite continued
               population growth, vehicle use, and economic activity.
I Groundwater  Freshwater-bearing sediments extend from a depth of about
               300 feet to a depth of approximately 1,500 feet below the
               surface of the City. These sediments range in geologic
I              age from Recent to Pleistocene.

I
I              The Recent deposits extend to a depth of about 60 feet
               below the surface. These deposits are represented by
               both continental alluvium and aeolian sand. The borings
I              from well driller's logs indicate fine sand, silty clay,
               and clay deposits. No significant water production zones
               are known to exist within the Recent series.
I Gage Aquifer Pleistocene formations are locally designated as the
               Upper Pleistocene formulation and the Low, or San Pedro
               and Pico, Pleistocene formations. Upper Pleistocene
I              formations extend from beneath the Recent sediments to a
               depth of 240 feet, which is the base of the Gage Aquifer.
               The topmost 50 feet of this formation is composed
               primarily of clay and sandy clay with intermittent zones
I              of fine sands and infrequent streaks of gravel.
               Historically the Gage Aquifer has been considered a
I              significant water-producing zone in the West Basin.
               However, because of over-draft and lateral percolation,
               this aquifer no longer transmits exploitable quantities
               of water in the Hawthorne vicinity. In addition, the
I              fine grained character of the materials in the zones that
               underlie the City is another factor which renders the
               Gage Aquifer undesirable for exploitation by high
I Silverado
               production water wells.
               The San Pedro or Lower Pleistocene Formation lies
  Aquifer      beneath the Gage Aquifer and extends to a depth of about
I              600 feet below the surface. Within this 360 foot section
               of continental and marine sediments lies the Silverado
               Aquifer, the most significant water-bearing zone in the
I              West Basin.
               In the Hawthorne area the top of the Silverado Aquifer
               occurs at a depth of approximately 300 feet below the
I              surface of the earth. This aquifer averages 150 feet in
               depth. Medium-to-coarse sand and gravel make up the
               major portion of this aquifer, all~wing it the high
I              transmission and storage capacity required for high
               production water wells. Thus, well production for the
               City. of Hawthorne has traditionally been derived
               predominantly from the Silverado Aquifer.
I Sunnyside    Beneath the San Pedro formation lies the Pico formation.
  Aquifer      Also of the Pliocene era, the Pico formation is comprised
I              predominantly of marine shale and siltstone. Although -
               these are not considered water-bearing deposits, the Pico
               formation does contain localized zones of water-bearing
               sediments ~hich are designated elsewhere in the West

I           Basin as the Sunnyside Aquifer. As no wells are known
            to penetrate this aquifer in the Hawthorne vicinity,
            little is known concerning the size or depth of this
I Landform
            aquifer.
            Hawthorne is located in the Centinela Valley. The
            Centinela Valley is not really a valley at all, but
I           rather a semi-flat plain stretching roughly from the
            Baldwin Hills on the north to the Palos Verdes Hills on
            the south. The terrain of Hawthorne is flat and
I           relatively featureless. No significant landforms exist
            in the City today.
  Soils     As recorded in 1919 by the United States Geological
I           Survey Office, the predominant soil types in the City are
            Ramona Loam and Montezuma Clay Adobe.
I           Ramona Loam is a very fertile soil suitable for growing a
            wide variety of grains and fruits. It is composed of
            clay, silt and sand, and has good drainage
            characteristics. This porosity allows water to readily
I           percolate into the soil, providing for groundwater
            rep1enishment.
I           The Montezuma clay adobe soil is considered a fertile,
            sticky and heavy soil which is hard to manage. This is
            considered an expansive soil. The soil grain porosity is
            such that during periods of heavy rainfall most of the
I           water will not be absorbed by this soil and substantial
            surface runoff can result. This necessitates designing
            flood control storm drains which can accommodate heavier
I           surface flow.
            In addition, Ramona Clay Loam, Yolo Loam, Yolo Sandy
            Loam, Handford Loam and Dublin Clay Adobe can be found
I           within limited geographic areas on the northeast side of
            the City and in portions of the south central and south
            eastern sections of Hawthorne. The Dublin City Adobe and
I           Hanford Loam soils have a low to moderate potential for
            1iquifaction, which will be addressed in the Safety
            Element.
I Hydrology Water is a critical issue in Southern California because
            of our semi-arid environment and our heavy reliance on
            imported water. Over 85 percent of our water in Southern
I           California is imported. Imported water comes from
            Northern California, the eastern Sierras, the Owens
            Valley, and the Colorado River. In fact, the watersheds
I           that supply Southern California now encompasses
            one-twelfth of the continental United States.

              District (WCBMWD). The WCBMWD adjudicates water rights
I              in the area bounded by the Ballona Escarpment, the
              Newport-Inglewood Fault, San Pedro Bay, and the Pacific
              Ocean, a relatively small groundwater basin underlying
              the southwestern part of the Los Angeles Coastal Plan.
I             The basin's 160 square miles include 20 incorporated
              cities.
I             Ground water levels in the West Coast Basin are
              considered severely depleted. Useable capacity in the
              basin is less than ten percent, although the storage
              capacity is high.
I             Thirty-six years ago groundwater pumping caused an
              intrusion of sea water into the Basin and legal action
I             was begun to halt the overdraft and prevent serious
              damage to the Basin. Since then, salt water intrusion in
              the basin has been effectively halted by the West Coast
              Basin Barrier Project, consisting of a line of 120
I             injection wells that parallel the coastline from Los
              Angeles International Airport to Palos Verdes Hills. Los
              Angeles County Department of Public Works, which operated
I             the project, injects State Water Project and Colorado
              River water into the barrier to create a pressure ridge
              that impedes the inland movement of a salt water front
              and maintains protective ground water elevations in the
I             Silverado aquifer.
  Groundwater The volume of groundwater stored in the West Coast Basin
I Volume      is constantly changed by variations in subsurface inflow
              and outflow, artificial recharge, extractions, and to a
              lesser degree, precipitation. The Silverado Aquifer
              underlying most of the West Coast Basin (including
I             Hawthorne) is the most productive aquifer in the Basin.
              Ranging from 100-500 feet in thickness, it yields 80 to
              90 percent of the ground water extracted annually.
I             Water supply and water use conditions have remained
              relatively stable in the Basin over the past 20 years,
              which has averaged about 60,000 acre-feet extracted
I             annually. Growth in water requirements has been met by
              new supplemental sources and the trend is for continued
              increases in imported water. In 1985-86 the West Coast
I             Basin imported 257,917 acre-feet ~nd extracted 54,708
              acre-feet of water.

  I  City Water
     Needs
                   The Hawthorne Water Department supplies approximately
                   two-thirds of the City's water demand. The other one-
                   third is supplied by the Southern California Water
  I                Company. In existence since the early 1920's, each
                   water company services about half of the geographic area
                   of the City.
  I                As a member of the West Coast Basin.,the City Water
                   Department has an adjudicated right to withdraw 1,882
                   acre-feet of water annually. Of this amount, the City
  I                sets aside 600 acre-feet in a water reserve account.
                   So, in actuality, the City withdraws 1,282 acre-feet of
                   water a year. The remainder of the City's need, 4,619
                   acre-feet, is imported from the Colorado River and State
  I                Water Project through the Metropolitan Water District.
                   This yields a yearly supply of 5,866 acre-feet a year.
  I  Southern
     California
     Water Company
                   Established in 1929, the Southern California Water Company
                   services 5,300 customers in the City of Hawthorne. They
                   provide 3,800 acre-feet of water annually. Three clear
                   water wells in the vicinity pump 15 percent of this -
I I                water, or 600 acre-feet. The remaining 85 percent or
                   3,200 acre-feet is imported from State Water Project and
                   Colorado River water through the Metropolitan Water
I II               District. The manager of the Southern California Water
                   Company Western Division anticipates that future water
                   requirements for the area will be met through imported
                   rather than well water resources.
  I  Future        In November of 1986 the City Water Department had an
     Water Demands independent consultant, Boyle Engineering Corporation,
  I                evaluate the City's Water Department needs. They found
                   that major redevelopment efforts underway in the City
                   could significantly impact the intensity and patterns of
                   water use. In addition, the annexations which have been
  I                occurring due to the new configurations of the land
                   (because of the Century Freeway routing through
                   Hawthorne) will also have an impact on future water
  I                demands.
                   Northrop, the City's largest water user, uses a great
                   deal of water in their manufacturing process, primarily
  I                for rinsing, cooling and industrial boilers. Their
                   projections of water usage through 1995 vary from an
                   increase of 13 percent for normal expansion to 35 percent
  I                for normal expansion, plus their obtaining larger
                   government contracts. Boyle Engineering used a
                   "conservative projection" of a 35 percent increase in
                   overall water demand to project future water requirements
  I                for the City.

   I Water
     Pollution
               The Regional Water Quality Control Board is assigned the
               task of monitoring ground and surface water quality.
     Control   Local governments may adopt ordinances pertaining to
   I           water quality only if they are more restrictive than
               state law. Hawthorne, like most local governments,
               relies on the ability of the Regional Board and its staff
               to monitor ground and surface waters and set standards
   I           which will protect the health and safety of its
               constituents.
   I           The Regional Water Quality Control Board provides a
               valuable service to the people of Hawthorne which the
               City could not accomplish on its own. By participating
               in the Sea Water Intrusion Barrier Project and the
 I             In-lieu Water Replenishment Program, Hawthorne is helping
               to conserve and protect our ground water resources.
  I            In addition to underground water pollution from salt
               water intrusion, commercial, residential and industrial
               users may also cause water contamination. To prevent
               this, the City may require installation of cross-
  I            connection or backflow prevention devices to insure that
               where water mains may break, contaminated water will not
               enter the water supply system.
  I            Recently the City created a Hazardous Materials
               Specialist position in the Fire Department. This
  •I Drainage
               individual is charged with monitoring the storage,
               transportation and disposal of hazardous materials. This
               position will help the City to further insure that water
               quality standards are maintained.
               The hydrological characteristics of the watersheds within
     and       Hawthorne have been markedly changed through the process
     Flooding  of urbanization. The major drainage course within the
 I             City is the Dominguez Channel, which acts solely as a .
               flood control, surface run-off collector.
 I             The risk of flooding in Hawthorne is considered low
               because the City does not lie in the inundation path of
'.
               any significant dams nor does it fall within the
               floodplain of any major streamway. Surface runoff is
               contained and transported by the extensive storm drain
               system throughout the City to the point where flood

I Pl ant Life  Native plant communities originally found in Hawthorne
               were of the coastal sagebrush variety. Coastal sagebrush
               or coastal sage scrub was commonly found in the Los
I              Angeles Basin. This plant community is described as a
               "low, dense, shrub formation dominated by California
               sagebrush, white sage, black sage and common buckwheat."
               These grey-green, small-leaved, drought-tolerant shrubs
I              are able to withstand the poor saline soils and the windy
               conditions of the coastal environment. The early Spanish
               and Mexican settlers grazed cattle on these plants.
I              By the late 1880's vineyards, cornfields, and fruit trees
               had been planted. Scotsman Robert Burnett and Canadian
               Daniel Freeman were responsible for planting thousands of
I              eucalyptus, pepper, almond, olive and citrus trees here.
               Fields of wildflower bloomed, including poppies, lupines,
               wild mustard, wild horseradish and pink verbena.
I              In 1875-76 a severe drought hit the ranchers and over
               22,000 head of cattle were lost. Soon after, dry farming
               of beans and barley began. By the 1920's grain farming
I             was the basis of the local economy. Only the Japanese
               farmers were able to use intensive farming techniques and
              water saving measures to grow other crops for local
I              consumption. Japanese nurseries still operate here in
              Hawthorne today.
               By the 1930's Hawthorne was rapidly becomin9 an urban,
I              industrial center. Development replaced native vegetation
              and new ornamental plants were introduced.
I Wildl ife   Hawthorne's wildlife population consists of the typical
              urban menagerie of gophers and mice, insects, small birds
              and reptiles and other species that have adapted
              themselves to urbanization. Displacement of wildlife has
I             no real meaning in Hawthorne today.
  Electrical  Electrical energy is supplied by the Southern California
I Ener9Y      Edison Company to the consumers in the City. Electric
              power supplied to the City comes principally from
              natural gas steam generation plants in El Segundo;
              Redondo and Huntington Beach, and from nuclear power at
I             the San Onofre Power Plant. The Redondo and Huntington
              Beach sources are able to switch over to oil generation
              power if necessary.
I             Natural gas is still the most economical source of
              energy, and this is where the majority of electrical
              power c9mes from today. Forecasts for the future are
I             that natural gas resources, although non-renewable,
              will carry us into the 21st Century.

 I Natural Gas    Natural gas supplied to the South Basin area in general,
                  and the City of Hawthorne in particular, comes primarily
                  from the Southern California Gas Company. Although
 I                deregulated to a great extent, the gas consumers
                  throughout the state have largely remained loyal
                  customers of the big distributors. Southern California
                  gas provides 35% of its product to residential users, 33%
 I                to the electric utilities (Southern California Edison is
                  their biggest single customer), 19% to industrial buyers
                  and 13% to commercial entities. Gas is transported to
 I                Hawthorne largely from the E1 Paso, Texas region and
                  through the Northwestern Pipeline Company. Supplies are
                  forecasted to remain adequate into the 21st Century.
 I                Natural gas is not a renewable resource and as such, when
                  these supplies are depleted, we must turn to other, more
                  expensive, forms of energy. Discovering and developing
 I                renewable non-polluting energy resources should be a top
                  priority for all consumers.
   Transportation Gasoline is our major source of transportation energy.
 I                Yet, burning these fossil fuels is causing problems with
                  the ozone level and air quality. Natural gas and
                  petroleum reserves are non-renewable resources and are
 I                not expected to last indefinitely. Utilizing alternate
                  clean-burning sources of transportation energy such as
                  methane, propane and ethyl alcohol, should be encouraged.

 I               SECTION III - ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
                 Although the City of Hawthorne is essentially built-out
 I               and provides few natural resources in terms of energy
                 sources or scenic and biological value, the City
                 contributes to the to quality and use of regional natural
                 resources such as air and water quality, water supply,
 I               and energy.
                 As the City continues to develop, it needs to consider
 I               the implications of further development in terms of
                 availability of necessary resources and the impact of
                 such development on the surrounding community.
 I               The following factors discussed in this section were
                 identified as the major issues and opportunities to be
                 addressed in the Conservation Element.
 I Water Quality
   and Supply
                 Increasing population and development has created high
                 demand for clean, high quality drinking water. As a
                 result, once plentiful supplies have been reduced in .both
 I               quantity and quality to levels where additional measures
                 to ensure adequate future supplies have become necessary.
                 The City needs to realize the importance of water in
 I               guiding future planning efforts.
                 Various programs exist which the City can use to educate
                 the population, encourage conservation, and to ensure
 I               that supplies will be adequate to support the current and
                 future needs and requirements of the City. A program of
                 utilizing reclaimed water for irrigation of public parks
II               and open spaces will help to conserve higher quality
                 water necessary for domestic needs.
   Air Quality   The entire South Coast Air Basin is considered a
 I               non-attainment area for air pollutants with increasingly
                 higher levels of pollutants such as carbon monoxide,
                 nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide being emitted by the
 I               increasing reliance on single-occupancy vehicles.
                 Programs to encourage alternate modes of travel would
                 help the City contribute to a regional improvement in air
                 quality.
 I Energy        The City relies heavily on electrical power generation
                 and natural gas, a non-renewable energy source, to run
 I               machinery, lights, cooking, and heating. The burning of
                 natural gas for power generation also contributes to
                 declining air quality. Continued growth and development
                 will result in increased consumption and reduced
 I               supplies.

I
I
I The City can encourage a lifestyle less dependent on
  non-renewable energy sources by encouraging development
  of alternative energy sources, educating its residents on

I SECTION IV - CONSERVATION ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
  The City of Hawthorne is committed to providing the
I community with a full measure of efficient and economical
  services and facilities. The intent and purpose of these
  goals and policies are to provide direction for
  maintaining or upgrading the water supply system, to
I ensure adequate water levels, to improve air quality and
  to promote and encourage energy conservation.
I GOAL 1.0:
  CAPABLE OF
  DEMANDS IN
             MAINTAIN A SAFE, CLEAN DRINKING WATER SUPPLY
             ADEQUATELY MEETING NORMAL AND EMERGENCY
             THE CITY THROUGH SOUND CONSERVATION AND
  MANAGEMENT PRACTICE.
I POLICY 1.1: The City shall preserve and protect the
  existing water resources, including domestic and imported
I sources.
  POLICY 1.2: The City shall take measures to replenish
  and expand our ground water resources.

I               SECTION I     INTRODUCTION
                The Noise Element of this General Plan is a comprehensive
                program for including noise control in the planning
I               process. It is a tool for local planners to use in
                achieving and maintaining compatible land use with
                environmental noise levels. The Noise Element identifies
I               noise sensitive land uses and noise sources, and defines
                areas of noise impact for the purpose of developing
                programs to ensure that Hawthorne residents will be
I               protected from excessive noise intrusion.
                The element quantifies the community noise environment in
                terms of noise exposure contours for both near and
I               long-term levels of growth and traffic activity. The
                information will become a guideline for the development of
                land use policies to achieve compatible land uses and
I               provide baseline levels and noise source identification
                for local noise ordinance enforcement. The Technical
                Appendix contains background information and a glossary
                that defines a number of key terms used in noise
I               assessments.
  Background on Noise Definitions. Sound is technically described
I Noise         in terms of the loudness (amplitude) of the sound and
                frequency (pitch) of the sound. The standard unit of
                measurement of the loudness of sound is the Decibel (dB).
                Since the human ear is not equally sensitive to sound at
I               all frequencies, a special frequency-dependent rating
                scale has been devised to relate noise to human.
                sensitivity. The A-weighted decibel scale (dBA) performs
I               this compensation by discriminating against frequencies
                in a manner approximating the sensitivity of the human
                ear.
I               Decibels are based on the logarithmic scale. The
                logarithmic scale compresses the wide range in sound
                pressure levels to a more usable range of numbers in a
I               manner similar to the Richter scale used to measure
                earthquakes. In terms of human response to noise, a
                sound 10 dBA higher than another is judged to be twice as
                loud; and 20 dBA higher four times as loud; and so forth.
I               Everyday sounds normally range from 30 dB (very quiet) to
                100 dB (very loud). Examples of various sound levels in
                different environments are shown in Figure I.
I               Noise Metric and Assessment Criteria. Community noise is
                generally not a steady state and varies with time. Under
                conditions of non-steady state noise, some type of
I               statistical metric is necessary in order to quantify
I                                   I                        Noise Element

I noise exposure over a long period of time. Several
  rating scales have been developed for describing the
  effects of noise on people. They are designed to account
I for the above known effects of noise on people.
  Based on these effects, the observation has been made
  that the potential for noise to impact people is
I dependent on the total acoustical energy content of the
  noise. A number of noise scales have been developed to
  account for this observation. These scales are: the
I Equivalent Noise Level (LEQ), the Day Night Noise Level
  (LON), and the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL).

I            SECTION II     EXISTING CONDITIONS
             This section contains a detailed description of the
I            current and projected noise environment within the City.
             This description of the noise environment is based on an
             identification of noise sources and noise sensitive land
             uses, a community noise measurement survey and noise
I            contour maps.
             To define the noise exposure, this section of the report
I            first identifies the major sources of noise in the
             community. The sources of noise in Hawthorne include:
             freeway, aircraft, overflights, arterial roadways, and
             industrial and commercial centers. To completely assess
I            the noise environment in the City, noise sensitive
             receptors must also be identified. As mandated by the
             State, noise sensitive receptors include, but are not
I            limited to, areas containing schools, hospitals, rest
             homes, long-term medical or mental care facilities, or any
             other land use area deemed noise sensitive by the local
             jurisdiction.
I            Based upon the identification of the major noise sources
             and the location of sensitive receptors, a noise
I            measurement survey was conducted. The function of the
             survey is threefold. The first is to determine the
             existing noise levels at noise sensitive land uses. The
             second function is to provide empirical data for the
I            correlation and calibration of the computer modeled noise
             environment. A third important aspect of the survey is to
             obtain an accurate description of the ambient noise levels
I            in various communities throughout the City.
             Noise contours for all of the major noise sources in
             Hawthorne were developed based upon current traffic
I            conditions. The contours were determined from the traffic
             levels for these sources. The contours are expressed in
             terms of the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). The
I            existing conditions scenario is derived from 1987 traffic
             levels and environmental conditions. Future conditions
             are assumed to remain essentially the same as existing
             conditions except for the freeways, where the anticipated
I            freeway development and the growth in traffic is included
             in these estimates.
I Sources of
  Noise
             The sources of noise in Hawthorne fall into four basic
             categories. These are: freeways, aircraft overflights,
             major and minor arterial roadways, and stationary sources.
             Each of these sources and their impacts on the noise

I
I                 environment of Hawthorne are summarized inthe following
                  paragraphs and discussed in greater detail in the
                 Technical Appendix.
I                The most common sources of noise in urban areas are
                  transportation related noise sources. These include auto-
                 mobiles, trucks, motorcycles, railroads, and aircraft.
I                Motor vehicle noise is of concern because it is charac-
                 terized by a high number of individual events which often
                 create a sustained noise level and its proximity to areas
I                 sensitive to noise exposure. Aircraft operations, though
                  infrequent, may generate high noise levels that can be
                 disruptive to human activity.
I Freeways       The City of Hawthorne is bisected by a freeway, and a
                 number of arterial roadways. A new major freeway is also
                 being planned for the northern portion of the city. The
I                San Diego Freeway runs in a north/south direction, in the
                 western portion of the city. The freeway is currently
                 under reconstruction, and included as part of this
                 construction project will be sound barriers to meet the
I                FHWA/Caltrans 67 LEQ Peak Hour Noise Standard.
                 Residential developments are located along the freeway.
I                The Century Freeway right-of-way is located along the
                 north boundary of the City. This future project will tra-
                 verse residential developments within the City. The pro-
                 ject design does include sound barriers as part of the
I                project. These barriers will be designed such that adja-
                 cent residential land uses will not exceed tne Caltrans/
                 FHWA standards.
I Major and
  Minor Arterial
                 Traffic noise on surface streets is a significant source
                 of noise within the community. The major roadways in the
  Roadways       City include: Imperial Highway, El Segundo Boulevard,
I                Rosecrans Avenue, and Compton Boulevard in the east/west
                 direction and Aviation Boulevard, Inglewood Avenue,
                 Hawthorne Boulevard, Prairie Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard
I Aircraft
                 in the north/south direction.
                 Another major source of noise within the City of Hawthorne
                 is aircraft noise. Hawthorne Municipal Airport is located
I                at the northeast end of the City. Operations from
                 departing and arriving aircraft result in significant
                 noise levels in the north portion of the city. Contours
I                for the airport show that some residential areas west of
                 the airport are exposed to noise levels greater than 60
                 CNEL.

  I
  I
  I              Los Angeles International Airport is located northwest of
                 the city. The published airport noise studies show that
                 the 65 CNEL noise contours from these operations is
                 located just outside the City boundary, however, the noise
  I              levels from these operations in the north portion of the
                 City boundary exceed 60 CNEL. Enroute helicopters will
                 fly over the city following the path of the freeway.
  I             Occasional single event disturbances from these overflights
                do occur.
    Stationary
  I Sources
                The City of Hawthorne has industrial and commercial
                 sources of noise at a number of locations throughout
                the City. These include commercial centers that range in
                 size from major aerospace corporations to small industrial
  I             operations. Many of these smaller operations are located
                 in strip commercial zones with adjacent residential land
                 use. The types of noise disturbance from these activities
  I             can range from short duration loud events such as trucks
                accessing the facility to continuous noise such as from
                refrigeration units or compressors.
  I Noise
    Sensitive
    Receptors
                The City of Hawthorne has a number of noise sensitive
                land uses. Within the city are a number of public and
                and private schools, day care centers and rest homes. The
  I             location of these facilities are shown in the Safety
                Element. The distribution of these facilities varies
                from moderately quiet residential areas to major
                transportation corridors.
  I Community
    Noise
                The determination of the major noise sources and the
                identification of noise sensitive receptors provide
  I Measurement
    Survey
                the basis of developing a community noise survey. The
                noise measurement survey was conducted at locations which
                reflect the noise levels at these facilities. Each site
                was monitored for a minimum of 20 minutes with longer
  I             measurements at locations near noise sources where the
                events are sporadic. The results of the survey and the
                methodology used in the measurement are summarized in the
  I             Technical Appendix.
'.I
    Community   The noise contours for the City of Hawthorne are presented
    Noise       in Figures 3 and 4 for existing 1987 and future 1997
    Contours    conditions respectively. The noise contours for
                Hawthorne Municipal Airport are being prepared as part of
                the Airport Master Plan Update and will be included in
                Figure 5. The contours are based on the existing
                conditions of traffic volumes and other sources of noise
                in the community. Future conditions are expected to
                remain the same as existing conditions except for the
  I             freeways. The methodology used for computing the noise
                contours is presented in the Technical Appendix.

I Noise contours represent lines of equal noise exposure,
  just as the contour lines on a topographic map are lines of
  equal elevation. The contours shown on the map are the 60
I and 65 dB CNEL noise level. The noise contours presented
  should be used as a guide for land use planning. The 60
  dB CNEL contour defines the Noise Referral Zone. This is
  the noise level for which noise considerations should be
I included when making land use policy decisions.
  The contours presented in this report are a graphic
I representation of the noise environment. These distances
  to contour values are also shown in tabular format in the
  Technical Appendix. Topography and intervening buildings
  or barriers have a very complex effect on the propagation
I of noise. To present a worst case estimate, the
  topographic affect is not included in these contours to

  I                  SECTION III      ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
    Transportation   Within the City of Hawthorne are a number of transpor-
  I Noise Control    tation related noise sources including freeways,
                      aircraft overflights, major arterials, and collector
                     roadways. These sources are the major contributors of
  I                  noise in Hawthorne. Cost effective strategies to reduce
                     their influence on the community noise environment are an
                     essential part of the Noise Element.
  I Noise and Land
    Use Planning
                      Information relative to the existing and forecast noise
                     environment within Hawthorne should be integrated into
    Integration      future land use planning decisions. The Element presents
  I                  the noise environment in order that the City may include
                     noise impact considerations in development programs.
    Community Noise
  I Control for Non-
    Transportation
                     Residential land uses and areas identified as noise
                     sensitive must be protected from excessive noise from
                     non-transportation sources including commercial and
    Noise Sources    industrial activities. These impacts are most effectively
  I                  controlled through the adoption and applications of a City
                     Noise Ordinance.
    Findings
  I                  The predominante noise sources in Hawthorne, as in most
                     other communities, comes from mobile noise sources
                     including motor vehicles. A number of freeways and
                     arterials expose the City to significant noise levels,
  I                  particularly in those areas directly adjacent to these
                     sources. Hawthorne Municipal Airport, located within the
                     City, and Los Angeles International Airport, located to
  I                  the northwest, significantly contribute to the noise
                     environment. To a lesser extent helicopter operations
                     result in some single event disturbance from occasional
                     overflights. The noise environment in Hawthorne is
  I                  typical of what would be expected of a community located
                     within a major urban area such as the Los Angeles Basin.
  I                  Other sources of noise within the City are from
                     non-transportation sources including industrial and
                     commercial activities, construction activities and

  I                  Noise affects all types of land uses and activities,
                     although some are more sensitive to high noise levels than
                     others. Land uses identified as noise sensitive include

                 residences of all types; hospitals, rest homes,
I                convalescent hospitals, places of worship and schools.
                 Within the City are a number of public and private
                 schools, day care centers and rest homes.
I                The noise environment for Hawthorne can be described using
                 noise contours developed for the major noise sources
                 within the City. The contours are developed for existing
I                1987 conditions and future 1997 conditions and are
                 presented in Figures 3 and 4 respectively. Figure 5
                 presents the CNEl noise contours for Hawthorne Municipal
I                Airport. Both the 60 and 65 dB CNEl contour levels are
                 shown on these maps. The 60 dB CNEl contour represents
                 the Noise Referral Zone for which any proposed noise
                 sensitive land use within this zone should be evaluated on
I                a project specific basis and the project may require
                 mitigation to meet City or State (Title 24) standards.
                 The 65 CNEl represents zones where residential development
I                should be discouraged without proper mitigation as part of
                 the project. To present a worst case estimate, the
                 contours for the Century Freeway represent the noise
I                levels without the sound barrier. These are shown on"the
                 contour map "as dashed lines.
                 The sources of noise in Hawthorne can be divided into two
I                basic categories, transportation sources and
                 non-transportation sources. A local government has little
                 direct control of transportation noise at the source.
I                State and Federal agencies have the responsibility to
                 control the noise from the source, such as vehicle noise
                 emissions levels. The most effective method the City has
                 to mitigate transportation noise is through reducing the
I                impact of the noise onto the community (i.e. noise
                 barriers and site design review).
I Mitigation     Mitigation through the design and construction of a noise
                 barrier (wall, berm, or combination wall berm) is the most
                 common way of alleviating traffic noise impacts. The
                 effect of a noise barrier is critically dependent on the
I                geometry between the noise source and the receiver. A
                 noise barrier effect occurs when the "line of sight"
                 between the source and receiver is penetrated by the
I                barrier. The greater the penetration the greater the
                 noise reduction.

I                 designed to integrate noise considerations into land use
                  planning to prevent noise/land use conflicts. Table 1
                  presents criteria used to assess the compatibility of
I                 proposed land uses with the noise environment. These
                  criteria are the basis for the development of specific
                  Noise Standards. These standards, presented in Table 2,
                  present the City policies related to land uses and
I                 acceptable noise levels. These tables are the primary
                  tools which allow the City to ensure integrated planning
                  for compatibility between land uses and outdoor noise.
I Community Noise The most effective method to control community noise
  Ordninance      impacts from non-transportation noise sources is through
                  application of the Community Noise Ordinance. The City
I                 should consider amending and adopting a new comprehensive
                  community noise ordinance to help ensure that City
                  residents are not exposed to excessive noise levels from
I                 non-transporation noise sources. The Noise Ordinance is
                  designed to protect quiet residential areas from
                  stationary noise sources. The noise levels encouraged by
                  the ordinance are typical of a quiet residential area,

I Methodology
               NOISE ELEMENT TECHNICAL APPENDIX
              The noise environment in Hawthorne was determined through
  of Analysis the employment of a comprehensive noise measurement survey of
I             existing noise sources and incorporating these results into
              computer noise models to model the noise environment (it is,
              of course, impossible to measure future noise levels so we
I             must rely on computer noise models for future noise
              estimates). The noise environment is commonly presented
              graphically in terms of lines of equal noise levels, or noise
              contours. The following paragraphs detail the methodology
I             used in the measurement survey and computer modeling of
              these results into noise contours.
I             Measurement Procedure. Twenty-four sites were selected for
              measurement of the noise environment in Hawthorne. A review
              of noise complaints and identification of major noise
              sources in the community provided the initial base for
I             development of the community noise survey. The measurement
              locations were selected on the basis of proximity to major
              noise sources and noise sensitivity of the land use. The
I             measurement locations are depicted in Figure 1.
              The Hawthorne Noise Element measurement survey utilized the
              Bruel & Kjaer 4427 automated digital noise data acquisition
I             system. This instrument automatically calculates both the
              Equivalent Noise Level (LEQ) and Percent Noise Level (L%)
              for any specific time period. The noise monitors were
I             equipped with a Bruel & Kjaer inch electret microphone.
              The system was calibrated with a Bruel & Kjaer calibrator
              with calibration traceable to the National Bureau of
              Standards. Calibration for the calibrator is certified
I             through the duration of the measurements by Bruel & Kjaer.
              This measurement system satisfies the ANSI (American
              National Standards Institute) Standards 1.4 for Type I
I             precision noise measurement instrumentation.
              Computer Modeling. The traffic noise levels projected in
              the Noise Element were computed using the Highway Noise
I             Model published by the Federal Highway Administration
              ("FHWA Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model,"
              FHWA-RD-77-108, December 1978). The FHWA Model uses traffic
I             volume, vehicle mix, vehicle speed, and roadway geometry to
              compute the LEQ noise level. A computer code has been
              written which computes equivalent noise levels for each of
              the time periods used in CNEL. Weighting these noise levels
I             and summing them results in the CNEL for the traffic
              projections used. The traffic data used to project these
              noise levels are derived from the Circulation Element for
I             the City. The traffic mix data for the arterials are based

I          on measurements for roadways in Southern California and are
           considered typical for arterials in this area. The traffic
           mix for the freeways is based upon Caltrans data.
I          The Hawthorne Airport noise contours were developed as part
           of the Airport Master Plan update. These contours were
           generated using the Integrated Noise Model (INM), developed
I          by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Los Angeles
           International Airport noise contours were developed from
           this same model. The INM is a large computer program
           developed to plot noise contours for airports. The program
I          is provided with standard aircraft noise and performance
           data that can be tailored to the characteristics of the
           airport in question. The INM program requires the input of
I          the physical and operational characteristics of the airport.
           Physical characteristics include runway coordinates, airport
           altitude, and temperature. Operational characteristics
I          include aircraft mix, flight tracks, and approach profiles.
           Measurement Results. The noise measurement program was
           conducted on three separate days from August 4, 1987 to
I          August 6, 1987 at twenty-four locations throughout the City.
           The results of the ambient noise measurements at each site
           are depicted in Figure 2 (Parts 1 through 3). These figures
I          also depict the date and time of the measurement and the
           primary noise source affecting the noise environment. Each
           site was monitored for a minimum of 20 minutes. Locations
           near Hawthorne Airport or near stationary noise sources that
I          occur only occasionally were measured for longer durations.
           The quantities measured were the Equivalent Noise Level
           (LEQ), the maximum noise level and the Percent Noise Levels
I          (L%). Percent Noise Levels are another method of
           characterizing ambient noise where, for example, L90 is the
           noise level exceeded 90 percent of the time, LSO is the
           level exceeded 50 percent, and LIO is the level exceeded 10
I          percent of the time. L90 represents the background or
           minimum noise level, LSO represents the average noise level,
           and LI0 the peak or intrusive noise levels.
I Noise
  Contours
           The existing and future noise levels in the city were
           established in terms of the CNEL indices by modeling all of
           the traffic noise sources for the existing and future
I          traffic and speed characteristics. The future traffic
           volumes for the arterials roadways are projected to be near
           capacity as they currently are for the existing volumes.

    •I               distances to the CNEL contours for the roadways in the

                     include the mitigating effect of noise barriers or
                     topography.
        Inventory of This section contains a detailed description of the current
     I  Current and
        Forecast
                     and projected noise environment within the City. This
                     description of the noise environment is based on an
        Conditions   identification of noise sources and noise sensitive land
     I               uses, a community noise measurement survey and noise contour
                     maps.
                     To define the noise exposure, this section of the report
     I               first identifies the major sources of noise in the
                     community. The sources of noise in Hawthorne include:
     •I
                     freeway, aircraft overflights, arterial roadways, and.
                     industrial and commercial centers. To completely assess the
                     noise environment in the City, noise sensitive receptors
                     must also be identified. As mandated by the State, noise
                     sensitive receptors include, but are not limited to, areas
                     containing schools, hospitals, rest homes, long-term medical
                     or mental care facilities, or any other land use area deemed
    •I
                     noise sensitive by the local jurisdiction .
                     Based upon the identification of the major noise sources and
                     the location of sensitive receptors, a noise measurement
                     survey was conducted. The function of the survey is
                     threefold. The first is to determine the existing noise
                     levels at noise sensitive land uses. The second function
                      is to provide empirical data for the correlation and
    I                calibration of the computer modeled noise environment. A
                     third important aspect of the survey is to obtain an
                     accurate description of the ambient noise levels in
                     various communities throughout the City.
      I              Noise contours for all of the major noise sources in
                     Hawthorne were developed based upon current traffic
      I              conditions. These contours were determined from the
                     traffic levels for these sources. The contours are
                     expressed in terms of the community Noise Equivalent Level
                      (CNEL). The existing_conditions scenario is derived from
      I               1987 traffic levels and environmental conditions. Future
                     conditions are assumed to remain essentially the same as
                     existing conditions except for the freeways, where the
    I                anticipated freeway development and the growth in traffic is
                      included in these estimates.

I Sources of
  Noise
             The sources of noise in Hawthorne fall into four basic
             categories. These are: freeways (both the San Diego Freeway
             and the future Century Freeway); aircraft (Hawthorne
             Municipal Airport and other aircraft overflights); major and
I            minor arterial roadways; and stationary sources. These
             sources and their impacts on the noise environment of
             Hawthorne are summarized in the following paragraphs.
I            Freeways. The San Diego Freeway runs in a north/south
             direction, in the western portion of the city. The freeway
             is generally at grade or slightly elevated with respect to
I            the adjacent areas and in general no sound walls exist at
             the present time. The freeway is currently under
             reconstruction, and included as part of this construction
I            project will be sound barriers to meet the FHWA/Caltrans 67
             LEQ Peak Hour Noise Standard. @For the traffic conditions
             projected for these freeways, this standard is approximately
             2 dBA less stringent than the 65 CNEL criteria.@ Residential
I            developments are located along the freeway. The closest
             developments are partially shielded from the freeway by the
             grading berm of the freeway. Many of these homes are.
I            exposed to noise levels greater than 65 CNEL.
             The Century Freeway right-of-way is located along the north
             boundary of the City. This future project will traverse
I            residential developments within the City. The project
             design does include sound barriers as part of the project.
             These barriers will be designed such that adjacent
I            residential land uses will not exceed the Ca1trans/FHWA
             standard.
             Major and Minor Arterial Roadways. Traffic noise on surface
I            streets is a significant source of noise within the
             community. The major roadways in the City include: Imperial
             Highway, E1 Segundo Boulevard, Rosecrans Avenue, and Compton
I            Boulevard in the east/west direction and Aviation Boulevard;
             Inglewood Avenue, Hawthorne Boulevard, Prairie Avenue and
             Crenshaw Boulevard in the north/south direction.
I            Noise levels along roadways are affected by a number of .
             traffic characteristics. Most important is the average
             daily traffic (ADT). Additional factors include the
I            percentage of trucks, vehicle speed, the time distribution
             of this traffic and gradient of the roadway.
I            In general, most of the land uses along the major roadways
             are commercial and industrial. However, there are a number
             of multi- and single-family homes that are located along
             many of these roadways. This is the case along sections of
I            Rosecrans Boulevard, Inglewood, El Segundo and Imperial
             Highway. Many of these homes are exposed to noise levels
             greater than 65 CNEL.                                   .

  Aircraft Operations. A major source of noise within the
I City of Hawthorne is aircraft noise. Hawthorne Municipal
  Airport is located at the northeast end of the City.
  Operations from departing and arriving aircraft result in
I significant noise levels in the north portion of the city.
  The operations at this general aviation airport are
  predominately single engine piston aircraft. However, there
I are a number of corporate aircraft, including some loud
  business jet aircraft. The main flow of traffic is to the
  west. The City of Hawthorne is currently updating the
  airport master plan. The results of this study were
I utilized to develop the CNEL noise contours for the airport.
  These contours show that some residential areas west of the
  airport are exposed to noise levels greater than 60 CNEL.
I Los Angeles International Airport is located northwest of
  the city. The primary approach pattern to the airport is to
  the west along the City's north boundary. Some aircraft
I flight patterns will also overfly the city. The published
  airport noise studies and the noise measurements have shown
  that the 65 CNEL noise contour from these operations is
I located just outside the City boundary, however, the noise
  levels during the flyover are sufficient enough that they do
  result in some single event disturbance from the flyover.
  The noise levels from these operations in the north portion
I of the city exceed 60 CNEL.
  Private helipads and helicopter flight corridors are also
I located within environs of Hawthorne. Helicopter operations
  from these facilities have only limited flights. In route
  helicopters will fly over the city following the path of the
  freeway. However, these events occur only occasionally, and
I are not considered a major noise source of Hawthorne.
  However, occasional single event disturbance from these
  overflights is likely to occur.
I Stationary Sources. The City of Hawthorne has industrial
   and commercial sources of noise at a number of locations
  throughout the City. These include commercial centers that
I range in size from major aerospace corporations to small
   industrial operations. Many of these smaller operations
   are located in strip commercial zones. Residential land
I  uses are located near many of these zones. The primary noise
   associated with the facilities is attributed to automobile
   and truck traffic making deliveries to these facilities.
  Additional sources of noise include air compressors,
I generators and outdoor loudspeakers. A number of businesses
   have paging systems that are audible in the adjacent
   residential developments.

 I                               GLOSSARY OF TERMS
   A-WEIGHTED SOUND LEVEL. The sound pressure level in decibels as measured on
 I a sound level meter using the A-weighted filter network. The A-weighting
   filter de-emphasizes the very low and very high frequency components of the
   sound in a manner similar to the response of the human ear. A numerical
   method of rating human judgement of loudness.
 I AMBIENT NOISE LEVEL. The composite of noise from all sources near and far.
   In this context, the ambient noise level constitutes the normal or existing
 I level of environmental noise at a given location.
   COMMUNITY NOISE EQUIVALENT LEVEL (CNEL). The average equivalent A-weighted
   sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of five (5)
 I decibels to sound levels in the evening from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and after
   addition of ten (10) decibels to sound levels in the night before 7 a.m. and
   after 10 p.m.
 I DAY-NIGHT AVERAGE LEVEL (LON). The average equivalent A-weighted sound level
   during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of ten (10) decibels to sound
   levels in the night before 7 a.m. and after 10 p.m.
 I DECIBEL (dB). A unit for measuring the amplitude of a sound, equal to 20
   times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound
 I measured to the reference pressure, which is 20 micro-pascals.
   dB(A). A-weighted sound level (see definition above);
 I EQUIVALENT
   level over
              SOUND LEVEL (LEQ). The sound level corresponding to a steady noise
              a given sample period with the same amount of acoustic energy as
   the actual time varying noise level. The energy average noise level during
 I the sample period.
   FREQUENCY. The number of times per second that a sound pressure signal
   oscillates about the prevailing atmosphere pressure. The unit of frequency
'I is the hertz. The abbreviation is Hz.
   INTRUSIVE NOISE. That noise which intrudes over and above the ambient noise
 I at a given location. The relative intrusiveness of a sound depends upon its
   amplitude, duration, frequency, time of occurrence, and tonal or informational
   content as well as the prevailing ambient noise level.
II LIO. The A-weighted sound level exceeded 10 percent of the sample time.
   Similarly, LSD, L90, L99, etc.
 I NOISE. Any unwanted sound or sound which is undesirable because it
   interferes with speech and hearing, or is intense enough to damage hearing,
   or is otherwise annoying. The State Noise Control Act defines noise as
   •...excessive undesirable sound ...•.

I NOISE ATTENUATION. The ability of a material, substance, or medium to reduce
  the noise level from one place to another or between one room and another.
  Noise attenuation is specified in decibels.
I NOISE EXPOSURE CONTOURS. Lines drawn around a noise source indicating
  constant or equal level of noise exposure. CNEL and LDN are typical metrics
  used.
I NOISE REFERRAL ZONES. Such zones are defined as the area within the contour
  defining a CNEL level of 60 decibels. It is the level at which either State
  or Federal laws and standards related to land use become important and, in
I some cases, pre-empted local laws and regulations. Any proposed noise
  sensitive development wh.ich may be impacted by a total noise environment of
  60 dB CNEL or more should be evaluated on a project specific basis.
I NOISE SENSITIVE LAND USE. Those specific land uses which have associated
  indoor and/or outdoor human activities that may be subject to stress and/or
  significant interference from noise produced by community sound sources.
I Such human activity typically occurs daily for continuous periods of 24 hours
  or is of such a nature that noise is significantly disruptive to activities
  that occur for short periods. Specifically, noise sensitive land uses.
I include: residences of all types, hospitals, rest homes, convalescent
  hospitals, places of worship and schools.
I SOUND LEVEL (NOISE LEVEL). The weighted sound pressure level obtained by use
  of a sound level meter having a standard frequency-filter for attenuating

I OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION ELEMENT
  SECTION I - INTRODUCTION TO OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION
I             ELEMENT
  Open spaces serve many needs, especially in our urban
  environment. In the broadest sense, open space refers to
I all land which is not covered by buildings or structures.
  Within urban areas, open space usually refers to parks,
  plazas, medians, and bicycle or jogging trails. Open
  space may also include waterways, undevelopable areas due
I to environmental constraints, or pockets of vacant land
  used for horticulture or as nature preserves.
I Open space can affect, or be affected by the nature of
  development. Open spaces offer aesthetic variety and
  relief from hard urban materials by proffering green
I areas of natural form and soft textures. Open space
  shapes the environment by limiting densities, buffering
  land uses and integrating urban forms. Open spaces can
  be used to protect and conserve our natural resources
I such as watersheds and spreading grounds.

I               SECTION II - EXISTING CONDITIONS
                Very little open space remains in Hawthorne today. The
I               City has been a fully developed, community for quite some
                time and therefore it is a geographic area. in which
                undeveloped lands are a scarce resource.
I               Open spaces which still exist within the City are
                predominantly composed of parklands, school yards,
                horticultural plots, railroad rights-of-way, flood
I               control channels, Southern California Edison easements,
                and small isolated, vacant lots. Expansion of
                residential neighborhoods has been responsible for the
                most recent declines in park open space average.
I               At present, the City has approximately 148 acres in some
                form of open space, although this figure includes some
I               structures. Of this, 68.6 acres are zoned as Urban Open
                Space (UOS).
  Publicly      Seven publicly-owned parks located throughout the City
I Owned Open
  Space Lands
                encompass 35.5 acres of open space. The municipal pool
                and tennis courts together constitute another 1.5 acres
                of recreation space. In addition, the City leases from
I               the federal government 20 acres of land located 100 miles
                north in the San Gabriel Mountains. This is known as
                Hawthorne Youth Camp, a special mountain retreat and
                recreation facility.
I Institutional Presently, there are ten elementary schools, two junior
  Lands         high schools and one high school located in Hawthorne.
I               The City leases land from the school districts which own
                the property. These school-owned properties include
                approximately 50 acres for recreational use. However,
                this figure includes some structures and has also been
I               somewhat diminished with the need to accommodate increased
                enrollments at elementary schools (due to the Century
                Freeway construction), which has necessitated the
I Additional
                placement of trailer classrooms on local play area sites.
                The City also owns three small lots adjacent to the
  Open Space    Civic Center. One is vacant, one is a vest-pocket park
I Areas         and one serves as a community garden. The City also
                operates and leases a small nursery lot and owns and
                operates maintenance yards. The median strip along
I               Hawthorne 80ulevard can also be considered as City-owned
                open space, and because of its central location which
                provides a strong visual image for the City, should be
                given special attention.

I County-Owned
  Facilities
                 County-owned facilities in the surrounding area include
                 four parks and one golf course. Together they comprise
                 220.2 acres of recreation open space, with 131 of these
I Private Open
                 acres devoted to golf.
                 The Southern Pacific Railroad Company owns a number of
  Space          railroad easements for lines and spurs within the City.
I                The Southern California Edison Company has a 120-foot
                 wide right-of-way easement in the southwest corner of the
                 City. In addition, the County Flood Control Department
                 operates privately-owned Dominguez Channel. A bike path
I                has been designated along 120th Street and El Segundo
                 Boulevard. The County will maintain the path as a
                 portion of the County System of Highways and a section of
I                the regional path. The City will pay for the cost of
                 maintenance.
I                The California State Transportation Department (CALTRANS)
                 owns a substantial portion of land adjacent to the 1-405
                 (San Diego Freeway), which runs through the southwest
                 portion of the City. These parcels, known as the Glasgow
I                Strip, will be devoted to a freeway sound attenuation
                 berm and open space. Approximately 11.3 acres of land
                 could be used as a linear park, which most likely would
                 be developed as a jogging trail and 3-par golf course.
I Hawthorne      The Hawthorne Municipal Airport property is owned by the
  Airport        City of Hawthorne. Although the 120 acres at the airport
I                might be viewed as open space, it is not considered
                 useable or visual open space for purposes of community
                 recreation.
I Horticultural/
  Nursery Areas
                 There are still a number of privately held nurseries
                 which at this time enjoy a horticultural zoning
                 designation. However, with rising land values, it is
I                doubtful whether these establishments can remain
                 economically viable in light of the pressures to develop
                 these lands. The market values of these properties is
I                forcing them to be recycled to higher and better uses.
                 Since 1975, they have been reduced from 31.1 acres to
                 about nine acres.
I Ratio of Open
  Space to
                 Since Hawthorne is urbanized to a large extent, the
                 backbone of committed open space is the municipal park
  Population     system. Therefore, open space deficiencies are
I                oftentimes thought of in terms of shortages of park
                 space. Deficiencies in park acreage can be based upon
                 access to park locations or acres of parkland per capita

                                                        Recreation Element

  I               in the community. Based on both of these criteria the
                  City of Hawthorne is considered to be deficient in open
                  space. Not only that, but local park acreage has
                  actually declined by 11.1 acres since the adoption of the
  I               1973 Open Space Element. Reduction in open space park
                  acreage has occurred largely due to the sell off of
                  school-owned open space (formally used as jointly shared
  I               space for public parks) to meet the needs of the school
                  districts.
                  The National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) has
  I               .adopted a standard of providing ten acres of parks and
                  recreation space for each 1,000 persons. Six of these
                  ten acres should be devoted to regional recreation and
  I               four acres devoted to local recreation space. Local
                  recreation is divided further into a recommended 2.5
                  acres for school playgrounds and 1.5 acres for local
                  parks. Based on a population estimate of 63,000, the
  I               City should contain approximately 94.5 acres in local
                  parks. With 35.5 acres currently devoted to local parks,
                  this leaves the City with a shortage of 59 acres, based
  I               on NRPA standards. In terms of school playgrounds, the
                  City should contain approximately 158 acres, based on
                  NRPA standards. With 50 acres of school playgrounds
                  currently, the City is deficient by approximately 108
  I               acres.
                  According to NRPA standards, 378 acres of regional
  I               recreation are necessary to accommodate the residents of
                  the City. Approximately 220 acres of county parks are
                  currently available, which leaves a need for 158
                  additional acres. However, some portion of this can be
  I               made up by including the local beaches as regional open
                  space.
  I  Open Space
     Distribution
                  Not only is the City short in providing park acreage, but
                  also the distribution of these parks is inefficient, with
                  no parks being located above 120th Street and only school
                  playgrounds (i.e., hard space), located between Hawthorne
  I               Boulevard and Prairie Avenue.

I               SECTION III - ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
                There is a need to provide more recreation open space
  Need
I               for the citizens of Hawthorne, especially in view of the
                tremendous growth in multiple family units within the
                City over the last two years. Not only should new parks
                be acquired, but the existing parks need renovating and
I               rehabilitating in order to keep up with user demands.
                Hawthorne's citizens need increased useable open space
                for multi-family housing projects as well. Medium and
I               high density residential uses increase the intensity of
                people in the city. Alleviating overcrowding by
                providing more open space must be a consideration.
I Development
  Pressures
                Hawthorne's park and recreation facilities are also being
                impacted by increasing requests of industrial and
                commercial entities for use of these spaces. Such firms
I               as TRW, Northrop, Aerospace, Hughes and Xerox
                consistently request use of the parks for leisure and
                recreational purposes. This impact on parks has only
                been generated within the past five years and these -
I               demands continue to increase.
                In addition, the 13.25 acres of Memorial Park are being
I               underutilized as recreation open space with the City
                leasing seven acres of this land to Northrop for a
                parking lot.
I Opportunities The following factors have been identified as the major
                opportunities to be addressed in the Open Space and
                Recreation Element.
I               Hawthorne Boulevard Visual Corridor. The vacant lot
                adjacent to the Civic Center could be devoted to
                functional open space such as a park or a community
I               garden. And the median strip in the Center of Hawthorne
                Boulevard which serves an important function in
                identifying the Boulevard as the major axis through
I               downtown, needs attention. Although the mature trees
                provide a positive visual image for the City, additional
                landscaping and irrigation are necessary to maintain the
                visual quality of the corridor. In conjunction with this
I               upgrading, the City should also address problems
                associated with the street trees which line the sidewalks
                along the Boulevard. The existing ficus trees are not
I               maintained, obstruct storefront signage, drop berries on
                the sidewalk and provide little or no canopy cover to
                pedestrians.

                                                       Recreation Element
                                                               March 1989
I
I
I
I School District Lands. Recreational open space leased
  from the school districts has been steadily declining.
  Most recently, with termination of the Holly Glen Park
  lease by the Wiseburn School District, the City has lost
I 4.1 acres of parkland to private residential development.
  Under Proposition 13, underutilized school property was
  sold off for financial reasons and the City could simply
I not afford to purchase these school-owned spaces.
  Similar situations exist in Zela Davis, Eucalyptus and
  Ramona Parks, where the Hawthorne School District owns
I the property and the Parks and Recreation Department
  operates facilities on the land. The school district
  could terminate these agreements at any time and the park
I open space acreage could be diminished once again.
  Finding the means to acquire these open space areas
  should be examined.
I County-Owned Facilities. The County has offered to sell
  Bodger Park to the City, but the City has declined
  ownership because of lack of funds. At this time,
I although several proposals have been made, a funding
  program for park acquisition does not yet exist in the
  City.
I Network Linking Existing Open Space. Not only should the
  City acquire more permanent park space, but an attempt
  should b~ made to create a network linking exiting open
I spaces. This would also help to alleviate the inequities
  in the distribution of these open spaces.

                SAFETY ELEMENT
                 INTRODUCTION TO THE SAFETY ELEMENT
I Disasters such as urban fires, flooding, and earthquakes
  are common to California. In Hawthorne, a city almost
  totally built out, there is the danger, for example, of
I urban fires. In addition, the ever-present possibility of
  hazardous-materials spills is due both to the presence of
  industry in the city and Hawthorne's geographical location
  in the center of a traffic arterial network. Furthermore,
I Hawthorne is in the immediate vicinity of the
  Newport-Inglewood fault and the Charnock fault.
I The Safety Element provides the direction necessary for
  the protection of the community from natural and man-made
  hazards. This is achieved by reducing the risks, property
  damage, injuries, or loss of life in the event of a
I natural or man-made disaster.

I                   SECTION II      EXISTING CONDITIONS
   Seismic Hazards  The City of Hawthorne is directly affected by two faults:
I                   the active Newport-Inglewood structural zone and the
                    potentially active CharnocK fault (See Figure 1 ).
I                  The potential for significant damage by groundcshaking in
                    Hawthorne in general is low. "Ground-shaking is often
                   greater on young, loose sedimentary deposits" (Tinsley,
                    Fuman:II3), typically unconsolidated soils. Much of
I                  Hawthorne lies atop late Quaternary (Pleistocene)
                   compact-to-very-dense deposits of gravel, silt, and clay.
                   About a third of the eastern half of the City, however, is
I                  underlain by the more recent Holocene deposits, which are
                   more susceptible to shaking (Tinsley,
                   Youd-:288)(Gulliver:Map). Potential damage, however, is
                   more a function of structure than of shaking intensity.
I Newport-         The Newport-Inglewood structural zone is made up of a
   Inglewood       broad range of discontinuous faults which trend northwest
I Structural
  Zone
                   from Newport 8each, across the Los Angeles basin to near
                   Santa Monica. This structural zone lies to the immediate
                   northeast of Hawthorne. No part of the City, therefore,
                   has been designated as an Alquist-Priolo Special Studies
I                  Zone, which must "encompass the trace of an active fault".
                   Such a zone requires a geologic investigation before a
                   local government can approve most development projects,
I                  thus assuring that structures for human occupancy are not
                   built on active faults (Guidelines: 25~).
  CharnocK         The Charnock fault, considered part of the Newport-
I Fault            Inglewood zone, passes through the center of the City.
                   Roughly seven miles long, the fault has no surface folds
                   dating from the late Quartenary and therefore is not
I San Andreas
                   considered active.
                   The southern segment of the San Andreas fault, which
  Fault            traverses the length of California, lies some 40 miles
I                  east of Hawthorne. The San Andreas fault is considered
                   active, having had surface displacement within Holocene
                   Time (within the last 11,000 years).
I liquefaction     Liquefaction is the sudden and temporary transformation of
                   loose, water-saturated soil to a liquid mass when
                   subjected to shock or strain (Gulliver:9-5).

 I                If depth to groundwater exceeds 30 feet, liquefaction is
                  unlikely to occur (Tinsley, et al:315). A review of the
                  static water levels of Hawthorne's four wells shows a
                  depth of 106 feet as the highest measurement from the
 I                surface of the ground to the top of the water (Static
                  Water Well Levels:9,10). Further, development of ground
                 water resources in Southern California has had the most
 I                effect in reducing or eliminating the 1iquefaction hazard .in
                  many areas because extractive pumping of ground water has
                  maintained the water table in many areas to depths that make
                  liquefaction unlikely (Tinsley, et al:275).
 I                The sediment of much of Hawthorne is largely older
                  (Pleistocene) and well consolidated, putting areas of such
 I                soil in the "very low" category of potent ia1 for
                  liquefaction.
    Ground       Hawthorne does not appear to have the topography that would
 I  Failure       fail under seismic shaking, since it is relatively flat. In
                 the central part of the City, the slope ranges from three to
                 ten percent. The extreme northeast section of Hawthorne
 I                includes a small area where slopes range from one to eight
                 percent. However, the risk of slope instability in these
                 areas is considered low.
 I Fire Hazards  Significant damage occurs infrequently, but it is most
                 likely to occur where industrial chemicals and fuels are
                 used and where these substances are stored or transported.
 I               This danger, however, is mitigated by stringent enforcement
                 of recent State r~quirements.
   Response Time Emergency response time is within three-to-four minutes.
 I and Water
   Availability
                 Water availability is well documented for the City of
                 Hawthorne water system, which serves roughly half the City.
                 Within this area ten sections were tested in 1986 for fire
 I               flow capability. Table 1 shows the current available flow
                 in gallons per minute (gpm) at the ten sites and future
                 fireflows required to deliver water at twenty pounds per
                 square inch (psi).
 I               The necessary improvements to achieve ideal flow are already
                 under way and have been scheduled through 1991. Current
 I               peak hour demand is determined to be 400 percent, or 13,604
                 gpm, of the average annual demand (AAD) (3,401 gpm
                 (8oyle:3-3)). Hawthorne water supplies are capable of
                 maintaining adequate fireflow.
 I Fire Hazard   A sprinkler ordinance was established in 1982 for buildings
   Reduction     of at least 5,000 square feet. Additionally, in those areas
 I               where fire-flow is weak, sprinklers are recommended to
                 lessen the hazard or potential damage of fire.

  I                 Besides the sprinkler ordinance, the Fire Department
                    utilizes the services of a public education specialist, who
                    presents fire prevention programs to different groups in the
                    community, such as schools and senior citizens. The
  I                 specialist works with Hawthorne Cable TV and writes articles
                    for the Chamber of Commerce on fire prevention, first aid,
                    and other emergency care procedures.
  I Hazardous
    Materials
                   To protect the public from exposure to hazardous materials,
                   the City of Hawthorne has implemented the following
                   measures:
  I                 •  zoning controls over permitted uses to carefully regulate
                       hazardous use;
  I                 •. conditions for approval by the Planning Commission for
                       conditional use permits and site plan review;
  I                 •  hazardous materials disclosure and regulatory procedures;
                    •  the appointment of a hazardous materials specialist
  I Disclosure and
                       (assigned to the Fire Department).
                   As the administering agency of the Hazardous Material
    Regulatory     Disclosure Ordinance, AB 2185 City Ordinance 1398, since
,
  I Procedures     August 1986, the Hawthorne Fire Department maintains the
                   mandatory disclosure file on use (or non-use), handling, and
                   storage practices of hazardous materials and hazardous
II                 wastes annually of all businesses. Inventories of hazardous
                   materials are data-processed for immediate availability to
                   fire, police, and other first-responder (i.e., first at the
                   scene of an incident) departments.
  I                These potential risks are carefully monitored and controlled
                   through annual inspection. The biggest user of hazardous
  I                materials in Hawthorne is Northrop Corporation which has its
                   own waste-control management system and therefore its own
                   transfer system, plus its own response team. There are no
                   major refineries located within the City.
  I Transportation The transportation of hazardous materials is concentrated
    of Hazardous   on major arterials and other streets away from residential
  I Materials
    Sites and
                   areas to the greatest extent possible. (See Figure 2).
                   City staff is completing the map of sites and facilities

                is designated as R-3 (High Density Residential), which
I               includes multiple-family dwellings and apartments.
  Critical      Critical facilities are those facilities in which damage
I Facilities    or malfunction during an earthquake would have serious
                and far-reaching consequences. Generally included in this
                category are hospitals, fire, police, and emergency service
                facilities; utility lifelime facilities, such as water,
I              electricity, and gas supply, sewage disposal, and
               communication and transportation facilities. (Figure 3 ).

  Plans
               Emergency Preparedness and Evaluation. The following plans
               represent the City of Hawthorne's preparations for disasters
               or major hazards.
I               1) Winter Storm and Preparedness Policy, February 1984
               2) Area G Emergency Operational Plans, Los Angeles County
I                   Chapter: California Fire Chiefs Association, December
                     1985 - To cover a local emergency which cannot be met by
                    the facilities of a given city, among fourteen cities,
                    including Hawthorne.
I              3) Multi-Casualty Incident Operational Procedures -
                    Establishes systematic sharing of emergency medical
I                   resources by all fire departments.
               4) California Fire and Rescue Emergency Plan, revised June
                    1978 - covers both California Disaster and Civil Defense
I                   Master Mutual Aid Agreements.
               5) Area (Area I) Plan - State-mandated, this is a
I                   pre-emergency plan for incident preparation, especially
                    hazardous-materials spills, and the safe management of
                    incidents, including emergency communications.
I              6) Emergency Preparedness Plan - Also state-mandated, this
                    plan discusses and allocates within the city government
                    those actions needed to be carried out under the various

                     municipalities, including the City of Hawthorne.
 I Alternative
   Power
                 City emergency vehicles are normally fueled at the City
                 maintenance yard, where a backup system is being installed,
   Sources       to be operational by March 1988. Should fuel become
 I               inaccessible at the yard, the Fire Department has its own
                 diesel-fueling facility and could fuel its vehicles manually
                 for about three days, until normal operating conditions were
                 restored. The storage tank at the Police Department has
 I               its own power system and is therefore not totally dependent
                 on the Equipment Department, City Hall's emergency source.
                 The Equipment Department owns a diesel-engine-powered
 I               generator system fueled by a 2,000-gallon diesel-fuel tank
                 (about two weeks' worth of power).
   Alternative   During an emergency, such as a chemical spill, water can
 I Water Sources be shut off block by block, depending on the time of day,
                 or produced at greater pressure, from storage if necessary.
                 Reserve water is available from storage tanks and reservoirs
 I Evacuation

                 A major disaster such as a large fire or hazardous-materials

 I               The City of Hawthorne has developed a Hazardous Materials
                 Evacuation Plan. This Plan outlines procedures involving
                 evacuation of residents in the event of hazardous materials
 I               upset conditions and identifies routes to be used for the
                 orderly movement of people. Hawthorne's well maintained
                 evacuation routes constitutes the major streets of Hawthorne
                 and much of the rest of the South Bay are designated as
 I               federal FAU (federal assistance, air, urban) highways and
                 thus are part of the County regional plan for evacuation.

I              SECTION III      ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
               The City of Hawthorne is continually exposed to the
               potential loss of life or property due to natural phenomenon
I              and human accident. These natural and human events include
               earthquake, fire, or hazardous material spills. Proper
               planning and adequate preparation, in most instances, can
I              significantly reduce the risk of disaster. This section
               discusses issues relevant to natural and man-made hazards
               which will require consideration by the City in future
               planning and policy.
I Seismic      The City of Hawthorne is directly affected by two faults:
  Hazards      the Newport-Inglewood Fault which is considered active, and
I              the Charnock Fault, considered to be potentially active.
               The Newport-Inglewood Fault lies to the immediate northeast
               of Hawthorne. The Charnock Fault is considered a part of
               the Newport-Inglewood structural zone which passes through
I              the center of the City. No Alquist-Priolo Special Studies
               Zones have been designated within the city limits.
I              The potential for liquefaction exists, although the depth to
               groundwater and underlying soil characteristics make this
               possibility remote.
I Fire Hazards The Hawthorne Fire Department is one of the busiest fire
               departments in the State per capital and receives an average
               of 12-15 calls per day. Significant damage occurs
I              infrequently, but it is most likely to occur where
               industrial chemicals and fuels are used, stored, or
               transported. There is potential for considerable damage
               where multi-family dwellings proliferate, such as in Moneta
I              Gardens which has the highest density and the restricted
               access.
I Hazardous
  Materials
               Situated at the hub of a major arterial traffic network, the
               City of Hawthorne is highly susceptible to the danger of
  Spi11s       hazardous materials spills. This danger is somewhat
I              mitigated, however, by various State and federal legislation
               regulating the use, storage, and transportation of hazardous
               materials and the strict enforcement of these regulations.
I Flooding     In 1980 the City of Hawthorne was removed from the Federal
               Insurance Rate Map after it was determined that a large
               majority of existing structures had been built above the
I              base flood-elevation. For insurance purposes the City is_
               now classified as Zone C, in which insurance coverage is
               optional, not mandatory.

                  (Villere). Further, any (smaller) dams not subject to the
                  above requirements have been determined by the County

                 The Hawthorne Municipal Airport Master Plan, when completed,
  Related        will contain a description of existing and proposed
I Accidents       facilities for the Hawthorne Municipal Airport; current and
                 projected airport operations; an inventory of areas
                 potentially affected by airplane crashes; policies and
I                standards for land use and development within the airport
                 planning boundaries to minimize safety hazards and noise
                 problems; and an emergency preparedness plan for the
                 airport. The report will be available from the airport
I                administrative offices. The date of completion is not known
                 at this time.
I Crime and
  Traffic Safety
                 Recent crime statistics from the Hawthorne Police Department
                 show a 19 percent decrease in crime from 1980 levels. This
                 decrease reflects the technological and administrative
                 changes that have occurred since that time. The Police
I                Department serves an integrated city of some 63,000
                 residents, which is experiencing a significant drop in Part
                 1 crimes. Part I crimes include violent crimes such as
I                murder, robbery and assault. Traffic accidents have also
                 experienced a significant decrease since 1980. Traffic
                 accident reports indicate an 18 percent decrease from 1980
                 figures.
I Evacuation     A major disaster such as a large fire or hazardous-materials
  Plan           spill could necessitate evacuating portions of the City.
I                Hawthorne has a system of well-established evacuation
                 routes.
  Loss of
I Lifelines
                 A major disruption of water supply, electric power, gasoline,
                 etc., would create a critical situation. Planning for
                 emergency preparedness and response is a concern with
                 respect to sources of energy for public buildings.

  I  SECTION IV - SAFETY ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
     The purpose of the Safety Element is to ensure that the
     community is protected from injuries, property damage, or loss
  I  of life that may result from natural or man-made occurrences
     by reducing the risk of exposure. Goals and policies
     intended to provide the community with an acceptable level of
  I  safety and protection are listed below.
     GOAL 1.0: MINIMIZE THE HAZARDS TO PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY,

SECTION I—INTRODUCTION TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
   Financing of government services is particularly challenging in California. For a number of
   reasons the percentage of the City’s municipal services funded through taxes and fees alone
   diminishes steadily, yet the demand for these services and other obligations continue to
   grow. Much reliance is placed on outside sources to fund many city programs, but these
   sources are highly specific in what they will fund, are increasingly competitive, and
   somewhat unpredictable due to political machinations in Washington and Sacramento. The
   demand for services remains high nevertheless, so reductions in staffing or funding is not in
   the interest of the City. The best solution to improve the finances of the City is to grow
   revenue without greatly increasing the rate of taxation or the fees charged. The purpose of
   this Element is to establish goals and policies related to economic development with the
   intent of making the City a great place to do business, increase the rate of success and
   profitability of our businesses, and improve the revenue to the City that flows from taxes
   and fees.
   Any Element must be internally consistent with all of the other elements of the General
   Plan. In particular, the Land Use is closely linked to matters covered in this element. In 2014
   the Land Use Element was revised to include a goal and several policies related to economic
   development as it related to zoning and development. The other elements are silent on
   Economic matters but after careful review no inconsistencies with these elements were
   found.

SECTION II—EXISTING CONDITIONS, ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
   Economic development is active participation in the City’s economic affairs in ways that
   promote revenue-producing developments, ensure better odds of success for businesses
   during periods of hardship, and attract new businesses to strengthen the local economy.
   The City of Hawthorne has experienced booms and busts frequently since the 1970s. The
   economic health of the City is closely aligned with the South Bay in general, but hard times
   hit harder in Hawthorne and recovery is slower. The economic recession of 2008 was
   particularly devastating to the City’s economy. Unemployment ran consistently over 14
   percent, foreclosure rates were amount the highest in the nation, and business vacancies
   were running high, driving rents downward. City revenues were down and expenditures
   continued to grow. By 2014 the situation turned around and Hawthorne was seeing a
   surplus in revenues, unemployment was below 10 percent and dropping, commercial
   vacancies were filling, interest in development was increasing, and foreclosure rates had
   returned to normal. Through this experience the City became determined to change its
   economic circumstances to make the local economy more resilient, less susceptible to
   fluctuations, and able to grow a surplus reserve to protect vital services when another
   downturn occurs.
   One goal of economic development for Hawthorne will be to build on our foundation of
   aerospace but also diversify the businesses based here to reduce vulnerability to sector-
   specific downturns. Another goal is to fill gaps in needed services, such as casual
   restaurants. Exploiting geographical advantages is another area where the City will benefit
   from taking a leading role rather than passively waiting for development. For example, our
   proximity to Los Angeles International Airport, yet outside of it flight paths, makes
   Hawthorne an ideal location for hotels.
   Hawthorne has not historically engaged in proactive economic development. There is much
   that needs to be done to lay the foundation. Other cities in California, even in the South
   Bay, are far more engaged, more experienced, and better staffed and budgeted for the
   tasks of business retention, business expansion, and business attraction. Nevertheless,
   many of these cites based their programs on redevelopment and have struggled to rebuild.
   In many ways, we are poised to build a more resilient foundation for economic
   development than our neighbors. it is never too late to start and Hawthorne has a golden
   opportunity to reposition itself in the South Bay through active engagement in economic
   development. This Element represents an important first step in that direction.
                                                 2

SECTION III—ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
    The goals and policies contained in the Economic Development Element are concerned with
    both preserving and enhancing the economic success the City is enjoying and developing
    ways to build a more economically sustainable future.
    The major issues facing the City are underscored in the following policies that emphasize
    the need for a professional, organized and unified approach to economic development and
    to be sensitive to the roles, responsibilities and potential of elected officials, staff and our
    natural partners in economic development.
    Hawthorne needs new and revitalized commercial development to increase sales tax
    revenue for municipal funding and to upgrade its physical image. As an older and well-
    established South Bay community, the City's future development will play a significant role
    in its efforts to maintain and upgrade the quality of its attractive residential communities.

investment, increases the tax base, creates employment opportunities for Hawthorne

              SECTION I - INTRODUCTION TO THE CIRCULATION ELEMENT
              Circulation and transportation systems are one of the most important
              of all urban systems in determining the overall structure and form of
              the areas they service. The basic purpose of a transportation network
              within the City of Hawthorne is the provision of an efficient, safe, and
              serviceable framework which enables people to move among various
              sections of the city in order to work, shop, or spend leisure hours. The
              transportation network also allows for the movement of goods for both
              the public and private sectors.
Purpose       The basic purpose of the Circulation Element is to identify, describe,
              and locate the basic transportation system networks which provide for
              the cities' transportation needs and land uses. The element sets forth
              goals and policies that are to be implemented and promotes the
              effective use of transportation facilities to efficiently and safely move
              people and goods while striving to preserve and protect the economic,
              environmental, and natural resources.
              The Circulation Element also functions as a guideline for local and
              regional transportation planning. Once implemented, the local and
              regional transportation network may be improved as necessary to
              accommodate increased economic activities such as housing density
              or commercial and industrial intensification.
Related Plans The Circulation Element must be closely coordinated, compatible, and
and Programs  internally consistent with each individual element of the General Plan.
              However, the land Use, Housing, and Noise Elements are most
              closely associated with the Circulation Element because circulation
              and transportation planning efforts have a direct impact upon each of
              them. The land Use Element designates the general distribution and
              location patterns of such uses as housing, business, industry, and
              open space.
              These land use patterns must accommodate both local and regional
              transportation networks. As such, the Circulation Element must
              accommodate the type and density of development designated in the
              land Use Element. The Housing Element identifies adequate sites for
              the preservation, improvement, and development of housing. Thus,
              the Circulation Element must accommodate the density and location
              of residential development in the City. Lastly, the Noise Element
              identifies and appraises noise exposure and problems within the
              community. In turn, the Circulation Element identifies noise exposure
              information that results from transportation related systems.

                                                                               April, 1990
         SECTION II - EXISTING CONDITIONS
         The mode of travel and the means through which that mode must
         move are the two basic determinants of the movement of people and
         goods within an urban environment. In the City of Hawthorne, the
         circulation system is primarily a rectangular grid represented by a
         hierarchy of streets and pathways ranging from large freeways to
         pedestrian walkways over which people and goods move between
         communities and within the community.
Freeways This section provides an overview of Hawthorne's circulation system.
         It classifies the streets, identifies the extent of other motorized means
         of moving goods and people such as trains, buses, and airplanes, and
         discusses pedestrian and bicycle circulation. Truck routes, parking,
         traffic generating attractions of activities, and air quality are additional
         topics which are addressed in this section. Figure 1 classifies the
         various street systems within the City.
         The principal circulation network within Southern California is the
         freeway system. The freeway circulation system offers high-speed
         thoroughfares for motor vehicles and has become the basic travel
         network for movement between cities as well as short trips within the
         city, although this system was not designed for the latter. The freeway
         system was designed to serve the travel needs of an ever-growing
         number of private automobiles and buses. It also serves the regional
         transportation demands for distribution of goods and services, with
         trucks carrying the majority of goods consumed within the community.
         This freeway system has provided a mechanism for growth
         throughout Los Angeles County, introducing and improving access to
         areas with high growth potential. Much of Hawthorne was developed
         as a result of this phenomenon.
         A freeway is defined as a road serving high-speed traffic with no
         crossings interrupting the flow of traffic (i.e., no crossings at grade).
         Located near the western edge of the City of Hawthorne is the San
         Diego Freeway (1-405) and to the north, the Century Freeway (1-105)
         scheduled for completion in 1993.
         San Diego Freeway (1-405). The 1-405 is the major north-south
         transportation corridor within the South Bay area and passes throu9h
         the west end of Hawthorne. Traffic counts performed by CALTRANS
         along its route have indicated that travel demand is well over design
         capacity at various points, including Hawthorne, during peak flow.
         Within Hawthorne, the 1-405 is presently over capacity which has
         created congestion problems along this corridor especially during
         peak traffic flows. Interchanges exist at Imperial Highway, El Segundo
         Boulevard, and Rosecrans Avenue.
                           2                                       Land Use Element
                                                                           April, 1990
                As further development in Hawthorne and the South Bay region
                occurs, changes in traffic flows along this major corridor will result,
                which may affect surrounding communities. However, through the
                mechanisms of alternative modes of travel, city and regional
                transportation impacts can be significantly reduced.
                Century Freeway (1-105). The other major element in the regional
                transportation network is the I-IDS which runs east-west along the
                northern boundary of Hawthorne. The I-IDS is currently under
                construction and is expected to be completed in 1993. It is anticipated
                that once completed, the 1-105 will significantly reduce east-west
                surface street congestion along arterial streets. Interchanges along
                the freeway will exist at Hawthorne Boulevard, Prairie Avenue, and
                Crenshaw Boulevard. In addition, the intersection of the 1-405 and the
                I-IDS will be a five-level interchange network which will, once
                completed, become one of the largest freeway interchange systems in
                modern transportation history.
Local Vehicular In a regional context, freeway circulation systems move traffic
Circulation and between cities as well as interfacing with the local circulation system
Street          functions by moving traffic within and between various parts of the city
Classification  and adjacent communities. Figure 2 indicates the level of use of the
                local circulation system, and illustrates the strong rectangular grid
                pattern of roadway use and development. The local circulation system
                is divided into several types of streets and are established upon their
                functions within the local street network. The classification for types of
                streets are as follows: arterial, collector and local streets. Typical
                roadway cross sections are shown in Figure 3. These roadway
                classifications are further described below:
                Arterial Streets. An arterial street is defined as a major street carrying
                the traffic of local and collector streets to and from freeways and other
                major streets, with controlled intersections and generally providing
                direct access to properties. Major north-south arterials serving
                Hawthorne are Aviation Boulevard; Inglewood Avenue; Hawthorne
                Boulevard; Prairie Avenue; Crenshaw Boulevard; and Van Ness
                Avenue. Major east-west arterials found in the City include Imperial
                Highway; El Segundo Boulevard; Rosecrans Avenue; and Compton
                Boulevard. Generally, both north-south and east-west arterial streets
                are spaced apart at even one-mile distances. Minimum arterial street
                right-of-way width in Hawthorne is one hundred feet and is designed
                to provide an eighty-four foot width curb to curb.
                Collector Streets. A collector street is a street for traffic moving
                between arterial and local streets, generally providing direct access to
                properties. Typical collector streets found in the City of Hawthorne
                include 120th Street, 135th Street, Broadway Avenue, and Ramona
                                  3                                      Land Use Element
                                                                                 April, 1990
        Avenue. Minimum collector street right-of-way width in Hawthorne is
        eighty feet and is designed to provide a sixty-four foot width curb to
        curb.
        Local Streets. A local street is a street that provides direct access to
        properties and designed to discourage through-traffic. Generally,
        these types of streets serve the residential needs of the community by
        carrying low volumes of traffic. They also serve neighborhood
        commercial and industrial land uses. Minimum local street right-of-
        way width in Hawthorne is sixty-feet and is designed to provide a
        forty-foot width curb to curb.
Transit The smaller urbanized areas of a region have always had the least
Systems amount of public transportation service. However, the changing
        lifestyles, economic pressures and greater social and environmental
        concerns have increased the need for alternatives to automobile
        travel or in many cases, not traveling at all.
        Compared to the convenience, flexibility and privacy of travel by car,
        transit travel is less appealing, especially for recreational purposes.
        The often poor quality of transit service also contributes to declining
        patronage. However, by providing adequate services, reducing transit
        inconveniences and costs, and the future 1-105 light rail system,
        public transportation can be one of the alternative modes
        implemented to alter the balance of the present auto-oriented
        transportation system.
        Transit services are physical systems and services which support
        development and people. Examples of transit services utilized within
        the City of Hawthorne are the urban and suburban rail systems, bus
        systems, and an airport network. These systems are described below:
        Southern Pacific and Santa Fe Railroads. The railway system
        presently operating within the City of Hawthorne is centered around
        the Southern Pacific. The Southern Pacific line currently operates a
        daily schedule in each direction over a line which extends the full
        length of the City. The Santa Fe Railroad serves a small area in the
        southwest corner of the City.
        Century-El Segundo light-Rail Transit System. The Los Angeles
        County Transportation Commission has approved the construction of
        a 20-mile light-rail transit project with anticipated opening in mid-1993.
        The line will run down the middle of the I-105, now under construction,
        from Norwalk on the east to Aviation Boulevard on the west; then the
        line will turn southward off the freeway and travel through the
        southwestern border of Hawthorne. Three stations in Hawthorne will
        be located with park-and-ride facilities.
                           4                                    Land Use Element
                                                                        April, 1990
The Century-El Segundo light Rail Transit System will alter existing
travel patterns in and out of Hawthorne. This will be achieved by the
light rail's positive impact of increasing the provision of adequate
transit services with the Los Angeles County region and
accommodating transit uses by providing an alternative mode of
transportation other than what presently is available. As such, this rail
rapid transit system will provide an important means to mitigate traffic
congestion so that comprehensive land use considerations can be
optimized. In addition, the proposed sites of park-and-ride facilities at
high-employment based locations will reduce commuter
inconvenience and encourage transit ridership.
Bus Service. Hawthorne is located within the Southern California
Rapid Transit District (SCRTD), which provides bus service to
Hawthorne for commuters and shoppers. In general, the buses
operate on routes confined to the City's major arterial streets. SCRTD
is primarily responsible for the review and designation of services, and
frequently revises schedules and routes according to expressed need
and economic activity.
Hawthorne Municipal Airport. Hawthorne Municipal Airport is owned
and operated by the City of Hawthorne and is located in the western
portion of the Los Angeles basin, five miles east of Santa Monica Bay
and the Pacific Ocean. Airport property is directly bounded by
Crenshaw Boulevard, 120th Street, Prairie Avenue, and a Northrop
Aircraft facility. In 1986, Hawthorne Municipal airport accommodated
approximately 277 single-engine based aircraft, 30 multi-engine
based aircraft, and three fixed base operations offering rentals,
charter service, flight instruction, and engine and airplane repair. In
addition, 1986 figures indicate that 130,714 annual operations were
conducted. The existing design capacity of the single runway airport is
230,000 operations per year. However, the Airport does not function
as a major transportation mode for residents at this time.
Of interest to Hawthorne are noise, safety, and land use
considerations. These considerations may not remain stable in the
future given the current underutilization of airport operations. Due to
changing physical, economic, and environmental conditions, the
possibility of the airport transforming from a general aviation airport
into a private, corporate airport setting is becoming more of a reality.
Factors which may contribute to this transformation include increases
in manufacturer's product liability insurance, changes in production
and distribution patterns for aviation fuel, changes in ownership and
marketing strategies of the larger general aviation manufacturers, and
public perception of aviation due to media coverage of safety and
noise issues.

                                                                April, 1990
                To study problems associated with the airport, an Airport Advisory
                Committee was formed in a joint effort by the City of Hawthorne and
                the Northrop Corporation. This committee will formulate
                recommendations for existing and future land use, noise, and safety
                considerations and needs.
                In addition, the committee is also responsible in formulating an Airport
                Master Plan to study existing facilities and activity trends in order to
                adequately assess future needs. The Plan shall include an inventory
                of existing navigation aids and aerospace factors, historical aviation
                activity, identification and location of area airports and service areas,
                and socioeconomic characteristics.
Para-Transit    Para-transit services include such transportation services as jitneys,
Systems         carpooling, van pooling, taxi service, and dia1-a-ride arrangements.
                These services usually serve elderly and disabled persons, although
                some services are available without restrictions. Six fixed bus routes
                and five taxi companies currently serve the South Bay area. In
                addition, three dia1-a-1ift services are available for senior citizens or
                disabled residents in Hawthorne. Lastly, private sector companies,
                like the Northrop Corporation, are currently providing car pooling or
                pooling para-transit systems.
 Transportation Transportation System Management (TSM) is a cooperative process
 System         involving all transportation agencies in an urban area attempting to
 Management     increase the efficiency of a transportation system through low-cost
                and relatively short-term actions. TSM analysis can incorporate a
                number of techniques that could be implemented to benefit a localized
                citywide or corridor problem. This is accomplished by establishing a
                better balance between the auto, pedestrian, bicycle, and transit of
                the urban transportation system.
                Contemporary objectives to satisfy the goal are to minimize person
                delay rather than only vehicle delay to maximize mobility, yet minimize
                environmental and energy impacts of travel; place increased reliance
                on public transportation and other means of group riding; improve
                transit speeds and operating efficiency; reduce travel demands and
                ensure that improvements are compatible with each other and
                consistent with broader urban objectives.
                Projected vehicular traffic for Year 2000 cannot be totally
                accommodated on the Master Plan of Streets and Highways solely
                through capital improvements such as street widening. Other
                strategies to reduce vehicular demand must be utilized to accomplish
                the goal of this Element. Ideally, the TSM process involves a
                comprehensive and coordinated analysis of alternative strategies that
                                   6                                    Land Use Element
                                                                                April, 1990
               take into account the complexities and trade-offs in the transportation
               system.
TSM Strategies One of the major TSM strategies presently working in Hawthorne is
               vanpooling. The vanpool concept is presently being-instituted by the
               Northrop Corporation which provides vans to their employees under
               varying arrangements.
               The City of Hawthorne may also consider the use of "Commuter
               Computer." The non-profit organization "Commuter Computer" has
               been actively promoting both carpools and vanpools within the El
               Segundo and Los Angeles area. This organization provides matching
               services for interested participants and aids in the pooling format in
               other ways. The vanpool concept has the most promising application
               for two types of trips; long commute trips and commute trips to
               concentrated employment nodes.
               Other active TSM programs which the city might consider would
               include work hour rescheduling where a staggered work program
               would help in spreading the peak period traffic over a longer time
               period, rather than exhibit high volume/short duration surges of traffic
               volume on the street system.
               Additional programs in Hawthorne depend on the active participation
               of employers in the private sector. A major issue acting as a barrier to
               their cooperation is that the employer stands to benefit far less than
               the community and may even suffer from initial implementation
               problems. of reduced productivity and the need to invest in project-
               related equipment.
               TSM in Hawthorne includes traffic-controls, improved public
               transportation, and improvements of the management of the existing
               transportation system.
Non-Motorized  Non-motorized circulation in Hawthorne includes pedestrians and
Circulation    bicyclists. Since increasing energy costs and air quality are becoming
               more of a critical concern, the provision of non-motorized circulation
               needs are becoming more important. The value of these non-
               motorized systems will escalate as city and regional transportation
               policies are implemented. Various types of non-motorized circulation
               include:
               Pedestrian Circulation. The streets of Hawthorne were designed for
               automobile circulation. As such, pedestrians must compete with
               automobiles in many areas of the city. Traffic volumes on major
               arterial streets during peak traffic hours create intense conflicts
               between pedestrian and automobile movement. In addition, some
                                 7                                    Land Use Element
                                                                              April, 1990
               residential areas in the city have no sidewalks to separate pedestrians
               from motor vehicle movement; however, programs have and will
               continue to be implemented to correct this problem.
               Bicycle Circulation. Hawthorne has just approved the extension of an
               existing bikeway within the city. It will run along the Dominguez Flood
               Channel from I20th Street to El Segundo Boulevard. The Hawthorne
               City Council has adopted bikeway plans that will generally follow
               power lines and drainage channel rights-of-way. The construction of
               new bike lanes on existing arterial or collector streets has not been
               implemented because a bicyclist's space takes away sorely needed
               space for moving higher person occupancy vehicles.
Other          Additional topics related to circulation and the movement of people
Circulation    and goods through the city that require discussion and consideration
Related Topics include major traffic generators and attractors, truck routes, parking,
               and air pollution. These issues are briefly discussed below.
               Traffic Generators and Attractors. Hawthorne exhibits four inner city
               locations that can be considered traffic generators or attractors. They
               are: 1) Northrop Corporation facilities located north of Broadway
               Avenue between Prairie Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard; 2) MatteI
               Incorporated located on Rosecrans Avenue near the 1-405; 3)
               Hawthorne Boulevard retail and service strip commercial
               developments; and 4) the Hawthorne Municipal Airport. In addition to
               the four inner city traffic generators, several locations outside the city
               have a direct effect on traffic flow within the city. Among these
               locations are most notably the Los Angeles International Airport
               located to the northwest, the Pacific Ocean and surrounding
               recreation areas, the Forum and Hollywood Race Track located only a
               mile north of the city on Prairie Avenue.
               Truck Routes. The City of Hawthorne presently has a designated
               truck route system which utilizes many of its major traffic-ways. These
               routes provide the city with a system which offers truck access to
               commercial and industrial areas while confining trucks to major
               streets. As such, existing truck routes reduce excessive noise, dust,
               and traffic hazards associates with truck movement from encroaching
               upon residential areas. Figure 4 indicates the designated truck routes
               within the city.
               Parking. The city presently has adequate parking facilities for most
               commercial, industrial, and public areas. However, residential parking,
               particularly parking associated with high density residential
               developments is a problem. The problem is created by the lack of
               adequate parking for older apartment complexes, existence of narrow
               local streets, and apartment tenants using street curb-side parking in
                                 8                                     Land Use Element
                                                                               April, 1990
lieu of their assigned parking space. Future zoning ordinance
considerations will be necessary with respect to parking design and
ratios. The present commercial off-street standards for the City of
Hawthorne are one of the most restrictive in the Los Angeles region.
Current standards require one space for every 250 square feet of
gross leasable floor area for 75% of the development, and one space
for every 100 square feet of gross leasable floor area for the
remaining 25% of the development. As such, existing inadequacies or
future parking needs which will result from implementation of the Land
Use Element will be minimized.
Air Pollution. Air pollution is associated with the impacts of
automobile, bus, truck traffic, and to a lesser extent, manufacturing
industries. Since Hawthorne will be serviced by two major freeways as
well as its existing street system, local air quality will most likely be
modified during peak traffic flow periods in areas adjacent to travel
corridors. However, the City of Hawthorne has little direct control over
mitigating these impacts associated with motor vehicular traffic.
School Circulation There is a growing need for the construction of
school facilities. Due to the scarcity of sites that are adequate to
accommodate the required school acreage, school districts are having
to consolidate residential lots and acquire lots across and adjacent to
local streets. This presents a safety concern for school children and
youth who are required to cross local streets to access school
facilities.

                                                                  April, 1990
               SECTION III - ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
               The Circulation Element is based upon policy response to circulation
               issues and opportunities. Issues are local concerns relating to existing
               or expected circulation topics which need resolution. Opportunities are
               potential benefits which might be achieved as a result of the revision
               of old situations, or the addition of new ones.
               The following factors discussed in this section were identified as the
               major issues and opportunities to be addressed in the Circulation
               Element and were identified through the examination of existing
               circulation systems, reviewing transportation studies, seeking citizen
               evaluation through public participation workshops, and conducting ad
               hoc committee meetings composed of members of the Hawthorne
               City Council, Planning Commission and other City officials.
               Current traffic circulation along arterial streets within the City include
Traffic
               opportunities for traffic signal modernization, timing, and coordination.
Circulation
               The General Plan identifies such signals and establishes policies to
               improve traffic circulation and safety.
Alternative    The City's location provides an opportunity for increased use in public
Transportation transportation through expansion of local and regional bus systems
Modes          and encouragement of carpooling, vanpooling, jitneys, or staggered
               work hours for local business. In addition, the City should consider
               ways to exploit the opportunity that exists due to the location of the
               Century-EI Segundo Light Rail Transit System. The General Plan
               includes policies to stimulate such activities.
Parking        The circulation system must accommodate existing and future
               developments in the City. As such, neighborhood and commercial
               parking problems need to be mitigated. The General Plan identifies
               parking needs and establishes policies to initiate the improvement of
               parking conditions and facilities within the City.
School Safety  School Districts are met with many challenges in meeting classroom
               enrollment, reduction in classroom size, and selection of new school
               sites. Local streets may present a difficulty in meeting school safety
               concerns when school sites which are divided by, or adjacent to, local
               streets require children and youth to cross a local street to access
               ancillary uses such as playgrounds and other recreational areas. The
               General Plan should facilitate the possible vacation of local streets
               once a traffic study has been completed and the Department of Public
               Works has determined that traffic circulation will not be substantially
               impeded.

SECTION IV – CIRCULATION ELEMENT GOALS AND POLICIES
Convenient and safe movement between home, work and shopping is
an important component of the perceived quality of life for the
community. As the City reaches its development capacity, traffic

POLICY 1.26: The City is encouraged to design arterial streets as
complete streets, balancing the needs, safety, and use of public right-
of-way for all users of all abilities.
POLICY 1.27: The City shall identify bicycle corridors within City limits
and adjacent municipalities in order to integrate into the regional
bicycle plan and connect resident to activity centers.
POLICY 1.28: The City shall build local and regional consensus and
support for the advancement of the Dominguez Channel Greenway as
a new active transportation corridor and connector from Hawthorne to
the Port of Los Angeles.
POLICY 1.29: The City shall support the retrofitting of existing
arterials to be safe, accessible, and comfortable transportation
corridors to meet the needs of all modes of transportation, prioritizing
resurfaced and rebuilt streets for the first retrofits.
Level of Service Analysis
The traffic impact methodology selected is the 1985 Highway
Capacity Manual Planning Method (HCM). The HCM method
calculates the level of Service at a particular intersection. level of
Service denotes any infinite number of traffic-operating conditions
which may exist on a given lane or roadway when it is subjected to
various traffic volumes
There are six levels of Service ("A" through "F") which relate to driving
conditions from best to worst respectively. The characteristics of traffic
operation for each level of service are listed in Table I. In general,

LOS "A" indicates free-flow conditions with no congestion, while LOS
"F" represents total system breakdown with stop-and-go conditions
and long delays.
The implementation of the land use policy contained in the Land Use
Element would alter the distribution of circulation related development
in two areas of the City. The first area is located adjacent to the
Century Freeway (1-105) and is identified as freeway related
commercial uses. The second area is located in the southwestern
portion of the City, specifically bounded by Isis Avenue, Rosecrans
Avenue, Ocean Gate Avenue and Compton Boulevard. This area is
also designated freeway commercial due to its proximity to the San
Diego Freeway (1-405). Figure 5 shows existing and future ICU and
Level of Service for these two areas.
The network of surface streets, highways and freeways serving the
two freeway commercial areas will experience an increase in daily
vehicle trips. However, by the year 2000, the above mentioned
circulation systems would be extremely congested whether or not
commercial use intensification resulted due to projected urban growth
rates in all surrounding jurisdictions.
In addition, the location of the light rail project, reduction of freeway
commercial floor area ratios from 4:1 to 3.5:1 (as proposed by the
Land Use Element), and current City of Hawthorne parking standards
will mitigate the possibility of adverse traffic related elements.

     Collectors are proposed to extend the network into existing
     residential and industrial areas to best serve and connect
     residents and employees to the Crenshaw Station. The goal
     of the Path Network priority improvements outlined here is
     to establish a connection to the Crenshaw Station from all
     four surrounding quadrants, connect to major origins and
     destinations, fill gaps in the existing bicycle network, and
     identify the highest priority arterials to define a realistic set
     of improvement projects. Figure 3 displays the priority
     improvement for the Path Network in the City of Hawthorne.

     INVENTORY OF MOBILITY IMPEDIMENTS
     Several barriers exist to using the Path Network to access
     the Crenshaw Station using active transportation and NEV.
     The mobility impediments are documented here in order to
     better understand challenges currently faced by users and
     identify priority improvement projects. The focus for
     pedestrian impediments is the ¼ to ½ mile walkshed,
     whereas the focus for bicycle and local use vehicle
     impediments is the 3-mile access shed. General mobility
     impediments are discussed here, with more detailed,
     site-specific impediments detailed in Section 2.

area immediately adjacent to the station area and nearby
intersections. The recommended projects were chosen using         GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
an analytical process involving inputs from observed and
                                                                  In order to address the active transportation access barriers

The recommended projects prioritize addressing the existing
safety hazards and accessibility deficiencies in the
immediate transit station area to enhance walkability and
bikeability. Following station area safety and walkability
upgrades, it is suggested that a Path Network system be
implemented to connect the transit station to nearby
centers of business and points of interest, including the
aerospace industrial district at Crenshaw and Northrop,
retail centers at Crenshaw & 120th and Crenshaw & Imperial,
aerospace and commercial business centers along Crenshaw
to Northrop and El Segundo, and along 120th linking the
transit station to the Hawthorne Airport. The presence of
these large centers of business and employment create a
significant opportunity to capitalize on transit ridership
gains. Upgrading the pathways between the Crenshaw
Station to these centers to be a safer and more comfortable
environment for walking or biking could make transit
ridership a more-attractive mode of commuting.
Once the immediate transit station area upgrades and
connection improvements to nearby businesses are met,
focus should be shifted to the greater bike-shed area of a 3
mile radius, where even more opportunities for connecting to
transit exist. The study area is a prime setting for
implementing a greenway path network, bikelane/NEV (or
rolling lane) network, given the proximity to multiple central
business districts, entertainment venues, commercial
campuses, and community colleges.

    Reduced Lane Width and Sidewalk Widening
    Elements/Location: The current lanes near the freeway on and off ramps are wider than needed, which leads to faster
    speeds. The traffic calming method of reducing the lane width and widening sidewalk could reduce speeds, creating a
    safer environment for pedestrians. Sidewalk widening/reduced lane widths are being proposed between the station and
    the nearest intersection, especially for the lanes leading up to freeway on-ramps.

   PHASE 1: UPGRADE EXISTING DOMINGUEZ CHANNEL
   BIKEWAY
   The phase 1 improvements take advantage of the existing
   infrastructure and attempts to make the channel more
   attractive for uses. The design guidelines for phase 1 should
   encourage safety, comfort, and convenience, but minimize
   scope so that the project will be politically feasible for
   funding and construction. The pathway currently runs along
   the east side of the channel the entire length, but the west
   pathway stops at Rocket Road. The west pathway would be
   extended south to El Segundo and linked to the existing
   cut-throughs and streets. The existing pavement would be
   patched and repaired with new striping and signage
   throughout. Safety upgrades consist of lighting along the
   paths and emergency kiosks at key access points. Comfort
   would be enhanced by replacing the chain link with
   decorative entrances, landscaping, tubular steel fencing,
   and amenities.
   Recommendations: Phase 1 Proposed Scope
   •	   Patch and repair existing asphalt pathway on the east
        side of Dominguez Channel from 120th Streets south to
        El Segundo Boulevard.
   •	   Build new a pathway on the west side of the channel
        from approximately Rocket Road south to El Segundo
        Boulevard. Patch and repair existing pathway from
        120th Street to Rocket Road.
   •	   Provide new pathway railroad crossing signal at freight
        railroad crossing for the new West side pathway.
   •	   Replace chain link gates with decorative entrances and
        signage.
   •	   Replace chain link fencing along pathways with a
        mixture of landscaping, tube steel fencing, and
        amenities.
   •	   Add light fixtures along both pathways.
   •	   Add emergency kiosks at pathway entrances with sirens
        and flashers.
   •	   Add striping, way-finding signage, and informational
        signage along pathways.

   IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES                                          benefits of NEVs without the expense, a shared fleet might
                                                                      be the most expedient. Shared vehicles carry extra expenses
   There are two parts to any potential implementation strategy of insurance, software, hardware, and administration beyond
   for NEVs. One is a realistic vision of a long-term,                the costs of the vehicles themselves. These expenses could

   and marketing, to test and refine concepts of operation and        NEVs in the long term are: Metro, property owners, retail
   revenue models, and to expand the number of future project tenants, business associations, and members of the
   partners. The key is to find a way to get more NEVs on the         community who want to use the vehicles. Funding such a
   ground in order to prove the concept and introduce people to program might also be achieved through a location-based

   In all cases, the central issue is that NEVs are consumer          The participant in the market, of car-share operators and

   the logic of the market, not of policy or planning. An NEV         strategy recommends that the City and its allies to keep a
   program and pilot project would have to include cooperation        close eye on development in community based car sharing
   and partnership from public and private sector entities            through the Shared Use Mobility Center (www.
   including insurance companies, software and hardware               sharedusemobilitycenter.org), in order to track new
   manufacturers, vehicle manufacturers and businesses. It’s          opportunities as they arise.
   not something the public sector can do alone.
                                                                      A pilot project to jump start this longer-term strategy could

   shared NEVs can expand and adapt over time. It may also            verification system for users, determine a means of tracking

   the vehicles for security and for calculating VMT and GHG
   reduction. There are software and hardware companies, and
   a specific vehicle manufacturer, who would be very
   interested in such a project, as might Metro, the County, the
   SBCCOG, and the LAEDC. Once all of the pilot project
   components are in place, it would take the AQMD eight
   months to review the application. A 30-month pilot could
   therefore start in a year after a focused project planning
   effort begins. This would depend on there being a road
   infrastructure in place for the NEVs.
   2. Shared fleet for Major Employer(s): Another, simpler,
   program could be directed to employees of one of the major
   employers in the project area, such as SpaceX. The company
   could offer a fleet of NEVs for employees to move not only
   between their own buildings, but to take advantage of new
   and existing local retail opportunities on a day-to-day basis.
   Employees could leave the campus more often for lunch and
   recreation opportunities. The goal would be to make
   vanpools or use of transit more attractive by providing a
   local vehicle for daytime use, replace some vehicle trips with
   NEVs, and support and expand local retail, and make the
   most of the employer’s presence in the City. On an ongoing
   basis, such a program would likely have to be funded by
   employers and participating employees. It would likely take a
   non-profit to assemble the more detailed implementation
   strategy in collaboration with the employers.
   It may be more difficult to make a case for this type of
   project to the AQMD since, although the project takes place
   in an underserved community, the users of the NEVs would
   not necessarily be residents of the community. AQMD’s
   efforts through grant programs are focused, to the extent
   possible, on disadvantaged populations. Perhaps such a
   pilot project can be established in conjunction with fostering
   new local retail and other amenities. If there is no direct
   benefit to the underserved community, it is possible that
   such a project would have to be funded almost entirely by
   the employers, land-owners, employees and software and
   hardware or vehicle providers (the latter, through donations).
   3. Autonomous NEV Pilot: At the time of writing, there is a lot
   of interest, on behalf of the LAEDC and the SBCCOG, to carry
   out a pilot for an automated shuttle or automated NEV. This
   would be a project small in scale, integrated with a larger
   shared NEV pilot. This is a very immediate issue. The
   organization or company carrying out the pilot would have to
   work with the City, and local stakeholders such as
   employers, to determine the best use case for an automated
   demo or pilot, and dovetail it with the NEV program.

      ELECTRIC VEHICLE SUPPLY EQUIPMENT (EVSE) LEVELS
      EVSE is grouped into three different levels, by voltage:
      Level 1 equipment provides charging through a 120 volt (V), alternating-current (AC) plug and requires a dedicated
      circuit. Level 1 charging refers to the use of a standard household outlet. On one end of the cord provided with PEV’s is a
      standard, three-prong household plug. On the other end is a connector, which plugs into the vehicle. Depending on the
      battery technology used in the vehicle, Level 1 charging generally takes 8 to 12 hours to completely charge a fully
      depleted battery. The most common place for Level 1 charging is at the vehicle owner’s home and is typically conducted
      overnight.
      Level 2 equipment offers charging through a 240V, AC plug and requires installation of home charging or public charging
      equipment. These units require a dedicated 40 amp circuit. Level 2 charging equipment is compatible with all electric
      vehicles and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles. Level 2 chargers have a cord that plugs directly into the vehicle in the same
      connector location used for Level 1 equipment. Depending on the battery technology used in the vehicle, Level 2
      charging generally takes 4 to 6 hours to completely charge a fully depleted battery. Charging time can increase in cold
      temperatures. Level 2 chargers are commonly found in residential settings, public parking areas, places of employment
      and commercial settings.
      Level 3 equipment, also commonly known as DC fast charging, charges through a 480V, direct-current (DC) plug. Most
      Level 3 chargers provide an 80% charge in 30 minutes. Level 3 equipment is not compatible with all vehicles, and all
      vehicles do not accept the charge. There is currently no industry standard for this level of charging; however, Level 3
      chargers are being deployed across the United States in public or commercial settings. Currently, the Mitsubishi “i” and
      Nissan LEAF can accept a Level 3 charge. Other vehicles, such as the Chevy Volt cannot. Level 3 Tesla Supercharger The
      Tesla Supercharger will only work for the Tesla Model S, providing half a charge in approximately 20 minutes.

   CONCLUSION
   In conclusion, targeting large residential developments
   (MUDs), specific employers and new and existing commercial
   centers, is the most effective way of encouraging more EVSE
   in the City of Hawthorne. The City should install publicly
   available chargers at strategic locations: City Hall, the
   Community Center, and in conjunction with key origins and
   destinations adjacent to active transportation, and work
   with Metro to install EVSE at the Crenshaw and other transit
   stations. Commuters who drive to the Crenshaw Green Line
   station should be able to charge their cars while at work in
   the Metro owned lot. The location of future car-share hubs
   (or NEV-share hubs) in association with the Green Line
   station or new commercial or mixed-use developments
   would make ideal locations for EVSE.
   If the City hasn’t already done so, it could gradually also
   replace vehicles in it’s gas powered fleet with EV’s.
   Going forward, the City should stay informed about the
   efforts of the SBCCOG in expanding the EVSE network in the
   sub-region to hear about new funding opportunities, and to
   know the location (and frequency) of new EVSE facilities. The
   City could pay for public EVSE through grant programs, but
   the City would first need to know about grants as they come
   up, and have the resources to apply for the grants.
   Hawthorne can, in turn, provide information to employers
   and citizens on costs and benefits of EVSE. It can encourage
   property owners to install EVSE by having a qualified

   This three-tiered strategy follows the pay-as-you-go and
   beneficiary pays principles as closely as possible. As new
   funding mechanisms, grant programs and fiscal policies are
   developed over the life of the ATP, the funding priorities
   should be adjusted accordingly.
   For example the State of California Strategic Growth
   Council’s funding priorities, which are tied to the costs of
   carbon emissions and are part of the state’s overall
   greenhouse gas reduction strategy, are currently set to fund
   projects that support affordable housing and infill
   development in transit oriented districts with fixed transit
   links this source of funding may become available to
   support infrastructure improvements within the plan area.
   In addition, state and county wide infrastructure programs
   are periodically made available through the initiative
   process. Funds from future initiatives may be able to be
   used to finance surface transportation improvements within
   the plan area.
   Several of the funding mechanisms that have been
   identified will require planning and outreach prior to their
   adoption. One or more potential funding sources for each
   major improvement or program proposed as part of the
   project have been identified. After agreeing on the funding
   priorities among those improvements that will require public
   funding, it will then be necessary for the City to integrate
   those funding priorities with overall citywide priorities.
   Many of the funding sources involve revenues that must be
   allocated not only among different improvements identified
   for the plan area but among projects located throughout the
   City. Therefore, it will be important for the City of
   Hawthorne to integrate the financing needs identified for
   this project with the City’s existing financing plans and
   programs, including the CIP, and the process for allocating
   grant funds to local projects and activities. Once this
   process is complete and infrastructure costs are available,
   the City can refine the implementation schedule with more
   specific funding dates that reflect the anticipated
   availability of funds for projects and programs, consistent
   with updated citywide financing plans.

                              SECTION I—INTRODUCTION
Purpose of this Element
The Land Use Element is the single most important element of this General Plan in
that it will guide future development in the city for many years to come. The Land
Use Element will also affect the key issues that are addressed in the remaining
elements. For example, land use policies will have a direct bearing on the local
system of streets and roadways which are the focus of the Circulation Element.
Housing issues and needs identified in the Housing Element will be linked to land use
policies related to both existing and future residential development. Even issues
related to safety, noise, and the environment will be directly affected by the land
use policies contained in this element.
The City seeks to accomplish the following with the implementation of the goals and
policies contained in this Land Use Element:
       Establishment of a balanced and functional mix of development consistent
        with the long-range goals, objectives, and values of the City;
       Provide a guide for both public and private investments indicating where
        new development is permitted and the nature, density, and intensity of that
        development;
       Identification of opportunities for new development and the redevelopment
        and revitalization of existing development in the city as well as any
        constraints that might affect this new development;
       Reduction of loss of life, injury, and property damage that might result from
        flooding, seismic hazards and other natural and man-made hazards that need
        to be considered in future land use planning and decision making;
       The preservation and maintenance of the residential quality of the individual
        neighborhoods which comprise the city.
Through the use of text and diagrams, this Land Use Element establishes clear and
logical patterns of land use as well as standards for new development. The single
most important feature of this element is the Land Use Policy Map which indicates
the location, density, and intensity of development for all land uses citywide. The
Land Use Policy Map is located at the end of this element.
The goals and policies contained in this element establish a constitutional
framework for future land use planning and decision making in the city.
                                              2

Related Plans and Programs
The scope and content of this element is largely governed by the General Plan Law
and Guidelines and the Planning and Zoning Development Laws for the State of
California. There are a number of other plans and programs that also require
consideration in the formulation of land use policy.
Zoning Ordinance
The Zoning Ordinance is the primary implementation mechanism for the Land Use
Element and the goals and policies contained herein. For this reason, the Zoning
Map must be consistent with the Land Use Policy map contained in the General Plan.
The Land Use Policy Map indicates the location and extent of future land use in the
city. The land use designations contained in this element and the boundaries of each
correspond to one or more zoning districts identified on the Zoning Map (see Table
3). Some land uses contained in the Land Use Policy Map differ from the existing
zoning. Therefore, zone changes will have to be made to maintain consistency with
the Land Use Policy Map.
Specific Plans
Land use policies contained in this element call for the preparation and
implementation of specific plans for certain areas of the city. The General Plan
establishes broad parameters of development on a long-term basis. A specific plan is
designed to identify particular land uses and development standards relating to a
specific site or development proposal. The Land Use Policy Map identifies
Hawthorne Boulevard as an area suitable for specific plan treatment.
Section 65451 of the Government Code requires that a specific plan include
regulations, conditions, programs, and proposed legislation concerning the
following:
       The development standards and precise location for land use and facilities;
       The standards and precise location designated for streets, roadways, and
        other transportation facilities;
       Standards indicating population density and building intensity and provisions
        for supporting services and infrastructure;
       Specific standards designed to address the use, development and
        conservation of natural resources; and
       Provisions for the implementation of the General Plan.
                                            3

SECTION II—EXISTING CONDITIONS
The City of Hawthorne is completely developed with the remaining vacant land
limited to smaller, scattered parcels. The City contains a mix of residential and multi-
family housing types and densities, strip commercial along the major arterials, retail
centers, public facilities, and industrial uses near the airport and in the southwest
portion of the City.
Changes in the demographic characteristics have resulted in a demand for more
housing while at the same time, the population has remained relatively constant.
The Century Freeway (1-105) greatly increases regional accessibility to Hawthorne
resulting in improved opportunities for development.
Table 3, at the end of this Element, compares the acreage of existing development
to existing zoning by use or zoning designation. As shown in Table 1, existing
development and existing zoning are generally consistent.
                                              4

SECTION III—ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
The Land Use Element is based upon policy response to land use issues and
opportunities. Issues are local concerns relating to existing or expected land uses
which need resolution. Opportunities are potential benefits which might be
achieved as a result of new land use situations.
The following factors have been identified as the major issues and opportunities to
be addressed in the Land Use Element:
Regional Commercial
Areas adjacent to the Century Freeway (1-105) and San Diego Freeway (I-
405)/Rosecrans Avenue offer significant development potential for land uses
requiring accessibility and visibility. Such uses include major retail goods and
services involving comparison purchasing decisions. The Land Use Element defines
such areas and includes policies to stimulate such commercial development.
Commercial Corridor Revitalization
Current land uses along arterial streets within the city include opportunities for
intensification and upgrading. Better development would increase sales tax revenue
to the city and improve land use compatibility and appearance. The Land Use
Element identifies such corridors and establishes policies to initiate commercial
revitalization.
Protection of Single Family Housing
The City contains large areas of single-family residential development. In light of the
past overdevelopment of multiple-family residences, low density residential areas
should be protected from intrusion.
Parks and Open Space
The limited parks and open space areas that provide recreational opportunities to
the public need to be developed and maintained. Additional areas of open space
such as rights-of-way, and easements offer additional offer additional opportunities
which are identified in the Land Use Policy Map.
Sphere of Influence Planning
Existing unincorporated "island" in the City's Sphere of Influence should be reviewed
for possible annexation in the future.
Hawthorne Airport
The City's airport and adjacent lands provide an opportunity for future expansion of
aviation-related development.
                                              5

SECTION IV—GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies contained in the Land Use Element are concerned with both
preserving the integrity of the individual neighborhoods that make up the city while
ensuring that future development is compatible with the environment and any
constraints that might be present. While new development can be beneficial to a
city, future growth must be managed in a sensible and rational manner. Adequate
infrastructure and services must be available to meet any future demand to ensure
that the existing levels of service are maintained.
The major issues facing the City are underscored in the following policies that
emphasize the need for future development to be sensitive to the existing residents,
their homes and businesses, and the natural environment.
It is important that Goals 1, 2 and 3 work together and are not pursued in a way that
achieves one goal at the expense of another. As critical as economic growth and
strength are to the city, they would be hollow achievements if the core fabric of the
community is sacrificed to gain that prosperity. Likewise, preserving obsolete and
tired land uses that have no redeeming historical, cultural or other intrinsic value to
the extent that the economic health of the city is suppressed is foolish in the long
run. The way land is used in Hawthorne and throughout the region has changed
significantly over the decades since the founding of the city, and will this will
continue. This Element is intended to provide guidance that seeks to achieve all of
the Goals of the General Plan simultaneously while providing a strong policy
foundation that is also flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances.
Additional and Revitalized Commercial Development
Hawthorne needs new and revitalized commercial development to increase sales tax
revenue for municipal funding and to upgrade its physical image. As an older and
well-established South Bay community, the City's future development will play a
significant role in its efforts to maintain and upgrade residential neighborhood
quality.
GOAL 1: THE CITY SHALL EXPAND CURRENT EFFORTS TO ATTRACT AND ENHANCE
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT.
POLICY 1.1: The Century Freeway (I-105) and San Diego Freeway (I-405) Corridors
shall be planned for regionally-oriented commercial uses where appropriate.
POLICY 1.2: The Hawthorne Boulevard Corridor shall be reviewed to determine the
most feasible program for commercial revitalization.
POLICY 1.3: Hawthorne Municipal Airport and related properties shall be analyzed to
explore possibilities for development while ensuring that the airport remains a vital
                                              6

economic asset for the community. The airport master plan shall be incorporated
into this analysis.
POLICY 1.4: The City shall support and encourage the rehabilitation or renovation of
existing buildings or structures or the conversion of obsolete and/or chronically
vacant storefronts from their original or most recent use to a new compatible,
economically viable, and sustainable use.
POLICY 1.5: The City shall continue to explore and adopt ways to use its assets to
promote commercial activity within the city.
Compatibility Between Existing and Future Development
Land use conflicts often arise when newer projects are insensitive to the use,
character, or scale of existing development. In many instances, these conflicts over
time can lead to both deterioration and blight of both the older and newer homes
and businesses. There are a number of ways potential conflicts can be resolved
through proper planning in the early stages of project design and subsequent code
enforcement. The following policies include measures to ensure that the existing
character of development is maintained and that future development is compatible
with existing land uses.
GOAL 2: EVERY EFFORT SHALL BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT BOTH EXISTING AND
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE AND WILL REMAIN COMPATIBLE WITH
SURROUNDING DESIRABLE USES.
POLICY 2.1: The design of future development shall consider the constraints and
opportunities that are provided by adjacent existing development.
POLICY 2.2: The construction of very large buildings shall be discouraged where such
structures are incompatible with surrounding residential development.
POLICY 2.3: A specific plan for the Hawthorne Boulevard corridor shall be prepared.
POLICY 2.4: Retention of buffer zones to protect adjacent areas of freeway corridor
from noise, exhaust, and light shall be encouraged.
POLICY 2.5: Obtrusive advertising media near residential or locally-oriented
commercial corridors shall be discouraged unless features that mitigate intrusive
light, glare and blight are incorporated in and/or around the appurtenant structure
and/or programmed into the media itself.
POLICY 2.6: Where it is necessary to construct retaining or noise-attenuating walls
along freeway corridors, they should be constructed with natural-appearing
materials and generously landscaped with vines, trees and shrubbery.
                                            7
POLICY 2.7: Encourage the development of unified commercial centers and
neighborhood commercial centers rather than the continued development of "strip
commercial."
POLICY 2.8: The residential character of the City’s single-family detached residential
neighborhoods shall be preserved.
POLICY 2.9: Chapter 17.38 of the City Code shall be amended to accommodate
residential nonconforming uses and permit expansion subject to current
development standards.
POLICY 2.10: The City shall evaluate the feasibility and appropriateness of adopting
form-based zoning codes or some hybrid version.
Economic Development
Land use policies have an immediate and direct impact on economic activity within
the city. Many decisions made in the past were made without consideration of these
impacts, and the cumulative effect of this has contributed to economic decline.
Although land use matters cannot be decided solely on the basis of their potential
economic impacts, to not consider economic impacts is to handicap economic
stability and growth in the city.
GOAL 3: A SOUND LOCAL ECONOMY WHICH ATTRACTS INVESTMENT, INCREASES
THE TAX BASE, CREATES EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR HAWTHORNE
RESIDENTS AND GENERATES PUBLIC REVENUES.
POLICY 3.1: The promotion of businesses that generate positive economic benefits
to the community, including generating tax revenue, job creation and enhancing the
quality of life for residents and visitors shall be encouraged and assisted.
POLICY 3.2: The design of future developments projects shall consider the economic
benefits and detriments that the project will provide.
POLICY 3.3: Development standards that encourage positive economic outcomes
shall be adopted.
POLICY 3.4: Any tools available to attract new businesses that create quality jobs,
generate revenue, or enhance the quality of life for residents, those employed with
the city and visitors to the city shall be considered.
POLICY 3.5: Revitalization of declining commercial and industrial areas through new
development, rehabilitation and other means that may be available shall be
considered and, if deemed advantageous, implemented.
                                              8

POLICY 3.6: Land use regulations shall be regularly evaluated and updated to
facilitate the attraction of high technology industries which will enhance the local
economy and support Hawthorne's image as a aerospace research and development
hub.
POLICY 3.7: The retention and expansion of small businesses shall be encouraged
through continued changes in zoning regulations.
POLICY 3.8: The City shall develop and adopt and periodically update an Economic
Development Element of the General Plan.
POLICY 3.9: The City shall continue to explore and adopt ways to use its assets to
promote fiscal health of the city’s government so that vital services are maintained
and improved to adapt to changing needs of the citizens and businesses of the city.

SECTION V—LAND USES
Land Use Policy Designations and Standards
The Land Use Policy Map at the end of this Element applies Hawthorne's stated goals to
specific land uses within the City. The Land Use Element designates five major
categories of land use, which roughly correspond to existing development patterns.
These categories include residential, commercial, industrial, public facilities and open
space. The residential designation is further subdivided into three density ranges: low,
medium, and high density. The commercial designation is also divided into three types:
local, general, and regional commercial. The distribution of land uses is shown in Table
3.
Table 3 also indicates residential development densities including potential ranges that
exist under current zoning. (The maximum allowable densities are not achievable in
many cases because existing street, alley, and lot configurations as well as setback, open
space, and parking requirements serve to limit densities). Table 3 also indicates
development intensities for the remaining land use designations and corresponding
zoning districts. Table 3 shows the distribution of acreage within Hawthorne by land use
designation.
The Floor Area Ratios (FARs) shown for the commercial and industrial land uses indicate
the maximum ratio of the gross floor area of all buildings on a lot to the lot area. As is
the case with residential density designations, the achievable floor area ratios for some
areas are less than the maximum. This is due to small lots as well as the necessity of
complying with setback, open space, and parking requirements.
        Low Density Residential - Residential dwelling unit densities in this category will
        correspond to those intensities allowed under the R-] zoning designation which
        allows] to 8.0 dwelling units per acre. This particular land use designation is
        characterized by single-family detached units and is found throughout the city.
        Approximately 589 acres of the city are classified as Low Density Residential.
        Medium Density Residential - This land use designation applies to those areas of
        the city in which the allowable densities for residential development
        corresponds to the R-2 zoning designation of 8.1 to 17.0 dwelling units per acre.
        Housing units within this density range typically include a mix of single-family
        detached and attached units and duplexes. Approximately 111 acres have been
        designated for Medium Residential Density development (Table 4).
        High Density Residential - This land use designation applies to those areas of the
        City where the. allowable residential densities are between 17.1 and 30.0 units
        per acre and corresponds to the R-3 zoning designation. This designation
        identifies those neighborhoods where triplexes, fourplexes and multi-family
                                          10                                  Land Use Element

units are located. An estimated 536 acres have been designated for High Density
Residential development (Table 4).
Local Commercial - This designation is a more restrictive land use category than
General Commercial. This particular designation identifies those areas of the city
where smaller professional offices, local services and retailing activities will be
located. The maximum Floor Area Ratio will be 1.5.
General Commercial - The general commercial land use designation refers to
those office and commercial activities which serve both the local and regional
markets. This is a more intense type of commercial development than that
permitted in local commercial areas and involves larger firms which generate
more traffic. The Floor Area Ratio for this development may go as high as 2.5 and
subterranean parking is permitted.
Regional Commercial - This designation accommodates commercial uses with
primary orientation to freeway accessibility. Allowable uses within this
designation include business parks, office, restaurants, auto centers, along with
other general commercial uses. The Floor Area Ratio for this type of
development may go as high as 3.5.
General Industrial - The General Industrial designation includes generally large-
scale developments or industrial parks whose activities include heavy
manufacturing, compounding, processing or fabrication. Such uses may also
include warehousing, storage, freight handling, truck services, and terminals. An
FAR of 1.75 is allowed for this designation.
Industrial - The Industrial land use designation generally involves smaller scale
development than the General Industrial designation and includes such uses as
manufacturing, assembly, fabrication, wholesale, heavy commercial and office
uses. This land use is appropriate as a buffer between non-industrial and general
industrial land uses. The Floor Area Ratio for this type of development may go as
high as 0.75.
Open Space/Parks - This designation includes open spaces which still exist within
the City including parklands, horticultural plots, railroad rights-of-way, flood
control channels, Southern California Edison easements, and small, isolated lots.
Development in this category is limited to uses associated with recreation or
other uses necessary in easements or flood control channels. A Floor Area Ratio
ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 will be allowed for recreational uses.
Public Facilities - The public facilities designation includes a variety of public uses
such as institutional uses (elementary, junior high, and high schools) and
government facilities (city hall, police and fire stations, libraries, etc.). Allowable
                                    11                                   Land Use Element
        development may include a Floor Area Ratio ranging from 0.3 to 0.75.
        Approximately 203 acres have been designated as public facilities (Table 3).
Implications of land Use Policy
The implementation of the land use policy contained in this Element will permit
additional development though this growth will be managed in a manner that is
consistent with citywide goals and objectives. The distribution of land uses citywide is
indicated in Table 3.

1. INTRODUCTION
This document constitutes the 2013-2021 Housing Element of the General Plan. While the
Housing Element is an integral component of the City of Hawthorne General Plan, it covers
a shorter planning horizon (October 15, 2013 through October 15, 2021), compared to the
General Plan.
The Housing Element identifies strategies and programs that focus on:
        Conserving and improving existing affordable housing;
        Providing adequate sites for residential development;
        Assisting in the provision of affordable housing;
        Removing governmental and other constraints to housing development; and
        Promoting equal housing opportunities.
A. Community Context
Established in 1922, the City of Hawthorne is located in the South Bay region of Los Angeles
County, within close proximity to downtown Los Angeles. The City of Hawthorne is a
highly urbanized community of 85,000 residents within a six-mile area. Surrounding
communities include Lawndale to the south, El Segundo to the west, Inglewood and the Los
Angeles County unincorporated area of Lennox to the north, and Gardena to the east.
Nicknamed the “Hub of the South Bay”, Hawthorne is well connected to several regional
transportation systems, including the San Diego (I-405), Harbor (I-110), and Glenn
Anderson (I-105) freeways. No unincorporated islands are located within the City or any
disadvantaged unincorporated communities within the City’s sphere of influence.
Hawthorne experienced the majority of its population and housing growth after World War
II, fueled by rapid growth in the aviation and commercial industries. However, the City
was heavily impacted by the regional recession in the early 1990s that curbed job and
housing growth for much of the decade. However, in spite of the recession, Hawthorne
continued to have a steady increase in population, gaining over 12,000 residents during the
1990s. Between 2000 and 2010, the population increased to close to 85,000.
The ethnic composition of Hawthorne residents has changed since 1990. In 2000, Hispanics
became the largest ethnic group (44 percent) in the City, with the proportion of White
residents decreasing from 31 percent in 1990 to 13 percent. This trend continued in the
2000s. By 2010, a majority (53 percent) of City residents were Hispanic.
Housing in Hawthorne offers a variety of housing types. The majority of homes in
Hawthorne (66 percent) consist of multi-family homes, with 29 percent being comprised of
                                          CITY OF HAWTHORNE | 2013-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                          1
                                                                            February 2014
 

single-family detached homes, and approximately four percent consisting of attached units.1
Between 1990 and 2000, very limited residential development occurred in the City, due in
large part to the recession during the late 199s. As the economy recovered between 2000
and 2006, the housing market in Hawthorne also improved, with major developments being
proposed. However, the market downturn at the end of the last decade yet again
substantially impacted housing growth in the City.
B. Organization of the Housing Element
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
              An analysis of the City’s demographic and housing characteristics and trends
               (Section 2);
              A review of potential market, governmental, and environmental constraints to
               meeting the City’s identified housing needs (Section 3);
              An evaluation of resources available to address the housing needs (Section 4); and
              A housing plan, consisting of goals, policies, and programs, to address the identified
               needs (Section 5).
C. Data Sources
When preparing the Housing Element, various sources of information were consulted. The
2010 Census provides the basis for population and household characteristics. However,
other reliable sources were used to provide an updated description of the community. Data
sources used include the following:
              Census 1990, 2000, and 2010
              American Community Survey, 2007-2011 and 2009-20112
                                                            
1      Attached Unit: This is a one-unit structure that has one or more walls extending from ground to roof
       separating it from adjoining structures. In row houses (sometimes called townhomes), double houses,
       houses attached to nonresidential structures, each house is a separate, attached structure if the dividing or
       common wall goes from ground to roof.
2      According to “American Community Survey – What Researchers Need to Know”, the Census Bureau
       cautions the direct comparison between the American Community Survey (ACS) data and data from the
       previous Censuses, particularly as it relates to income, age, and household characteristics, as different
       methodologies were used or questions were asked in collecting the sample. The most significant difference
       is that the decennial Census is point-in-time data; whereas the ACS is period data. The ACS was developed
       with a sample each year and data presented for 2007-2011 represents an averaging of the sampling results
       over three years. An issue with this methodology is that conditions in 2007 may have been substantially
       different than in 2011, the averaging would “dilute” the data and therefore does not present an accurate
       picture of the conditions. Averaging over these three years would not reflect the sharp changes in
       conditions. Professor Paul Ong of UCLA School of Public Policy cautioned the use of ACS in a recent
       newspaper article. Therefore, ACS data in this report is presented as percentages and used only as
       additional references.

      California Department of Finance housing estimates, 2013
      Housing       market      data     from      www.dqnews.com,          www.realtor.com,
       www.craigslist.org, etc.
      Lending patterns for home purchase and improvements from the Home Mortgage
       Disclosure Act (HMDA) data.
D. Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The 1989 Hawthorne General Plan (as amended) consists of seven elements: 1) Land Use; 2)
Conservation; 3) Housing; 4) Circulation; 5) Safety; 6) Noise; and 7) Open Space/Recreation.
The Housing Element builds upon the other elements and is consistent with the policies and
programs set forth in the General Plan. New State law requires that the Safety and
Conservation Elements include an analysis and policies regarding flood hazard and
management information upon revisions to the Housing Element.
E. Public Participation
The City encourages and solicits the participation of its residents and other local agencies in
the process of identifying housing needs. Development of the Hawthorne Housing Element
involved the following outreach activities.
1. Community Workshop
As part of the Housing Element development, the City conducted a community workshop
on October 28, 2013. In addition to a public notice in the Hawthorne Tribune, the City also
sent a special invitation letter to the following agencies that serve persons of lower and
moderate incomes and/or with special housing needs:

region. Overall the homeless population in the South Bay region has declined slightly in
recent years but shelter beds are still in demand, especially for men. Supportive programs
are also needed to help these men and women transition back to permanent housing
situations.

2. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Assuring the availability of adequate housing for all social and economic sectors of the
City's present and future population is an important goal of the Housing Element. To
implement this goal, the City must target its programs toward those households with the
greatest need. This section of the Housing Element discusses the characteristics of the City's
present and future population and housing stock, in order to better define the nature and
extent of unmet housing needs in the City.
A. Population Characteristics and Trends
Population characteristics affect the type and amount of housing need in a community.
Issues such as population growth, race/ethnicity, age, and employment trends are factors
that combine to influence the type of housing needed and the ability to afford housing.
1. Population Growth
Incorporated in 1922, Hawthorne remained a relatively small community until WWII when
growth in the aviation and aerospace industries has resulted in rapid development and
population growth. Known as the “Cradle of Aviation”, Hawthorne experienced a strong
period of economic prosperity and residential growth that peaked in 1980s (realizing a 26-
percent growth in population). However, the community was heavily impacted by the
severe regional economic recession of the early 1990s, resulting in substantial layoffs in the
aerospace industrial and limited residential investment of much of that decade. Economic
recovery between 2000 and 2006 had brought several major developments to the City.
However, the downturn of the real estate market that began in 2007 and the subsequent
economic recession have again led to a standstill in residential development in the City.
The 2010 Census reported the Hawthorne population to be 84,293, which represented a
negligible increase from the 2000 population of 84,112 (Table 1). The population increase
during the last decade was only extremely limited compared to the robust growth observed
during the 1990s when the number of residents grew by 18 percent. However, the stagnant
population growth in Hawthorne between 2000 and 2010 was similar to the slow growth of
surrounding communities and only slightly less than that experienced countywide.
Due to limited number of vacant parcels available for development, future population
growth in Hawthorne will consist primarily of infill development including replacement of
older homes with new development and reuse of older commercial sites for residential and
mixed-use developments.

2. Age Composition
The age structure of a population is also an important factor in evaluating housing and
community development needs and determining the direction of future housing
development. Typically, each age group has distinct lifestyles, family types and sizes,
incomes, and housing preferences. As people move through each stage of life, housing
needs and preferences change. For example, young householders without children will
have different housing preferences than middle-age householders with children or senior
householders living alone. Consequently, evaluating the age characteristics of a community
is important in determining the housing needs of residents.
Several trends with regard to age characteristics have occurred in the community during
2000s. One of the most dramatic changes was the size of the preschool and school age
children population, which decreased both in proportion and in number from 2000 to 2010.
Collectively, the proportion of children under age 18 decreased 13 percent, representing an
decrease of approximately 3,500 children in the community. This demographic shift was
also apparent in nearby communities and countywide.
In 2000, the median age of Hawthorne residents was 28.7 years, which was lower than the
countywide median age of 32.0 years. According to the 2010 Census, the median age in
Hawthorne increased to 31.5 years and that countywide increased to 34.8 years.
Relative to the surrounding communities, the median age in Hawthorne was significantly
lower. The proportion of residents aged 65 or over in Hawthorne (7.4 percent) was lower
than most neighboring cities, while the proportion of residents under 18 was the highest in
the area (Table 2). These figures indicate that the City has a family-oriented community
with a high proportion of families with children. Single-family housing and larger multi-
family housing is a good fit for the community, based on age demographics.

College age adults (ages 20 to 24) declined slightly in proportion since 2000 and comprised
8.2 percent of the residents in 2010 (Figure 1). This age group typically consists of college
students, recent graduates, or adults who have recently entered the job market and are
seeking affordable housing near employment centers.

The proportion of residents aged 25 to 34 declined approximately 2.5 percentage points,
which was offset by a 2.8-percentage-point increase among the 45 to 54 age cohort. This
slight change in age distribution helps explain the moderate increase in median age and
may be partially attributable to younger households “aging in place.”

Hawthorne’s senior population increased slightly over the last decade, comprising 7.4
percent of all residents by 2010. However, the larger and growing proportion of middle-
aged adults (ages 45 to 64) indicates that the City may have a significant senior population
in the near future. Attention must be paid to the housing needs of older residents who as
they age, may require smaller, more affordable housing near public transportation and
supportive services.
3. Race and Ethnicity
Different racial and ethnic groups often have different household characteristics, income
levels, and cultural backgrounds, which may affect their housing needs and preferences.
Studies have also suggested that different racial and ethnic groups differ in their attitudes
toward and/or tolerance for “housing problems” as defined by the federal Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD), including overcrowding and housing cost
burden.      According to these studies, perceptions regarding housing density and
overcrowding tend to vary between racial and ethnic groups. Cultures that prefer to live
with extended family members are accepting of increased household sizes and
overcrowding. In general, Hispanic and Asian households exhibit a greater propensity than
the White households for living in extended families.
As of 2010, a majority (52 percent) of Hawthorne residents were Hispanic, nearly one-
quarter were Black, 10 percent were White and seven percent were Asian (Figure 2). The
City has become less diverse today compared to in 2000.

This trend of an increasing proportion of Hispanic residents and a decreasing proportion of
White residents between 2000 and 2010 is consistent with the trend exhibited countywide.
The proportion of Hispanic residents in Hawthorne was almost five percentage points
higher than that in the County in 2010, while the proportion of Black residents was
significantly higher in Hawthorne than in the County and most surrounding jurisdictions.
In addition, the proportion of White and Asian residents was generally lower in Hawthorne
than in the County and surrounding jurisdictions (Table 3).

B. Employment Profile
An assessment of the needs of the community must take into consideration the type of
employment held by residents. Incomes associated with different jobs and the number of
workers in a household determines the type and size of housing a household can afford. In
some cases, the types of jobs themselves can affect housing needs and demand (such as in
communities with military installations, college campuses, and seasonal agriculture).
Employment growth typically leads to strong housing demand.
1. Occupation and Wage
The Census provides information about employment, specifically the number of City
residents by industry type, who are employed by businesses either outside or within their
community. As of the 2007-2011 ACS, sales and office occupations employed the largest
share of City residents, accounting for nearly one third of resident employment (Table 4),
while service occupations accounted for 25.6 percent and management/professional
occupations accounted for approximately 22.0 percent of the total employment. Together,
these three sectors accounted for nearly three quarters of resident employment. Although in
aggregate, these three sectors accounted for a similar proportion of the employment
countywide, Hawthorne had a higher proportion of residents employed in sales/office and
service occupations, which tend to be lower-paying, and a lower proportion in
management/professional occupations, which tended to be higher-paying. The average
wage for a sales/office and service occupation in 2013 ranged from approximately $38,000
to $41,000 compared to more than $75,000 for management/business/science/arts

C. Household Characteristics
The Census defines a household as all persons who occupy a housing unit, which may
include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or blood, and
unrelated individuals living together. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes,
dormitories, or other group living situations are not considered households. Information on
household characteristics is important to understand the growth and changing needs of a
community.
1. Household Type
Housing needs vary among the household types. Seniors or young adults typically
comprise the majority of the single-person households and tend to reside in apartment
units, condominiums, or smaller single-family homes. Families often prefer single-family
homes. According to the Census, 28,486 households lived in Hawthorne in 2010.
Approximately 69 percent of households were families and a majority of families had
children (Table 5). Between 2000 and 2010, household types remained virtually unchanged
in Hawthorne.

2. Household Size
Household size identifies sources of population growth and household overcrowding. A
community's average household size will increase over time if there is a trend towards
larger families. In a community where the population is aging, the average household size
may decline.
According to the 2000 Census, the average household size in Hawthorne (2.98) was the same
as the countywide average household size, but higher than the majority of the surrounding
communities (Figure 3). The average household size in Hawthorne decreased slightly since
the 2000 Census, with an average of 2.94 persons per household as of 2010. Average
household size in Hawthorne is comparable to that in the County, substantially below that
in the City of Lawndale but much higher than in Redondo Beach or Manhattan Beach.

Household size can vary among different ethnic groups and tenure. In 2010, Hispanic
households in Hawthorne had a significantly greater average household size than other
ethnic groups, regardless of tenure. Black households (average 2.31 persons per household)
had the smallest household size among all ethnic/racial groups, followed by Asian
households (2.91 persons).
3. Household Income
Household income is an important consideration when evaluating housing and community
development needs because lower income typically constrains a household's ability to
secure adequate housing or services. While housing choices, such as tenure (owning versus
renting) and location of residences are very much income-dependent, household size and
type often affect the proportion of income that can be spent on housing.
According to the 2007-2011 ACS, the median household income of Hawthorne residents was
approximately $45,600, which was lower than the County median of $56,000 (Table 6). The
distribution of households among the income levels was skewed toward the lower incomes;
more than half (54 percent) of households earned less than $50,000 and 24 percent earned
more than $75,000. In contrast, approximately 45 percent of County residents earned less
than $50,000 and 38 percent earned more than $75,000.

The State and Federal government classify household income into several groupings based
upon the relationship to the County Area Median Income (AMI), adjusted for household
size. The State of California utilizes the following income groups:
       Extremely Low              0-30% AMI
       Very Low                   31-50% AMI
       Low                        51-80% AMI
       Moderate                   81-120% AMI
       Above Moderate             120%+ AMI

Between 2005 and 2009, approximately half (49 percent) of households had incomes in
moderate and above income level and half (50 percent) of the City was made up of low
income households (Table 7).

D. Persons with Special Housing Needs
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty in finding decent and
affordable housing due to their special needs. Special circumstances may be related to one’s
employment and income, family characteristics, disability, and household characteristics,
among other factors. Consequently, certain residents may experience a higher prevalence of
housing cost burden, overcrowding, or other housing problems.
“Special needs” groups include the following: senior households, large households, female-
headed households, persons with disabilities, agricultural workers, residents living below
the poverty level, and the homeless (Table 8).This section provides a detailed discussion of
the housing needs facing each particular group as well as programs and services available to
address their housing needs.

      1. Senior Households
      Seniors households can have special needs resulting from four main concerns: limited and
      often fixed income; poor health and associated high health care costs; mobility limitation
      and transit dependency; and high costs of housing.
      In 2010, seniors (age 65+) comprised 7.5 percent of Hawthorne residents and 12.5 percent of
      Hawthorne households were headed by seniors. Approximately half of senior-headed
      households owned homes, while half were renters (Table 8). Housing cost burden was the
      most common housing problem for senior households, with approximately 59 percent of all
      senior renter-households being impacted. Housing cost burden was less common but still
      prevalent among senior owner-households, with approximately 37 percent of households
      being impacted.
      Aside from cost burden issues faced by seniors due to their relatively fixed incomes, many
      seniors are faced with various disabilities. Nearly 39 percent of the senior population in
      Hawthorne was listed as having one or more disabilities by the 2009-2011 ACS, and senior
      residents comprised 33 percent of all persons with disabilities. Among these disabilities, the
      most common were ambulatory and independent living difficulties.
      For senior residents that require assisted care, there are currently six State-licensed
      residential care facilities for the elderly in the City with a total capacity of 171 beds. Housing
      Choice Voucher assistance is also available for extremely low and very low income senior

households. As of September of 2013, the City provided rent subsidies to 585 households
and an additional 539 are ported in from LA County and the City of Los Angeles for a total
of 1,124. Of these, 252 were utilized by seniors. In addition, the Hawthorne Senior Center
provides referral services and a Meals-on-Wheels program.
2. Large Households
Large households (with five or more members) are identified as a group with special
housing needs based on the limited availability of adequately sized, affordable housing
units.    Large households are often of lower income, frequently resulting in the
overcrowding of smaller dwelling units and in turn, accelerated unit deterioration.
Approximately 18.1 percent of Hawthorne households had five or more members in 2010.
Among large households, roughly 63 percent were renters while only 37 percent owned
their units. There are a large proportion of multi-family residential units (65 percent) in
Hawthorne, which are generally smaller than single-family homes.                    However, in
Hawthorne, rental units with three or more bedrooms accounted for 42 percent of all
housing units, according to the 2000 Census. This means that there is a large supply of
adequately sized rental units for large families in the City. Despite that, 84 percent of all
large renter-households in the City suffered from housing problems, according to CHAS
data. Large households can benefit from the City’s Housing Choice Voucher program.
3. Single-Parent Households
Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance because of their
greater need for day care, health care, and other facilities. Female-headed households with
children in particular tend to have lower incomes, thus limiting housing availability for this
group.
Approximately 12.7 percent of all households in the City were headed by single female
parents in 2010;. According to the 2007-2011 ACS, approximately 34 percent of female-
headed households with children had incomes below the poverty level. The City’s Housing
Choice Voucher assistance can benefit female-headed households. Among recipients, 900
female-headed households were assisted through the Housing Choice Voucher program.
4. Persons with Disabilities
Disability is a physical or mental condition that substantially limits one or more major life
activity. Physical disabilities can hinder access to housing units of conventional design, as
well as limit the ability to earn adequate income.
The 2010 Census did not collect information on disability. According to 2009-2011 ACS
data, approximately eight percent of Hawthorne residents had a disability (Table 9). The
ACS also tallied the number of disabilities by type for residents with one or more disabilities
(Table 10). Among the disabilities tallied, ambulatory (27 percent), cognitive (21 percent),
and independent living (21 percent) difficulties were the most prevalent. The types of
disabilities experienced varied depending on the age of the disabled person. Specifically,

cognitive disabilities were the most common disability affecting disabled person ages five to
17, afflicting 31 percent of the disabled persons in this age group. Meanwhile, ambulatory
difficulties were the most likely to affect older disabled persons.
The most obvious housing need for persons with disabilities is housing that is adapted to
their needs. Most older single-family homes are inaccessible to people with mobility and
sensory limitations. Housing may not be adaptable to widened doorways and hallways,
access ramps, larger bathrooms, lowered countertops, and other features necessary for
accessibility. Location of housing is also an important factor for many persons with
disabilities, as they often rely upon public transportation to travel to necessary services and
shops.

                  Note: A person can report more than one disability and therefore, the total
                  number of disabilities tallied far exceeds the number of disabled persons.
Developmental Disabilities
A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss the housing needs of
persons with developmental disabilities. As defined by the Section 4512 of the Welfare and
Institutions Code, “developmental disability” means “a disability that originates before an
individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and
constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. As defined by the California Director
of Developmental Services, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Instruction,
this term shall include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term
shall also include disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to
require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but shall
not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.” This
definition also reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance
that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S.
Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage of the
population that can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. This generally
equates to 1,264 persons in the City of Hawthorne with developmental disabilities, based on
                                                    CITY OF HAWTHORNE | 2013-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT

the 2010 Census population.                 However, according to the State’s Department of
Developmental Services, as of November 2012, between 802 and 946 residents with
developmental disabilities living within the 90250 zip code (which approximates the
Hawthorne City Limits) were being assisted at the Westside Regional Center. Most of these
individuals are under the age of 18 and reside in a private home with their parent of
guardian (Table 11).

Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group
living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals
may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are
provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
Several factors limit the supply of housing for persons with disabilities, including
affordability, accessibility, location, and discrimination. The most obvious housing need for
persons with disabilities is housing that is adapted to their needs. Most single-family homes
are inaccessible to people with mobility and sensory limitations. Housing may not be
adaptable to widened doorways and hallways, access ramps, larger bathrooms, lowered
countertops and other features necessary for accessibility. The cost of retrofitting a home
often prohibits homeownership, even for individuals or families who could otherwise afford
a home. Furthermore, some providers of basic home buying services do not have offices or
materials that are accessible to people with mobility, visual or hearing impairments.
Location of housing is also an important factor for many persons with disabilities, as they
often rely upon public transportation. As of 2013, 431 disabled households were receiving
Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance in the City of Hawthorne.

5. Agricultural Workers
Agricultural workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are
earned through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farm laborers work in
the fields, processing plants, or support activities on a generally year-round basis. When
workload increases during harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal
labor, often supplied by a labor contractor. For some crops, farms may employ migrant
workers, defined as those whose travel distance to work prevents them from returning to
their primary residence every evening.
According to the 2007-2011 ACS, 69 Hawthorne residents were employed in agriculture,
forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining occupations, representing 0.2 percent of the City’s
population. Hawthorne is an urbanized community with no parcels zoned for agricultural
use. Because so few residents are employed in agricultural occupations and there is little
potential for this occupational category to expand within the City, the overall housing
programs and policies to facilitate development of affordable housing can address the needs
of Hawthorne residents employed in the agricultural occupations.
6. Homeless
According to HUD, a person is considered homeless if he/she is not imprisoned and:
       Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence;
       The primary nighttime residence is a publicly or privately operated shelter designed
        for temporary living arrangements;
       The primary residence is an institution that provides a temporary residence for
        individuals that should otherwise be institutionalized; or
       The primary residence is a public or private place not designed for or ordinarily
        used as a regular sleeping accommodation.
According to the homeless population count conducted by the Los Angeles Homeless
Services Authority (LAHSA) in January 2013, of the homeless counted within Hawthorne,
20 were unsheltered. Based on this information there is an unmet need of 20 homeless
shelter beds in Hawthorne.
No emergency shelters are located within the City of Hawthorne. However, St. Margaret’s
Center, located within the Lennox area of Los Angeles County, provides emergency support
services including hot lunches, case management, and food and hygiene supplies for the
homeless and low income families. St. Margaret’s Center serves communities near LAX,
including Hawthorne and Inglewood.

E. Housing Stock Characteristics
A community’s housing stock is defined as the collection of all housing units located within
the jurisdiction. The characteristics of the housing stock, including growth, type, age and
condition, tenure, vacancy rates, costs, and affordability are important in determining the
housing needs for the community. This section details the housing stock characteristics of
Hawthorne in an attempt to identify how well the current housing stock meets the needs of
current and future residents of the City.
1. Housing Unit Growth and Type
Hawthorne has experienced relatively little housing growth since 1990. The housing stock
grew by approximately one percent between 1990 and 2000, and one percent between 2000
and 2013 (Figure 4). Although the limited vacant land in the City presents a constraint to
housing development, reuse of abandoned commercial properties present an opportunity
for development. Future housing growth in the City is likely to come as a result of reuse of
former commercial or industrial land.
In 2013, single-family homes comprised approximately one third of the housing stock, while
multi-family units comprised nearly two thirds and less than one percent of the housing
stock consisted of mobile homes (Table 12). The distribution of housing units among the
unit types experienced little change between 2000 and 2013, as the total number of housing
units increased only minimally during this period (453 units). The vacancy rate increased
slightly from 3.7 percent in 2000 to 4.7 percent in 2013.

2. Housing Age and Condition
Typically, housing over 30 years in age is more likely to have major rehabilitation needs that
may include new plumbing, roof repairs, foundation work and other repairs. According to
the 2013 Department of Finance and 2000 Census data, approximately three quarters of
housing units in Hawthorne were constructed prior to 1980 (Figure 5) and therefore are of
sufficient age to be highly susceptible to deterioration. The age of the City’s housing stock
indicates a potentially significant need for continued code enforcement, property
maintenance and housing rehabilitation programs to stem housing deterioration. The City
estimates that approximately five to ten percent of the Hawthorne’s housing stock is
deteriorated and between 25 and 50 units are dilapidated and require replacement.

3. Housing Tenure
The tenure distribution of a community's housing stock (owner versus renter) is an indicator
of several aspects of the housing market, including the affordability of units, household
stability and residential mobility. Tenure distribution generally correlates with household
income, composition, and age of the householder.
The 2007-2011 ACS reported that Hawthorne’s homeownership rate remained unchanged
since 2000 with one-quarter of the housing units in Hawthorne were owner-occupied, while
70 percent were renter-occupied (Table 13). According to Table 14, owner-households had a
higher average household size than renters, which results from the higher proportion of
large households (five or more members).

4. Housing Vacancy
A certain number of vacant units are needed to moderate the cost of housing, allow
sufficient choice for residents, and provide an incentive for unit upkeep and repair.
Specifically, vacancy rates of two to three percent for ownership housing and five to six
percent for rental housing are generally considered optimal to balance demand and supply
for housing.
The 2000 Census reported the ownership housing vacancy rate at 1.4 percent, while the
rental vacancy rate was 3.3 percent. According to the Department of Finance, the overall
vacancy rate in Hawthorne was 5.6 percent in 2013. The recent credit crisis in the subprime
mortgage market and subsequent economic downturn contributed to increased vacancy
rates between 2000 and 2013.
5. Housing Costs and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems in a community. If
housing costs are relatively high in comparison to household income, there will be a
correspondingly higher prevalence of housing cost burden and overcrowding. This section
summarizes the cost and affordability of the housing stock to Hawthorne residents.
Homeownership Market
According to DataQuick3, the home prices in Hawthorne are generally higher than the
communities of Gardena, Inglewood and Lawndale, but lower than the nearby beach
communities (Table 15). Compared to one year ago, median single-family home price in
Hawthorne increased by 30 percent and median condominium price increased close to 15
percent. Substantial increases in median sales price were also observed in some zip codes
within Gardena and Inglewood, indicating a recovering housing market in the region.

However, the increases in median home/condominium prices can be misleading. Because
of the credit crunch, the current economic conditions, many of the homes sold in the past
few years were foreclosures or short-sales at the lower end of the price scale. A portion of
the increases in median prices can be attributable to the types of homes sold, rather than a
true increase in home values, although that can be a significant factor as well.

Rental Market
With renters comprising nearly three quarters of the City’s households, it is important to
understand the rental market in Hawthorne. According to information published on rental
websites, rental prices range from $675 for a studio apartment to $2,850 for a four-bedroom
unit in August 2013 (Table 16).

Housing Affordability by Household Income
Housing affordability is dependent upon income and housing costs. Using set income
guidelines, current housing affordability can be estimated. According to the HCD income
guidelines for 2013, the Area Median Income (AMI) in Los Angeles County was $59,800
(adjusted for household size). Assuming that the potential homebuyer has sufficient credit
and down payment (10 percent) and spends no greater than 30 to 35 percent of their income
on housing expenses (i.e. mortgage, taxes and insurance), the maximum affordable home
price and rental price can be determined. The maximum affordable home and rental prices
for residents of Los Angeles County are shown in Table 17. Households in the lower end of
each category can afford less by comparison than those at the upper end. The income-
affordability of the housing stock for each income group is discussed below.
Based on the home prices and rental rates presented in Table 15 and Table 16 earlier,
extremely low and very low income households are not able to afford rental housing or
purchase a home in Hawthorne without incurring a cost burden. Small low income
households (three persons or less) could afford to rent one and two bedroom units;
however, affordable options for larger low income households are more limited. Moderate
income households could afford a wide range of adequately-sized rental units. Moderate
income      households       may      also   be     able  to    afford     to    purchase   small
condominiums/townhomes. However, single-family homes are beyond the financial means
of most moderate income households.
This Housing Element includes a variety of programs designed to improve the adequacy
and affordability of housing and to assist renters and homeowners who cannot afford
housing (see Section 5, Housing Plan).

F. Project-Based Rental Housing Assistance
Housing that receives governmental assistance is often a significant source of affordable
housing in many communities. Because of its significance, this section identifies publicly
assisted rental housing in Hawthorne, evaluates the potential of such housing to convert to
market rates during a ten-year planning period (2013 to 2023), and analyzes the cost to
preserve those units. Specifically, State law requires the following:
       An inventory of restricted low-income housing projects in the City and their
        potential for conversion;
       An analysis of the costs of preserving and/or replacing the units "at risk" and a
        comparison of these costs;
       An analysis of the organizational and financial resources available for preserving
        and/or replacing the units "at risk"; and
       Programs for preserving the "at risk" units.
1. Inventory of Affordable Housing and At-Risk Status
         
Table 18 presents an inventory of the City’s affordable housing projects. These include two
senior housing projects developed by TELACU, projects owned and operated by Access
Community Housing and National CORE (formerly Southern California Housing
Development Corporation). In 2008, the City’s former Redevelopment Agency utilized
Housing Set-Aside funds to purchase a number of housing units and set aside those units as
affordable housing for seniors, families, and persons with disabilities. As state law (ABx1),
and the California Supreme Court case interpreting it, dissolved redevelopment agencies
statewide effective February 1, 2012, ownership/management of these units has been
transferred to the Hawthorne Housing Authority. The affected units include:
       11605 Gale Avenue - 10 units, senior housing, very low income
       11529 Gale Avenue - 12 units, families, moderate income
       11537 Gale Avenue - 5 units, families, low income
       12529 Truro Avenue – 3 units, families, very low income families
The front house at Truro Avenue is rented to Behavioral Health Services as a group home
for women transitioning from their residential facility.
In addition, the City also provided HOME funds for Moneta Gardens Improvement, Inc. to
purchase 12501 Kornblum Avenue, providing seven units low income family housing with a
15-year restriction.

a. As of the writing of this Housing Element, no Notice of Intent to opt out of the Section 8 program has been filed so the
    Section 8 contract is assumed to be renewed for another year to 2014. However, HUD database maintained by
    headquarters in DC has not been updated to reflect the current status of these two contracts.

2. Preservation and Replacement Options
Two projects are potentially at risk of converting to market rate during the planning period
of this at-risk housing analysis (July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2023) – TELACU Gardens and
TELACU Terrace. Since both TELACU projects are nonprofit owned, the most feasible
options to preserve the affordability of these units are: 1) providing additional financial
assistance in lump sum to enhance the self-sufficiency of project; and 1) providing rental
assistance to tenants using funding sources other than Section 8 Project Based Assistance.
Provision of Additional Financial Assistance
One option to preserve the affordability of the two TELACU projects is to provide
additional financial assistance to these projects so the project financing can be self-sustaining
in the long term even without the Section 8 Project Based Assistance. Assistance could
include writing down the interest rate on the remaining loan balance or providing a lump
sum assistance to either reduce or eliminate the remaining loan balance.
Rent Subsidy
Another option to preserving the affordability of the two TELACU projects is to replace the
Section 8 Project Based Assistance with a different funding source to provide rent subsidies
for the units. The level of the subsidy required to preserve the at-risk affordable housing is
estimated to equal the Fair Market Rent for a unit minus the housing cost affordable by a
very low income household. Table 19 shows the rent subsidies required for the TELACU
projects. As shown, subsidizing the two projects would require approximately $650,000
annually, an average of $383 per unit per month.

Average subsidy per unit for each project is estimated with the following assumptions:
    1. Both TELACU projects are comprised of studio or 1-bedroom units. A household size of one person is used.
    2. Based on 2013 AMI in Los Angeles County, affordable monthly housing cost for a one-person very low income
         household (excluding utility allowance) is $672 (see Table 17.)
    3. Vacancy rate of 5%.
    4. HUD 2013 Fair Market Rents in Los Angeles County are $911 for a studio unit and $1,101 for a 1-bedroom unit.

Replacement
In general, when a project is for-profit owned and the community is unable to preserve the
affordability of the units via preservation options, new construction of affordable housing is
a costly, but alternative means of providing affordable housing to households in need.
However, given that both TELACU projects are required by the use permits issued by the
City to maintain as affordable housing in perpetuity, the physical units are not at risk, only
the ongoing subsidies. Therefore, construction of replacement units is not a necessary or
feasible option.
G. Housing Problems
The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) developed by the Census for
HUD provides detailed information on housing needs by income level for different types of
households in Hawthorne. Detailed CHAS data is displayed in Table 20. Housing
problems considered by CHAS include:
       Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom);
       Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person per room);
       Housing cost burden (overpayment), including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of
        gross income; or
       Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50 percent of gross
        income.
The types of problems vary according to household income, type, and tenure. In general,
owner-households had a higher level of housing problems (52 percent) compared to renter-
households (45 percent). Large renter-families had the highest level of housing problems
regardless of income level (84 percent).

     1. Cost Burden (Overpayment)
     State and federal standards for housing cost burden (also known as overpayment) are based
     on an income-to-housing cost ratio of 30 percent and above. Households paying more than
     30 percent of their income on housing have limited remaining income for other necessities.
     Above moderate income households generally are capable of paying a larger proportion of
     income for housing; therefore, estimates of housing cost burden generally focus on lower
     and moderate income households. Below are some highlights:
               Very low income households had the highest incidence of housing problems (89
                percent), compared to 87 percent of extremely low income households.
               Extremely low income households had the highest incidence (at 76 percent) of severe
                housing cost burden (paying 50 percent or more of income on housing), compared to
                28 percent of very low income households and nine percent of low income
                households.
               Among the extremely low income households, severe housing cost burden was most
                prevalent among small renter-households.

2. Overcrowding
An overcrowded housing unit is defined as a unit occupied by more than one person per
room.4 Overcrowding can result when there are not enough adequately sized units within a
community, when high housing costs relative to income force too many individuals to share
a housing unit than it can adequately accommodate, and/or when families reside in smaller
units than they need in order to devote income to other necessities, such as food and health
care. Overcrowding also tends to accelerate the normal wear and tear, resulting in
deterioration of housing. Therefore, maintaining a reasonable level of occupancy and
alleviating overcrowding are critical to enhancing quality of life for residents and aesthetic
quality of neighborhoods.
As reported by the 2012 ACS, 5,558 (19.4 percent) of the Hawthorne households were living
in overcrowded conditions, with renters being disproportionately affected by overcrowding
(4,558 or 21.2 percent of renter-households and 1,000 or 14.0 percent of owner-households).
This high proportion of overcrowding can be the result of several factors, including a
limited supply of large rental units, high housing costs relative to household income, and
differing perceptions among racial and ethnic groups regarding overcrowding.
According to the 2007-2011 ACS, approximately 88 percent of renter-occupied housing units
had three or fewer rooms, in contrast to approximately 21 percent of owner-occupied units.
This large proportion of smaller rental units is a contributing factor to overcrowding,
particularly for large renter-households.
                                                            
4      The Census Bureau’s definition of a “room” excludes bathroom, porch, balcony, foyer, hall, or half-room.

3. HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
Although the City of Hawthorne strives to ensure the provision of adequate and affordable
housing to meet the needs of the community, many factors can constrain the development,
maintenance, and improvement of housing.               These include market mechanisms,
government regulations and policies, and infrastructure and environmental constraints.
This section addresses these potential constraints that may affect the supply and cost of
housing in Hawthorne.
A. Market Constraints
Locally and regionally there are several constraints that hinder the City’s ability to
accommodate the community’s affordable housing demand. The high cost of land, rising
development costs, and neighborhood opposition make it expensive for developers to build
affordable housing. These constraints may result in housing that is not affordable to lower
and moderate income households, or may render residential construction economically
infeasible for developers.
1. Land and Development Costs
High development costs in the region stifle potential affordable housing developments.
Construction costs for residential units have increased rapidly over the last decade,
particularly the price of land and extensive entitlements costs. Furthermore, neighborhood
resistance to some developments lengthens development timeframes, driving up costs for
holding the property. The difficulty of developing small, infill sites can also constrain
housing development in built out communities such as Hawthorne.
Reduction in amenities and the quality of building materials (above a minimum
acceptability for health, safety, and adequate performance) could lower costs and associated
sales prices or rents. In addition, prefabricated factory-built homes may provide lower
priced housing options by reducing construction and labor costs. Another factor related to
construction costs is the number of units built at one time. As the number of units in a
single development project increases, overall costs generally decrease due to economies of
scale.
The price of raw land and any necessary improvements is a key component of the total cost
of housing. The diminishing supply of land available for residential construction combined
with a fairly steady demand for housing has served to keep the cost of land high. High and
rapidly increasing land costs have resulted in home builders developing increasingly
expensive homes in order to capture profits. According to the MLS database, only one
vacant parcel was listed for sale in Hawthorne in August 2013. The 0.33-acre lot is zoned for
multi-family uses (R-3) and could accommodate up to five units. The lot is listed for
$600,000, or $40 per-square foot and $120,000 per potential new dwelling unit.

                                                                           February 2014
 

2. Availability of Mortgage Financing
Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to
disclose information on the disposition of loan applications and the income, gender, and
race of loan applicants. The data for Hawthorne were complied by census tract and
aggregated to the area that generally approximates the City boundaries.
Lending
Overall, 2,558 households applied for mortgages in Hawthorne in 2012 (Table 21).  Of  the 
applications  for  conventional  and  government‐backed  home  mortgages,  69  percent  were 
approved.  There were few home improvement loan applications and a 49 percent approval 
rating.    However,  more  than  one‐third  of  the  applicants  were  denied  home  improvement 
loans.    Refinance  loans  were  the  most  prevalent  in  2012  with  1,708  applications.    This  is 
likely  due  to  a  prevalence  of  adjustable  rate  mortgages  and  historically  low  interest  rates 
that create an incentive for people to refinance in order to obtain a lower, fixed interest rate.  
Approximately 65 percent of refinance loans were approved and 15 percent were denied.

Foreclosures
Between 2000 and 2005, with low interest rates, “creative” financing (e.g., zero down,
interest only, adjustable loans), and predatory lending practices (e.g. aggressive marketing,
hidden fees, negative amortization), many households purchased homes that were beyond
their financial means. Under the false assumptions that refinancing to lower interest rates
would always be an option and home prices would continue to rise at double-digit rates,
many households were (and still are) unprepared for the hikes in interest rates, expiration of
short-term fixed rates, and the decline in sales prices that set off in 2006. Suddenly faced
with significantly inflated mortgage payments, and mortgage loans that are larger than the
worth of the homes, many had to resort to foreclosing their homes.
In Los Angeles County, 5,525 homeowners filed Notices of Default (NODs) in the second
quarter of 2012, compared to 10,568 NODs filed during the same period in the previous year

(a 48-percent decrease).5 Foreclosures also declined substantially (54 percent) between the
second quarter of 2012 and the following year. The steep decline in NOD filings and
foreclosures may indicate that the real estate lending market is stabilizing from the sudden
downturn that occurred with the implosion of the mortgage lending market in 2008.
In Hawthorne, 64 properties were listed in pre-foreclosure sales (with mortgage payments
in default), 42 properties were being auctioned, and 62 were bank-owned properties listed
for sale in October 2013.6 More than 20 of the homes in pre-foreclosure sales were listed for
well above $400,000, indicating foreclosures in Hawthorne are impacting also above
moderate income households.
B. Governmental Constraints
Policies of the City can have an impact on the price and availability of housing in
Hawthorne. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, building codes, fees, and
other local programs to improve the overall quality of housing may serve as constraints to
housing development. The following public policies can affect overall housing availability,
adequacy, and affordability.
1. Land Use Controls
General Plan and Zoning
The Hawthorne General Plan and Zoning Ordinance provide for a range of residential land
use designations/zones in the City. The City amended its General Plan and Zoning
Ordinance in 2011 to create a Mixed Use Overlay and to increase the density of the R-4 zone
to allow developments up to 30 units per acre. With these recent changes, the City offers the
following:
              Low Density Residential (R-1): 1-8 dwelling units/acre; single-family dwelling
               units; minimum 5,000 square feet lot;
              Medium Density Residential(R-2): 8.1-12 dwelling units/acre; single-
               family/duplex/double units; allows two units on minimum 5,000 square feet lot;
              High Density Residential: (R-3): 12-17.1 units/acre, multi-family units, minimum
               lot size of 5,000 square feet;
              Maximum Density Residential: (R-4): 17.1-30 units/acre, multi-family units,

Specific Plans
The City of Hawthorne has implemented specific plans in order to incorporate new uses in
various parts of the City. There are no set densities or floor area ratios in specific plan areas.
Instead, the number of approved housing units is the overriding density control. Five
specific plans are in effect:
        The Prestige Villa Specific Plan is located on Grevillea Avenue and 116th Street. It
         is zoned for single-family residential uses. All entitlements have been approved for
         116 for-sale single-family detached housing units and construction has not yet
         begun.
        The Willow Glen Specific Plan is located along Aviation Boulevard and converts
         13.93 acres into a residential condominium development. A total of 285 for sale
         townhouse units have been completed on the site.
        The Pacific Glen Specific Plan provides for the development of a residential
         condominium project on approximately 39.24 acres of land that was formerly part of
         the Los Angeles Air Force Base. A total of 625 for-sale residential units are currently
         under construction.
        The Primavera Courts Specific Plan is located on Hawthorne Boulevard and is
         zoned for 171 for-sale residential units and commercial uses in mixed use buildings.
         The entitlements have all been approved and construction has not yet begun.
        The Central Park Specific Plan is zoned for commercial and residential mixed use.
         It is located at 120th Street and Van Ness Avenue. A Target was completed and
         opened for business in 2008 and 175 for sale residential units have been approved
         but construction has not yet begun on the residential component.
The City is currently in the process of preparing a specific plan for the City’s downtown.
The Downtown Hawthorne Specific Plan. The City received a Strategic Growth Council
Planning Grant to fund the plan creation. The Project Area is comprised of Hawthorne
Boulevard, Imperial Highway and the residential blocks that are within one-quarter mile of
these major arterials. The future transformation of a dilapidated and under-utilized section
of this 1920s town will give its residents a “city center” by stimulating environmentally
sensitive development, encouraging alternative forms of travel, and providing jobs and
affordable housing to this economically disadvantaged community. 
2. Residential Development Standards
The City’s Zoning Ordinance contains development standards for each zoning                district
consistent with the land use designations of the General Plan. The Hawthorne              Zoning
Ordinance establishes residential development standards for each zone to ensure           quality
development in the community. Development criteria, as specified in the                   Zoning

Ordinance, are presented in Table 22. These development standards are typical and
consistent with standards established in surrounding communities.

Lot Dimensions, Size, and Coverage
Minimum lot area in all residential zones is 5,000 square feet with identical lot dimensions of 50
feet wide by 100 feet deep. The maximum lot coverage of 50 percent for R-1 and R-2, 60 percent
for R-3, and 60-80 percent R-4 provides for adequate yard space and common space in multi-
family developments. The common open space requirement is significant at 500 square feet per
unit, except in the MU Overlay. However, in the R-4 zone, a developer is able to use the non-
street facing side and rear setbacks to fulfill the open space requirements. Maximum lot coverage
for multi-family developments in Hawthorne is comparable to those in neighboring cities:

Gardena (50-75 percent lot coverage depending on district) and El Segundo (50-53 percent lot
coverage depending on district).
Density
A range of densities is permitted in residential zones. Density levels range from one to eight
units per acre in the single-family (R-1) zone, to 17.4 units per acre in the R-3 zone, and 30 units
per acre in the R-4 zone and Mixed Use (MU) Overlay. Specifically, the Zoning Ordinance
indicates that the calculation of allowable units R-4 and MU Overlay is based on the applying the
permitted density on the entire project site.
In addition to these density provisions, the City complies with the State density bonus law
for housing projects that provide a portion of the units to lower and moderate income
households.  A density bonus up to 35 percent over the otherwise maximum allowable
residential density under the applicable zoning district is available to projects that include
an affordable housing component. Developers of affordable housing are also entitled to at
least one regulatory concession or development incentive.
Height Limits
The Zoning Ordinance allows for up to five stories (60 feet) for mixed use developments in the
MU Overlay and four stories (50 feet) for high density residential uses in the R-4 zone. These
height limits adequately accommodate the densities permitted in these zones.
Unit Size
To facilitate housing developments, the City amended the Zoning Ordinance in 2011 to offer
minimum unit sizes that vary by the type of housing and number of bedrooms. These
minimum unit size requirements are typical and can facilitate a range of housing types in
the City. The minimum unit size standards are established to facilitate the inclusion of
smaller units in the R-4 and MU Overlay areas.

Open Space
Previously, for multi-family residential development, the City required 200 square feet of private
open space and 300 space feet of common open space. The City amended the Zoning Ordinance
in 2012 to combine the open space requirements to 500 square feet, allowing developers the
flexibility to address the open space requirements through a combination of private and common
spaces.
Parking Requirements
All residential uses are required to provide the number of parking spaces as specified in Table
24, with the exception of secondary dwelling units, which require no additional parking if the
primary unit has a two-car garage and neither unit has more than four bedrooms. The City has
provisions to waive or reduce the parking requirements for projects that include affordable
housing units, and also allows for parking reductions for senior housing developments. A
parking reduction is also available through the CUP process for housing for persons with
disabilities. Moreover, affordable housing developments that are eligible for a density bonus
pursuant to Government Code Section 65919-65918 are eligible to use parking standards
established by State law.

Multi-family development is not permitted in the City’s R-2 zone. Multi-family housing in the R-
3 zone (up to 17.4 units per acre) is intended for low-medium density development. Unit sizes in
the R-2 and R-3 zones are typically larger because of the lower intensities. Therefore, parking
requirements in these zones are higher than in the City’s high density residential zones (R-4 and
MU), but are appropriate for the types of housing typical in these zones. Furthermore, most of
the City’s R-2 and R-3 areas are fully developed. Future residential development is expected to
occur primarily in the new R-4 and MU Overlay zones, as well as through the specific plan
process.
In 2011, the City amended the Zoning Ordinance to facilitate high density residential and mixed
use developments at a density of up to 30 units per acre. In the R-4 and MU zones, the parking
requirements for multi-family housing were revised to a maximum of two spaces per unit for the
larger units. Smaller (efficiency, bachelor, and one-bedroom) units require only one space per
unit. Shared guest parking is also allowed for mixed use developments.
3. Provision for a Variety of Housing
State housing element law specifies that jurisdictions identify adequate sites to be made
available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the
development of various types of housing for all economic segments of the population.
Table 25 summarizes the housing types permitted and conditionally permitted under the
Zoning Ordinance.

Single-Family Housing
Single-family housing is permitted by right in all residentially zoned districts of the City as
well as the MU and C-1 districts. Single-family dwellings must abide by the varying
development standards of each zone.
Duplex Housing
A duplex is generally defined as a two-unit housing structure with separate entrances for
each unit. According to the California Department of Finance, about four percent of all
housing units in the City of Hawthorne are duplex units. Duplex units are permitted in the
R-2, R-3 and R-4 zones which are prevalent throughout the City.
Multi-Family Housing
As of January 2013, multi-family housing units constituted approximately 66 percent of
Hawthorne’s housing stock.                     The Zoning Ordinance provides for multi-family
developments in the R-3, R-4, and Mixed Use (MU) Overlay zones. Multi-family uses in R-3
are permitted with approval of a Conditional Use Permit (CUP). Because the City is already
densely developed, the CUP process is in place to ensure compatibility with existing uses.
In March 2012, the Hawthorne City Council approved an amendment to the Zoning
Ordinance to permit multi-family housing in the R-4 and MU Overlay zones as a permitted
use.
Live/Work Units
With the adoption of the MU Overlay, the City also makes provisions for live/work units.
Live/work units are intended for owner-occupants to operate its small business within the
designated commercial square footage of the unit.

Manufactured Housing/Mobile Homes
Manufactured housing and mobile homes offer an affordable housing option to many low
and moderate income households. According to the California Department of Finance,
there are 147 mobile homes in the City. The City allows manufactured housing constructed
after July 1, 1976 and placed on a permanent foundation by right in all residential zones.
Residential Care Facilities
The Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (Lanterman Act) sets out the rights
and responsibilities of persons with developmental disabilities. The Lanterman Act impacts
local zoning ordinances by requiring the use of property for the care of six or fewer disabled
persons to be classified as a residential use under zoning. A State-authorized, certified or
licensed family care home, foster home or a group home serving six or fewer disabled persons
or dependent and neglected children on a 24-hour-a day basis must be considered a residential
use that is permitted in all residential zones.
In Hawthorne, residential care homes serving up to six persons is permitted by right in all
residential zones and in the C-1 zone. As single-family housing is permitted by right in the
MU zone, residential care facilities serving six of fewer persons should be treated in the same
manner. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to define a small residential care home as
a single-family residential use and therefore permitted by right as such in the MU zone.
Residential care facilities serving more than six persons are not addressed in the Zoning
Ordinance. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to conditionally permit residential care
facilities for seven or more persons in the R-4 and MU Overlay zones. Conditions will pertain
to performance standards (such as parking, management, security, hours of operation, etc.) and
will not be different from those required for similar uses in the same zone.
Second Dwelling Units
Second dwelling units are attached or detached dwelling units that provide complete
independent living facilities for one or more persons including permanent provisions for
living, sleeping, cooking and sanitation. Second units may be an alternative source of
affordable housing for lower-income households and seniors.
California law requires local jurisdictions to adopt ordinances that establish the conditions
under which second dwelling units are permitted (Government Code, Section 65852.2). A
jurisdiction cannot adopt an ordinance that precludes the development of second units
unless findings are made acknowledging that allowing second units may limit housing
opportunities of the region and result in adverse impacts on public health, safety, and
welfare. An amendment to the State’s second unit law in September 2002 requires local
governments to use a ministerial, rather than discretionary process for approving second
units (i.e. second units otherwise compliant with local zoning standards can be approved
without a public hearing).
Second dwelling units are permitted by right in all residential zones in Hawthorne, subject
to the following conditions:

       The lot must have a minimum area of 8,000 square feet in the R-1, R-3, and R-4
        zones, and 7,000 square feet in the R-2 zone.
       Two parking spaces are required for each unit on the lot.
       The maximum height of the accessory structure is 12 feet
       The building must be architecturally compatible with the primary dwelling unit
       The two units must be held under single ownership, and the owner of the property
        must occupy one of the units.
Since January 1, 2006, one building permit has been issued for second dwelling units.
Transitional and Supportive Housing
Transitional housing is a type of housing used to facilitate the movement of homeless
individuals and families to permanent housing. Transitional housing can take several
forms, including group quarters with beds, single-family homes, and multi-family
apartments and typically offers case management and support services to return people to
independent living (usually between six and 24 months). The Zoning Ordinance defines
transitional housing as a development with buildings configured as rental housing
developments, but operated under program requirements that call for the termination of
assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some
predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than six months. This definition
is consistent with Government Code Section 65582(g).
According to the National Housing Institute, supportive housing is permanent housing with
a service component, which can be provided either on-site or off-site. The Zoning
Ordinance defines supportive housing as “housing with no limit on length of stay, that is
occupied by the target population that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the
supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status,
and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community.” The
target population includes persons with disabilities, elderly, youth aging out of foster
system, veterans, and homeless. The City’s definition is consistent with Government Code
Section 65582(f).
State Bill 2 provides that transitional housing and supportive housing that is a rental
housing development constitutes a residential use. It requires zoning to treat such uses as a
residential use and subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of
the same type in the same zone. The City amended the Zoning Ordinance in 2013 to allow
transitional and supportive housing as a residential use, subject to the same permitting
process and development standards as other residential uses in the residential and mixed-
use overlay zones.

Emergency Shelters
An emergency shelter is a facility that provides shelter to homeless families and/or
homeless individuals on a limited short-term basis. The Zoning Ordinance defines
emergency shelter as a facility that provides immediate and short-term housing for
homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less. Supplemental services
may include counseling and access to social programs. This definition is consistent with
Government Code Section 65582(d).
The City amended the Zoning Ordinance in 2013 to accommodate emergency shelters
within the M-1 and M-2 zones. Emergency shelter application reviews are subject
ministerial review and approval to determine that the proposed use conforms to Zoning
standards that apply throughout the M-1 and M-2 zones as well as the following use-
specific development and operational standards:
    1. Individuals and families shall not stay at an emergency shelter for more than 180
        days per calendar year.
    2. Emergency shelters shall not be established within 500 feet of an R-1-zoned property
        or a specific plan area developed as single-family housing, measured from the
        property lines.
    3. Emergency shelters shall not be established within 300 feet of another emergency
        shelter.
    4. Each emergency shelter within 500 feet of residentially-zoned properties, measured
        from property lines, shall be limited to 40 persons/beds for overnight occupancy.
        Shelters located beyond 500 feet from residentially-zoned property shall not exceed
        capacity for 150 persons/beds. The total number of permanent emergency shelter
        beds within the city shall not exceed 300.
    5. Each shelter shall be operated by a responsible agency or non-profit organization
        with experience in managing shelters and/or providing social services.
    6. There shall be at least one on-site supervisor per 25 persons, or portion thereof,
        during the hours of shelter operation.
    7. Operators shall maintain a log of occupants which may be reviewed by the city at
        any time to ensure compliance with length of stay restrictions.
    8. Outdoor areas of the shelter that are not completely enclosed by a building shall only
        be used between 3pm and 10pm. Loitering shall not be permitted on the site nor
        adjacent sidewalks or streets. Trash and graffiti must be removed from the site daily.
    9. Occupants shall be permitted to enter the facility no earlier than 3pm and must leave
        by 9am the following morning.

       10. No individual or household may be denied access to an emergency shelter because of an
               inability to pay.
No emergency shelters are currently located within Hawthorne. The Needs Assessment
determined that, based on the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority census, there is a total
unmet need of 20 unsheltered homeless persons in Hawthorne. The M-1 zone is located along
major corridors (Rosecrans, Hawthorne, Imperial, Marine, and Crenshaw) with easy access to
public transit (bus and Green Line). Emergency shelters will be permitted in the M-1 and M-2
zones, all of which are well served by public transportation. There are 248 parcels totaling 350
acres that are appropriately zoned. However, no emergency shelters will be permitted within
500 feet of an R-1 zoned property or any portion of a specific plan developed as single-family
homes. This removes 30 parcels (80 acres). Additionally, parcels within 500 feet of any
residential zone are limited to emergency shelters not to exceed 40 beds. This area comprises
103 parcels (89 acres) and is approximately 33 percent of the acreage identified for emergency
shelters. The remaining 115 parcels (181 acres) are to be available for development without
restriction to bed size except by the citywide cap of 300 beds.
Single-Room Occupancy
With high housing costs, many communities in California are exploring the use of single-
room occupancy (SRO) housing to fulfill the affordable housing needs of certain segments of
the community, such as seniors, students, and single workers. The Hawthorne Zoning
Ordinance does not currently address SRO units. The City will amend the Zoning
Ordinance to specify SRO as a conditionally permitted use in an overlay zone to be created
in the commercial and industrial zones. Conditions for approval will relate to the
performance of the facility, such as parking, security, and management.  
4. Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Both the federal Fair Housing Amendment Act (FHAA) and the California Fair Employment
and Housing Act direct local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e.
modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such
accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use
and enjoy a dwelling.
Zoning and Land Use
Restrictive land use policies and zoning provisions can constrain the development of
housing for persons with disabilities.
Definition of Family: Local governments may restrict access to housing for households
failing to qualify as a “family” by the definition specified in the Zoning Ordinance.
Specifically, a restrictive definition of “family” that limits the number of and differentiates
between related and unrelated individuals living together may illegally limit the
development and siting of group homes for persons with disabilities but not for housing
families that are similarly sized or situated.7
                                                            
7      California court cases (City of Santa Barbara v. Adamson, 1980 and City of Chula Vista v. Pagard, 1981, etc.)
       have ruled an ordinance as invalid if it defines a “family” as (a) an individual; (b) two or more persons
                                                             CITY OF HAWTHORNE | 2013-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                                             45
                                                                                               February 2014
 

The City of Hawthorne Zoning Ordinance contains a definition of family, which is defined
as one or more persons living together in a dwelling unit, with common access to and
common use of all living, kitchen and eating areas within the dwelling unit. The City’s
definition of family does not stipulates relation and size; the definition of family is
acceptable and fully complies with the law.
Residential Facilities and Special Needs Housing: As previously discussed under “Variety
of Housing Types”, the Zoning Ordinance will be amended to address the following:
              Allow small residential care facilities (serving six or fewer persons) by right in the
               MU Overlay zone.
              Conditionally permit large residential care facilities (serving more than six persons)
               in R-4 and MU zones.
              Conditionally permit SRO housing in the commercial and manufacturing zones.
The City has not established any distance requirements between residential care facilities.
While the City of Hawthorne plans to require a CUP for large residential care facilities
serving seven or more residents, small residential care facilities are permitted by right in
residential zones and in the C-1 zone. Requiring a CUP for large residential care facilities
will allow the City to ensure compatible uses in a neighborhood, control for environmental
and quality of life factors such as noise and hazards and maintain parking and traffic
standards. The City does not impose special occupancy permit requirements or business
licenses for the establishment or retrofitting of structures for residential use by persons with
disabilities. The CUP process has not been used to deny or substantially modify a housing
project for persons with disabilities to the point where it is no longer feasible. The City has
several residential care facilities for adults and for elderly persons that have a capacity that
exceed six persons. Furthermore, provisions for transitional and supportive housing, as
well as SRO housing, will provide additional opportunities for housing for the disabled.
Reasonable Accommodation
It may also be reasonable to accommodate requests from persons with disabilities to waive a
setback requirement or other standard of the zoning ordinance to ensure that homes are
accessible for the mobility impaired. Whether a particular modification is reasonable
depends on the circumstances, and must be decided on a case-by-case basis.
The City amended its Zoning Ordinance in 2008 to establish the process for requesting and
grant reasonable accommodations in the application of the Zoning regulations for persons
with disabilities. Requests for reasonable accommodation are submitted to and reviewed by
the Planning Director in writing. The Planning Department provides assistance to those
                                                                                                                                                                                        
       related by blood, marriage, or adoption; or (c) a group of not more than a specific number of unrelated
       persons as a single housekeeping unit. These cases have explained that defining a family in a manner that
       distinguishes between blood-related and non-blood related individuals does not serve any legitimate or
       useful objective or purpose recognized under the zoning and land use planning powers of a municipality,
       and therefore violates rights of privacy under the California Constitution.

who need it in applying for a reasonable accommodation. The request must state the basis
of the request, including modification or exception to the regulations, standards and
practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing related facilities that
would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide an individual with a disability equal
opportunity to housing of his or her choice. The Planning Director may request additional
information that complies with fair housing law and the privacy rights of the individual.
The determination is made within 45 days, not counting time necessary to gather
additionally requested documents. The Planning Director has the right to require the
applicant to record a covenant in the County Recorder’s Office acknowledging and agreeing
to comply with the terms and conditions established in the determination. Appeals may be
made to the Planning Commission.
In approving or denying the request, the Planning Director shall apply the following
criteria:
              The unit, which is the subject of the request for the reasonable accommodation, will
               be used by an individual with a disability protected under the Acts8;
              The requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an
               individual with a disability protected under the Acts;
              The requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial or
               administrative burden on the City; and
              The requested accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the
               nature of the City’s zoning regulations and policies.
Hawthorne’s reasonable accommodation procedure does not require a public hearing and
preserves privacy laws and fair housing laws. Only property owners in abutting properties
are notified if the accommodation is granted and future property owners are notified by the
covenant. Hawthorne’s reasonable accommodation procedure complies with Housing
Element law and provides an accessible way for disabled residents to make necessary
changes to their properties.
Building Codes
The City enforces Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations that regulates the access and
adaptability of buildings to accommodate persons with disabilities.                                     Furthermore,
Government Code Section 12955.1 requires that 10 percent of the total dwelling units in
multi-family buildings without elevators consisting of three or more rental units or four or
more condominium units are subject to the following building standards for persons with
disabilities:
              The primary entry to the dwelling unit shall be on an accessible route unless
               exempted by site impracticality test.
                                                            
8      “Acts” means the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and California’s Fair Employment and
       Housing Act.

        At least one powder room or bathroom shall be located on the primary entry level
         served by an accessible route.
        All rooms or spaces located on the primary entry level shall be served by an
         accessible route. Rooms and spaces located on the primary entry level and subject to
         this chapter may include but are not limited to kitchens, powder rooms, bathrooms,
         living rooms, bedrooms, or hallways.
        Common use areas shall be accessible.
        If common tenant parking is provided, accessible parking is required.
The City has not adopted unique restrictions that would constrain the development of
housing for persons with disabilities. Compliance with provisions of the Code of
Regulations, California Building Standards Code, and federal Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) is assessed and enforced by the Building and Safety Department as part of the
building permit submittal.
5. Planning and Development Fees
Developers are subject to a variety of fees and exactions to cover the cost of processing permits
and providing necessary services and facilities. In general, these fees can be a constraint on
housing development and compromise market-rate affordability because the additional cost
borne by developers contributes to overall increased housing unit cost. However, the fees are
necessary to maintain adequate planning services and other public services and facilities in the
City.
Planning Fees
The City’s fee schedule for a typical residential project is displayed in Table 26. Hawthorne’s
planning fees are generally higher than those in the smaller cities of Redondo Beach and
Lawndale. These two cities also contract with the County of Los Angeles for much of its plan
checking functions, with costs being set by the County.
Impact Fees
Development impact fees are established for mitigating various development impacts based on
the specific existing conditions of and projected needs for infrastructure and public facilities.
Therefore, comparing the levels of impact fees across communities does not recognize the
unique circumstances for establishing these fees. Furthermore, impact fees are subject to the
requirements of State law for ensuring reasonableness and proportionate share of responsibility.
The City has implemented development impact fees which are used for police facilities, park
facilities, storm drain facilities and street and traffic signals. The total impact fees are presented
in Table 28. Developers are able to apply for a fee waiver if they can prove the lack of a nexus
relationship between the proposed development and the fees charged. The City Council
considers the waiver with the development permit application at a public hearing or at a
separate hearing and the decision of the City Council is final.

Overall Cost Impact
Overall, fees for a typical single-family unit total about $5,500. For multi-family housing
projects, the per-unit fees decrease as the number of units increases. For a five-unit project,
the fees average around $6,000 per unit. The fees decrease to $5,275 per unit for a ten-unit
project and to $4,900 per unit to a 20-unit project. These fees represent less than five
percent of the total development costs.
A 2012 National Impact Fees Survey (www.impactfees.com) surveyed 37 jurisdictions in
California, including two in Los Angeles County (Long Beach and Lancaster). The study
reports average impact fees of $31,014 per single-family unit and $18,807 per multi-family
unit in California. The City of Hawthorne’s development impact fees and taxes are well
below the statewide average, constitute a relatively minor proportion of total development
cost, and, therefore, do not constitute a constraint to the production or improvement of
housing.
6. On- and Off-Site Improvements
Requirements for on- and off-site improvements vary depending on the presence of existing
improvements, as well as the size and nature of the proposed development. Given the built
out character of Hawthorne, most residential areas are already served with infrastructure.
The City has established specific standards for improvements and facilities to serve new
development, including: concrete curbs, gutters, asphalt concrete street pavement,
sidewalks and streetlights. The City has adopted the provisions in the most recent edition
of the “Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction,” published by the Southern
California Chapters of the American Public Works Association and the Associated General
Contractors of America. The City of Hawthorne street design criteria are summarized in
Table 29.

The City of Hawthorne’s fee structure includes some on- and off-site improvements, which
are described in the section above (development impact fees). Off-site improvement fees
include storm drain, street, traffic, police, and park facilities, among others. While these fees
add to the cost of housing development, they are also established to cover the costs of
infrastructure, facilities, and improvements necessary to serve the development.
7. Development Permit Procedures
Development review and permit procedures are necessary steps to ensure that residential
construction proceeds in an orderly manner. The following discussion outlines the level of
review required for various permits and timelines associated with those reviews. The
timelines provided are estimates; actual processing time may vary due to the volume of
applications and the size and complexity of the projects.
Permit Processes
The City of Hawthorne has three types of permit processes for residential projects:
       Discretionary applications, which require a public hearing before the Planning
        Commission.
       Ministerial applications for two stories and large additions, which require a plan
        check from the Planning, Building, Fire, and Engineering Departments.
       Ministerial applications for minor additions, which can be reviewed and approved
        over-the-counter.
The time frame for discretionary approvals ranges from 30 to 60 days from formal submittal
until the Planning Commission hearing date.
The City requires a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for multi-family projects in the R-3 zone,
but does not have a design review process. To apply for a CUP, an applicant must submit
site plans, elevation illustrations, and other materials as required.
The timeframes associated with securing a CUP is largely a function of the public hearing
process. Processing time for a typical, small multi-family project is about eight weeks.
Processing time for a large multi-family project takes between 30 and 60 days. However,
                                              CITY OF HAWTHORNE | 2013-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                                      51
                                                                                        February 2014
 

CEQA (California Environmental Quality Act) requirement for large projects often extend
the timeframe for processing.
In general, the applicant can request a pre-application conference with City staff to identify
initial concerns of the City. This process is done informally and the City is typically able to
grant that request and set up an appointment immediately. The City does not have a design
review board or a formal design review process. The Planning Commission reviews the
project proposal for architectural integrity concurrently as part of its development review
process. Conditions for project approval typically establish performance standards and
mitigations to reduce impacts on surrounding neighborhoods. Specifically, the Zoning
Ordinance outlines the following considerations:
        Compatibility of existing and potential uses;
        Factors such as noise, smoke, dust, fumes, vibration, odors, hazard (including traffic
         hazard), or public need; and
        Location and design of parking facilities, ingress and egress facilities, and on-site
         provisions for back-up storage of cars waiting to enter traffic flow on the street, as
         these factors relate to general safety and convenience of the public.
The Zoning Ordinance further stipulates that before imposing conditions on any use
requiring a CUP, the Planning Commission must ascertain its findings the characteristics
that may be present in exceptional degree, and the conditions imposed shall only be those
that will reasonably assure to mitigate the nuisance or hazard to life or property. Therefore,
the CUP requirement for multi-family projects does not constrain the development of
housing in Hawthorne. Typical conditions for approval specify the amount of amenities to
be provided, such as private and common open space, and assurance for the maintenance of
the required parking spaces for parking. Approximately 66 percent of the City’s housing
stock is multi-family. The City has demonstrated an excellent track record in approving
multi-family development. With the high concentration of multi-family housing in the City,
a discretionary process is necessary to promote a well-balanced community and to preserve
the integrity of the City’s single-family neighborhoods.
For subdivisions, the tentative tract maps must be filed with the Planning Commission and
within 30 days of the next Commission meeting. The City engineer must submit a report in
writing to the Commission within 30 days or the project is automatically deemed approved.
The Lot Split subdivision process is slightly longer time investment. After filing the survey
map and plot plan, the planning official must set the matter for public hearing within 30 to
50 days. This is also after the environmental impact report is certified and the negative
declaration is adopted or the project is deemed exempt from these requirements.
General Plan Amendment and/or Zone Change
A proposed housing project may include a General Plan Amendment and/or rezone. This
type of approval is discretionary, requiring approval by the City Council. Approval of a
rezone or General Plan Amendment would depend on the applicant’s ability to show that
the proposal would further and not detract from the City’s established land use goals.

           February 2014
 

General Plan Amendments and Zone Code Amendments are generally processed
concurrently with required project entitlements to save time.
8. Building Codes and Enforcement
The City has adopted, by reference, the 2010 California Building Standards Code, which
includes the State Green Building Code. These codes are considered to be the minimum
necessary to protect the public’s health, safety and welfare. The codes are determined by
the International Conference of Building Officials and the State of California. Substandard
housing conditions within the City’s existing housing stock are abated primarily through
code compliance. Identification of code violations is both proactive and reactive to resident
complaints. Although building codes and the time required for inspections can increase
housing production costs and may reduce the rehabilitation viability of older properties, the
intent is to provide structurally sound, safe, and energy-efficient housing. Property owners
are advised by the City of available rehabilitation programs to assist in the correction of
code violations.
C. Public Policy Constraints
State and federal requirements may act as a barrier to the development or rehabilitation of
housing, and affordable housing in particular. These include State prevailing wage
requirements and environmental review requirements.
1. State Prevailing Wage Requirements
The State Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) has recently greatly expanded the kinds
of projects that require the payment of prevailing wages. Labor Code Section 1720, which
applies prevailing wage rates to public works, now defines public works to mean
construction, alteration, installation, demolition, or repair work done under contract and
paid for in whole or in part out of public funds. For example, public transfer of an asset for
less than fair market value, such as a land write-down, would now be construed to be paid
for in part out of public funds and trigger prevailing wage requirements.
While the cost differential in prevailing and standard wages varies based on the skill level of
the occupation, prevailing wages tend to add to the overall cost of development. In the case
of affordable housing projects, prevailing wage requirements could effectively reduce the
number of affordable units that can be achieved with public subsidies. The following types
of projects are not however required to pay prevailing wages:
       Residential projects financed through issuance of bonds that receive an allocation
        through the State; or
       Single-family projects financed through issuance of qualified mortgage revenue
        bonds or mortgage credit certificates.

                                                                                          53
                                                                           February 2014
 

2. Environmental Protection
State and federal regulations require environmental review of proposed discretionary
projects (e.g., subdivision maps, development review permits, etc.). Costs resulting from the
environmental review process are also added to the cost of housing and are passed on to the
consumer. These costs include the preparation of environmental analyses, and from delays
caused by the mandated public review periods. However, the presence of these regulations
helps preserve the environment and ensure environmental safety to Hawthorne residents.
Furthermore, recent State laws have established exemptions from CEQA for infill and
affordable housing projects.
D. Infrastructure and Public Service Constraints
The infrastructure of critical importance to the maintenance and development of new
housing includes water facilities, sewer facilities, streets, and sidewalks. The provision and
maintenance of these facilities in a community enhances not only the character of the
neighborhoods but also serves as an incentive to homeowners to routinely maintain the
condition of their homes. In contrast, when public improvements are left to deteriorate or
are overextended in use, the neighborhoods in which they are located become neglected and
show early signs deterioration.
Very little undeveloped residential land remains in the City. Future housing growth will
occur within vacant infill areas, construction of secondary units on existing lots, the
rezoning of commercial to mixed and residential uses, and the redevelopment of
Hawthorne Boulevard. All necessary infrastructures are currently in place and maintenance
of such infrastructures is the responsibility of the City, County, and a number of
public/private agencies.
E. Environmental Constraints
A community’s environmental setting affects the feasibility and cost of developing housing.
Environmental issues range from the conservation of biological resources to the suitability
of land for development due to potential exposure to seismic, fire, hazardous materials and
airport related accidents as well as the availability of adequate water supplies. This section
summarizes these potential constraints in Hawthorne.
 
1. Geology/Seismic Constraints
Hawthorne is located in the seismically active Los Angeles Basin where numerous active
and potentially active faults have been identified. The Charnock fault, a component of the
Newport-Inglewood fault, is located in the center of the City. The greatest risk of seismic
shaking would result from activity on one of the major fault lines in the region. The
potential for liquefaction exists, although the depths to groundwater and underlying soil
characteristics make this possibility remote. This risk is typical of any area located within
the Los Angeles Basin. The General Plan Safety Element contains goals and policies that
address seismic hazards to the extent possible.

2. Fire Hazards
The City of Hawthorne is served by the Los Angeles County Fire Department Stations #160,
161, and 162. The County receives an average of 20 calls per day for service in the City of
Hawthorne. Significant damage occurs infrequently, but it is most likely to occur where
industrial chemicals and fuels are used, stored or transported. There is potential for
considerable damage where multi-family dwellings proliferate, such as in Moneta Gardens
which has the highest density and restricted access.
3. Hazardous Material Spills
Situated at the hub of a major arterial traffic network, the City of Hawthorne is highly
susceptible to the danger of hazardous materials spills. This danger is somewhat mitigated,
however, by various State and Federal legislation regulating the use, storage and
transportation of hazardous materials and the strict enforcement of these regulations.
4. Airport Related Accidents
The Hawthorne Municipal Airport Master Plan contains a description of existing and
proposed facilities for the Hawthorne Municipal Airport; current and projected airport
operations; an inventory of areas potentially affected by airplane crashes; policies and
standards for land use and development within the airport planning boundaries to
minimize safety hazards and noise problems; and an emergency preparedness plan for the
airport. The Airport Master Plan is consistent with the City’s General Plan Land Use
Element.
5. Water Supply Constraints
California Water Service Company (Cal Water) is Hawthorne’s water supplier and has been
since 1996. Cal Water is the largest investor owned American water utility west of the
Mississippi River and among the largest in the country.
A recent United States District Court decision mandated a 35 percent reduction in pumping
from the Sacramento Delta to protect the endangered Delta Smelt. As a result, it is
anticipated that demand for water will exceed supplies by 2020. Alternative measures to
conserve existing and secure additional water supply will be necessary.
Senate Bill 1087 (enacted 2006) requires that water providers develop written policies that
grant priority to proposed development that includes housing affordable to lower-income
households. The legislation also prohibits water providers from denying or conditioning
the approval of development that includes housing affordable to lower-income households,
unless specific written findings are made. The City will provide a copy of the adopted 2013-
2021 Housing Element to Cal Water within 30 days of adoption. The City will also continue
to coordinate with the Cal Water to ensure affordable housing developments receive
priority water service provision.

4. Housing Resources
 
This section identifies resources that are available for the development, rehabilitation, and
preservation of housing in the City of Hawthorne. The analysis includes an assessment of
land resources for future housing development, the City’s ability to satisfy its share of the
region’s future housing need, the financial resources available to support housing activities
and the administrative resources available to assist in implementing the City’s housing
programs. Additionally, this section examines opportunities for energy conservation.
A. Residential Development Potential
1. Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
State Housing Element law requires that a local jurisdiction accommodates a share of the
region’s projected housing needs for the planning period. This share, called the Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), is important because State law mandates that the
jurisdiction must provide sufficient land to accommodate a variety of housing opportunities
for all economic segments of the community. Compliance with this requirement is
measured by the jurisdiction’s ability in providing adequate land to accommodate the
RHNA.
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), as the regional planning
agency, is responsible for allocating the RHNA to individual jurisdictions within the six-
county region.9 For the 2014-2021 RHNA period, the City of Hawthorne is allocated a
RHNA of 683 units by SCAG as follows:
              Extremely Low (up to 30 percent of AMI): 85 units (12.5 percent)
              Very Low Income (31 to 50 percent of AMI): 85 units (12.5 percent)10
              Low Income (51 to 80 percent of AMI): 101units (14.8 percent)
              Moderate Income (81 to 120 percent of AMI): 112 units (16.4 percent)
              Above Moderate Income (more than 120 percent of AMI): 300 units (43.9 percent)
The City must ensure the availability of residential sites at adequate densities and
appropriate development standards to accommodate these units.
 
                                                            
9      Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) covers a six-county region, including Los Angeles,
       Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, and Imperial.
10     The City has a RHNA allocation of 170 very low income units (inclusive of extremely low income units).
       Pursuant to State law (AB 2634), the City may assume 50 percent of the very low income units as extremely
       low. Therefore the City’s RHNA of 170 very low income units may be split into 85 extremely low income
       units and 85 very low income units.

2. Pending Project
The City is in the process of reviewing a 127-unit rental housing/mixed use development
project (14124 Yukon Avenue). In this project AMG Development is teaming with TELACU
to provide affordable housing using Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and tax-
exempt bonds. All 127 units are proposed to be deed restricted as housing affordable to low
income households for 55 years. This project is not anticipated to issue building permits
until 2014. With this project, the City has a remaining RHNA of 582 units.
3. Residential Sites Inventory
 
Hawthorne is an older urbanized City with limited development opportunities on vacant
land. As such, the City’s existing vacant residential sites do not have the capacity to meet
the City’s share of the regional housing need and the City must rely on recycling of
currently underutilized properties for residential development.
For this Housing Element, the sites inventory includes 158 parcels, with a total of 47.5 acres.
Parcels that, individually, are not likely to be redeveloped over the near term have been
excluded. The City includes in this sites inventory only those parcels where the owners
have expressed interest for redevelopment and properties that are possible for
redevelopment given their existing vacant or underutilized character, and/or long-term
viability of existing uses. As shown on the maps included in the Appendix, most of the
parcels selected for the sites inventory are contiguous and offer opportunity for lot
consolidation. The more obvious opportunities for lot consolidation are noted in the
detailed sites inventory contained in the Appendix. However, it is not uncommon that
developers when surveying an area for development potential, include properties that are
not considered underutilized or blighted but would serve to “connect” or “complete” a
group of parcels to create a larger site for development. Often common ownership is not a
prerequisite for lot consolidation.
Existing Uses
Existing uses in these areas are characterized by older single-family residential units and
low intensity industrial/retail uses that are marginally operating, as well as nonconforming
uses. Non-residential development includes light industrial and commercial strips located
at the edges of residential development, and a wide range of mostly small businesses such
as masonry shops, metal manufacturing, and other construction-oriented businesses; auto
repair shops; storage facilities; surface parking lots; as well as retail and other commercial
uses. Often these retail/light industrial uses include large, sparsely used parking lots.
Some of the single–family homes in the selected areas appear to be in disrepair or are poorly
maintained. The areas rezoned are generally described below. A detailed inventory is
included in the appendix where the conditions of existing uses are presented. Lot
consolidation potential and expressed interests in redeveloping the properties are also
noted.
Cordary Avenue/Rosecrans Avenue (Areas 1a and 1b): Parcels bounded by Cordary
Avenue on the west, Yukon Avenue on the east, West 139th Street on the north, and
Rosecrans Avenue on the south. The majority of the properties are outdated single-story
                                         CITY OF HAWTHORNE | 2013-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT
                                                                                          57
                                                                           February 2014
 

commercial and industrial buildings, older single-family houses, and vacant properties.
Most of these properties were developed in the 1950s and have not undergone major
improvements in the last 50 years, with improvement-to-land value ratios (ILR) significantly
below 1.0, indicating that the improvements on these properties are worth far less than the
land. With the rezoning, the increased density should raise the land value when the
economy recovers, further enhancing the feasibility of redevelopment.
Also, many properties are nonconforming – where industrial buildings are located on lots
zoned residential or vice versa. Given their nonconforming status, these properties will not
be allowed to be redeveloped back to the current uses or pursue expansion opportunities. A
majority of the properties are larger, having depths of 300 feet or more. Large portions of
the properties are used for surface parking, making many of these properties severely
underutilized in today’s standard for commercial development.
A General Plan amendment and Zone Change completed in 2011 realigned the land use and
zoning to reflect the City’s vision for the areas. The increased density of 30 units per acre
and a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 2.5 will induce redevelopment in the areas. Specifically,
two parcels owned by a local church (Site 138) with the potential to accommodate more than
30 units has previously expressed interest in redeveloping the property. Also, at least eight
properties (Sites 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 93, 98, and 99) are contiguous and under common
ownership. The property owner has previous expressed interest in redeveloping at least
five of those properties.

Rosecrans Avenue Corridor (Areas 1c and 1d): Parcels abutting the north side of Rosecrans
Avenue, bounded by Yukon Avenue on the west and Crenshaw Boulevard on the east. The
majority of the properties are outdated low-intensity single-story commercial and industrial
buildings. A majority of the properties are larger, in excess of one acre. A larger project is
possible if the adjacent underutilized properties (Sites 163 and 166) are involved.
Regionally, the conversion of plant nurseries in urban areas to higher intensity uses was a
frequent development scenario prior to the recession.
Within Area 1d are also large industrial buildings that have been largely vacated not only
because of the recession but because of the economic restructuring that has impacted Los
Angeles County. Bus service is available on Rosecrans Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard.
Mixed use development would induce public transit use and reduce vehicular traffic. As
the southern and eastern entrances to the City, redevelopment would enhance the image of
the City as a whole. High traffic volumes on Rosecrans Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard
make adjacent properties suitable for mixed commercial/residential development.
The General Plan amendment and Zone Change realigned the land use and zoning to reflect
the City’s vision for the areas. Some properties were rezoned to reflect the current medium
density residential uses. Other properties were rezoned from M-1 to C-3 with a MU
Overlay.

Hawthorne Boulevard Greenline Metro Station/Hawthorne Boulevard Corridor South
(Areas 3a and 3b): Parcels bounded by Imperial Highway on the north, West 115th Street on
the south, Hawthorne Boulevard on the east, and Grevillea Avenue on the west. The
residential uses should be vertically mixed atop ground floor retail uses. The retail uses
should be convenience shopping oriented to serving the residents of the development,
nearby residential areas, as commuters using the Metro station.
The properties are located adjacent to the Hawthorne Boulevard Greenline Metro Station.
Bus service is available on Imperial Highway and Hawthorne Boulevard. Higher density
residential development would induce public transit use and reduce vehicular traffic. As
the northern entrance to the City, redevelopment would enhance the image of the City as a
whole. High traffic volumes on Imperial Highway and Hawthorne Boulevard make the
properties suitable for mixed commercial/residential development.
The majority of the properties in this area are outdated and low-intensity single-story
commercial buildings and older single-family houses. Existing residential uses include old
single-family homes on R-3, C-1, and M-1 properties. Commercial uses in these areas are
primarily retail shops and restaurants. Many properties were developed in the 1950s and
are showing signs of deferred maintenance and disrepair. Areas 3a and 3b also include at
least ten vacant parcels and six parcels used as surface parking lots. Specifically in Area 3a,
existing structures on six parcels have been demolished. There is also a vacant former
gasoline station property. With the underutilized character of existing uses, the General
Plan amendment and Zone change further enhance the feasibility of redevelopment of these

properties. Property owners of at least four parcels had previously expressed interest in
redeveloping the properties.

Redondo Beach Greenline Metro Station/Marine Avenue (Area 7c): Parcels abutting the
north side of Marine Avenue, bounded by 405 Freeway on the east and Aviation Boulevard
on the west. The residential uses should be vertically mixed atop ground floor retail or
office uses, or horizontally mixed, or a combination of both. The westerly portion of the
area, adjacent to Aviation Boulevard, is more suitable to a mix of residential and office uses.
This area includes two parcels that are currently used as a car dealership and a small fast
food restaurant. Both uses offer small building structures and large surface parking space.
Conversion of car dealership to other uses is not uncommon in the region.

West El Segundo Boulevard/Van Ness Avenue (Area 8):                    A number of old
commercial/industrial uses are located at the northwest corner of West El Segundo
Boulevard and Van Ness Avenue. These uses are located directly across residential uses
and many have large parking areas. One of the major uses in this area was the Behavioral
Health Services Clinic, which has been closed. The property owner has expressed interest in
redeveloping the property into affordable housing and is pursuing funding for the project.

Redevelopment Potential
All the sites identified include marginal uses such as small homes on large lots within high
density areas, small commercial offices, retail businesses, or light industrial uses that have
outdated configuration and marginal operations. An economic research consultant was
commissioned to conduct a feasibility study of mixed use developments in the South Bay.
Eight hypothetical models of various urban development forms ranging from medium
density residential to high density mixed use were formulated for feasibility testing. Each
model involves the recycling of low-intensity uses to medium- to high-intensity uses.
As mentioned above, prior to the economic downturn, several property owners have
expressed interest in redeveloping their properties for higher intensity uses. With adoption
of the MU Overlay Zone and R-4 zone in 2011, the City seeks to take advantage of
development opportunities in key areas of the City, each of which face unique opportunities
and constraints. With the shifting economic structure in the region and nationwide,
manufacturing jobs are disappearing. Industrial uses within these areas are expected to be
replaced with other more viable economic uses. Most of the residential uses in the City
were developed in the 1950s and 1960s, with many showing signs of disrepair and several
homes in the areas have also been vacated and boarded up. As the economy continues to
recover, the City has been notified of development interests in the area. Examples of
development interest in these areas include:
       Area 1a: Expressed interest in redeveloping the vacant site owned by a local church.
       Area 1b: Expressed interest in consolidating and redeveloping five parcels under
        common ownership.
       Area 1d: Expressed interest in consolidating and redeveloping five separately owned
        parcels of industrial buildings into a mixed use project.
       Area 8: Expressed interest in redeveloping a vacated health clinic into 100 percent
        affordable housing.
The City intends to facilitate mixed use and high density residential development in these
areas to promote an urban character that fosters the use of public transportation and
sustainable development pattern. With the adoption of the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay, the
City has already been contacted by several property owners/developers with interest in
taking advantage of the MU Overly. For example, two mixed-use developments have been
constructed, with another project being proposed on sites that were identified in the sites
inventory for the 2008-2014 Housing Element Update. Specifically, a 127-unit affordable
rental housing project for low income households has been proposed in Area 1c. This
project has an effective density of 77 units per acre. Existing uses of this site included
horticulture production. Another development constructed within Area 1d included 109
units, of which 28 are affordable. This project has an effective density of 38 units per acre.
Prior uses on site included industrial, surface parking, and restaurant uses. A third mixed
use development within Area 2 was constructed on a vacant property and the project
included 72 market-rate rental units. This project has an effective density of 30 units per
acre.

Adequacy to Meet RHNA
Overall, these properties can accommodate 998 housing units, conservatively estimated at
only 70 percent of the maximum density of 30 units per acre. Specifically, 267 units can be
accommodated on R-4 properties and 731 units can be accommodated on MU Overlay
properties.
This sites inventory already takes into account that not all properties will be redeveloped
within the planning period. From 192 acres of properties that were rezoned/upzoned to R-4
and MU Overlay in 2011, this sites inventory includes only 47.5 acres (25 percent), excluding
all properties that do not demonstrate obvious potential for redevelopment in the near
future.
The City recognizes that not all MU Overlay properties, when redeveloped, will include a
residential component. Overall, 267 units can be accommodated in the new R-4 zone,
almost double of the City’s remaining RHNA for lower income units (144 units). Assuming
percent of the MU Overlay acreage included in this inventory would include a residential
component when redeveloped, 511 units could be achieved.11 Therefore, the City’s sites
inventory for this planning period offers a capacity for 778 units, adequate to accommodate
the City’s remaining RHNA of 582 units.
                                                            
11     This assumption is conservative. Of the acreage included within the sites inventory for the 2008-2014
       Housing Element Update, a total of 8.1 acres have been developed to date. Of the developed acreage, 6.1
       acres have resulted in mixed use developments with a residential component. The mixed use developments
       account for 76 percent of the total acreage within the MU Overlay that has been developed since the prior
       Housing Element update.

B. Financial Resources
1. Housing Choice Voucher Program - Rental Assistance
Housing Choice Vouchers represent a significant housing resource for very low income,
especially for extremely low income households. Specifically, pursuant to HUD regulations,
each housing authority must set aside a portion of the Housing Choice Vouchers for
extremely low income households.
The Hawthorne Department of Housing administers its Housing Choice Voucher program.
This program provides rental assistance to very low income households. Currently, 1,124
Hawthorne households are receiving rental assistance through the program.
2. Community Development Block Grant
The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program was initiated by the Housing
and Community Development Act (HCDA) of 1974. The primary objective of the program
is to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing, a suitable living
environment, and economic opportunities, principally for persons of low incomes (up to 80
percent AMI). CDBG funds can be used for a wide array of activities, including:
      Housing rehabilitation;
      Downpayment and other homeownership assistance;
      Lead-based paint screening and abatement;
      Acquisition of buildings and land;
      Construction or rehabilitation of public facilities and infrastructure;
      Removal or architectural barriers;
      Public services for low-income persons and persons with special needs;
      Rehabilitation of commercial or industrial buildings; and
      Loans and grants for businesses that provide employment for low-income persons.
The City of Hawthorne receives approximately $1.1 million in CDBG funds annually, down
from $1.7 million only a few years ago.
3. HOME Investment Partnership Act
The HOME program provides federal funds for the development and rehabilitation of
affordable rental and ownership housing for households with incomes not exceeding 80
percent of area median income. The program gives local governments the flexibility to fund
a wide range of affordable housing activities through housing partnerships with private
industry and non-profit organizations. HOME funds can be used for activities that promote
affordable rental housing and homeownership by low-income households.
The City of Hawthorne receives an annual allocation of approximately $454,000 in HOME
funds from HUD, down from nearly $1.0 million a few years ago.

Program 2: Crime-Free Multi-Housing Program
This program was designed to help landlords, property owners, and the Police Department
improve the quality of life in and around apartment complexes within the City, while
reducing the calls for police services at participating complexes. Through a cooperative
effort, this program helps to eliminate gang, drug and illegal activity from targeted rental
properties. The program provides training in crime prevention measures, tenant screening,
and policing of multifamily buildings.
    Objectives and Timeframe:
     Maintain low crime levels and vacancy rates for the existing 380 participating rental
         buildings.

Program 3: Code Enforcement
As Hawthorne’s housing stock continues to age, it is important that the City maintain its
concentrated code enforcement efforts. When code violations are identified the City will
provide the homeowner with information on available rehabilitation programs for use in
correcting the existing code violation.
    Objectives and Timeframe:
     Continue to enforce the City’s adopted codes and provide information on available
        rehabilitation programs.
     Inspect approximately 1,500 homes within low and moderate income
        neighborhoods.
    Funding Sources:              CDBG
    Responsible Agency:           Department of Planning and Community Development
Program 4: Multi-Family Acquisition and Rehabilitation
The City will work with qualified Community Housing Development Organizations
(CHDOs) to acquire and rehabilitate multi-family rental units as affordable housing.
    Objectives and Timeframe:
     Acquire and rehabilitated two rental units annually, targeting for occupancy by
        extremely low and very low income households.
     Support applications by CHDOs for additional State and federal funding to pursue
        the acquisition and rehabilitation of larger multi-family rental housing.

    Responsible Agency:           Department of Planning and Community Development
2. Assist in the Provision and Conservation of Affordable Housing
The City is committed to providing a variety of housing types to meet the needs of all
residents. Although the community is largely built-out, the City continues to encourage the
development of a variety of housing types including mixed-use, second units, and single-
family and multifamily housing. In addition, through the use of homeownership programs,
the City can increase home ownership opportunities for residents. The City also maintains
affordability by facilitating the provision of rental assistance and preserving the
affordability of assisted rental units.
Program 5: Housing Choice Voucher Program
This program assists extremely low and very low income households in paying their
monthly rent. Under the program, the tenant contributes 30 percent of their monthly income
toward rent, while the Housing Choice voucher will pay for the remainder of the monthly
rental cost up to the payment standards established by the Housing Authority.

    Objectives and Timeframe:
     Continue to market the Housing Choice Voucher program to eligible households
        and provide approximately 1,100 extremely low and very low income households
        with Housing Choice Voucher Rental Assistance annually through the Hawthorne
        Housing Authority and portability provisions under the City and County of Los
        Angeles Housing Choice Voucher programs. Pursuant to HUD regulations, 70
        percent of the Housing Choice Voucher program rental assistance should be targeted
        to extremely low income households.
    Funding Sources:              HUD Section 8 funds
    Responsible Agency:           Department of Housing
Program 6: Security Deposit Assistance Program
This program provides extremely low and very low income renters with a zero-percent
interest loan for up to one month’s rent to be used as a security deposit. The loan must be
paid back to the City upon tenant vacation of the unit.
    Objectives and Timeframe:
     Provide security deposit financial assistance to 40 at-risk and homeless households
        annually through Moneta Gardens Improvement, Inc.

Program 7: Preservation of At-Risk Units
Currently 16 housing developments with deed-restricted affordable housing units are
located within Hawthorne. These include two senior rental housing developments owned
and operated by TELACU, a non-profit housing corporation. Five assisted projects are
owned and operated by Access Community Housing, a non-profit developer. Two assisted
buildings are owned and operated by National CORE (formerly the Southern California
Housing Development Corporation), a non-profit housing developer. Three projects (Doty,
Chadron, and Yukon) are under construction or soon to be constructed. Each of these is
utilizing private and non-profit funding. Moneta Gardens Improvement Inc owns one
project and the remaining projects are owned and operated by the Hawthorne Housing
Authority. This program will monitor assisted housing in the City and work to preserve the
affordable units in the community.
    Objectives and Timeframe:
     Monitor the legislative changes concerning the Section 8 program, in order to be
        strategically prepared for the potential conversion of the at-risk projects.
     Work with nonprofit developers to preserve the at-risk housing. Support
        applications by the project owners or affordable housing providers for funding to
        extend affordability covenants or make improvements to the properties.
     Ensure that tenants receive adequate noticing should an at-risk housing project file a
        notice of intent to convert to market-rate housing.

Program 8: Facilitate the Production of New Affordable and Special Needs Housing
Developers of affordable and special needs housing face a number of hurdles, including
financing, development codes and standards, and in some cases, public opposition.
Dissolution of the City’s Redevelopment Agency by the State in 2012 eliminated the Low
and Moderate Income Housing Fund (LMIHF), formerly the City’s primary mechanism for
providing direct funding support of affordable housing development. Continuing
reductions in federal funding of HUD programs (e.g., CDBG and HOME) will constrain the
City’s ability to offer committed funding assistance to affordable and special needs housing
even further. The City can encourage and facilitate affordable and special needs housing
through financial assistance, removal of regulatory constraints, and administrative support.
With limited funding, the City will rely on the following non-funding-related actions to
encourage affordable and special needs housing production (including housing for
extremely low income households and the developmentally disabled) during the planning
period:
           Collaborate with Affordable and Special Needs Housing Developers: Affordable
            housing developers work to develop, conserve and promote rental and
            ownership affordable housing. Particularly in relation to senior citizen housing
            and housing for persons with disabilities (including persons with developmental
            disabilities), the affordable housing developer is often, but not always, a local
            organization interested in developing affordable housing. The affordable
            housing developer is often involved with what is called "assisted housing",
            where some type of government assistance (such as Section 8 or Tax Credits) is
            provided to the individual household to keep rents affordable. An affordable or
            special needs housing developer can help meet the goals for additional housing
            by implementing or assisting with the implementation of programs described in
            this Element. The City will continue to collaborate with affordable and special
            needs housing developers to identify potential sites, write letters of support to
            help secure governmental and private-sector funding, and offer technical
            assistance related to the application of City incentive programs (e.g., density
            bonus).
           Regulatory Concessions and Incentives: The City will continue to work with
            developers on a case-by-case basis to provide regulatory concessions and
            incentives to assist them with the development of affordable and senior housing.
            In a relatively small city like Hawthorne, this is the most effective method of
            assisting developers, as each individual project can be analyzed to determine
            which concessions and incentives would be the most beneficial to the project’s
            feasibility. Regulatory concessions and incentives could include, but are not
            limited to, density bonuses, parking reductions, fee reductions or deferral,
            expedited permit processing, and modified or waived development standards.

     Objectives and Timeframe:
      Maintain contact information for affordable housing developers special needs
         service providers for the purposes of soliciting their involvement in development
         projects in Hawthorne.
      Participate with affordable and special needs housing developers to review available
         federal and State financing subsidies and apply as feasible on an annual basis.
      Assist and support developers of housing for lower income households, especially
         housing for extremely low income households and the disabled (including the
         developmentally disabled), with site identification, supporting applications,
         conducting pre-application meetings, assisting with design and site requirements,
         and providing regulatory incentives and concessions.

3. Removal of Constraints
The City is committed to addressing governmental constraints that hinder the production of
housing. The City has already streamlined case processing and permit procedures. Given
the limited amount of remaining vacant residential land in the community, the City plays an
important role in promoting a range of housing types and removing any constraints to
housing development. For example, in 2013 the City amended the Zoning Ordinance to
accommodate transitional housing, supportive housing, and emergency shelters, in
accordance with recent changes to State law.
Program 9: Residential Care Facilities
In Hawthorne, residential care homes serving up to six persons is permitted by right in all
residential zones and the C-1 zone. Pursuant to State law, residential care homes serving six or
fewer persons should be treated as a regular residential use permitted by right where
residential uses are permitted. As single-family housing is permitted by right in the MU
Overlay zone, residential care facilities serving six of fewer persons should be treated in the
same manner. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to define a residential care home
serving up to six persons as a single-family residential use and therefore permitted as such use
is otherwise permitted in the MU Overlay zone.
Residential care facilities serving more than six persons are not addressed in the Zoning
Ordinance. The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to conditionally permit residential care
facilities for seven or more persons in R-4 and MU Overlay zones. Conditions will pertain to
performance standards (such as parking, management, security, hours of operation, etc.) and
will not be different from those required for similar uses in the same zone.
     Objectives and Timeframe:
      Amend the Zoning Ordinance within one year of the adoption of the Housing
         Element to address provisions for small and large residential care facilities.

    Responsible Agency:          Department of Planning and Community Development
Program 10: Single-Room Occupancy Housing
The Hawthorne Zoning Ordinance does not currently address SRO units. The City will
amend the Zoning Ordinance to specify SRO as a conditionally permitted use in an overlay
zone to be created on the commercial and industrial zones. Conditions for approval will
relate to the performance of the facility, such as parking, security, and management.
    Objectives and Timeframe:
     Amend the Zoning Ordinance within one year of the adoption of the Housing
        Element to address the provisions for single-room occupancy housing.
    Funding Sources:             None required
    Responsible Agency:          Department of Planning and Community Development
4. Provision of Adequate Sites
Meeting the housing needs of all residents of the community requires the provision of
adequate sites for all types of housing. By capitalizing on the allowances of the current
zoning code, or by modifying the code as necessary, the City will assure that an adequate
amount of residentially zoned land is available.
Program 11: Specific Plans
As a means of providing adequate sites for development, the City has utilized Specific Plans
as a tool to provide consolidated development projects on unique development sites. The
Specific Plan process permits flexible development standards uniquely tailored to the
special needs of the project.
    Objectives and Timeframe:
     Continue to use specific plans as a tool to promote residential development within
        the City.
     Provide technical assistance to property owners and developers.
    Funding Sources:             None required
    Responsible Agency:          Department of Planning and Community Development
Program 12: Provision of Adequate Sites for RHNA
The City is primarily built out. As part of this Housing Element, the City has identified
several areas where the recycling of existing lower intensity uses to higher intensity
residential or mixed use developments is appropriate and encouraged. In 2011, the City
amended the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance to apply a Mixed Use Overlay on select
C-1 and C-3 properties and to upzone some properties to Maximum Density Residential.
The High Density Residential zone was also amended to become the Maximum Density
Residential with a maximum density of 30 units per acre. These land use planning efforts
provided the City with adequate land capacity to accommodate the City’s RHNA. The
Zoning Code was also amended in 2011 to allow multi-family by-right, without any

discretionary approval procedure to facilitate higher density housing to accommodate the
City’s regional housing need for lower-income households.
The Hawthorne Zoning Ordinance is designed to encourage lot consolidation. Small lots of
5,000 square feet or smaller can only accommodate one single unit. This approach
encourages the consolidation of existing small lots to facilitate larger-scale developments.
The R-4 zone contains contiguous areas of underutilized properties with a demonstrated
trend of lot consolidation. Lot consolidation is an administrative procedure.
The City will meet with property owners and interested developers to promote and
encourage proposals for multi-family and mixed use development to accommodate the
City’s share of regional housing need.
The City received a grant from MTA to develop a Transit-Oriented Design ordinance. The
TOD grant that the City was awarded by MTA was for the development of a model TOD
ordinance that can be used by the participating cities (Lawndale, Redondo Beach and
Hawthorne). The document that is to be created is a pre-regulatory document that will give
each of the jurisdictions involved the opportunity to create or customize a TOD ordinance
for their jurisdiction. The ordinance development is still in the very beginning stages;
however, the model ordinance will take into consideration form-based standards with
emphasis on building form and massing rather than uses, facades that engage in pedestrian
use, flexible building heights, mix of uses and possible vertical mix of uses with pedestrian
oriented ground-floors that front complete streets.
    Objectives and Timeframe:
     Maintain an inventory of vacant and underutilized sites in the City and provide
        potential sites information to interested developers.
     Meet with property owners and developers to discuss the incentives offered by the
        Mixed Use Overlay.
     Complete Metro TOD study and develop customize development standards for the
        City in 2015.

Program 13: Monitor Residential Capacity (No Net Loss)
City staff will monitor the consumption of residential acreage to ensure an adequate
inventory is available to meet the City’s RHNA obligations. To ensure sufficient residential
capacity is maintained to accommodate the RHNA, the City will develop and implement a
formal ongoing (project-by-project) evaluation procedure pursuant to Government Code
Section 65863. The City’s development application tracking software will notify staff when
an application has been submitted for development of a property included in the residential
sites inventory (Appendix C). Should an approval of development result in a reduction of
capacity below the residential capacity needed to accommodate the remaining need for
lower income households, the City will identify and, if necessary, rezone sufficient sites to
accommodate the shortfall and ensure “no net loss” in capacity to accommodate the RHNA.

Program 14: Lot Consolidation
Future residential development in Hawthorne is expected to occur primarily in the Mixed
Use and High Density Residential (R-4, 30 units per acre) zones. The City will facilitate lot
consolidation for mixed use and housing developments in these areas.
    Objectives and Timeframe:
     Allow administrative processing of lot consolidation requests.
     Facilitate lot consolidation by assisting developers in identifying parcels with
        consolidation potential and assisting in the lot consolidation process.
     Work with property owners to facilitate lot consolidation and identify
        redevelopment potential.

5. Equal Housing Opportunity
In order to fully meet the community’s housing needs, the City must assure that housing is
accessible to all residents, regardless of race, religion, national origin, color, ancestry, marital
status, familial status, sex, disability, source of income, sexual orientation, or any other
arbitrary factor.
Program 15: Fair Housing Program
The City contracts with the Housing Rights Center to provide fair housing services
including fair housing education, counseling, enforcement, and landlord/tenant dispute
resolution to Hawthorne residents.
    Objectives and Timeframe:
     Provide fair housing counseling, including housing discrimination counseling,
        landlord/tenant dispute resolution services, education, and outreach.
     Serve 800 persons with general housing and/or fair housing issues.

Appendix A: Review of Past Accomplishments
To develop appropriate programs to address the housing issues identified in the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the City of
Hawthorne has reviewed the programs contained in the 2008-2014 Housing Element and evaluated the effectiveness of these
programs in delivering housing services and assistance. Table A-1 shows the progress the City made in implementing the
Housing Programs. Based on this information an analysis on the effectiveness and continued appropriateness of these programs
is provided.
