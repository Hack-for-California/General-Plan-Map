                      in jobs count. As of the 2000 Census, 6.6 percent of Danville’s employed residents (1,370 people) worked
                      from home. This represented almost 10 percent of Danville’s job base.

C. GOALS AND POLICIES
Community Development Goals and Policies are divided into five categories:
 •	 Quality Development
 •	 Community Design
 •	 Commercial and Office Development
 •	 Downtown Danville
 •	 Housing
A complete list of implementation measures may be found at the end of this Chapter.
   Responsibility for implementation of General Plan policies lies with the Town Council, assisted by the
Planning Commission and staff. Although other implementation measures may be considered or added,
the measures listed for each policy serve as a basis for carrying out the General Plan. For more detailed
housing policies and programs, consult the Danville Housing Element under separate cover.
   As noted in Chapter 1 of the General Plan, some of the goals and policies are followed by text in italicized
font. This text is not part of the policy, but is included to provide context, clarify the policy’s intent, and/
or explain how the policy should be applied.
                                     GOAL : QUA L I T Y DEV E L OPM E N T
Goal 1:          Assure that future development complements Danville’s existing small town character and
                 established quality of life.
                                                                                     IM P L E M E N TAT I O N

                 The development review process provides an opportunity for
                 the Planning Commission and Town Council to evaluate the
                 merits of each project and determine whether it is consistent
                 with this policy. Other policies in the General Plan indicate
                 where differences in scale may be acceptable in order to
                 meet State-mandated housing requirements and other
                 community development goals. The Town has developed
                 design guidelines and zoning regulations to help make these
                 determinations.
                                                                                                              3·21

   1.05   Retain the limited areas planned for multifamily residential  •	   Zoning Ordinance
          development and discourage General Plan amendments                 (minimum densities)
          and rezonings of such areas to office or other uses. Areas    •	   Housing Element
          zoned for multifamily residential use should not be
          developed with single family detached homes.
          This will enable the Town to maintain sufficient land to
          comply with its state-mandated Regional Housing Needs
          Allocation.
   1.0 6  Consider the cumulative effects of development on             •	   CEQA

          This policy is intended to protect Danville’s hillsides,           Ordinance
          ridgelines, creeks, and other important scenic or natural
          resources. Consistent with the policies under Goal 2,
          development on visually or environmentally sensitive sites
          should set aside substantial areas as open space.
   1.0 8  Protect existing residential neighborhoods from intrusion     •	   Zoning Ordinance

          of Danville General Plan in effect on November 7, 2000,
          were reaffirmed and readopted by the voters of the Town
          in an election held on November 7, 2000. The lands with
          those Land Use Designations are graphically depicted on
          the Land Use map contained in the General Plan. Until
          November 7, 2020, the Land Use Designations for those
          properties may be amended only by one of the following
          two procedures:
          a) By a vote of the people at an election, or
          b) By a 4/5 vote of the Town Council if the Town Council,
              after a public hearing, makes one of the following
              findings that is supported by substantial evidence in the
              record:
              (i) That approval of the land use amendment is
                   necessary to avoid an unconstitutional taking of a
                   landowner’s property rights and that the new land
                   use is only the minimum necessary to avoid the
                   unconstitutional taking of the landowner’s property
                   rights.
              (ii) That approval of the land use amendment is
                   necessary to comply with state or federal law
                   and that the new land use is only the minimum
                   necessary to comply with such laws.
          Prior to amending the General Plan to redesignate land
          pursuant to subparagraphs (i) or (ii) above, the Town
          Council shall hold at least two noticed public hearings for
          the purposes of receiving testimony and evidence from
          the applicant and the public on the proposed amendment
          and any findings proposed in connection with such an
          amendment. This hearing shall be in addition to any other
          public hearings regularly required for a General Plan
          amendment.

             Danville’s neighborhoods are the essence of the community.
             Most of the Town’s neighborhoods will experience minimal
             change during the next 20 years, but will continue to mature
             and evolve. Continued reinvestment in the housing stock is
             strongly supported. The positive qualities that define each
             neighborhood should be maintained and enhanced, thus
             enabling the Town to retain its outstanding quality of life.
   5.02      Ensure that residential alterations and additions are                •	   Development Review

             impacts (on privacy, shadows, parking, etc.).
 The policies below help implement State housing law and reinforce the Housing Element of the General Plan.
 All communities in California are required by State law to provide for their share of regional housing needs.
 The Town is obligated to plan for sufficient land zoned at sufficient densities to meet its assigned needs.

The goals and policies in this section are organized under two headings:
   •	      Growth Management
   •	      Intergovernmental Coordination
A complete description of the implementation measures may be found at the end of this Chapter. Cross-
references to other sections of the General Plan (e.g., transportation) are included as appropriate, thereby
ensuring that all growth management policies required under Contra Costa County Measure J are referenced
in this section.

                 needed services, mobility improvements, natural resource protection, and minimization of
                 public infrastructure costs.

                 economic development programs and strategies. This                   Strategy

                 The Town will promote Danville businesses and seek to avoid
                 the loss of sales tax dollars to other communities. Examples
                 include the “Shop Danville First” campaign which developed
                 a logo, tagline, and website promoting local retailers.
  10.02          Leverage local assets and attractions to define a unique         •	 Economic Development

                 conditions in order to identify underserved sectors, growth          Strategy
                 opportunities, and future business development strategies.
                 Business license data can be used to solicit feedback on
                 the types of services the Town can provide and the types of
                 businesses the Town attracts. Similarly, sales tax collection
                 data is useful in assessing trends and underserved sectors.
                 Data collection efforts could also include marketing
                 workshops, focus groups and shopper surveys to assess why
                 people shop (or don’t shop) in Danville.

          Danville has pioneered the concept of the “Danville

                    Incubator space is similar to conventional office space but
                    is designed to facilitate synergistic relationships between
                    different enterprises. Such space is often marketed to start-

                    services. Appropriate locations could include those areas
                    where office uses are currently permitted, such as the upper
                    floors of multi-story buildings in Downtown Danville, vacant
                    retail space in older shopping centers, service commercial
                    areas, and the controlled manufacturing area near Crow

    DANVILLE’S BIKE ROUTES
    Danville recognizes three different classes of
    bicycle routes:
    Class I routes operate within a completely
    separate right-of-way and are exclusively used
    by bicycles and pedestrians. The Iron Horse
    Trail is probably the best known Class I route
    in Danville.

    Class II routes, commonly called bike lanes,
    operate in a striped, restricted lane within
    the right-of-way of a street. Motor vehicles
    are prohibited from using this lane, although
    cross-f lows in and out of parking spaces and
    onto cross-streets are permitted. An example
    is the bike lane along Camino Tassajara.

    Class III routes, or bike routes, operate within
    moving traffic lanes and are distinguished only

             Streets are the foundation of Danville’s circulation system.
             As indicated in Figure 11, the Town’s streets are designated
             as major and minor arterials, major and minor collectors,
             neighborhood access streets, and local streets. Design
             standards for each street type help to ensure that multiple
             modes of travel are safely and efficiently accommodated.

                 additional policies on transportation fees and impacts.)
  11.0 6         Create a connected circulation system in which it becomes     •	 Development Review
                 easier to walk or bicycle from one point in Danville to       •	 Engineering Design Standards
                 another. On cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets, encourage       •	 Capital Improvement
                 pedestrian and bicycle paths that extend through to nearby       Program
                 streets, making it easier to reach destinations such as
                 schools, parks, shopping, and public transit.
                 This policy supports the concept of “connectivity” in
                 Danville’s transportation network. The idea is to reduce
                 travel distances by eliminating barriers and providing less
                 circuitous routes. In general, grid street patterns provide
                 better connectivity than curvilinear streets and cul-de-sacs.
                 However, even in suburban settings, neighborhoods can
                 become better connected through paths and walkways, bicycle
                 and pedestrian bridges, and openings in fences or walls.

    COMPLETE STREETS IN DANVILLE
    In May 2012, the MTC and ABAG boards adopted Resolution 4035 requiring local governments to
    formally adopt a “Complete Streets Policy” by January 31, 2013. Having such a policy will become
    a prerequisite for receiving certain state and federal transportation funds. This requirement is an
    implementation of the Complete Streets Act of 2008 (AB 1358), which requires the General Plan
    Mobility Element to contain provisions for a balanced multi-modal network of streets, roads, and
    highways for safe and convenient travel in a manner that is suitable and based on local conditions.
    The “Complete Streets” design concepts are not new to the Town of Danville, as the Town has been
    designing and constructing its transportation network with all users in mind. Consistent with MTC
    requirements, the Mobility Element incorporates Complete Streets principles:
    1. Serve all Users: All transportation improvements will be planned, designed, constructed, operated
    and maintained to support safe and convenient access for all users, and increase mobility for
    walking, bicycling and transit use, wherever possible while promoting safe and accessible operations
    for all users.
    2. Context Sensitivity: Transportation projects will be sensitive to their surrounding context,
    contribute to Danville’s sense of place, and be designed with opportunities for community input.
    3. Multi-Departmental Approach: All Town departments whose missions affect the Town’s roadway
    system will incorporate a complete streets approach in their projects and activities.
    4. Comprehensive Application: The complete streets philosophy applies not only to the construction
    of new roads but also the reconstruction, repaving, and retrofitting of existing roads, and the
    construction of privately built roads intended for public use.
                                                                                                       4·41

I.      INTRODUCTION
A.      COMMUNITY CONTEXT
Danville began as a small rural village formed in the 1850s to serve commercial
and cultural needs of the surrounding agricultural areas. With the construction
of the Bay Bridge in 1936 and the Caldecott Tunnel in 1937, Central Contra Costa
County became accessible to the large and growing employment centers in San
Francisco and other parts of the Bay Area. A significant amount of residential
development began to occur in the San Ramon Valley during the late 1940s. The
first large residential subdivisions in Danville occurred during this period.
During the 1950s and 1960s, Danville evolved into a desirable residential
community. The completion of I-680 in 1968 greatly improved access to the area
and led to increased amounts of residential development activity throughout the
San Ramon Valley. During the 1970s, major changes began to occur in the San
Ramon Valley. Large new developments were proposed and construction began,
including the residential community of Blackhawk to the northeast of Danville
and the Bishop Ranch Business Park in San Ramon. Danville was one of three
Tri-Valley Region communities (covering the communities of Danville, San
Ramon, Dublin, Pleasanton, and Livermore and occupying the valley areas
identified as San Ramon, Livermore and Amador Valleys) to incorporate in the
early 1980s.      During the 1980s and 1990s, the San Ramon Valley, the
northernmost of the three valley areas constituting the Tri-Valley Region)
became a focus of major development activity. Once a predominantly residential
and rural area, the San Ramon Valley has experienced major residential,
commercial and office growth, which has altered its historic rural character.
B.      ROLE AND CONTENT OF HOUSING ELEMENT
Section 65583 of the State Government Code establishes the required components
of housing elements. The housing element must make adequate provision for the
existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the
community.
In brief, Danville’s housing element must contain:
       An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and
        constraints relevant to meeting these needs;
       A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies
        relative to the maintenance, improvement and development of housing;
       A program that sets forth a schedule of actions (implementation
        strategies) during the planning period, each with a timeline, to implement
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                     1

        the policies and to achieve the goals and quantified objectives of the
        housing element;
       An identification of adequate sites to meet the community’s need for
        housing (including its need for housing for extremely low, very low, low,
        moderate, and above moderate income households); and
       An identification of governmental and non-governmental constraints,
        coupled with a program that, as appropriate and legally feasible, serves to
        remove or mitigate identified governmental constraints to housing
        development.
Lack of affordable housing is a problem affecting the greater Bay Area Region that
cannot be addressed solely on a local level. The inability to pay for decent housing,
paying higher amounts for housing, and the inadequacy of public resources to
support affordable housing development are problems that cross jurisdictional
boundaries.
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is the Council of Government
(COG) for the Bay Area Region and is the agency assigned by the State Department
of Housing and Community Development to allocate regional housing need for
cities and counties for the nine-county Bay Area Region. Danville's Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) is presented in Table 1.

C.      DATA SOURCES
Various sources of information are used to prepare the Housing Element. Much
of the data used to compile the document was taken from the 1990, 2000, and
2010 Decennial Census counts and from various American Community Survey
(ACS) 3- and 5-Year Estimates (published by the Bureau of Census).
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                                        2

It is noteworthy that, as compared to data taken from decennial census counts,
the ACS data has a measurably larger margin of error. Other data sources used
included demographic and housing data provided in various ABAG Projections
publications, information compiled by the California Department of Finance, and
information compiled by the Danville Community Development Department.
D.      PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
In preparation of the Draft Danville 2014-2022 Housing Element, the public was
provided an opportunity to review and comment on the draft document and the
associated environmental documents. Notice of the availability of the Draft
Danville 2014-2022 Housing Element for review and the intent to adopt a Negative
Declaration of Environmental Significance for the policy document was posted on
the Town’s website, posted at community locations, posted by the Contra Costa
County Clerk, and published (on November 10, 2014) in the San Ramon Valley
Times.
A total of over 600 groups and individuals were notified of the public hearings for
the 2014-2022 Housing Element before the Planning Commission and the Town
Council, including the following groups:
       Alameda and Contra Costa Counties
       Town of Danville Departments
       Tri-Valley region cities
       Other local agencies and special districts
       Transportation committees
       Danville Chamber of Commerce
       San Ramon Valley Unified School District
       Danville Library
       For-profit and non-profit housing developers
       Housing advocacy groups
       Real estate associations
       Bay Area Council
       Home Builders Association of Northern California
       California Alliance for Jobs
       Greenbelt Alliance
       Faith community
       Social service providers
In addition, mailed notification of the public hearings for the 2014-2022 Housing
Element update were sent to all agencies and organizations copied on the
Housing and Community Development (HCD) agency comment letter for the
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                      3

Danville 2007-2014 Housing Element. By way of articles placed onto the Town’s
website, residents and business property owners in the Town were advised of
the 2014-2022 Housing Element update effort. The articles discussed the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) process that was utilized to
establish Danville’s allocation of the projected housing need for the 2014-2022
planning period. The articles summarized the content requirements of the
housing element; the time frame for its preparation and submittal to the HCD;
the availability of a draft document for public review; and also provided
direction to interested individuals and groups as to the manner that they could
direct questions and comments to the Town regarding the update. Following a
formal review and comment period, the Town made revisions to the draft
document in response to comments received. In advance of the Planning
Commission’s December 17, 2014 public hearing on the draft 2014–2022 Housing
Element, the Town posted a copy of the updated draft document on the Town’s
website.
As required by the Government Code, the Town reached out to all economic
segments of the community in the preparation of the 2014-2022 Housing
Element. The outreach process started in Fall 2012, as the Regional Housing
Needs Allocation (RHNA) for the 2014-2022 period was being finalized. At the
time, the Town was adopting its 2030 General Plan, which called for rezoning
multifamily sites to ensure sufficient capacity to meet the RHNA.
More than 25 study sessions or public hearings were held as part of the General
Plan Update process. Every Danville household received post card notification of
the public hearings and was invited and encouraged to attend. Attendance was
particularly high at the hearings convened between November 2012 and March
2013, with several hundred people in attendance at each meeting. More than 20
hours of testimony and discussion regarding housing needs, affordability, and
housing sites was received. Danville residents, housing advocacy groups, lower
income persons, seniors, students, environmental groups, representatives of the
faith community, and developers were all part of the discussion. Press coverage
of these meetings was extensive.
The feedback received at these meetings has shaped the policies and programs in
the 2014-2022 Housing Element. The list of housing opportunity sites directly
reflects input from the public. The strategies to meet housing needs have been
developed in an effort to meet the RHNA obligations and balance input from
hundreds of residents on how to best meet the Town’s housing needs.

E.      RELATIONSHIP TO GENERAL PLAN
The Danville 2014-2022 Housing Element is a required component of the Danville
General Plan. The Town of Danville adopted its current General Plan in March
2013 (i.e., the Danville 2030 General Plan). The Town will ensure consistency
between the 2014-2022 Housing Element and the Danville General Plan through the
Housing Element update process and any subsequent update or amendment of the
2030 Plan. As may be determined necessary, and consistent with SB 244 (Wolf,
2011), the Town will amend the land use element of the Danville 2030 General Plan
to indicate that a determination has been made that there are no unincorporated
disadvantaged communities (DUCs) present in Danville’s Planning Area as
depicted in the general plan. If the 2030 Plan is amended during the planning
period covered by the 2014-2022 Housing Element, the Town will make
conforming amendments to the Housing Element, and/or consider whether the
amendments under consideration to the 2030 Plan would impede the Town’s
ability to meet its RHNA.
The 2014-2022 Housing Element establishes goals, quantified objectives, and
policies, accompanied with a detailed work plan (i.e., implementation strategies).
It was established through the Danville 2007-2014 Housing Element that the Town
had a RHNA “shortfall”. The analysis preformed for the RHNA shortfall
established that Danville needed to fill a shortfall of multifamily land with
minimum development densities adequate to accommodate the needs of 187
extremely low and very low income households and a shortfall of multifamily land
with minimum development densities adequate to accommodate the needs of 34
low income households. In response to the identified RHNA shortfall, by way of
the Town’s adoption of the 2030 General Plan in March 2013, designated 8.75 acres
to a newly established Residential – Multifamily – High (25-30 units/acre) land use
designation and designated an additional 2.0 acres to the Residential – Multifamily
– High/Medium (20-25 units per acre) land use designation. The High/Medium
land use designation was recalibrated by the adoption of the 2030 Plan from an 18
units/acre minimum density to the requisite 20 units/acre minimum density to
qualify as land suitable to accommodate the needs of low income households.

   Danv ille’s major creeks (i.e., San Ramon
Creek, Sycamore Creek, Green Valley Creek, and
Alamo Creek) offer unique opportunities for
trails. Although current development patterns
preclude continuous public access along some
sections of these creeks, opportunities remain
for incorporating the creeks into the overall trail
system. These opportunities, as well as linkages to
the state and regional parks, are currently being
considered by the Town.

adopted in 2006 served to update and consolidate

     The Parks Recreation and Arts Strategic Plan is based on an assessment of current and future
     needs in Danville, input from the community, and an evaluation of existing park facilities and
     resources. It is predicated on the following seven basic “Vision Principles”:
     1.	 Parks are community places.
     2.	 Parks are interwoven into the community.
     3.	 Communit y members are engaged in
            creating community spaces and becoming
            park stewards.
     4.	 Amenities are located to promote comfort
            and sociability of public spaces.
     5.	 Activities enhance the use of public spaces
            and community sociability.
     6.	 Partnerships sustain parks, recreation,
            and the arts.
     7.	 Cultural arts enhance the livability of the
            community.
     Each of these principles is supplemented by
     strategies, along with specif ic short-term
     action steps for the Town’s community parks
     and its trail system.

II.    HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
A.     POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AND TRENDS
1. Population, Housing Units, and Households
The 2010 Census set Danville’s population at 42,039 persons, inclusive of 243
persons in group quarters. The 2010 population was split between 20,313 males
(48.3%) and 21,726 females (51.7%). The 2010 Census indicated 84.4% of all
households were owner-occupied households (13,020 households) with the
remaining 15.6% of households being renter-occupied households (2,400
households). At the time, 3.2% of all housing units were vacant (514 housing
units). At the time of the 2010 Census, Danville contained 15,934 housing units,
consisting of 12,067 detached single family residential units (75.7% of the total
units); 2,900 attached single family residential units (18.2%); 153 multifamily
units in buildings with 2-4 units per building (1.0%); and 797 multifamily units in
buildings with 5-plus units per building (5.0%). (Refer to Table 2) The 2010
Census estimated that there were 514 vacant housing units in Danville,
representing 3.3% of the housing units. The number of households in a
community is the number of occupied housing units. Danville’s vacancy rate has
generally been in the range of 2% to 3%, meaning there are generally 2% to 3%
less households than there are housing units. During the Great Recession the
Town experienced an unusually high vacancy rate, which converted to a drop in
the number of households present. The number of households in Danville was
established by the 2010 Census to be 15,420 households. The number of
households increased by 4,253 (a 38.1% increase) between 1990 and 2010, with
the vast majority of the increase (i.e., 3,649 households – or 85.8% of the change)
occurring between 1990 and 2000. Projections 2013 forecasts the number of
households in Danville will increase by 520 households (+3.4%) between 2010
and 2020, taking the total to 15,940 households. To put these increases in context,
the 1990 Census and 2010 Census indicated the increase in households for the
entire Tri-Valley Region was 40,130 households (a 57.4% increase) from 1990 to
2010, taking the number of households from 69,866 to 109,996, with just over one
half of the increase (i.e., 20,653 households – or 51.4%) occurring between 1990
and 2000. Projections 2013 forecasts the number of households in the Tri-Valley
Region will increase by 10,814 households (+9.8%) between 2010 and 2020, taking
the total to 120,810 households. As a result of the Great Recession, Danville and
the other cities making up the Tri-Valley Region saw a decline in the number of
households after the tabulation of household in the 2010 Census. The decline
resulting from the Great Recession (a result in a temporary upward spike in
vacancy rates for the cities in the Region) is reflected in data from the 2006-2010
ACS, which indicates a drop from the 2010 Census totals of 245 households for
Danville (a 1.6% decline) and 3,556 households for the Tri-Valley Region (a 3.2%
decline).

2. Age Characteristics
The median age of Danville residents in 2010 was calculated to be 44.5 years
(compared to a median age of 38.5 for Contra Costa County as a whole). (Refer to
Table 4) Age trends for Danville are revealed when Census 2000 data is compared
to Census 2010 data. Danville’s population is trending older, as evidenced by the
relative decrease in the percentage of residents under five years of age (i.e., 2,961
persons for 7.1% of total population in 2000 versus 2,044 persons for 4.9% of the
population in 2010) and the relative increase in the percentage of residents 65 and
older in age (i.e., 4,300 persons for 10.3% of total population in 2000 versus 6,048
persons for 14.4% of the population in 2010).

3. Race and Ethnicity
Danville’s population is less racially diverse than Contra Costa as a whole. (Refer
to Table 5) The 2010 Census indicates that Contra Costa County is now a
“minority majority” County, with 52.2% of the population identifying as non-
white. Data from the 2000 Census and 2010 Census also indicates both jurisdictions
are becoming more diverse over time. The data indicates decreases in the
percentage of residents identifying as white, with a decrease in Danville from
83.0% to 78.1% and in the County from 57.9% to 47.8% between the two survey
periods.
4. Employment
Up until the early 1980’s, the Tri-Valley Region was primarily a bedroom
community. Projections 1994 indicated that the Tri-Valley Region had 51,386 total
households, 76,875 employed residents, and 48,775 total jobs in 1980. This meant
that the area had a net surplus of housing as a function of available area jobs.
Specifically, there were 0.63 jobs present in the area per employed resident in 1980.
For its portion of the jobs/housing picture, Danville was estimated to have had 0.47
jobs per employed resident in 1980.
The Tri Valley Region experienced massive job growth along with an extensive
amount of residential development between 1980 and 2000. The 2000 Census
indicated that the Tri-Valley Region had 161,820 total jobs in 2000 (a 230+%
increase from 1980). While some of this job growth is likely attributable to
changes implemented in the methodology to count jobs (i.e., how home-based
jobs were accounted for), it is clear that the increase in total jobs outpaced the
development of total households in the area. Households were estimated to
have increased by around 75% to 90,159 total households over the same period of
time. (Refer to Tables 5 and 6) The 2000 Census indicated that the number of
employed residents in the area has increased by around 95% between 1980 and
2000, rising to 150,080 employed residents by 2000.
The growth the area experienced favored the development of new jobs over new
housing. The ratio of jobs per household shifted from 0.95 jobs per household to
1.79 jobs per household in the twenty year period. Danville’s status as a net
provider for housing to the area and region solidified during this period when
the total number of jobs in the Tri-Valley Region caught up, and surpassed, the
total number of employed residents in the area.

 Projections 2013 forecasts that the prior trends in place for the region continue
 through to the year 2020. Projections 2013 estimates that total jobs in the Tri-Valley
 Region will increase by 33,950 (20.3%) in the decade, rising to 200,970 total jobs
 from the 2010 total of 167,020 jobs. Projections 2013 estimates the number of
 households added to the area will increase by 25,436 (6.8%) in the decade, rising to
 120,810 households from the 2010 total of 109,996 households. Projections 2013
 estimates the population added to the area will increase by 27,824 (9.0%) in the
 decade, rising to 339,300 persons from the 2010 total of 311,476 persons.
 As the current decade concludes, the Tri-Valley area will have experienced a 40-
 year conversion from bedroom community to major employment center. Total jobs
 in the area will have increased by more than a 412% increase (200,970 jobs
 projected in 2020 compared to 48,775 jobs estimated to have been present in
 1980). Meanwhile, total households in the area will have increased by over 250%

in the same time frame (120,810 households projected in 2020 compared to 47,081
households estimated to have been present in 1980). Total population in the area
will have increased by over 230% in the time frame (339,300 persons projected in
2020 compared to 145,807 persons estimated to have been present in 1980).
B.      HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
1. Household Type
Housing needs and/or desires vary with household type. According to the 2010
Census, a large percentage of Danville’s households are family households (77.7%).
For Contra Costa County at large, the 2010 Census indicates that 70.4% of
households were family households. Except for the larger number of households
that are family households, household compositions in Danville are generally
similar to household compositions present at the countywide level.
Danville has a wide range of housing product types. Home to one of the State’s
first Planned Unit Developments, Danville has, since the 1970’s, provided for
mixed residential densities in its various neighborhoods. As of January 1, 2014,
Danville’s housing stock consisted of 12,091 detached single family residential
units (75.7% of all units); 2,904 attached single family residential units (18.2%);
153 multifamily residential structures with 2 to 4 units (1.0%); and 797
multifamily residential structures with 5 or more units (5.0%). (Refer to Table 2)
2. Household Size
The 2010 Census determined Danville’s average household size to be 2.74 persons
per household (down from 2.78 for the average household size determined by the
2000 Census). Both the California Department of Finance and the Bureau of Census
had shown a trend for household size decline in Danville – but the Department of
Finance has shown an incremental increase each year since 2010, with household
size estimated to again having reached 2.78 persons by the start of 2014.
The Bureau of Census estimated Danville’s the average household size at 3.15 in
the 1980 Census (Refer to Table 3) The reduction in the average household size
has impacted Danville’s rate of population increase. While the number of
households increased by 4.1% from 2000 to 2010 (from 14,816 to 15,420), Danville’s
population only increased 0.8% (from 41,715 to 42,039) – with this limited increase
also influenced by a temporary rise in the vacancy rate of housing units in Danville.

3. Household Income
Household income greatly influences housing opportunities as it directly affects a
household’s ability to balance expenditures on housing costs against expenditures
for other, basic necessities. Average household incomes for the San Ramon Valley
are high compared to average incomes for the County and for the Bay Area Region.
The 2000 Census estimated median household incomes in Danville to be $114,064
(as compared to a median income Countywide of $63,675). For context, converting
this estimate to 2011 dollars raises the median household income to $153,986, with
the converted median income Countywide at $85,961. Estimates from the 2007-
2011 ACS indicate Danville experienced a 13.4% drop in median income from 2000
to 2011 in adjusted dollars, with the 2011 median income estimated to be $133,360.
Median income Countywide also dropped in the period, falling to $79,135, a 7.9%
drop from the income levels of 2000.
The reported poverty rate in Danville was 2.2% according to the 2010 Census and
was 4.3% in 2011 according to the 2007-2011 ACS.
4. Overpaying for Housing
Median income levels for a community only partially reflect how household
income levels may affect the ability to secure housing. According to the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), households should
spend less than 30 percent of their income on housing, including utilities, taxes, and
insurance. However, an estimated 45 percent of the households in Contra Costa
County have a cost burden of more than 30 percent. This is an increase of 42
percent since 2000.
The 2006-2010 ACS estimated that 465 of Danville’s 2,205 renter-occupied
households present at the time (21.1%) assigned between 30% and 50% of their total
income to housing costs in 2010, with another 470 renter-occupied households
(21.3%) estimated to be assigning over 50% of their total income to housing costs at
that time. The 2006-2010 ACS estimated that 3,115 of Danville’s 12,970 owner-
occupied households present at the time (24.0%) assigned between 30% and 50% of
their total income to housing costs in 2010, with another 2,240 owner-occupied
households (17.3%) estimated to be assigning over 50% of their total income to
housing costs. (Refer to Table 9)
Incurring housing costs in excess of 50% of household income is particularly a
concern to lower income households which have little margin to cover extra
expenditures.

    Supportive housing is a housing option that has a demonstrated ability to assist
    extremely low income and very low income households.
    Housing policies established for this planning period should favor assistance to
    extremely low income and very low income households where such policies would
    lead to deeper income subsidies, housing supportive services, or shared housing
    options, or rent subsidies/vouchers or the equivalent.
    5. Overcrowding
    In order to avoid extraordinary housing costs, many lower income households rent
    smaller apartments or live with friends or relatives to economize on housing costs.
    For the purposes of this report, overcrowding is defined as households with more
    than one occupant per room.
    The 1990 Census reported overcrowding in 66 of Danville’s 11,064 occupied units
    (<0.5%). The 2000 Census reported overcrowding in 157 (1.0%) of Danville’s
    15,027 occupied units. The 2006-2010 ACS estimated that 75 owner-occupied
    units in Danville were over-crowded and 25 owner-occupied units were

    considered to be severely over-crowded. The 2006-2010 ACS estimated that 35
    renter-occupied units in Danville were over-crowded and that there were no
    severely over-crowded renter-occupied units. The 2006-2010 ACS defined over-
    crowded conditions as a condition of greater than one but less than one and one
    half persons per room. Severely over-crowded conditions were considered to be
    present by the 2006-2010 ACS were greater than one and one half persons per
    room were determined to be present. (Refer to Table 10)

      b. An “overcrowded” housing condition is considered to exist where there is greater than one but less
           than or equal to one and one half persons per room present.
      c. A “severely overcrowded” housing condition is considered to exist where there is greater than one
           and one half persons per room present.
    Overcrowding in Danville is not considered to be a significant issue. Where
    overcrowding is present in Danville, it tends to be larger family households in
    owner-occupied homes with multiple bedrooms, rather than families crowding
    into one bedroom rental apartments.
    C.       SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
    Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due
    to their special needs and/or circumstances. Special circumstances may be
    related to one’s employment and income, family characteristics, disability, and
    household characteristics. As a result, certain residents may experience a higher
    prevalence of lower income and/or housing cost burden, overcrowding, or other
    housing problems.

In the context of this document, special needs groups include the following:
senior households, physically and mentally disabled (including developmental
disabled) persons, large family households, single-parent households (female-
headed households with children in particular), homeless persons, and
agricultural workers. This section provides discussion of the housing needs
facing each particular group as well as programs and services available to
address their housing needs. The US Census Bureau’s 2008-2012 ACS provides
the most current data available and is the primary source used to estimate the
size of a particular group. Table 11 summarizes the special needs groups.
1. Senior Households
Senior households have special housing needs primarily due to three major
concerns - physical disabilities/limitations; income; and health care costs. In
2000, 4,300 persons (10.3% of Danville’s total population) were >65 years in age.
By 2010 that number had increased to 6,048 (14.4% of the total population). To
underscore Danville’s trend towards an older population, the 1990 Census
showed 2,658 persons were >65 years in age in Danville and the 1980 Census
showed that only 4.9% of the Danville population was >65 years in age (1,450
persons).
Some of the special needs of seniors are as follows:
    • Limited Income - Many seniors have limited income available for health
        and other expenses. The 2011-2013 ACS estimated that 6.3% of persons 65
        years and over had income in the prior twelve months below the poverty
        level.
    • Disabilities - The 2011-2013 ACS estimates that 2,001 of Danville’s 7,209
        seniors 65 years or over in age has a disability limitation (27.7% of
        seniors).
    • The 2011-2013 ACS estimated that there were 1,742 households in Danville
        with one or more person present 65 years and over. Because of physical
        and/or other limitations, seniors may have difficulty in carrying out
        regular home maintenance or repair activities.
Various programs such as congregate care, supportive services, rental subsidies,
and housing rehabilitation assistance can address the special needs of seniors.
For the frail elderly, or those with disabilities, housing with architectural design
features that accommodate disabilities can help ensure continued independent
living. Elderly with mobility/self-care limitations also benefit from
transportation alternatives.

The Contra Costa County Advisory Council on Aging has adopted Best Practice
Development Guidelines for multifamily Senior Housing projects. These
guidelines provide a framework to help guide the planning, design, and review
of new senior housing developments in the County. The guidelines are an
information tool for local community groups, architects, planners, and
developers. Senior housing with supportive services can be provided for those
who require assistance with daily living.
Social and supportive services are available in Contra Costa County through
various agencies and organizations, including the County Area Agency on Aging
and the John Muir Senior Services Program. Multiple service providers offer an
array of assistance including Alzheimer’s service programs, respite care, day
programs, addiction services, financial assistance, and Meals on Wheels.
The County Area Agency on Aging, in particular, offers information services for
seniors on a variety of topics, including: health, housing, nutrition, activities,
help in home, employment, legal matters, transportation, financial or personal
problems, paralegal advice, health screening, and day activities for the disabled.
(Refer to Tables 11 and 12)
2. Persons with Disabilities
Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from
working, restrict one’s mobility, or make it difficult to care for them. Disabled
persons often have special housing needs, may have limited earning capacity,
and often incur higher health costs due to the disability. Some residents suffer
from disabilities that require living in a supportive or institutional setting. The
U.S. Census Bureau defines six types of disabilities: hearing, vision, cognitive,
ambulatory, self-care, and independent living difficulties.
The 2011-2013 3-Year ACS estimated that 3,012 disabled persons resided in
Danville (with a margin of error estimated to be +/-542 persons), representing
approximately 7.1% of Danville’s total population (+/-1.3%).
The breakdown of disabled persons in Danville in the six categories was
estimated as follows: 1,129 persons with a hearing difficulty; 228 persons with a
vision difficulty; 1,313 persons with a cognitive difficulty; 1,473 persons with an
ambulatory difficulty; 787 persons with a self-care difficulty; and 1,330 persons
with an independent living difficulty.
It is noted that the disabilities are not category-exclusive (i.e., one person may
have multiple disabilities) and the estimates have a high margin of error.

  Notes:
      a. The dashes (“-“) indicate no facilities of that type shown on State database for Danville as of review date.
      b. The specialized care columns are not mutually exclusive.
      c. “Adult Day Program Facility” means a community-based facility or program that provides care to
           persons 18 years of age or older in need of personal services, supervision, or assistance essential for
           sustaining the activities of daily living or for the protection of these individuals on less than a 24-hour
           basis
      d. “Adult Residential Facilities” are facilities of any capacity that provide 24-hour non-medical care for
           adults ages 18 through 59, who are unable to provide for their own daily needs. Adults may be
           physically handicapped, developmentally disabled, and/or mentally disabled.
      e. “Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly” (RCFE) provide care, supervision and assistance with
           activities of daily living, such as bathing and grooming and may also provide incidental medical
           services. The facilities provide services to persons 60 years of age and over and persons under 60 with
           compatible needs. RCFEs may also be known as assisted living facilities, retirement homes and board
           and care homes. The facilities can range in size from six beds or less to over 100 beds. The residents in
           these facilities require varying levels of personal care and protective supervision.
      f. "Crisis Nursery" means a facility licensed to provide short-term, 24-hour non-medical residential care
           and supervision for children under six years of age, who are either: (a) voluntarily placed by a parent or
           legal guardian due to a family crisis or a stressful situation, for no more than 30 days, or (b) temporarily
           placed by the county child welfare services agency for typically no more than 14 days.
      g. "Group Home" means a facility which provides 24-hour-a-day care and supervision to children
           (generally nonmedical care); provides services to a specific client group; and maintains a structured
           environment, with such services provided at least in part by staff employed by the licensee. Since small
           family and foster family homes, by definition, care for six or fewer children only, any facility providing
           24-hour care for seven or more children must be licensed as a group home facility.

  h. Small Family Homes provide 24-hour-a-day care in the licensee's family residence for six or fewer
     children who are mentally disabled, developmentally disabled, or physically handicapped, and who
     require special care and supervision as a result of such disabilities.
  i. Foster Family Homes provide 24-hour care and supervision in the licensee's family residence for no more
     than six children. Care is provided to children who are mentally disabled, developmentally disabled, or
     physically handicapped, children who have been removed from their home because of neglect or abuse,
     and children who require special health care needs and supervision as a result of such disabilities.
  j. “Family Child Care Homes” must be in the licensee's own home. A FCCH reflects a home-like
     environment where non-medical care and supervision is provided for periods of less than 24 hours.
     Small Family Child Care Homes provide care to no more than 8 children. Large Family Child Care
     Homes provide care to no more than 14 children.
  j. “Child Care Centers” (CCCs) are usually located in a commercial building. Non-medical care and
     supervision is provided for infant to school-age children in a group setting for periods of less than 24
     hours.
The living arrangement of disabled persons depends on the severity of the
disability. Many live at home independently or with other family members. To
maintain independent living, disabled persons may need assistance. This can
include special housing design features for the disabled, income support for
those who are unable to work, and in-home supportive services for persons with
medical conditions among others. Services are typically provided by both public
and private agencies. It is recognized that there is a scarcity of appropriate
housing for persons with disabilities and that there is a need for more accessible,
adaptable, and affordable housing.
The County has provided HOME funds to several projects in the County for
disabled populations, including: Belle Terre located in Lafayette; Berrellesa
Palms located in Martinez; and Third Avenue located in Walnut Creek. The
development of these projects reflects a growing recognition of the significant
housing needs of the disabled. The County Health Services Department, in
cooperation with the Department of Conservation and Development, uses
Mental Health Services Act funds to support permanent supportive housing,
with seven projects funded to date.
Both the federal Fair Housing Amendment Act and the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act direct local governments to make reasonable
accommodations (i.e., modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other
land use regulations when such accommodations may be necessary to afford
disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.
The Town analyzed its zoning regulations, permitting procedures, development
standards, and building codes to identify potential constraints for housing for
persons with disabilities. The Town’s findings of that analysis are described
below.
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                                              23

a. Zoning Regulations
State law preempts local zoning controls over certain licensed residential care
facilities. If a licensed facility serves six or fewer persons (a “small family care
facility”), the law states this is a residential use and, therefore, cannot be treated
any differently than a typical family living situation. This means that the Town
cannot require any special permits, business license, home occupation permit,
fire code restrictions, building codes, etc. unless such is required of any other
family dwelling. Occupancy (i.e., the number of people in the family) is limited
by the Uniform Housing Code, which applies to all residences, and is based on
the size of each bedroom.
A residential care facility serving between seven and twelve clients (a “large
family care facility”) may operate in all residential zones upon submittal and
approval of a Land Use Permit. Criteria that would be used to review the merits
of such permits would be limited to specific performance standards (primarily
traffic generation and safety standards) and are not specific to the proposed use.
Occupancy standards for residential care facilities are the same as those for all
other residential uses as promulgated by the California State Fire Marshal’s
Office. The Town has not adopted a minimum spacing standard for residential
care facilities. Except as provided under Government Code Section 65008, the
Town cannot impose different requirements on residential developments which
are subsidized, financed, insured or otherwise publically assisted than are
different than would be imposed on non-assisted developments.
The Land Use Element of the General Plan provides for the development of
multifamily housing in the four land use categories, the fourth category - i.e.,
Multifamily – High Density (25 – 30 units per acre) - having been established
through the adoption of the Danville 2030 General Plan. Zoning districts
deemed consistent with these land use categories include all the M-Districts
listed in the Municipal Code and the P-1 District. Regular multifamily housing
for persons with special needs, such as apartments for seniors and for persons
with disabilities, are considered regular residential uses permitted by right under
these land use categories and zoning districts.
Flexibility in development standards is reasonable, and provided, to
accommodate requests from persons with disabilities to ensure that homes are
accessible for the mobility impaired. The Building Division provides ongoing
assistance for rehabilitation efforts for single family properties and for public
facilities to install necessary accommodations, including installation of
accessibility ramps and railings to meet handicapped accessibility needs.
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                        24

Accommodation is given (as directed by the Town’s Reasonable Accommodation
Ordinance approved in September, 2014) for improvements needed to enhance
accessibility, regardless of whether they may result in conflicts with other
requirements in the Municipal Code (e.g., numerical and/or dimensional
requirements for parking may be modified to install handicap parking).
The Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance allows requests for reasonable
accommodation to be granted by the Chief of Planning. If the physical
expression of the reasonable accommodation is visible from the street fronting
the affected property, the Chief of Planning may refer the request to the Design
Review Board and/or to the Planning Commission. Public notice, where such
referral is made, is to be consistent with the public noticing process for
comparable items.
b. Building Codes
The Development Services Department - Building Division actively enforces 2013
California Building Code provisions that regulate the access and adaptability of
buildings to accommodate persons with disabilities. No unique restrictions are in
place that would constrain the development of housing for persons with
disabilities. Government Code Section 12955.1 directs that a minimum of 10
percent of the total dwelling units in multifamily buildings without elevators
consisting of three or more rental units or four or more condominium units abide
to the following building standards to accommodate the needs of persons with
disabilities:
      The primary entry to the dwelling unit shall be on an accessible route
       (unless exempted by a site impracticality test);
      The dwelling unit shall have an adaptable design relative to the accessible
       route through the unit, the design and location of environmental controls
       such as light switches, reinforcement of bathroom walls for retrofit for
       later accessibility improvements such as grab bars, and ability to readily
       retrofit the kitchen to accommodate the needs of an individual in a
       wheelchair;
      At least one powder room or bathroom shall be located on the primary
       entry level served by an accessible route.
c. Planning Entitlement Permitting Fees and Review Process
Development Services Department and Community Development Department
fees and development impact fees can increase the cost of housing and, therefore,
can potentially constrain the development of housing for persons with
disabilities, many of whom are of lower income due to earning limitations. The
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                    25

Town has provided fee waivers and fee deferrals, relaxed parking standards, and
authorized other incentives to reduce the cost of development for housing
projects serving special needs populations.
It is appropriate for the Town to systematically analyze its fee schedule and
planning entitlement review and permitting process on an ongoing basis to
assure reasonable accommodation is being provided to future housing projects
serving special needs groups, including seniors and persons with disabilities,
with funding assistance and other regulatory concessions/incentives.
d. Definition of Family
The Town cannot impose different requirements on residential developments, or
emergency shelters, than those imposed on developments generally because of
the race, sex, color, religion, ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, lawful
occupation, family status, disability, and/or age of the intended occupants, or
because the development is intended for occupancy by persons and families of
low, moderate, or middle income, except as provided Government Code Section
65008.
As part of the recent update to the single family residential and multifamily
regulations (see Town Council Resolution Nos. 2014-03, 2014-04 and 2014-05), the
Town formalized the definition of “Family” in the Municipal Code. The Town
does not regulate residency by discriminating between biologically related and
unrelated persons nor does it regulate or enforce the number of persons
constituting a family.
3. Developmental Disabilities
SB 812, which took effect January 2011, amended State housing element law to
require an evaluation of the special housing needs of persons with
developmental disabilities. A “developmental disability” is defined as a
disability that originates before an individual becomes 18 years old, continues or
can be expected to continue indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability
for that individual. Developmental disabilities include intellectual disabilities,
cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term does not include disabilities that
are solely physical in nature, though there are a significant number of persons
with developmental disabilities who also require adaptations in their housing to
address physical disabilities.
Most developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within
a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals may
require a supervised group living environment. Historically, the most severely

affected individuals lived in an institutional environment where on-site medical
attention and physical therapy are provided. In recent years, many adults living
in institutional settings have transitioned to community-based housing and
services. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first
housing issue for the developmental disabled is the transition from living at
home with a parent/guardian as a child to an appropriate level of independence
as an adult. The State Department of Developmental Services currently provides
community based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental
disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers,
four developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The Regional
Center of the East Bay (RCEB) serves Alameda and Contra Costa counties. RCEB
works in partnership with many individuals and other agencies to plan and
coordinate services and supports for people with developmental disabilities.
A community-based Board of Directors, which includes individuals with
developmental disabilities, family members and community leaders, provides
guidance and leadership. In addition, the Housing Consortium of the East Bay
(RCEB) provides housing outreach and support services; develops affordable
housing, partners with other nonprofit and for profit companies to secure set-
asides within larger rental communities; and owns and operates special needs
affordable housing. RCEB staff, in partnership with Developmental Disabilities
Board Area 5, provided housing need information for individuals with
developmental disabilities for Contra Costa. This data is available at the city level
and indicates that Danville has 172 developmentally disabled residents who are
considered eligible for social services from the Regional Center for the East Bay.
Of this total, 87 are 18 years of age or less, 81 are between the ages of 19 and 64,
and four are age 65 or older.
There are a number of housing types appropriate for people living with a
development disability: licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, Housing
Choice vouchers (Section 8), and affordable housing with rent restrictions may
all be appropriate options. Unless an individual is able to receive significant
subsidies, homeownership is not a viable option in Danville for the
developmentally disabled. Considerations for housing siting and development
include proximity to transit and services, and physical accessibility to the unit.
Danville will continue to support housing developments and opportunities such
as those listed above.
4. Single Parent Households
Because of their relatively lower incomes and high living expenses, single-parent
households generally have difficulty finding affordable, decent and safe housing.
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                       27

These households have special needs relating to access to childcare, health care
and other supportive services. The 2011-2013 ACS estimated that 917 of all
households in Danville (5.9%) were headed by a single parent. The 2007-2011 5-
Year ACS estimated that while only 2.9% of Danville’s households had household
incomes placing them below poverty level, household incomes of 22.3% of
female headed households were below poverty level and household incomes of
29.9% of female headed households with children under 18 were below poverty
level.
5. Large Households
Large households are defined as households containing five or more persons.
Because there is a limited supply of adequately sized households to
accommodate large households, they are considered a special need group.
Because there is often a need for large households to save for non-housing
related expenses, these households often reside in relatively smaller units,
resulting in overcrowded living conditions. The 2007-2011 ACS estimated that
1,525 Danville households included five or more people (9.9% of all households)
– qualifying them as large family households. As a subset of this total, it was
estimated there were 199 renter-occupied large family households. While large
family households do not necessarily live in overcrowded or severely
overcrowded conditions, the 2006-2010 ACS estimated there were 35 renter-
occupied overcrowded households, 75 owner-occupied overcrowded households
and 25 owner-occupied severely overcrowded households in Danville.
6. Agricultural Workers
Agricultural workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes
are earned through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. According to the
2000 Census, 16 persons in Danville were employed in the farming, forestry, and
fishing occupational category (down from an estimate of 112 persons in the 1990
Census). Farmworkers are generally considered to have special housing needs
because of their limited income and the seasonal nature of their employment.
According to the 2012 Agricultural Census, 2,049 workers were employed on farms
in Contra Costa County, with a reported 89 migrant workers. The majority of the
farmworker population in the unincorporated areas consists of resident-households
requiring permanent affordable housing rather than migratory workers with
seasonal housing needs. Currently, the Danville Municipal Code permits
farmworker housing for seasonal workers in agricultural districts (i.e., the A-2 and
A-4 zoning districts) subject to approval of a land use permit.
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                      28

The Town of Danville complies with the Employee Housing Act (California
Health and Safety Code Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6) as regards the housing
needs of agricultural workers.
7. Extremely Low Income Households
Extremely low income households – those earning less than 30 percent of area
median income – face significant housing needs. In accordance with Chapter 891,
Statutes of 2006 (AB 2634), cities must quantify the existing and projected extremely
low income households and analyze their needs.
Data from the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), taken from
the 2006-2010 ACS, estimated the number of extremely low income households in
Danville to be 625 households. Results from past decennial census counts point to
the probability that many of these households are occupied by senior citizens. As
seniors are typically on fixed incomes, an increase in rents can have a considerable
impact on extremely low income senior renters. Senior homeowners with
extremely low incomes also face significant needs related to maintaining their
homes. Again as shown by data from prior census counts, it can be assumed that
many of these extremely low income households experience overpayment and/or
have at least one type of housing problem.
Housing types to accommodate the needs of extremely low income households
include transitional and supportive housing, multifamily rental housing, rental
housing included as part of a mixed use project (e.g., residential-over-commercial
housing), factory-built housing, workforce housing and mobile homes.
8. Homeless Persons
In January 2013, the County Homeless Program staff, assisted by various
homeless service programs and volunteers, conducted the biannual homeless
census of sheltered and unsheltered people experiencing homelessness in Contra
Costa County. The survey identified 3,798 homeless persons in Contra Costa
County, including 1,092 persons (29%) categorized as chronically homeless
individuals; 851 persons (22%) categorized as chronic substance abusers; 713
persons (19%) categorized as severely mentally ill; 447 persons (12%) categorized
as victims of domestic violence; and 277 persons (7%) categorized as veterans. A
total of 2,448 of the homeless (64%) were sheltered at the time the survey was
conducted, leaving 1,350 (36%) unsheltered. The survey documented the
presence of four unsheltered homeless individuals in Danville, representing less
than 0.3% of the County-wide unsheltered population. Although the point-in-
time count identified homeless individuals within Danville, it is acknowledged
that the survey represents only a snapshot view, with the count reflective just of
the number of identified homeless on the particular day of the count. It is further
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                       29

recognized that individuals and families may move in and out of homelessness
and in and out of shelters over the course of a year. Homeless individuals and
families have the most immediate housing need of any special needs population
subgroups. They also have one of the most difficult set of housing needs to meet,
due to the diversity of the population that find themselves homeless and the
complex set of factors that would have led to homelessness.
There are no homeless shelters located within Danville. There are various
facilities located in Contra Costa County that provide shelter for homeless
individuals and families. The draft Contra Costa County Housing Element
indicates there are nine homeless shelters in the County, collectively providing
367 year-round beds. The nearest mixed population interim housing emergency
shelter facility to Danville in Contra Costa County is located in Concord – the
Concord Adult Interim Housing facility. The draft County Housing Element
indicates there are twelve transitional housing facilities in Contra Costa County,
collectively providing 340 year-round beds. The nearest transitional housing
facility to Danville in Contra Costa County is located in Richmond. The draft
County Housing Element indicates there are seventeen facilities providing
permanent housing for the homeless, collectively providing 891 year-round beds.
The nearest mixed population facility to Danville providing permanent housing
is located in Concord. There are also facilities in the Tri-Valley portion of
Alameda County that provide shelter for homeless individuals and families.
Pleasanton, Livermore, and Dublin, using a HUD Section 108 loan secured in
2002, acquired and rehabilitated the former Family Crisis Shelter in Livermore
and reopened the facility as a homeless shelter (the “Sojourner House”) under
the ownership of Tri-Valley Haven. Additional facilities benefit homeless and
formerly homeless persons in the Tri-Valley area include Bluebell transitional
housing in Livermore and Carmen Avenue apartments, also in Livermore.
Under Danville’s Municipal Code, emergency shelters and transitional housing
are defined as facilities that, respectively, meet the needs of those who are
homeless or those that were formerly homeless. Pursuant to the requirements of
SB 2, Danville has amended its zoning regulations to permit emergency shelters
without a conditional use permit or other discretionary action within commercial
areas carrying the DBD: Downtown Business District Area 3 – Old Town Mixed
Use zoning designation. Land zoned DBD - Area 3 is a compact, multi-property
area totaling slightly more than five acres along Front Street and in close
proximity to the Downtown core. Area 3 provides adequate area and an
adequate number of separate parcels to accommodate the emergency shelter
needs for Danville – if such a facility was pursued for development. The zoning
change to DBD – Area 3 properties are consistent with the intent and
requirements of SB 2.

C.      HOUSING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS
1. Housing Growth
Danville’s residential growth rate has varied since 1970, as shown in Table 13.
The construction of several thousand housing units during the period from the
1970 through the end of the 1990’s represented the last significant surge of
residential development that Danville will experience. With the adoption of a
Growth Management Element in 1991, new residential projects approved in
Danville were required to be found to be in compliance with specified
performance standards relative to public facilities and services. With the
adoption of the Danville 2030 General Plan in March, 2013, the Town determined
there was sufficient infrastructure and public facilities in place and/or planned
to accommodate the projected amount of residential growth through the
planning period covered by the 2030 Plan (i.e., through 2030, the “horizon year”
for the Plan).
2. Housing Type and Tenure
Housing tenure refers to the status of the occupants of housing, indicating
whether the occupant owns or rents the housing unit. While housing tenure
generally conforms to the type of housing unit (i.e., attached units and multiple
family units tend to be renter-occupied households than is the case for detached
units), many of Danville’s attached single family residential units and multiple
family units are owner-occupied units and many of Danville’s detached single
family residential units are rent-occupied units. The 2010 Census indicates that
owner-occupied units comprised 84.4% of Danville’s housing stock while rental
units comprised the remaining 15.6%. (Refer to Table 8)
3. Housing Age and Condition
As is the case for most of the Tri-Valley Region, Danville’s housing is relatively
new. (Refer to Table 13) Only 434 units, or 2.8% of the existing housing stock in
place as of the end of 2013, were built prior to 1950. A majority of the housing
stock in Danville (i.e., 11,941 units – or 77.6%) was built since 1970, with roughly
half of that total being less than thirty years of age. A general rule in the housing
industry is that structures older than thirty years begin to show signs of
deterioration and require reinvestment to maintain their quality. Unless
properly maintained, homes older than fifty years will typically require major
renovations to remain in good working order. The housing stock in Danville is
considered to be in excellent condition, in part because of the relative newness of
housing in Danville and in part because of the relatively high incomes and high
home values that have been present, and continue to be present, in the area.

 Note: The total for housing units is not inclusive of second dwelling units. A total of 92 second dwelling units
       were built during the last planning period (i.e., between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2013). This
       delivery rate was higher than the development output of second dwelling units for the 1999-2007 planning
       period where 62 second units were built. With 154 second units built between 1999 and the end of 2013,
       the annual average production was 10¼ units.
   According to estimates made by the 2007-2011 American Community Survey, no
   housing units in Danville lacked complete individual plumbing facilities and 178
   of occupied units (1.1%) lacked complete kitchen facilities. The Town’s Building
   Division estimates that no more than 50 units in Danville require major
   rehabilitation (less than one unit in 300), and virtually no units in Town require
   replacement.

       4. Housing Costs and Affordability
       a. Sales and Rental Survey
       With acknowledgement of recent recovery from the prior decline in home prices
       due to the economic downturn, home prices are relatively high in the south central
       portion of Contra Costa County and in the Tri-Valley Region.
       Pursuant to information derived from the California Association of Realtors, the
       median home sales prices for single family homes in the central portion of Contra
       Costa County was $765,960 in June 2014. For context, June 2014 values tabulated
       by DataQuick for the Tri-Valley Area in 2014 were as follows: Danville $995,000;
       Dublin $743,000; Livermore $570,000; Pleasanton $783,000; and San Ramon
       $800,000. (Refer to Table 14).

       The median home prices contained in the Table 14 were generated from DataQuick
       Information Systems. DataQuick reports show that prices have not returned to pre-
       recession levels. Contra Costa County’s Draft 2014-2022 Housing Element indicates
       the median home price in Contra Costa in January 2007 was $575,000, with the
       Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                                               33

Great Recession resulting in a home price drop in April 2014 to a median home
price of $455,000. However, according to the RealtyTrac U.S. Foreclosure Market
Report the Bay Area is in the top five markets in the country in foreclosure
recovery. The price statistics are derived from all types of home sales, including
new and existing, condominiums and single family units. The website cautions
that movements in sales prices should not be interpreted as changes in the cost of a
standard home, though it is clear that there has been measurable erosion on home
sales prices due to the current economic downturn. Median prices can be
influenced by changes in cost, as well as changes in the characteristics and size of
homes sold. Due to the low sales volume in some cities or areas, median price
changes may exhibit unusual fluctuation.
The draft housing element update for Contra Costa County, citing data derived
from several market studies and a review of June 2014 rental listings, indicates
that rental rates vary significantly between the three regions of the County.
Market rents range from a low for a one-bedroom apartment in East County of
$878 to a high of $1,245 in Central County.
The range for two bedroom apartments is cited at $1,400 to $2,000, with three
bedroom rental units ranging from $1,700 to $2,400. According to the County’s
draft housing element, as of the end of the first quarter of 2014, vacancy rates for
apartment units in the County were 3.6%, as compared to a 4.9% vacancy rate
average for the five largest Bay Area Counties. At the first quarter of 2012,
Contra Costa County’s vacancy rate had been 4.6%.
The declining vacancy rate was matched with a 14% average increase in rental
rates in that two year period. This trend indicates a tightening of the rental
market. As long as vacancy rates remain below five percent, rents are likely to
continue increasing. Table 15 provides rental data for both Alameda and Contra
Costa Counties and the five Tri-Valley cities. The table underscores the impact of
the Great Recession on rental rates. There is no ACS data available yet to reflect
the upward swing of rental rates reflecting pressures on rental properties as a
result of the improvement in the economy.
Local rental rate data is provided later on in this section and reflects very steep
increases in rental rates since 2010.
Tables 16 and 17 provides information regarding Fair Market Rents (FMRs), an
index primarily used to determine payment standard amounts for HUD’s
Housing Choice Voucher program. HUD’s Policy Development and Research
Office estimates FMRs for metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan county FMR
areas. FMRs are gross rent estimates. To accomplish this objective, FMRs must

Note: Fair Market Rent is a term in real estate that indicates the amount of money that a given property would
        command, if it were open for leasing at the moment. Fair market rent is used by the Housing and Urban
        Development (HUD) to determine initial renewal rents for some expiring project-based Section 8 contracts, to
        determine initial rents for housing assistance payment (HAP) contracts in the Moderate Rehabilitation Single
        Room Occupancy program (Mod Rehab), and to serve as a rent ceiling in the HOME rental assistance program.
        The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually estimates FMRs for 530
        metropolitan areas and 2,045 nonmetropolitan county FMR areas.

      using the Bay Area CPI, with a 35% upward CPI adjustment applied between 1999 and 2011. The Bay Area

    be both high enough to permit a selection of units and neighborhoods and low
    enough to serve as many low income families as possible. The level at which
    FMRs are set is expressed as a percentile point within the rent distribution of
    standard-quality rental utilities, except telephones, cable or satellite television
    service, and internet service. HUD sets FMRs to assure that a sufficient supply of
    rental housing is housing units. The current definition used is the 40th percentile
    rent, the dollar amount below which 40 percent of the standard-quality rental
    housing units are rented. The 40th percentile rent is drawn from the distribution
    of rents of all units occupied by recent movers (renter households who moved to
    their present residence within the past 15 months). HUD is required to ensure
    that FMRs exclude non-market rental housing in their computation. Therefore,
    HUD excludes all units falling below a specified rent level determined from
    public housing rents in HUD's program databases as likely to be either assisted
    housing or otherwise at a below-market rent, and units less than two years old.
    Table 18 provides information about surveyed rent schedules for rental units
    within Danville.
    b. Housing Affordability by Household Income
    HUD publishes household income data annually. Table 19 shows the maximum
    annual income levels for each income group, adjusted for household size, as
    established for 2014 for the Alameda and Contra Costa Counties Area. This
    information is utilized to calculate the maximum affordable housing payments
    for different households (varying by size and income level) and is also used to
    determine household eligibility for federal housing assistance. In evaluating
    affordability, the maximum affordable price refers to the maximum amount that
    could be afforded by households at the upper end of the range of their respective

Notes:   a. In general, maximum income for low-income households reflects 80% of the mean family income level.
              Because the Alameda and Contra Costa Counties Area is a high income area, the U.S. Department of
              Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has adjusted the maximum income for low-income households.
         b. California’s income limits were updated based on: (1) federal income limit changes published December
              18, 2013 by HUD for its Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program income limits; and (2) adjustments
              HUD made based on particular State statutory provisions and HUD’s Hold Harmless Policy implemented
              in 2013.
         c. HUD annually updates Section 8 income limits to reflect changes in household income category levels and
              median income levels applicable to extremely-low, very-low, and low-income households. California law
              specifies that its State Income Limits must be updated based on HUD updates to its Section 8 income limit
              levels. The Department also revises its State Income Limit levels to reflect the following: adjustments, per
              State law, to some HUD county median income figures; adjustments to some household income category
              and area median income levels to reflect HCD’s February 2013 Hold Harmless Policy; and calculation of
              California’s moderate-income household levels based on changes to county area median income levels.

5.        Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
Existing housing that receives governmental assistance may convert over time to
market rate housing. In some communities, the loss of such units could
constitute a significant reduction in the amount of available affordable housing.
Because of that potential impact, housing element updates are required to
identify publicly assisted rental housing and evaluate the potential for that
housing to convert to market rate housing.
Government Code §65583(a)(9) requires jurisdictions to analyze existing assisted
housing developments that are eligible to change from low-income housing uses
during the next ten years due to termination of subsidy contracts, mortgage
prepayment, or expiration of restrictions on use.
There are no residential projects in Danville where governmental assistance was
provided that are subject to these regulations. Although below market rate units
(BMRs) provided through the Town’s inclusionary housing program do not
receive any governmental assistance, the Town made an effort over the final five
years of the 2007-2014 planning period to extend the resale restriction term for
BMRs units as they became available for resale to new 20-year terms. For seven
of the ten most recent resale opportunities, the Town successfully reset the 20-
year resale restriction term by working with the sellers of the BMRs. The sellers
of the units were allowed to sell the units at 3% to 5% above the resale restriction
price where they were willing to have a new resale restriction agreement
recorded before the sale.

D.     REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS
This section addresses the existing and future housing needs of Danville.
Existing housing needs refer to households earning lower income, living in
overcrowded conditions or overpaying for housing. Future housing needs refer
to the projected amount of housing a community is required to plan for during a
specified planning period. The State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) provided each regional council of governments (COG) its
share of the statewide housing need. In turn, all COGs, including the
Association of Bay Area Government (ABAG) - the COG for the nine-county Bay
Area Region - are required by State law to determine the portion allocated to
each jurisdiction in the region. This allocation process is referred to as the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) process in the ABAG Region. The
2014-2022 RHNA methodology takes into account, among other things, growth
principles first initiated with the 2007-2014 RHNA methodology; projected
growth in both households and jobs; proximity to transportation facilities; and
historic patterns of provision for very low and low income housing needs.
(Refer to Appendix A)
Future housing need refers to the share of the region’s housing growth that has
been allocated to a community. In allocating the region’s future housing needs
to the various member jurisdictions, the following factors were taken into
consideration:
      Market demand for housing
      Employment opportunities
      Proximity to transportation facilities
      Availability of suitable sites for residential development
      Availability of public facilities to serve new residential development
      Commute patterns of the area work force
      Type and tenure of existing housing
      Loss of units in government assisted housing developments
      Existing over-concentration of lower income households
      Historic production rates of lower income housing
      Geological and topographical constraints to residential development
Table 1 indicates the housing allocation for Danville for the RHNA for the 2014-
2022 planning period, broken down by four income categories: very low income,
low income, moderate income and above moderate income. As indicated on the
table, Danville’s share of regional housing needs has been set at a total of 557
residential units, reflecting a small reduction from the 583 unit allocation for the
RHNA for the 2007-2014 planning period.
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                      41

Pursuant to AB 2634, local jurisdictions are required to project the housing needs
of extremely low income households (i.e., households earning <30% of the area
median income). In estimating the number of extremely low income households,
a jurisdiction may use 50% of the very low income allocation or apportion the
very low income allocation between the very low and extremely low categories
based on Census data. For purposes of housing needs assessment for the 2014-
2022 Housing Element planning period, the Town’s RHNA of 196 very low
income units was split according to the second methodology, putting 95 units
into the ELI sub-category and 101 units into the VLI subcategory.
Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data from the American
Community Survey 2006-2010 supports this apportionment given the estimate of
625 extremely low income households and 665 very low income households in
Danville (a 48.4% extremely low income to 51.2% very low income “split”).

    The San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) first adopted a plan for
    waters inland from the Golden Gate in 1968. The first comprehensive Basin Plan for the Region
    was adopted in 1975. That plan is periodically updated in response to new state and federal laws,
    and changing conditions in the watershed. The basin planning process guides the RWQCB’s
    efforts to manage water quality in the region. The Basin Plan provides a definitive program of
    actions designed to preserve and enhance water quality, with the overarching goal of providing
    positive and firm direction for future water quality control.
    The Basin Plan fulfills the following needs:
    •	     It provides the basis for determining priorities for the allocation of state and federal grants
           for construction and upgrading of wastewater treatment facilities.
    •	     It fulfills the requirements of the Porter-Cologne Act that call for water quality control
           plans in California.
    •	     It provides the basis to establish or revise waste discharge requirements and to establish or revise
           water rights permits.
    •	     It establishes discharge conditions and prohibitions.
    •	     It establishes or indicates the water quality standards required by the federal Clean Water Act.
    •	     It establishes water quality attainment strategies required by the Clean Water Act for pollutants
           and water bodies where water quality standards are not currently met.

          unless the intended use of the new parcel is open space.
          The policy above is intended to prohibit lot splits and
          subdivisions on slopes greater than 30 percent. The policy does
          not preclude the development of an individual home on an
          existing legally created lot if that lot is greater than 30 percent
          slope. The policy also does not preclude the subdivision of
          sites which contain a mix of areas above and below 30 percent
          slope, provided all future building sites will be on land that is
          less than 30 percent slope.
  24.0 6  Require that roads and drainage systems constructed in              •	   Public Works Standards
          hillside areas are engineered to standards that prevent             •	   Development Review

          particularly residential soft-story structures and critical
          public facilities.
          A “soft-story” building is a multi-story building with a
          ground floor that may not sufficiently support the upper
          floors during a major earthquake. An example would be
          an apartment building with large “tuck under” carports on
          the first floor. Such buildings can be made more secure by
          installation of shearwalls and other types of bracing that
          address lateral stress.

                 applied, higher standards may be permitted at the discretion
                 of the Town Council. In such cases, indoor noise levels should
                 not exceed an Ldn of 45 dB.
                 Development sites exposed to noise levels exceeding 60 Ldn shall

                 Development on such properties should incorporate

                 occur within 50 feet of residential or other vibration sensitive

                 Vibration studies may also be required for projects involving

                                  GOAL : SUSTA I NA BI L I T Y
Goal 31: Conserve non-renewable resources through solid waste reduction, water conservation, and
          energy efficiency programs.
Goal 32 : Encourage building and construction practices that minimize environmental impacts and
          natural resource consumption.
                                                                             IM P L E M E N TAT I O N

          and landscape systems designed to reduce potable water use          Landscaping Ordinance
          and water waste.
          The Town has already adopted sustainable landscaping
          standards intended to reduce water consumption and promote
          native (“bay-friendly”) plantings.
  31.02   Support the use of reclaimed water (“gray water”) for          •	   Building Code
          landscape irrigation on medians, in parks, and in other        •	   Intergovernmental
          landscaped areas.                                                   Coordination
          The San Ramon Valley Recycled Water Program began
          delivering reclaimed water to Danville and San Ramon in
          2007. The project has been designed to provide a drought-
          resistant recycled water supply for irrigation in the San
          Ramon Valley. In addition, the Town requires dual plumbing
          systems to enable the use of recycled water for irrigation in
          designated recycled water areas.
  31.03   Promote composting, recycling, and other programs that         •	   Solid Waste Management
          reduce the amount of household solid waste requiring                Program
          disposal in landfills.                                         •	   Public Education and

          The Town is exploring ways to increase the amount of solid     •	   Sustainability Action Plan
          waste that is diverted from landfills, including increased
          opportunities for “e-waste” recycling, green waste collection,
          and kitchen waste recycling.

          “Green buildings” are structures which are designed
          to achieve more efficient use of natural resources than
          conventional buildings. The extra efficiency is achieved
          through siting, design, construction, operation, and
          maintenance methods. Such buildings typically reduce
          energy and water consumption, incorporate measures to
          reduce waste and pollution, and promote the health and
          safety of occupants.

                 Such incentives could include reduced permit costs for LEED-
                 certified projects, or projects which achieve a particular green

                 This can be achieved through features such as shade trees,
                 the orientation of buildings to maximize solar access, and the
                 use of “cool roofs” (roofs designed to reduce heat transfer to
                 interior spaces), and roof designs which support solar panels.
  32.05          Protect solar access rights in a manner that is consistent          •	  Development Review
                 with state law, and encourage the use of solar energy               •	  Zoning Ordinance

                 projects.
                 Since 1978, local governments in California have been
                 prohibited from adopting ordinances which unreasonably
                 restrict the installation of solar energy systems. State law
                 further protects owners of existing solar collectors from
                 shading caused by trees on adjacent properties, and gives
                 local government the authority to protect solar access through
                 zoning and solar access easements. Danville will explore a
                 variety of approaches to encourage the use of solar energy
                 systems in future construction and major remodeling projects.

          In June 2010, the Bay Area Air Quality Management
          District adopted thresholds for identifying significant air
          quality and greenhouse gas impacts, along with guidelines
          for evaluating the impacts of new development on climate
          change. Mitigation measures can help reduce emission levels
          by reducing vehicle trips and energy use.

III.    HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
A.      MARKET CONSTRAINTS
The housing element is required to include analysis of non-governmental
constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing
for all income levels, including the availability of financing, the price of land, the
cost of construction and other non-governmental constraints.
While local government actions can have a significant effect on the production of
housing, there are several market-related factors that may create barriers to
housing production. The inventory of non-governmental constraints can be
separated into two groups. In the first group, which would serve to increase
housing costs to the consumer, are financing, land prices and construction costs.
A second category of non-governmental constraints, which would serve to
reduce or slow down housing development, are community opposition to higher
density housing, possible lack of infrastructure capacity, and competition of
different land uses for undeveloped land.
1. Vacant / Underdeveloped Land
Danville is a nearly built-out community with limited vacant or underutilized
land available for residential development.            Table 32 lists vacant and
underutilized sites that carry residential land use designations and zoning. This
is a very comprehensive listing but, reflecting the fact the Town is nearing a
built-out status, the majority of the sites are relatively small and have relatively
limited development yield. The period of constructing 250 to 350 new residential
units per year in Danville has passed as the larger tracts of land, either available
at the time of incorporation or made available through annexation, have been
developed. The limited availability of land suitable for residential uses is
ultimately a factor in pushing housing costs higher. The price of land is also one
of the largest components of housing development costs. Land costs in the
region are extremely high, with the cost of land in Danville potentially being as
high as virtually any area in the East Bay region.
2. Cost of Housing Construction
Construction costs are the largest component of total costs for single-family
attached and detached units, accounting for 40 percent or more of the finished
sale price. According to the Town’s valuation table used for its building permit
fee schedule, construction costs for a typical wood frame single-family detached
residence are assumed to be about $210.00 per square foot. For multiple family
units, construction costs are slightly lower, assumed to be around $190.00 per
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                        43

square foot, with the lower costs reflecting the ability to achieve economies of
scale in these projects (e.g., savings from discounts for materials and cost
averaging of equipment mobilization costs). Actual construction costs likely
range from about these levels or higher, depending on the particular unit being
constructed. High demand for residential development keeps land cost
relatively high throughout the Bay Area, with land costs in the Tri-Valley Region
especially high, with some pressure due in part due to relative land scarcity.
Another consideration is that in-fill development, which describes the condition
of much of Danville’s remaining residential development potential, is often more
expensive than “green field” development. Many in-fill parcels have existing
structures and/or contaminated conditions that must be addressed before
redevelopment can occur. Aging infrastructure serving the property may require
replacement. These factors and others have the potential to increase the cost of
development for in-fill sites.
3. Availability of Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a
home. Following the foreclosure crisis that began in 2008, lenders significantly
tightened their lending standards. As of this writing, lending standards are
extremely tight and it is difficult for all but the most credit worthy buyers to get
mortgage loans.
Specific housing programs such as first-time homebuyer programs or other
mortgage assistance programs can be a useful tool providing help with down
payment and closing costs, which are often significant obstacles to home
ownership for lower income and minority groups.
4. Foreclosures
Many households nationwide purchased homes that were beyond their financial
means leading up to the Great Recession. Of those, many households were
unable to absorb hikes in interest rates, expiration of short-term fixed rates,
and/or the decline in residential home prices as a result of the recession. The
result of these factors was a significantly higher incidence of residential
foreclosures. As the economy has improved, the number of foreclosures has
sharply declined and home values in Danville have recovered to close to their
pre-recession high valuations.
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                      44

B. GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
1. Land Use Controls
The Danville 2030 General Plan sets forth policies that guide new development,
including new residential development. These policies, together with existing
zoning regulations, serve to control the amount and distribution of land
allocated for different uses within the Town. The single family and multifamily
residential land use designations established by the General Plan are reflected on
Table 22. There are four single family residential land use designations, four
multifamily land use designations and one crossover land use designation (that
addresses the overlap of allowable single family and multiple family
development densities) for a total of nine different residential land use
designations. The land use designations provide for a range of development
densities, ranging from rural densities (i.e., 1 dwelling unit/5 acres) to
multifamily residential high densities (i.e., 25-30 dwelling units/acre).
2. Residential Development Standards
The type, location and density of residential development in Danville are
regulated through the Danville Municipal Code and through the development
review process. The zoning regulations contained in the Municipal Code serve
to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of
the community while also serving to implement the goals and policies of the
general plan. Table 23 summarizes the most pertinent residential standards for
single family residential zoning districts.         Table 24 provides the same
information for the multifamily residential zoning districts. In both tables, the
zoning districts are grouped to show their relationship to the corresponding
general plan land use designations.
The Danville 2030 General Plan divides Danville into 24 Planning Areas,
distinguishing the respective neighborhoods by their location, unique
characteristics, age, and natural or constructed boundaries. Reflective of the
diversity of the residential areas in Danville, the minimum lot size to
accommodate single family residential attached or detached development ranges
from 4,000 to 100,000 square feet. This translates to densities ranging from 8.0
residential units per net acre down to 0.2 residential units per net acre. The
allowable density in multifamily residential zoning districts ranges from 8.0
residential units per net acre up to 30 units per acre. Higher densities in all
districts are achievable through application of density bonus provisions.

   a. The zoning districts listed in this column may be found consistent with the General Plan land use designation
        under certain circumstances, depending upon the specific use that is proposed.
   b. Densities are expressed as the number of dwelling units per “net” acre of land (this is referred to as “net
        density”). Net acreage excludes street rights-of-way, utility easements, drainage channels, and similar areas
        that cannot be developed. Net acreage also excludes areas that are undevelopable due to environmental
        constraints.

             2.   Danville 2030 General Plan. March, 2013.
       a. Single Family and Multifamily Zoning Regulations
       All single family residential districts establish development standards for
       minimum lots area, building setbacks, lot width and depth and for building
       height. The multifamily residential districts address these areas and also
       establish standards for building coverage and for open space areas. Most
       multifamily residential projects processed by the Town utilize the P-1; Planned
       Unit Development process, which is encouraged under general plan policies and
       which provides project-specific standards for minimum lot area, building

setbacks, building-to-building separation, building coverage, floor area ratio,
minimum lot widths and depths, and maximum building heights.
b. Parking Standards
The Town’s parking requirements for residential projects varies by housing type.
Table 25 outlines the Town’s parking requirements for residential developments.
Single family residential units are required to have two spaces per unit. Zoning
regulations were modified in the early 1980’s to require parking supplied for single
family residential units to be enclosed parking. The number of parking spaces
required under the Municipal Code for multifamily residential units ranges from
one space per studio unit to two spaces per units with two or more bedrooms. To
accommodate guests in multifamily residential projects, an additional one-
quarter a parking space per unit must generally be provided. Residential lots
that contain second units are required to have three parking spaces in order to
meet the parking needs for both the primary residence and the second unit.
Uncovered parking may be used for the parking requirement of the second unit
and this parking may be tandem parking as long as the space does not block
vehicular access to a parking space required for the primary residence.
c. Planned Unit Development Process
Flexibility with regard to development standards is available in Danville through
use of the following three mechanisms: (1) the use of the P-1; Planned Unit
Development process; (2) through mixed use developments; and (3) through use of
density bonus provisions. The vast majority of residential units developed in
Danville since the early 1980’s have utilized the P-1 zoning process. The P-1 zoning
process allows for more design flexibility in a residential project by allowing
project-specific development standards to be considered and applied. The use of P-
1 zoning process is encouraged to permit more flexible development standards on
appropriate sites as a means of conserving open space, enhancing project aesthetics
and amenities and ensuring high quality development.
d. Mixed Use Development
Danville’s general plan includes a Mixed Use land use designation. For Mixed
Use sites where residential uses are allowed, densities in the range of 20 to 30
units per net acre may be considered. The Mixed Use land use designation was
created as a means of providing opportunities for residential development
within established commercial areas or within areas designated by the Danville
2030 General Plan as Special Concern Areas. There are several different forms of
mixed use development existing or anticipated in Danville. For some sites,
vertical integration of uses is encouraged (e.g., residential uses above commercial
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                      49

uses). For larger mixed use sites (e.g., possible future uses for the Historic Wood
Family Ranch Headquarters site), the designation would allow for the presence
of multiple uses on a single parcel, allowing the uses may to be either side-by-
side or vertically integrated.
e. Density Bonus Regulations
The State's density bonus law, having been significantly modified in 2004 by
SB1818, can be considered a voluntary inclusionary housing ordinance providing
large incentives to developers who include specified amounts of affordable
housing in their projects. SB1818 requires cities and counties to grant developers
both density bonuses of 20 to 35 percent, depending on the amount and type of
affordable housing provided, and "concessions" - exceptions from normally
applicable zoning and other development standards. Qualifying projects would
be projects of five or more units where at least one of the following occupancy
characteristics is present: a minimum of 5 percent of the units are for very low
income households; a minimum of 10 percent of the units are for low income
households; 10 percent of the units are for moderate income households and the
project is a qualifying common interest, for-sale project; or 100 percent of the
units are in a senior citizen project (with no corresponding standard for
affordability). Danville adopted a new density bonus ordinance through
approval of ZTA 2014-05 in September 2014, bringing its regulations in line with
SB1818.
f. Inclusionary Housing Program
The development review process utilized in Danville since the implementation of
inclusionary housing program in the early 1990’s has seen the vast majority of
projects subject to the program secure approvals at the top end of their respective
allowable density ranges (i.e., 34 of 40 projects). (Refer to Table 41 and Figure
B)
Of the projects that did not maximize their development yield, three were kept
below the maximum yield as a result of developer market decisions, two were
kept below the maximum yield in response to, among other considerations,
neighborhood opposition expressed during the development review process, and
one was held to a mid-point density development yield due to site-specific
language contained in the general plan (i.e., the 22-unit infill Weber/Davidon
Homes project - directed by the Danville 2010 General Plan, as one of twelve
identified Special Concern Areas, to develop at the mid-point of allowable
development density to address neighborhood compatibility impacts).

The governmental constraints “burden” that might otherwise be associated with
Danville’s inclusionary regulations is lessened by the fact that the target units
under the program are linked to moderate income households that may earn up
to 110% of the published median income for the area. The “subsidy gap”
between the market value of such units and their below market rate value is
therefore significantly less than would be the case if the inclusionary housing
program sought to secure units for very low and/or low income households.
The “burden” is further lessened by the fact that the Alameda and Contra Costa
Counties Area is a relatively high income area, meaning the financial return from
below market rate units is comparably higher than other areas as allowable sales
prices and allowable rental rates are set as a function of relatively higher
maximum allowable income levels.
For a relative perspective of the governmental constraints “burden”, the
program’s impact on the 38-unit for-sale Preserves at Iron Horse Trail
condominium project completed in 2010 can be assessed.                   That project
successfully secured an affordable “by-design” designation, as provided for
under its amended affordable housing agreement.                  Under the Town’s
inclusionary housing program, a project can potentially secure an affordable “by-
design” status as a result of providing small and/or efficiently designed units or
a as a result of building at a higher development density and/or because the
project creates rental housing. The Preserves at Iron Horse Trail project secured
the affordable “by-design” status in recognition that 80% of the units had market
rate pricing that put the sales prices of the units at a level that is lower than had
been mandated by the original version of the project’s affordable housing
agreement. Fourteen of the 34 units in the project ultimately sold for market rate
prices (i.e., sales prices in the $319,000 to $370,000 range) that were below the
$372,100 maximum sales price established under the original affordable housing
agreement that would have been applied to 15% of the units in the project.
The designation of this project as an affordable “by-design” project represents
the second instance of such designation for a for-sale project since the inception
of the inclusionary housing program, showing that the situation is not unique to
the current market conditions. The initial instance of a for-sale affordable “by-
design” designation involved the 248-unit California Shadowhawk project built
in the early 1990’s on the east side of Danville.
Also critical to the question of governmental constraint “burden” is the flexibility
that has been integrated into the inclusionary housing program since its
inception.
From the onset, developers have had the option to pay an in-lieu fee to satisfy
their inclusionary obligation. In the program’s twenty-four year history, only
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                       52

one project has elected to pursue the in-lieu fee option. That one project, the 88-
unit Stony Brook project in the Downtown area, chose the in-lieu inclusionary fee
option in response to the fact it was subject to the more stringent California
Community Redevelopment Law inclusionary standards given its location
within the redevelopment project area. The payment of an in-lieu fee satisfied
the project responsibility to provide fifteen below market rate units split between
moderate income units (nine required) and very low income units (six required).
The in-lieu fees collected from the project provided an important portion of the
financial subsidy for the 74-unit Bridge Housing/Town of Danville affordable
housing apartment project that provides housing to a mix of extremely low and
very low income senior households.
Additional flexibility in the inclusionary housing program is reflected by the fact
that the target below market rate units required under Danville’s inclusionary
program may be provided as either for-sale or for-rent units and the target units
are allowed to be developed as a housing product type that can vary from the
product type used for the market rate units in the project. The majority of the
initial projects developed under the inclusionary program were on sites carrying
a Residential - Single Family - Medium Density (3-5 units/acre) designation. The
“solution” to meet the inclusionary requirements in these early projects was
often to situate duet-style below market rate units at corner locations among the
single family detached market rate units in the project. The residential massing of
the below market rate (BMR) units on these select corner locations have the
appearance of being comparatively large single family units as the design of the
duet units largely hid the presence of the two two-car garages serving the duet
unit.
This approach allowed the BMR units to occupy a minimal amount of land area
in the project (typically 5%+/- of the land area even though the BMRs constitute
10% of the project’s unit count) - meaning larger units on larger lots could be
provided for the market rate section of the project. Additionally, the below
market rate units were allowed to be significantly smaller than the smallest
market rate unit in the project. In the 146-unit Tassajara Ridge project, a
representative project using duet-style units as their BMR units, the 14 BMR units
averaged 1,375 square feet in area with the market rate units ranging in size from
1,941 square feet to 2,456 square feet. The initial sales prices in the project
hovered around $200.00 a square foot, regardless of whether the unit was a
market rate unit or a BMR.
Further flexibility in the program was provided when the Inclusionary
Ordinance was amended in the late 1990’s. In recognition that the duet-style
“solution” for for-sale BMRs did not as readily fit into single family residential
projects developed at lower densities (e.g., projects on lands carrying a
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                     53

Residential - Single Family - Low Density 1-3 units/acre designation), an option
was created through a Town-sponsored zoning text amendment to allow the
inclusionary requirement to be met through the development of second units in
the project. In the place of supplying 10% of the units as for-sale units available
to households earning a maximum of 110% of the median income, the developer
could now choose to equip 25% of the units developed with turn-key attached or
detached second dwelling units.
The developer experience on the projects choosing this option (11 of 40 projects
to date developed subject to inclusionary requirements) has been that the square
footage involved with the requisite second units can be absorbed at market rate
values (i.e., purchasers of the paired primary and secondary units are paying the
same per square footage rate for the secondary units – often marketed as
“Casitas” – as they paid for the square footage contained in the primary
residence).
For projects providing for-rent housing, further flexibility has been provided
under Danville’s inclusionary housing program. The two for-rent projects that
secured entitlement approvals under the inclusionary regulations (i.e., Sequoia
Grove Apartments and Rose Garden Apartments) qualified, and continue to
qualify, as affordable “by-design” projects.           The affordable “by-design”
designation was provided for under the respective affordable housing
agreements. This designation reflects the fact that the market rate rent schedules
for these projects have stayed at or below rent levels that place 100% of the
project units at rents affordable to median income households.
This means that 100% of the units in these projects have market rate rent levels
that are a minimum of 10% lower than the otherwise mandated rent levels that
would have been required for BMRs developed under the respective affordable
housing agreements. This condition reflects the fact that the affordability of
projects is inherent to the product selection - i.e., affordability is being achieved
as a result of the underlying land use designation effectively dictating that the
sites be developed with high/medium density multifamily for-rent housing. If
and when market rate rents rise to the point that the project rent schedule no
longer makes units affordable to households earning <100% of median income,
the projects are obligated to identify 15% of the project units as designated below
market rate units and to screen tenants for eligibility as households earning
<110% of median income.
Recognition is made of the “Palmer” decision, a recent court action that affects a
jurisdiction’s ability to impose inclusionary housing requirements on newly
developed rental housing. A new implementation program has been added
(Program 2.3.3.) that directs the Town to monitor litigation responding to the
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                       54

Palmer/Sixth Street Properties L.P. v. City of Los Angeles ("Palmer") decision.
While the Town recently updated its inclusionary housing regulations, it is
appropriate to track subsequent litigation responding to Palmer to determine if
further amendment to Danville’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance is warranted.
The flexibility provided in Danville’s inclusionary housing program, coupled
with the length of time the program has been operational (since 1990) means the
program does not represent a governmental constraint to housing development.
To the contrary, the inclusionary requirements have created an inventory of
affordable units that serves an important need in the community without
changing the character of the neighborhoods. The first 36 of 40 projects approved
with an inclusionary housing program obligation have been built and occupied.
g. Conclusion
In general terms, the Town’s residential development standards have not acted
as a constraint to the development of new housing or affordable housing. For the
thirty-year period extending from 1980 through 2010, Danville’s development
review process provided for a greater than 80% increase in the number of
housing units present in 1980, adding housing units at an average annual rate of
just over 225 units per year, with just under 6,800 housing units added. For the
final decade of this period (2000 through 2010), the rate of residential
development slowed to an annual average production of 75 units per year. For
2010 through 2013, the rate of addition of housing units dropped by more than
50%, to an average of slightly more than 30 units per year. The slowing down on
the annual production of housing reflects both the impacts of the Great Recession
and the fact the Town is closing in on a built out condition. (Refer to Tables 2
and 13) The construction of affordable housing, a subset of all construction, is
further constrained by the availability of funding to cover the subsidy gap
necessary to make projects affordable.
3. Provision of a Variety of Housing
The housing element must identify adequate sites that are to be made available
through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the
development of various types of housing for all economic segments of the
population. This includes, among other housing product categories, single
family residential housing, multifamily residential housing, second dwelling
units, assisted living facilities, factory-built housing, mobile homes, emergency
shelters, and transitional and supportive housing. Tables 26 and 27 summarize
the housing types permitted within the various residential zoning districts in
Danville. Danville’s zoning and development standards provide for a diversity
of housing types for a wide economic spectrum of the community, including
those earning lower income, seniors, disabled, etc.

       Notes: See Notes Section following Table 27.
  Danville’s multifamily residential land use designations have historically precluded
  development below the minimum range of their respective density scales. This policy
  was carried forward into the Danville 2030 General Plan (refer to Policy 1.05) adopted
  in March 2013. The minimum density requirement locks in the housing development
  yield on the remaining vacant or underutilized multifamily residential parcels in
  Danville. The Danville 2010 General Plan (adopted August 1999) split the historic
  land use designation of Multiple Family - Medium Density 13-21 units/acre into two
  categories and changed the upper density limit allowed from a maximum of 21 units
  per acre to a maximum of 22 units per acre.                          To meet the requisite minimum
  development densities for the housing needs of very low and low income households,
  the Danville 2030 General Plan created the Residential – Multifamily – High Density
  (25–30 units per acre)

       c. Health Facility means a facility, place or building that is organized, maintained, and operated for the
           diagnosis, care, prevention, and treatment of human illness, physical or mental, including convalescence
           and rehabilitation, and care during and after pregnancy. Health facilities include general acute care and
           psychiatric hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities including developmentally

     disabled, congregate care, correctional treatment facilities, and hospice facilities, and as further defined
     under the California Health and Safety Code Section 1250.
d.   Intermediate Care Facility means 24 hour personal care, developmentally disabled habilitation and
     nursing or congregate living health facility, development and supportive health services in compliance
     with California Health & Safety Code Section 1267.8 and 1267.9.
e.   Residential Care Facilities means California Department of Social Services licensed non-medical facilities
     which provide long-term care to adults or children which stay in a residential setting rather than in their
     own home. Occupants may include persons with chronic life threatening illness including HIV or AIDS,
     or the elderly. Residential care facilities provide room, board, housekeeping, supervision, and personal
     care assistance with basic activities such as bathing and grooming, as further defined under the California
     Health and Safety Code Section 1568.0831.
f.   Second dwelling unit means a dwelling unit, attached or detached to the primary dwelling, which
     provides complete independent living facilities with accommodations for a kitchen, living, sleeping,
     eating, and bathroom on the same parcel as a primary structure on a residentially zoned site. Second
     dwelling units shall be consistent with the requirements of Section 32-76.
g.   Supportive housing means housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by a target
     population, and that is linked to on or off-site services that assist the supportive housing resident in
     retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximize his or her ability to live and,
     when possible, work in the community, as defined under California Government Code Section 65582(f).
h.   Transitional housing means buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under
     program requirements that require the termination of assistance and circulation of the assisted unit to
     another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than
     six months of the assistance, as defined under California Government Code Section 65582(h).
   land use category and recalibrated the allowable density range for the existing
   land use categories so the Residential - Multifamily - High/Medium land use
   category could be set at a 20 – 25 units per acre density range. The requisite
   minimum density for multifamily land to address the needs for low income
   households is 20 units per acre. The requisite minimum density for multifamily
   land to address the needs for very low income households is 25 units per acre –
   with this minimum having been agreed to by Danville and HCD during the
   preparation of the 2007-2014 Housing Element.
   Senate Bill 2 (SB 2), enacted in October 2007, requires local governments to
   identify one or more zoning categories that allow emergency shelters without
   discretionary review. The statute permits the Town to apply limited operational
   standards for emergency shelters. The identified zone must have sufficient
   capacity to accommodate at least one year-round shelter and accommodate the
   Town’s share of the regional unsheltered homeless population estimated to be
   less than five individuals.
   The Town amended the Municipal Code following the adoption of the 2007-2014
   Housing Element to permit homeless shelters with just a ministerial permit on
   DBD; Downtown Business District - Area 3 Old Town Mixed Use properties,
   consistent with the requirements of SB2. DBD - Area 3 properties are located
   within the Downtown core and are served by, or proximate to, the major
   Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                                                58

transportation corridors serving the Downtown, including Hartz Avenue, Diablo
Road and I-680. There are approximately 13 acres of DBD - Area 3 property in
aggregate, with this total comprised of fifteen individual parcels. Adequate
capacity exists either on vacant or underutilized properties, or through
conversion of existing buildings for use as an emergency shelter, to
accommodate an appropriately sized homeless shelter. The Municipal Code was
also amended to provide a definition of homeless shelters that is consistent with
the definition contained within Health and Safety Code Section 50801(e).
There are numerous types of residential care facilities that, under state law, may
located in a jurisdiction with limited local discretionary review.                The
preemptions include the following types of residential care facilities:
       Health facilities (care for developmentally disabled and skilled nursing
        care) California Health and Safety Code Sections 1267.8, 1267.9
       Community care facilities (covers all other types of care not already noted
        for adults and children) California Health and Safety Code Sections 1566.3,
        1567.1
       Residential care facilities for the elderly California Health and Safety Code
        Sections 1568.083, 1568.0831, 1569.85
       Alcoholism recovery and drug abuse facilities California Health and Safety
        Code Sections 11834.02 - 11834.30
       Family day care homes (day care for children) California Health and Safety
        Code Sections 1596.70 - 1596.795, 1597.40 - 1597.47, 1597.65
       Homes or facilities for mentally disordered, handicapped, or dependent
        and neglected children California Welfare and Institutions Code Sections 5115
        – 5120
Certain types of the residential care homes are allowed under state law to be
subjected to standards dealing with potential overconcentration have standards.
4. Growth Management Program
The premise of growth management is that development pays its own way and
sufficient public services and facilities are committed and/or in place before
additional development is approved. The Danville 2010 General Plan supported
this concept and the 2030 Plan continues to include goals and policies that
reinforce the Town’s commitment to managed growth.
In 1988, Contra Costa County voters approved Measure C, the Contra Costa
Transportation Improvement and Growth Management Initiative. The Measure
responded to concerns throughout the County about the ability of local
governments and service providers to mitigate the impacts of development. In
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                       59

2004, Contra Costa County voters approved a 25-year extension of growth
management requirements through Measure J. Measure C expired in March
2009, and Measure J became effective on April 1 of that year. In general terms,
Measure J extended the one-half percent sales tax established by Measure C. It
also extended, with minor revisions, various transportation programs and
Growth Management Programs (GMP) established to implement Measure C.
On a policy level Measure J renewed a commitment to manage and mitigate the
impacts of future growth and development within Contra Costa County. On an
administrative level, the performance standards set forth under Measure C were
replaced by different, generally less restrictive standards. Mandatory standards
apply now only to regional transportation routes. A new requirement is that
jurisdictions delineate an urban limit line (or urban growth boundary). Local
governments may retain performance standards related to local streets, parks,
police, sewer, water, and other facilities, but are no longer required to do so.
Although Measure J eliminated the previous Measure C requirements for local
performance standards and level of service (LOS) standards for non-regional
routes, Danville has chosen to retain its own transportation LOS standards in its
General Plan. As such, Danville’s growth management standards comply with
the requisite Measure J policies, while augmenting them with more stringent
local controls. Transportation LOS standards are in Chapter 4 of this document.
With the Town Council action in 2007 to adopt Resolution No, 8-2007, pursuant
to the requirements of the Measure J program, Danville adopted the County
Urban Limit Line (ULL) as its Urban Growth Boundary. Implementation of
Measure C 1988 and Measure J 2009 and Danville’s adoption and refinement of
its Growth Management Element has not prevented Danville from meeting its
housing obligations. Instead, Measure C and Measure J and the various resultant
Growth Management Elements required under the program, have led to a more
coordinated planning effort that has provided a mechanism to support and
enhance development.
5. Dougherty Valley and Alamo Creek Settlement Agreements
The Town of Danville, Contra Costa County, the City of San Ramon and the
developers of Dougherty Valley executed the Dougherty Valley Settlement
Agreement in 1994 in conjunction with the County approval of the Dougherty
Valley General Plan Amendment. The legally binding agreement requires full
mitigation for any subsequent projects involving approvals of general plan
amendments and contains provisions for future growth management that must
be met, including traffic level of service standards and performance standards
for other urban services.
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                   60

A subsequent Settlement Agreement was executed when the Alamo Creek
subdivision was approved by the County east of the Town boundary. The
Agreement included a special methodology for measuring traffic for any future
development in the Tassajara Valley. However, that requirement expired on
December 31, 2010. Provisions of the Alamo Creek Settlement Agreement should
not substantively affect the Town’s growth management programs during the
lifetime of the 2014-2022 Housing Element or the Danville 2030 General Plan. The
settlement agreements have not constrained housing affordability as significant
components of affordable housing were/are being supplied in both projects.
6. Site Improvements, Development Impact Fees and Processing Fees
An important component of new residential development costs are costs
associated with site improvements. Site improvements costs are incurred to
provide sanitary sewer and water service to a project, to make necessary
transportation improvements, and to provide other infrastructure to a project.
The Town may require a residential development project to pay for various
offsite improvements as project mitigation measures (e.g., payment towards an
offsite traffic signal).
The developers of new residential projects are also required to construct all
internal streets, sidewalks, curb, gutter and affected portions of offsite arterials.
As the cost of site improvements varies measurably from project to project, it is
difficult to estimate what the “typical” per-unit cost is for site improvements.
Even in the case of infill projects, where infrastructure may already be present,
there is often a need to upgrade and/or expand the existing improvements in
response to the addition of new residential development. The Town collects fees
from new development projects to cover costs of planning and processing
permits, which will include plan check and inspection fees as the project
proceeds into the construction phase of development.
A variety of development impact fees are often assessed upon new residential
projects, including both Town controlled fees (such as child care fees and park
land in-lieu fees) and non-Town controlled fees (such as regional traffic
mitigation fees and school impact fees). Another major component of project
costs is utility service connection fees (e.g., sewer and water connection fees).
Taken collectively, the various planning and processing fees, development
impact fees and utility service connection charges can add significantly to the
cost of housing. Tables 28, 29 and 30 indicate typical costs associated with new
residential developments, indicating, respectively, the costs for new single family
projects, for apartment projects and for second units. Requiring developers to
construct site improvements and/or pay fees towards the provision of
infrastructure, public facilities, services, and permit processing will increase the
cost of housing. While these costs may impact housing affordability, these

Note:          This estimate of processing fees, impact fees and utility connection charges has been
         calculated for a theoretical 500 square foot detached second dwelling unit with a 125 square foot
         attached porch area . The project is assumed to not require a public hearing (no exceptions from
         zoning regulations) and is processed as a ministerial permit (i.e., as a building permit).
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                                                64

these requirements are deemed necessary to maintain the quality of life desired
by Danville residents and are considered consistent with the goals of the
Danville 2030 General Plan.
A small single family residential project could expect processing fees, impact fees
and utility service connection charges of slightly more than $90,000 per lot. Of
that total, slightly less than $33,000 per lot would be Town-controlled processing
fees and impact fees. A small apartment project could expect processing fees,
impact fees and utility service connection charges of slightly less than $46,000
unit. Of that total, slightly less than $14,750 per unit would be Town-controlled
processing fees and impact fees. A typical second dwelling unit (i.e., a detached
unit of approximately 500 square feet) could expect processing fees, impact fees
and utility service connection charges approximately $18,000. Of that total,
approximately $3,425 would be Town-controlled processing fees and impact fees.
To put these costs in context, the Draft Contra Costa County 2014-2022 Housing
Element estimates the per-unit range of planning and processing fees for a
typical single-family residence in the unincorporated area to range from $48,000
to $88,500. The estimated per-unit range of planning and processing fees for a
for-rent project (the County analysis was for a 25-unit multifamily complex) was
estimated to be in the range of $22,750 to $45,000 per apartment unit.
7. Environmental and Development Review and Permitting Process
The development review and permitting process is utilized to receive, evaluate
and approve new development applications. The development review and
permitting process is necessary to ensure that new residential projects develop in
an orderly manner, reflective of the goals and policies of the General Plan and
consistent with the intent and requirements of the Municipal Code. This process
is utilized, in part, to assure that new projects will be consistent with the Town’s
character and respectful of the natural and man-made landscape.
Danville stresses an efficient and comprehensive approach to development review
and permitting which, as a whole, allows for quick response to developer
applications. The planning staff coordinates the review of development proposals
by other Town staff and by the San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District, other
service districts, and by other outside agencies. Table 31 depicts the processing
steps and timeline flow chart for a major residential project, assumed to include a
Preliminary Development Plan - Rezoning action. The Town can reduce the time
and uncertainty involved in development permits by use of pre-submittal meetings
(to secure preliminary comments on a proposal from Development Services
Department and Community Development Department staff) and by providing
early access to the Design Review Board review process.

The Design Review Board (DRB) serves in an advisory role to the Planning
Commission for the review of the design aspects of development entitlement
requests. The DRB make-up has been consciously structured by the Town to
include a minimum of two (and up to a maximum of three) Planning Commission
members among its five- to six-member makeup. This format has served, as
evidenced by regular and ongoing review of the DRB process, to provide the
desired separation of design issues from land use issues as projects move through
the entitlement review process from DRB on to the Planning Commission, where
formal public hearing review and action occurs. By having an overlap between the
two bodies, there is both less frequency of having design issues revisited once the
matter is before the Planning Commission and less frequency of having DRB’s
review venture inappropriately into a review of land use considerations.
Where DRB’s role is expanded beyond that of an advisory body, the expansion of
authority is provided (typically by project conditions of approval) to streamline the
review process. In the most frequent expression of this expanded authority, the
Planning Commission empowers the DRB, through project conditions of approval,
with the authority to make final review of project construction design details
leading up to a project’s submittal for building permit plan check review. This
allows DRB to both stay in the loop on the final review of design matters and
allows the process to be a one-stop process (i.e., avoiding a need to have these types
of construction-detail design matters from having to go back to the Planning
Commission). By utilizing this process, the permit review is further streamlined by
way of allowing design details to be addressed at the back end of the process rather
than forcing detailed design studies to be provided prior to the project moving to
public hearing,
To add developer certainty to the DRB review process, the Town amended the
Design Guidelines of the DBD; Downtown Business District providing, among
other things, better direction as to the expectations for Downtown projects that may
include a residential component. Additionally, since the early 2000’s, the Town has
maintained a detailed DRB Submittal Checklist to provide applicants with the
specific submittal requirements for items requiring DRB review, allowing
developer certainty and processing time savings by letting applicants know what
needs to be submitted for DRB to complete its review.
Since the DRB’s review on proposed residential projects is in the role of an advisory
body, the applicant’s retain the right to “agree to disagree” with the findings and
recommendations of DRB and secure direct consideration on the design aspects of
their project from the Planning Commission.
Pursuant to the State Permit Streamlining Act, permit processing delays are
reduced by limiting processing time for non-legislative applications to one year and
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                        68

by being clear and forthright in making determinations as to what information is
needed to complete development plan submittals. In terms of time needed to
complete the plan check and inspection process once a project moves into the
construction phase, the Town has brought more of the building plan check and
inspection functions in house but maintains the ability to access outside contract
plan check and inspection services in response to fluctuations in workloads. The
Town has implemented practices that expedite processing, reduce costs, and clarify
the process to developers and homeowners. Delays in the Town’s development
review and permitting process do not constitute an unreasonable constraint.
8. California Building Codes and Enforcement
Danville uses several uniform codes as the basis of its building standards;
including, most significantly, the California Building Code (CBC), the California
Electrical Code (CEC), the California Plumbing Code (CPC), and the California
Mechanical Code (CMC). These Codes establish minimum standards and
require inspections at various stages of construction to ensure code compliance.
The Town’s building code requires new multifamily for-rent residential
construction to provide a specified minimum percentage of the units built to be
fully accessible to the physically disabled and an additional percentage of units
built to be readily adaptable to meet the needs of the physically disabled.
New multifamily residential construction that receives federal assistance is
required by HUD to comply with the Federal American with Disabilities Act,
which specifies a minimum percentage of dwelling units in new multifamily
developments be fully accessible to the physically disabled at the time of
construction. Although these standards and the time required for inspections
increase housing production costs and may impact the viability of rehabilitation
of older properties that are required to be brought up to current code standards,
the primary intent of the codes is to provide structurally sound, safe, and energy-
efficient housing.
The Town’s code enforcement efforts are handled through the Community
Development Department, with direct linkage to both the Building Division and
the Planning Division. Code enforcement typically handles a range of 15 to 20
cases per month. Besides complaints involving minor zoning violations, the
majority of other complaints deal with property maintenance, abandoned
vehicles, and unscreened boats and recreational vehicles. The California
Building Code provides direction for reasonable accommodation for new or
modified construction. Enforcement of building standards does not constrain the
production or improvement of housing in the Town.
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                     69

9. Summary – Removal and/or Mitigation of Governmental Constraints
State housing law requires jurisdictions to address, and where appropriate and
legally possible, remove or mitigate governmental constraints to the
maintenance, improvement, and development of housing, including housing for
all income levels and housing for persons with disabilities. The policies
contained in Section VI – Housing Plan integrate measures that serve to remove
or mitigate governmental constraints on several “fronts”.
C.      ENVIRONMENTAL, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PUBLIC SERVICE
        CONSTRAINTS
1. Environmental Constraints
The San Ramon Valley has a variety of natural conditions that impact the design,
construction and final cost of new residential development. If not properly
recognized and accommodated, these environmental constraints have the
potential to endanger lives and property.
a. Seismic Hazards/Geologic Hazards
A number of active faults paralleling and associated with the San Andreas Fault
are found in and near the San Ramon Valley, including the Calaveras Fault, the
Pleasanton Fault, the Bollinger Fault, and the Mt. Diablo Fault. These four fault
structures constitute some of the major faults in California at the latitude of San
Francisco. The 2011 Hazard Mitigation Plan for Contra Costa County indicates
there is a 75 percent probability of a magnitude 7.0 or greater earthquake in the
Bay Area during the next 30 years. In 2002, the United States Geologic Survey
(USGS) estimated an 11 percent probability for one or more magnitude 6.7 or
greater earthquakes by 2032 on the Calaveras Fault alone. The Calaveras Fault
Zone has been designated as a Special Study Zone pursuant to the Alquist-Priolo
Special Study Zones Act.
Geologic hazards in Danville are associated with the complex topographic and
geologic features of the Valley. Geologic hazards include two types of hazards:
seismically induced hazards, those hazards related to earthquakes, including
ground shaking, surface rupture, ground failure and seismically induced
landslides; and hazards associated with certain soils, bed rock, steep slopes and
land subdivision occurs naturally or is induced, including slope instability, and
landslides caused by construction activity, land subsidence and shrink-swell
characteristics of soils.
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                     70

Seismic and geologic hazards are addressed through the environmental and
development review and permitting process, through use of structure setbacks
(to avoid impacts from potentially active fault traces and known geologic
hazards) and through imposition of the regulations contained in the Town’s
grading ordinance and the California Building Code (collectively resulting in
requirement of use of construction design improvements, such as seismic
strengthening and detailing, to make projects meet the latest adopted seismic
design criteria).
The environmental constraints for individual housing sites identified as being
available for the 2014-2022 planning period are addressed in the descriptions of
these sites contained in the next chapter.
b. Landslides and Soil Erosion
Steep topography, fractured and unconsolidated bedrock conditions, expansive
soils, and high erosion potential combine to make some of the hillside areas in
the San Ramon Valley highly unstable. Landslides resulting from natural
conditions or caused by construction activity are common occurrences in the
hillsides. Nearly 50 percent of Danville is located on hillsides, including the Las
Trampas Ridge area and the hills paralleling the Sycamore Valley. There are
numerous traces of landslide activity in these areas and the potential for future
landslides is considered to be high. While landslides may occur on slopes of 15
percent or less in unstable areas, the risks are usually proportional with
steepness of slopes. Areas where old slide deposits are evident are the most
subject to failure.
Hillside areas in Danville are also subject to soil erosion, which can contribute to
instability of slopes, loss of vegetation, downstream flooding, sedimentation and
stream bank failure. Soil erosion potential is generally proportional to slope and
occurs mainly during peak rainfall, when runoff volumes are high.
Hazards associated with landslides and soil erosion are addressed through the
environmental and development review and permitting process and through
imposition of the regulations contained in the Town’s Grading Ordinance, the
Scenic Hillside and Major Ridgeline Development Ordinance and through
observance of Danville’s Hillside Development Guidelines.
c. Fire Hazard
The woodlands, grasslands, and chaparral areas present in parts of Danville
create fire hazard areas, especially when development is located in or adjacent to
these areas. Wildfires in these areas are a hazard to life and property during the
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                      71

summer and fall dry season, especially during periods of low humidity and high
winds.
Pursuant to Senate Bill 1241 (Kehoe, Statutes of 2012), the Safety Element of the
General Plan was reviewed and updated to address the risk of fire hazard in
state responsibility areas and very high fire hazard severity zones. In 2008, Town
declared certain areas in Danville as Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones. The
areas receiving this designation were in the vicinity of Magee Ranch, off of
Diablo Road, where single family homes are in immediate proximity to fire-
prone hillsides. Existing developed areas located in proximity to the Las
Trampas Ridge and the hillside areas of the Sycamore Valley are particularly
subject to wildfire risks. Buildings on properties in the Very High Fire Hazard
Severity Zone must comply with specified building requirements which increase
their ability to resist the intrusion of flames or burning embers by a vegetation
fire. These areas do not contain any of the identified housing opportunity sites
for low and very low income housing and these designations will not impede
Town’s ability to meet RHNA.
Fire hazards are addressed through the environmental and development review
and permitting process, through observance of Danville’s Hillside Development
Guidelines, through imposition of the regulations contained in the California
Building Code and through observance of performance standards contained
within the Growth Management Element (which precludes major development
from occurring if firefighting services are not available or are determined to be
inadequate).
d. Flood Hazard
Flooding in Danville does not pose a significant hazard to life and property, but
some areas along major creeks and near the confluence of creeks are subject to
periodic inundation by floods. Flooding that does occur is typically caused by
winter rains. Portions of San Ramon Creek and one of its major tributary
streams, Green Valley Creek, are subject to flooding. Flood hazard maps
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the State
Department of Water Resources (DWR) indicate several areas in developed
portions of Danville that may be subject to flooding.
The Contra Costa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, with
assistance from the Soil Conservation Service, has reshaped and widened
segments of San Ramon, Sycamore, and Green Valley Creeks and constructed
various flood protection structures. These efforts, along with Danville's drainage
maintenance efforts, have reduced the potential for serious floods. Flood
hazards are addressed through the setbacks, through imposition of requirements
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                     72

on new projects to make appropriate flood control improvements and through
observance to the standards of the Flood Disaster Preservation Act of 1973.
Pursuant to Assembly 162 (Wolk, Statutes of 2007) and Senate Bill 5 (Machado,
Statutes of 2007) the Safety Element of the General Plan was reviewed and
updated to reflect current flood hazard maps and related flood hazard policies
and measures. The Danville 2030 General Plan, adopted in March 2013, reflects
the latest information regarding flood hazard risks and includes the best
available maps for the identification of the risks associated with a 200-year flood
event.
As a result of the current level of residential build out in Danville, coupled with the
level of detail of prior flood hazard studies performed on a project-by-project basis
dating back to pre-incorporation, it is not anticipated that there will be any
significant alteration to projected development yield or flood hazard constraint on
the vacant or underutilized properties cited in this housing element update as
being available for future residential development. While the two sites that
received multifamily residential land use designation through the adoption of
the Danville 2030 General Plan (i.e., the 7.0-acre Borel/EBRPD site and the 3.75-
acre Diablo Office Partners site) abut drainage channels, the channels are fully
improved and would not need to be widened to accommodate the development
of the sites for multifamily residential use.
2. Infrastructure, Urban Services and Facilities Constraints
A lack of adequate infrastructure or urban services and facilities can be a
substantial constraint to residential development if it is to avoid impacting
existing residences. On a regular basis (typically on a yearly basis), the Town
reviews it’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP). The CIP is a compilation of the
capital improvements planned for construction over the next five-year period in
Danville. It includes cost estimates, the phasing of specific improvements and
associated costs, and methods with which specific improvements will be
financed. Benefit assessment district financing has been successfully used to
finance a vast amount of infrastructure improvements in the Town and can be
used, as may be needed, in the future.
In 1984, the Town adopted the Commercial Transportation Improvement
Program (CTIP) requiring new commercial and office development to pay a fee
to offset impacts upon local transportation improvements. The fee helps finance
needed improvements to Downtown Danville’s road network. In 1986, the Town
adopted the Residential Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP) requiring
the payment of a fee for each new residential unit for the financing of Town-wide
transportation improvements.
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                         73

In addition, several other impact fees have been put into place to facilitate the
construction and improvement of the basic infrastructure improvements needed
by residential development. The impact fees include, among others, the two-tier
fees for transportation improvements created through the Dougherty Valley
Settlement Agreement, various sub-regional traffic impact fees; park land in-lieu
fees and child care fees.
As mentioned in a previous section, the Growth Management Element of the
General Plan serves to ensure that the infrastructure and urban services and
facilities are in place to serve new development.
Many of Danville’s affordable housing opportunities (i.e., sites currently carrying
multifamily residential land use and zoning designations) are infill development
locations in areas already served by existing infrastructure. The vast majority of
the incorporated limits of the Town lie within the service boundaries for water
and sewer service, virtually assuring that the vacant and underutilized parcels
identified in this document could develop by the end of the 2014-2022 Housing
Element planning period.
East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) is the water purveyor for the
Danville area. EBMUD’s current Water Supply and Management Program
(WSMP 2040), adopted October 2009, serves as the basis for water conservation
and recycling programs and for development of supplemental supply initiatives.
WSMP 2040 seeks to provide a diverse and robust water supply portfolio that
ensures water reliability in an uncertain future while also protecting the
environment.
Through the implementation of the WSMP 2040, EBMUD is meeting future
growth with aggressive conservation and recycling, while supplemental supply
components allow a lower rationing level and thereby decrease direct impacts on
EBMUD customers during dry years.
The Central Contra Costa Sanitary District (CCCSD) wastewater treatment plant
and its associated wastewater collection system provides secondary treatment of
domestic, commercial, and industrial wastewater for Danville, Lafayette,
Martinez, Moraga, Orinda, Pleasant Hill, San Ramon, Walnut Creek, Concord,
Clayton, and adjacent unincorporated areas, including Alamo, Blackhawk,
Clyde, and Pacheco.
The population of the service area is approximately 471,000. In 2013, the
wastewater treatment plant’s average flow dry weather rate was 35.8 million
gallons per day (MGD). This rate is well within the permitted 53.8 MGD average
dry weather flow limit allowed for by Order No. R2-2012-0016 issued by the SF
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                     74

Bay Region of the California Regional Quality Control Board and by National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit No. CA0037648.
CCCSD has indicated it will be able to serve the planned growth provided
through the Danville 2030 General Plan and the 2014-2022 Housing Element.
While many of the Town’s vacant and underutilized parcels can develop without
extension of urban services, they may face other challenges to development.
Infill sites may require upgrading of existing infrastructure systems to support
more intense development, such as roadway improvements and the replacement
of undersized sewer and water lines. Other constraints to development of infill
sites include site assembly and preparation, relocation of existing uses,
compatibility with surrounding land uses and/or potential neighborhood
opposition.
In the context of the intent and requirements of Senate Bill 244 (Wolk, Statutes of
2011), the Land Use Element of the Danville 2030 General Plan was reviewed and
a determination was made that there were no disadvantaged sub-areas in
Danville that had infrastructure conditions (i.e., infrastructure for water,
wastewater, storm drainage, and/or structural fire protection) with deficiencies
and or significant need that would forestall or make infeasible development of
residential property that might develop absent such deficiencies of infrastructure
needs.
EBMUD, the water purveyor for the area, and CCCSD, the wastewater treatment
agency for the area, will be provided copies of this Housing Element after the
Plan is adopted.
The forecasts and projections being used by EBMUD and CCCSD are consistent
with the RHNA and the estimates of development capacity used in this Housing
Element. In other words, the Town is not designating land for development
beyond what has been assumed by these service providers.

IV.     HOUSING RESOURCES
This section analyzes the resources available for the development, rehabilitation
and preservation of housing in Danville. This analysis includes an evaluation of
the availability of land resources for future housing development, the Town’s
ability to satisfy its share of the region’s identified housing need, the financial
resources available to support housing activities, and the administrative
resources available to assist in implementing the Town’s housing policies and
programs. Additionally, this section examines opportunities for energy
conservation.
A.      AVAILABILITY OF SITES FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT
ABAG, as the council of government for the nine-county Bay Area Region, was
directed by the State to develop and assign the Regional Housing Needs
Allocation (RHNA) for the region for the 2014-2022 Housing Element planning
period. After developing the final methodology for the 2014-2022 RHNA, ABAG
assigned shares of the region’s future housing need to each Bay Area Region
jurisdiction. Table 1 reflects Danville’s housing share for the Bay Area Region.
Appendix A is provided to give insight into the methodology utilized for the
2014-2022 RHNA. State law requires that communities document they have
sufficient land to accommodate their assigned share of the region’s future
housing needs. There is a direct relationship between a community’s inventory
of land that is available for residential development and its ability to meet the
adequate sites test set forth in State housing law. This section identifies the
development potential of land in Danville currently available for residential
development to meet Danville’s RHNA, forwarding that information with the
broader goal of providing “greater development certainty” relative residential
development potential in the community.
1. Sites Available for Residential Development with Residential Land Use
    and Zoning Designation
An important component of a housing element is the identification of sites
available for future housing development and evaluation of the adequacy of the
identified sites to fulfill the housing mix established in a jurisdiction’s RHNA.
The results of Danville’s review of sites with residential development potential
are summarized within Tables 32, 33 and 34 and Figure A. All the sites
identified are located within the Town limits. The tables are formatted to
provide at least the following information for each listed site: general plan and
zoning designations, parcel size, address or street location, assessor parcel
number, estimated development potential, and development status.

The sites in Danville available for residential development (i.e., sites that have
the appropriate land use and zoning designations to accommodate residential
development) had a demonstrated capacity of 875-1,075 net800 to 1,000 new
units for the 2014-2022 planning period as of the start of 2014. (Refer to Table 32)
The sites with residential development density standards of at least 8-13 units
per acre have minimum development density standards in place.
While many of the sites are currently vacant, a number of the sites are partially
developed/underutilized sites (e.g., sites that currently contain some limited
level of activity or development but are not considered to be fully developed).
The inclusion of partially developed/underutilized sites indicates the
determination that the current level of development of the property, due to the
limited nature of the land use activity or the age and/or condition of structures
present on the site, does not constitute a significant obstacle to the
redevelopment of the site for a more intensive use reflective of its land use and
zoning designations.

Much of the multifamily development that has occurred in Danville since its
incorporation, or has been granted planning entitlement approval to occur,
involves land not previously designated for multifamily residential use by the
general plan.
Table 42 – Summary of Inclusionary Housing Efforts lists many of these sites,
including: Creekside Commons (Entry #10 - leading to 14 units on 1.6 acres);
Ryland Cottage (Entry #20 - leading to 39 units on 2.9 acres); Pintado Point
(Entry #24 - leading to 9 units on 0.5 acres); Laurel Senior Apartments (Entry #25
- leading to 74 units on 2.75 acres); Willow Commons (Entry #29 - leading to 22
units on 0.5 acres); Tassajara Cottages (Entry #30 - leading to 21 units on 2.8
acres); Rose Garden Apartments (Entry #31 - leading to 55 units on 2.5 acres);
The Preserves @ IHT (Entry #33 - leading to 27 units on 2.6 acres); and the
Danville Hotel (Entry #38 – which will lead to 18 units on 1.0 acres for a vertical
mixed use project). In addition to these sites are the GMMR, LLC site (Entry B-2
on Table 32 that will lead to a minimum of 32 units on 1.6 acres) and the
Casale/Ryder Tassajara LLC site (Entry E-10 on Table 32 which will lead to 7
units on 0.7 acres).
Additional significant projects where the Town approved general plan
amendment requests to allow multifamily development include StoneyBrook
(River Rock Lane at Hartz Way leading to 88 units on 6.9 acres) and the Green
Terraces (Fostoria Circle at Fostoria Way leading to 144 units on 8.1 acres). The
recent recognition of a need to provide flexibility for smaller sites to make
multifamily residential development a viable option are the land use permit
approvals recently granted by the Town in the Downtown area for the Weinberg
site (lead to three for-rent multifamily units on a 0.16 acre horizontal mixed use
project) and for the Onsori site (will lead to three for-rent multifamily units on a
0.10 acre vertical mixed use project).
There are no identified significant environmental constraints or service
limitations that would limit development of residential uses on the sites listed on
Tables 32, 33 and 34. The sites are within the service boundaries for water,
sewer, and other dry utilities supplies, whether public or private. Water delivery
systems and sewer treatment capacity, is or will be, available to the identified
sites.
2. Land Inventory Analysis
The sites listed on Tables 32, 33 and 34 and depicted on Figure A would provide
for the requisite variety of housing types deemed necessary by the RHNA,
including multifamily rental, factory-built, mobile homes, transitional housing,
supportive housing, and emergency shelters.
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                      87

The column labeled “Estimated Development” on Table 32 reflects the assumed
development yield on a property-by-property basis for the 57 sites included on
the table. As applicable and appropriate, the estimated development has been
adjusted to reflect the estimated net development area, accounting for the
presence of unbuildable areas. These adjustments are reflective of policy
direction of the Danville 2030 General Plan as regards the methodology to
calculate a property’s maximum development potential.
Seventeen of the 57 sites are double-listed (but not double-counted), as they
appear both on Tables 32 and 34. These are the properties that currently carry
multifamily residential land use and zoning designations. Each of these sites is
subject to minimum development density standards where a residential use is
established.
Table 34 independently lists one additional site, being the mixed
residential/commercial project with 18-unit multifamily units that secured
building permit issuance after January 1, 2014 (i.e., the Danville Hotel project) – a
project that will provide two for-rent moderate income units to meet its
inclusionary housing requirement. The site is seeing multifamily use established
as a “residential over commercial” component following Town approval of a
general plan amendment that changed their historic commercial land use
designations to a Downtown Business District designation that allows residential
uses as a second story by-right use (i.e., DBD Area 11 – Special Opportunity
District).
Two additional sites listed on Tables 32 and 34 (i.e., sites B-11 and B-12) were
designated DBD Area 11 through the same general plan amendment action and
have comparable residential development potential to the Danville Hotel project
site.
In terms of estimated development potential for the single family residential sites
listed on Table 32, it is assumed these sites will develop at, or near, the
maximum allowable development densities. The development review process
utilized in Danville since the implementation of its inclusionary housing
program in the early 1990’s has seen the vast majority of projects subject to
inclusionary housing regulations secure approvals at the top end of their
respective allowable density ranges (i.e., 36 of 40 projects). (Refer to Table 41)
Further discussion of the Town’s inclusionary housing program is contained in
Section III of this document where governmental constraints to development is
discussed and analyzed. There is no reason, beyond builder market decision, to
assume land use controls and/or site improvement obligations would preclude
the maximum allowable densities to be reached on all the residential sites listed
on Table 32.

3. Progress Made to Satisfy Danville’s 2014-2022 RHNA
To satisfy a jurisdiction’s RHNA allocation, the jurisdiction must identify
adequate sites to accommodate housing that is affordable to extremely low, very
low, low, moderate and above moderate income households. Progress meeting
the RHNA for the 2014-2022 planning period will come from several categories
of residential development activity, which are summarized on Tables 35 and 36.
The following provides expanded discussion of the subcategories of residential
activity included on those tables.
As of January 1, 2014, the sites in Danville available for residential development
(i.e., sites with land use and zoning designations in place to accommodate
residential development) have a demonstrated capacity to accommodate
between 875-1,075 approximately 800 and 1,000 new residential units. (Refer to
Tables 32, 33 and 34 and Figure A)
A total of 66 net new housing units were completed in Danville during the 2014
calendar year (being net production after accounting for the loss of seven units
through demolition). (Refer to Line A of Tables 36 and 37 and Pages 25-28 of
Appendix B) The 73 new units constructed were determined to have the
following household income distribution: no units for extremely low income
households; seven units for very low income households; four units for low
income households; eight units for moderate income households; and 54 units
for above moderate income households. The 73 new units constructed are not a
subset of the 800 to 1,000 unit development capacity (i.e., these units are above
and beyond the cited development capacity).
As of January 1, 20142015, there were 4552 housing units under construction (net
after accounting for the loss of five units through demolition) and 6827
additional units that either had a building permit status of either “Issued” or
“Approved” or were at an earlier stage in the building permit plan check
process. (Refer to Lines B and C of Tables 36 and 37 and Pages 25-28 and 3029-
34 of Appendix B) These

Notes:
   1. The affordability of the seven very low income units is assured through deed restriction (30 year term). The four cited low income units are detached second dwelling
        units whose size (they range from 320 to 657 square feet) qualifies them for a low income household affordable “by-design” designation. The two cited moderate income
        units are detached second dwelling units whose size (i.e, 811 and 864 square feet) qualifies them for a moderate income household affordable “by-design” designation.
        The final second unit is 1,250 square feet in size and is assumed appropriate for an above moderate income household.

these units are above and beyond the cited development capacity).
As of January 1, 20142015, 121154 additional units (being net production after
accounting for the loss of eight units through anticipated demolition) had been
authorized for development (i.e., had secured the requisite planning entitlements
to allow development) but had not yet initiated the building permit plan check
process. (Refer to Line D of Tables 35 and 36 and Page 3135 of Appendix B)
These 121 unitsWhen the 162 new units are constructed, they are projected to
have the following household income distribution upon their construction: no
units for extremely low households; no units for very low income households;
nine units for low income households; no unitsone unit for moderate income
households; and 112152 units for above moderate income households. The 121
units162 new units authorized for development are a subset of the above-cited
875-1,075800 to 1,000 unit development capacity cited above.
As of January 1, 20142015, there were 4027 additional residential units (being net
production after accounting for the loss of three units through anticipated
demolition) linked to pending planning entitlement requests. (Refer to Line E of
Tables 35 and 36 Page 3236 of Appendix B) These 40When the 30 new units are
constructed, they are projected to have the following household income
distribution upon their construction: no units for extremely low households; no
units for very low income households; fourno units for low income households;
no units for moderate income households; and 3630 units for above moderate
income households. The 4030 new units are a subset of the above-cited 875-
1,075800 to 1,000 unit development capacity cited above.
In addition to the projected housing production discussed above-cited subsets of
units, and based on recent development trends, it is reasonable to anticipate 84
individually sponsored second units (i.e., second units on existing developed
single family residential lots) will be constructed between January 1, 20142015
and the end of the 2022the 2014-2022 planning period, providing an average of
twelveten and one half second dwelling units per year for the 2014-2022 planning
period. (Refer to Line G of Tables 35 and 36) Based on the anticipated sizes of
these units 84 units (as extrapolated from the size of the 101 units built or under
construction during the 2007-2014 planning period – refer to Appendix M –
Tables M-1 and M-2), these 84 units are projected to have the following
household income distribution upon their construction: no units for extremely

low households; no units for very low income households; 30 units (35% of the
units) for low income households; 46 units (55% of the units) for moderate
income households; and eight units (15% of the units) for above moderate
households units. The 84 units are not a subset of the above-cited 875-1,075800 to
1,000 unit development capacity (i.e., these units are above and beyond the cited
development capacity).
Because Danville is within the high income Alameda and Contra Costa Counties
Area, the rental market rate value of second dwelling units in this size range
makes many of the units developed affordable to one- and two-person low or
moderate income households. Assuming a maximum of 30%35.0% of household
income is devoted to rental housing costs rent or utilities, a one-person low
income household can assign up to a maximum of $1,075 a month$1,250 month
to housing costs. This increases to $1,245$1,450 a month for two-person low
income households. These assumptions are consistent with findings contained in
the Draft 2014-2022 City of Albany Housing Element, specifically the
determination that the prevailing market rate rental cost per square foot value for
second dwelling units in Berkeley, Albany, and El Cerrito area in 2013 was $2.50
– making a 500 square foot second dwelling unit affordable to one person low
income households and making a 550 square foot second dwelling unit
affordable to two person low income households.
A one-person moderate income household can assign up to a maximum of $2,180
a month to housing. This increases to $2,510 a month for two-person low income
households. For the 2007-2014 planning period, the Town assumed any second
dwelling unit built at 750 square feet or less in size would command rental rates
making them affordable to low income households. The Town further assumed
any second dwelling unit between 751 square feet and 1,000 square feet in size
would command rental rates making them affordable to moderate income
households. These assumptions were verified through Craigslist rental surveys
and through discussions with local real estate representatives and with
developers who were building second dwelling units to satisfy their inclusionary
housing requirement.
Recognizing that rental rates have increased over the past couple of years, the
assumptions on the linkage between unit size and affordability are being
adjusted for the 2014-2022 planning period. After reviewing the various unit
sizes of the 101 second dwelling units either built or under construction between
2007-2014 (see Appendix B), the, the Town has determined it is reasonable to
assume the following unit size breakdown for second units constructed in the
2014-2022 planning period: (1) 35% of units at <550 square feet; (2) 55% of the
units between 551 square feet and 1,000 square feet; and (3) 10% of the units over
1,000 square feet in size. For the 2014-2022 planning period, the Town has
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                     93

determined it is reasonable to assume that units in the first tier of unit size (i.e.,
<550 square feet) will command rental rates making them affordable to low
income households and that units in the second tier of unit size (i.e., between 551
square feet and 1,000 square feet) will command rental rates making them
affordable to moderate income households. The Town will assume that second
dwelling units greater than 1,000 square feet in size will be affordable only to
above moderate income households.
These assumptions reflect findings of a Craigslist rent survey conducted in
January 2015 (refer to Appendix M – Table M-3) and are further supported by
the extrapolation of findings from a recent research paper that analyzed second
unit production and affordability for a nearby sub-area of Alameda County (see
Appendix M – Reference Article Excerpts M-4). Pertinent findings from the
research paper (Yes in My Backyard: Mobilizing the Market for Secondary Units -
June 2012, as prepared by the University of California Center for Community
Innovation) include the following:
• Secondary units can be anticipated to rent for less than other rental units
    because of the informal way they are often supplied and managed;
• Most secondary units are small – roughly two-thirds can be anticipated to be
    either studios or one-bedroom units;
• As supported by Craigslist rental advertisement studies, secondary units will
    likely offer substandard cooking facilities (i.e., they will often not be supplied
    with a stovetop range and/or an oven);
• Secondary units will generally be occupied by people using them as housing
    (the cited study revealed this to be the case for 85% of the units surveyed);
• Secondary units can be anticipated to have roughly a 50%/50% split of
    occupant-households between occupant-households that are strangers who
    pay rent to the home-owning household and occupant-households being
    occupants that are staying for free or else are friends or family, who are likely
    to be receiving reduced rent;
• By far, the most common means by which secondary unit occupants find their
    housing are either already knowing the homeowner household, or Craigslist
    (meaning a measurable number of these units would not be revealed through
    a rental advertisement study);
• Secondary units are far more likely to share utility costs with another
    dwelling (presumably, in most or all cases, the main house) than other types
    of rental housing;
• The average occupied secondary unit can be anticipated to contain 1.5 adults -
    but is unlikely to have children (0.2 on average for the cited study);
• Secondary units are disproportionately likely to house young adults; the
    average age of the adults residing in them can be anticipated to be under 40
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                        94

    years of age (it was 39 for the cited study - as compared to 50 for the average
    age for homeowner households in the study area); and
• As supported by analysis of rental unit advertisements on Craigslist, the
    average secondary unit can be anticipated to be advertised at a rental rate that
    makes it affordable to low income households (for the cited just under one
    half of the secondary units were occupied by a low income household).
Another subset of the above-cited 875-1,075 unit development capacity
areAdditional units that can be anticipated to be developed during the planning
period are units that would be constructed on existing individual lots of record
available for single family development that are not included in any other
totalsub-category. At the time of adoption of the 2014-2022 Housing Element
there were 4832 such lots. It is anticipated that a range of 16 to 1913 to 15 units of
these lots would be developed during the 2014-2022 planning period. (Refer to
Line F of Tables 35 and 36) Residential development on this subset of 16 to
19these 13 to 15 units is projected to have the following household income
distribution upon occupancy: no units for extremely low, very low, low, or
moderate income households; and 16 to 1913 to 15 units for above moderate
income households. These 13 to 15 units are a subset of the 800 to 1,000 unit
development capacity cited above.
An additional subset of the above-cited 875-1,075 unit development capacity are
theAdditional units that can be anticipated to be constructed during the 2014-
2022 planning period are replacement single family detached (RSFD) units
anticipated to be constructed during the 2014-2022 planning period. Reflecting
the rate of development of RSFD units during the 2007-2014 planning period, it is
anticipated that 5452 RSFD units will be developed during the 2014-2022
planning period. As each RSFD is associated with a corresponding demolition of
an existing single family residence, the construction of RSFD units would not
result in any net new residential units. All 52 projected RSFD units developed
would be anticipated to serve the housing needs of above moderate income
households. The 52 units are not a subset of the 800 to 1,000 unit development
capacity (i.e., these units are above and beyond the cited development capacity).
After accounting for the aggregate number of anticipated units listed above that are
a subset of the cited 800 to 1,000 unit development capacity (i.e., a range of 374 to
377205 to 207 units), there are approximately 500 to 700650 to 800 units of
development potential remaining from the above-cited 875-1075 unit development
capacity. During the course of the 2014-2022 planning period it is projected that a
range of 449 to 528483 to 562 units of the remaining 500 to 700650 to 800 units of
development capacity will be constructed. (Refer to Lines H and I of Tables 35
and 36)
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                        95

Residential development of this subset of 449 to 528483 to 562 units has the
capacity to have the following household income distribution upon their
construction: 105 to 126 extremely low income units; 114 to 137 very low income
units; 85 to 103 low income units; 6 to 7 moderate income units; and 173 to 189
above moderate income units. (Refer to Lines H and I of Table 33)
It was established through analysis contained within the Danville 2007-2014
Housing Element that the Town had a RHNA “shortfall” for the 2007-2014
planning period. The 2007-2014 Housing Element established that Danville
needed to fill a shortfall of multifamily land with minimum development
densities adequate to accommodate the needs of 187 extremely low and very low
income households and to fill a shortfall of multifamily land with minimum
development densities adequate to accommodate the needs of 34 low income
households.
In response to the identified RHNA shortfall, by way of the Town’s adoption of
the 2030 General Plan in March 2013, the Town designated 8.75 acres to a newly
established Residential – Multifamily – High (25-30 units per acre) land use
designation and designated an additional 2.0 acres to the Residential –
Multifamily – High/Medium (20-25 units per acre) land use designation. The
High/Medium land use designation was recalibrated by the adoption of the 2030
Plan from an 18 units per acre minimum density to a 20 units per acre minimum
density to meet HCD’s requirements to qualify as land suitable to accommodate
the needs of low income households.
Both sites affected by these actions (i.e., the 7.00 acre Borel/EBRPD site and the
3.75 acre Danville Office Partners, LLC site) were subsequently rezoned by
Town-initiated rezoning actions to establish the right to develop at the cited
multifamily residential densities as an at-right land use - a requisite step in
addressing Danville’s RHNA shortfall for the 2007-2014 planning period.
These two sites (10.75 net acres in aggregate area) remained available for
development as of the adoption of the 2014-2022 Housing Element and constitute
the majority of the land needed to meet the extremely low, very low income and
low income household components of Danville’s 2014-2022 RHNA.
Table 34 lists all sitesproperties in Danville with development potential for
multifamily development as of the adoption of the 2014-2022 Housing Element.
The four right hand columns on the table highlight those properties (i.e., sites
listed as Entry 2 (Site B-2 from Table 32 – the GMMR, LLC property), Entry 7
(Site B-8 from Table 32 – the Danville Office Partners property discussed above),
Entry 12 (Site B-17 from Table 32 – the Danville Hotel Holdings property), and
Entries 17 and 18 (being two portions of Site G-2 from Table 32 – the
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                    96

Borel/EBRPD site discussed above) that meet HCD standards to satisfy the
housing needs for the extremely low, very low and low income household
components of Danville’s 2014-2022 RHNA. HCD requires sites to have
specified minimum development potential (i.e., must, if not already designated
and zoned for multifamily use, be composed of single ownership properties with
clear development potential that are >0.8 acres in size) and specified minimum
allowable development densities (i.e., a minimum of 25 units per acre for the
extremely low and very low income household components of the 2014-2022
RHNA and a minimum of 20 units per acre for the low income household
component of the 2014-2022 RHNA).
Three of the five sites were vacant at the time of adoption of the Housing Element
(i.e., Entries 2, 17 and 18 on Table 34). The other two sites, while non-vacant, are
underutilized sites that were determined to have realistic residential development
capacity at densities appropriate to accommodate Danville’s RHNA within the
2014-2022 planning period.
Entry 7 on Table 34 (Site B-8 on Figure A) is the Danville Office Partners property,
a 3.75 acre site (net area) occupied by a 50,000 square foot office project. Several
factors support the determination of the property’s “clear development potential.”
Those factors include: the age of the project (it was built in 1979); the general
condition of the office structures and of the general site improvements; and the
physical layout of the office space (i.e., the size and orientation of office spaces,
hallways and stairways). Collectively these factors make the office project less
competitive in the local office rental market (an office market dominated by high
quality/highly flexible office space available in the Bishop Ranch Office Park in San
Ramon and the Hacienda Office Park in Pleasanton). Even in the context of
competing with other Danville office space, space which is generally newer and in
relatively better condition, this office space is clearly past its prime. The current
office project has a high vacancy rate. Tenant leases are generally month-to-month
leases. These last two factors are likely reflective of the fact that the property
ownership has been actively marketing the property for multifamily use since as
early as the start of 2010.
Interest in the property from multifamily developers has been, and continues to be,
extensive. This interest is evidenced by the large number of pre-submittal meetings
the Town has had with multifamily builders making inquiries about the site’s
development potential over the past several years. In their discussions with the
Town, these developers have not raised concerns about constraints making the
project infeasible.
As of January 2015 the property was in escrow for sale for to a multifamily
developer that has expressed a desire to pursue a for-rent project that would invoke
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                     97

density bonus provisions in return for the provision of units in the project for very
low income households. The recent elimination of redevelopment agencies lessened
the affordable housing burden for the property, as that action resulted in the
parallel elimination of the previously applicable RDA inclusionary housing
requirement (which would have required 60% of 15% of the multifamily units
developed on the property to be affordable to very low income households). This
factor further enhances the “clear development potential” of the property as it
makes the property even more viable for reuse with a multifamily project. The
change of the site’s land use designation to Residential – Multifamily – High
Density (25-30 units per acre) and the follow-up rezoning action to establish high
density multifamily use as an “at-right” use (i.e., no legislative action is necessary
to develop the site with high density multifamily use) provides high developer
certainty as to the potential yield of the property. The density range in place allows
interest in the property to be shown by both multifamily for-sale builders and
multifamily for-rent builders.
Entry 12 on Table 34 (Site B-17 on Figure A) is the Danville Hotel Holdings
property. Entry 12’s “clear development potential” is demonstrated by the fact that
the planning entitlement approved for the site in early 2011 subsequently resulted
in the issuance of building permits in early 2015 for a project that includes 18
multifamily residential units. The 18 units being developed on the property reflect
a development density of 22.5 units per net acre across the 0.8+/- portion of the site
being redeveloped as a mixed use project.
Taking all the subsets cited above into account, the aggregate residential
development capacity for the 2014-2022 planning period is a range of 852 to 934888
to 969 units (with net production being in the range of 801 to 882 units after
accounting for a projected 87 units lost due to demolition to accommodate new
construction). As established in the above paragraphs, the development capacity
would yield the following household income distribution: 105 to 126 extremely low
income units; 121 to 144 very low income units; 137 to 155132 to 150 low income
units; 67 to 6869 to 70 moderate income units; and 489 to 508548 to 566 above
moderate income units. (Refer to “Totals” Lines Tables 35 and 36 and Table 42 -
Quantified Objective for 2014-2022 Planning Period) After accounting for the
projected demolition of 79 existing residential units during the planning period, the
capacity for new units is a range of 840 to 922 net new residential units.
As shown on Table 34, the amount and type of land available for multifamily
development, coupled with the anticipated production of second dwelling units,
assures that Danville exceeds the requisite development capacity for the
extremely low, very low and low income household components of Danville’s
2014-2022 RHNA. Specifically, as detailed on Table 34, Danville has the
development capacity for 118-138 low income units (where the current RHNA
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                       98

allocation for low income household need is 111 units) and has the development
capacity for 219-263 very low income units (where the current RHNA allocation
for very low income household need is 196 units).
4. Analysis of Densities Appropriate to Accommodate Housing for Lower
    Income Households
Housing element law requires jurisdictions to provide a requisite analysis
showing that zones identified for lower-income households are sufficient to
encourage such development. The law provides two options for preparing the
analysis: (1) describe market demand and trends, financial feasibility, and recent
development experience; (2) utilize default density standards deemed adequate
to meet the appropriate zoning test. According to state law, the default density
standard for the Danville is 30 dwelling units per acre.
Danville currently has capacity for 219 to 263 units at 30 dwelling units per acre
or more, meeting 71% to 86% of the lower-income RHNA on these sites. The
remaining allocation will be met on sites zoned to allow 20 to 25 dwelling units
per.
a. Market Conditions
While land prices are high in the Danville area, densities up to 25 units per acre
are considered appropriate for the development of housing affordable to lower
income households. This assumption is further supported by conversations with
developers of housing affordable to lower income households. Based on
conversations with developers of housing affordable to lower income
households, the availability of land, sizeable parcels (e.g. an acre or more) and
subsequent economies of scale and construction costs for garden style
apartments are contributing factors to the cost effectiveness of 25 units per acre.
Additional factors include the ability to provide surface parking instead of other
more expensive forms. This cost effectiveness of 25 units per acre, in simple
terms can be expressed in terms of land costs per unit at various densities. (Refer
to Table 37).
For example, the following table uses an average land price of $3.5 million per
acre. Based on a typical total development cost of approximately $450,000 per
unit, the table shows a significant difference between lower densities (e.g., 15
units per acre) and higher densities such as 25 and 30 units per acre. Specifically,
land costs per unit at 25 units per acre are less than 150,000 per unit and
represent only about 30 percent of total development costs which is much less
than approximately 52 percent for 15 units per acre.

         Note:   Table assumes an average land price of $3,500,000 per acre and total development costs
                 of $450,000 per unit.
b. Financial Feasibility
Danville contacted local affordable housing developers. Based on those
conversations, it was determined that densities at 25 units per acre can be
appropriate for development of affordable housing. The size of parcels is an
important consideration. The ability to accommodate at least 40 units and
maximize surface parking were key to financial feasibility. There are currently
two sites that can accommodate at least 40 units at 25 units per acre.
The cost of different construction types can also be an important factor, with the
possibility that housing cost can increase when the density increases because of
the required materials, e.g., steel frame versus stick frame, parking structures.
Garden style 2 to 3 story apartments were considered to facilitate financial
feasibility.
Based on the above information, taking into account conversations with
affordable housing developers, and looking at what has been built in the
community, 25 units per acre is an appropriate density to accommodate housing
for lower income households for a small portion of the RHNA for lower income
households.
c. Development Experience - Danville Area and San Ramon Areas
Recent developments with an affordable component range approximately from
19 to 46 units per acre (net). The average density has been approximately 26
units per acre. Also, most developments have been 50 to 120 units in size,
emphasizing the importance of parcel size. Of the recent developments, two
were 100 percent were non-elderly and affordable to BMR. Both of these
development were about 20-22 units per acre. (Refer to Table 38).

45. Quantified Objectives for 2014–2022 Housing Element Planning Period
The setting of quantified objectives follows a locality’s work in identifying
housing needs, surveying land and financial resources, analyzing constraints,
and developing appropriate programmatic and policy responses which reflect a
community’s unique needs and circumstances. This information is used to
establish reasonable estimates of the number of units, by income level, these
programs and policies can accomplish.
The quantified objectives should estimate the number of units likely to be
constructed, rehabilitated or conserved/preserved by income level during the
planning period. The quantified objectives do not represent a ceiling on
development, but rather set a target goal for the jurisdiction to achieve based on
needs, resources and constraints.
Ideally, construction objectives will be equal to identified needs. However, when
a locality has determined total housing needs exceed the locality’s ability to meet
those needs with existing resources, the quantified objectives may be less than
the total identified need as specified in the locality’s regional housing need
allocation. Under these circumstances, localities may target limited resources to
areas of greatest local need based on the analysis completed.
The development capacity for residential development in Danville during the
2014-2022 housing element planning period equals the aggregate number of
housing units projected to be completed that are detailed on Table 42, located at
the end of the document.

B.      FINANCIAL RESOURCES
The Town of Danville has access to a variety of existing and potential funding
sources for affordable housing activities. Many of these funding sources involve
programs administered by Contra Costa County (e.g., CDBG and HOME funded
programs, as described in more detail below).
1. Community Development Block Grant Program
Contra Costa County administers the Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) Program for all Contra Costa jurisdictions except the cities of Antioch,
Concord, Pittsburg, Richmond and Walnut Creek. These five cities individually
receive CDBG funding directly from HUD because they have populations in
excess of 50,000 residents and are entitled to receive funding from HUD directly.
The remaining fourteen cities and the unincorporated areas of the County
participate in the CDBG program through the County, and are collectively
referred to as the Contra Costa Urban County. The CDBG program is funded
through the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Based on previous allocations, the County anticipates receiving annual
allocations of approximately $3 million in CDBG funds during the –2014-2022
planning period. In accordance with policies established by the County Board of
Supervisors, 45 percent of the annual CDBG allocation (approximately $1.35
million) is reserved for programs and projects to increase and maintain the
supply of rental housing affordable to and occupied by very low and low income
households. CDBG funds are used for site acquisition, rehabilitation of existing
affordable housing stock, first-time homebuyer assistance, development of
emergency and transitional shelters, and fair housing/housing counseling
activities. Additional activities focus on the supply of appropriate and
supportive housing for special needs populations. A measurable contribution of
CDBG funds ($1,800,000) was expended on the 74-unit Bridge Housing/Town of
Danville affordable senior housing apartment project completed in 2004.
2. HOME Investment Partnership Act Program
Contra Costa County also administers the Home Investment Partnership Act
(HOME) Program through the Contra Costa Consortium, with member
jurisdications including the Contra Costa as the Urban County and the cities of
Antioch, Pittsburg and Walnut Creek. Approximately $1.8 million in HOME
funds are allocated on an annual basis to the Consortium. All projects funded
with HOME funds must be targeted to very low and low income households and
must have permanent matching funds from non-federal resources equal to 25%
of the requested funds. In addition, the Board of Supervisors has established a
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                 103

priority for the allocation of HOME and CDBG funds to projects that include a
portion of the units affordable to extremely low-income households.
3. Emergency Shelter Grants Program
The Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) Program was established by HUD as part
of the federal Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing
Act (HEARTH Act). The program provides funds for homeless shelters, social
services for the homeless, and for homeless prevention efforts. On behalf of the
Urban County, Contra Costa County receives approximately $237,000 annually
in ESG funds from HUD. These funds are awarded to local non-profit and
public agencies to provide emergency shelter and support services for the
homeless. ESG funds are used in conjunction with Contra Costa County General
Fund monies and other resources to support two emergency shelters for adults,
one in the West County area and one in Central County, as well as drop-in day
care services providing meals, showers and laundry, and shelter and support
services for victims of domestic violence.
4. Housing Successor Funds (former Redevelopment Set-Aside Funds)
The legislation eliminating redevelopment allowed certain housing assets to
remain with Housing Successor Agencies. For Danville, a large portion of the
former Redevelopment Set-Aside Funds will be tied up for the remaining life of
the Housing Successor Agency to cover the bond payment obligations created
through the Bridge Housing/Town of Danville affordable senior housing
apartment completed in 2004 in the downtown area.
5. Bond Financing
As cited in the prior entry, the Town of Danville issued tax-exempt mortgage
revenue bonds to support the development of the 74-unit Bridge Housing/Town
of Danville affordable senior housing apartment project completed in 2004 in the
downtown area. The proceeds from the bond sales are being used to cover land
acquisition costs and construction costs associated with this project that targeted
extremely low income and very low income senior households. The Housing
Successor Agency does own two small parcels of land in the Downtown which
could be sold to provide financial resources.
6. Mortgage Credit Certificates
The Mortgage Credit Certificate Program, authorized by Congress in the Tax
Reform Act of 1984, provides financial assistance to qualifying first time
homebuyers for the purchase of new or existing single family residences. In
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                    104

1985, the State adopted legislation authorizing local agencies (for Danville this
means Contra Costa County) to make Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCCs)
available in California. Contra Costa County MCC authority can be used in all
cities as well as the unincorporated areas of the County.
7. Low Income Housing Tax Credits
Created by the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit
(LIHTC) Program is used in combination with County and other resources to
assist the construction or rehabilitation of rental housing serving low income
households. The program allows investors an annual tax credit over a ten year
period, provided that the housing project making use of the funding meets
specified minimum low income housing occupancy requirements. The 74-unit
Bridge Housing/Town of Danville affordable senior housing apartment project
completed in 2004 in the downtown area was funded in part by LIHTC proceeds,
which were secured through a competitive review process.
8. Section 8 Assistance
The Housing Authority of Contra Costa County administers the federal rental
assistance program that provides rent subsidies to very low income persons in
need of affordable housing. The Section 8 program offers a voucher that pays the
difference between the current fair market rent (with specified maximum
allowable rent levels) and what a tenant can afford to pay (e.g., 30% of their
household income). The voucher allows a tenant to choose housing that may
cost above the payment standard, but the tenant must pay the extra cost.
The County has approximately 7,000 residents who receive Section 8 assistance.
The 22-unit Willow Commons apartment project completed in 2006, a private
venture serving seniors and up to six developmentally disabled one-person
households, pursued and secured Section 8 vouchers for the developmentally
disabled households in the project.
C.      ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES
Described below are major public and non-profit agencies that have been
involved in affordable housing activities. The agencies/organizations listed have
the potential to play a role in the production, improvement, preservation and
management of affordable housing and related supportive services and
programs for the existing and future residents of Danville.

The administrative efforts provided by Contra Costa County Department of
Conservation and Development (County DCD) staff for the affordable housing
programs involving the coalition of agencies involved with the Contra Costa
Urban County and the Contra Costa Consortium represent a substantial resource
for the provision of affordable housing in the community.
The County DCD implements programs designed to increase and maintain
affordable housing, expand economic and social opportunities for lower income,
homeless and special needs populations, and revitalize declining neighborhoods.
Specific programs include the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG),
the HOME Investment Partnership Act Program, the Housing Opportunities for
Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) Program, the Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG)
Program, the tax-exempt and mortgage revenue bond, and Mortgage Credit
Certificate (MCC) programs. The County DCD is also responsible for the review
of projects applying to HUD for funding to determine their consistency with the
Consortium’s Consolidated Plan. Based on previous allocations, the County
anticipates receiving an allocation of approximately $3 million annually in CDBG
funds during the planning period. In addition to those funds, approximately $1.8
million in HOME funds are allocated to the Consortium on an annual basis
through HUD.
3. Section 8 Assistance
The Housing Authority of Contra Costa County administers the federal rental
assistance program that provides rent subsidies to very-low income persons in
need of affordable housing. The Section 8 program offers a voucher that pays the
difference between the current fair market rent and what a tenant can afford to
pay (e.g., 30 percent of their income). The voucher allows a tenant to choose
housing that may cost above the payment standard, but the tenant must pay the
extra cost. Project-based vouchers help support new affordable housing
developments.

4. Housing Successor Agency (former Community Development Agency of
    the Town of Danville)
The legislation eliminating redevelopment allowed certain housing assets to
remain with Housing Successor Agencies. For Danville, a large portion of the
former Redevelopment Set-Aside Funds will be tied up for the remaining life of
the Housing Successor Agency to cover the bond payment obligations created
through the Bridge Housing/Town of Danville affordable senior housing
apartment completed in 2004 in the downtown area.
5. Danville Building Inspection Division
The Danville Building Inspection Division carries out building inspection and
code enforcement activities that are designed to ensure the safety of the Town’s
housing stock. The Division staff is available for use as a resource by renters and
owners of units in Town that may be in need of rehabilitation and/or other
improvements designed to increase efficiency in energy use.
6. Contra Costa County Health Services Department
The County Health Services Department (HSD) is responsible for the
development of plans and programs to assist homeless households and adults
throughout the County by providing emergency and permanent supportive
housing and supportive services designed to enable this population to achieve
greater economic independence and a stable living environment.                 HSD
coordinates the activities of, and provides staff support to, the Contra Costa
Interagency Council on Homelessness (CCICH). The CCICH works with the
HSD to develop and refine the Ten Year Plan to End Homelessness, and to
develop the County’s Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition
(HEARTH) Act application, to educate the public with respect to homelessness,
and to advocate for increased funding for homeless programs.
7. Non-profit Housing Developers
Contra Costa County has several successful affordable housing developers with
significant organizational capacity. Non-profit agencies that are involved in
housing development represent a substantial resource for the provision of
affordable units in a community. These agencies/organizations play important
roles in the production, improvement, preservation, and management of
affordable housing. Nonprofit ownership helps assure that these housing units
will remain as low-income housing. Following is an example of the most active
developers in the County.
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                    107

a. Bridge Housing Corporation
Based out of San Francisco, Bridge Housing Corporation develops and manages
affordable housing for lower income households in the Bay Area and throughout
California. BRIDGE developed and is managing the 74-unit affordable senior
rental project completed in 2004 in the downtown area.
b. Shelter, Inc. of Contra Costa County
Shelter, Inc. is a non-profit community-based service organization and affordable
housing provider located in Martinez that is active in Central and East Contra

affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International serving Alameda, Contra Costa,
and Santa Clara Counties.
Their mission is to create successful homeownership opportunities for families
with limited incomes by building sustainable housing and revitalizing
neighborhoods.
Over the past 27 years, Habitat for Humanity East Bay has served 460 low and
very-low income families in Alameda, Contra Costa, and Santa Clara Counties
by providing affordable homeownership opportunities to low-income families
who earn an income between 30%-80% of area median income, have a need for
housing, and are willing to partner with Habitat for Humanity and contribute
hundreds of sweat equity hours to the construction of their own home, or their
neighbor's home. Habitat for Humanity East Bay approaches the challenge of
providing affordable homeownership opportunities to low-income families in an
innovative way. Affordable homes are built using a large amount of volunteer
labor, donated funds and materials. Then the homes are sold at affordable prices
to qualifying low-income families.
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                 109

h. Satellite Affordable Housing Associates
Satellite Affordable Housing Associates (SAHA) is a non-profit housing

populations through acquisition/rehabilitation and new construction projects.
Contra Costa projects include Acalanes Court, Hookston Manor, Montego Place,
and Sierra Gardens. An additional project, Third Avenue Apartments, is under
construction.
D.      OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
1. Utility-related Costs
Utility-related costs can directly affect the affordability of housing. Title 24 of the
California Administrative Code sets forth mandatory energy standards for new
development and requires adoption of an “energy budget.” In turn, the home
building industry must comply with these standards while localities are
responsible for enforcing the energy conservation regulations. There are many
alternative ways to meet these energy standards including but not limited to:
    •   Use of passive solar;
    •   High insulation levels;
    •   Active solar water heating;
    •   Locating the home on the northern portion of the sunniest part of the site;
    •   Designing the structure to admit the maximum amount of sunlight into
        the building and to reduce exposure to extreme weather condition;
    • Locating indoor areas of maximum usage along the south face of the
        building and placing corridors, closets, laundry rooms, power core, and
        garages along the north face making the main entrance a small enclosed
        space that creates an air lock between the building and its exterior; and
    • Using a windbreak to reduce the wind velocity against the entrance.
2. Energy Conservation
Energy conservation is also addressed through the Town’s environmental and
development review and permitting process. The initial environmental analysis
prepared for new construction projects is used to identify potential energy use
impacts and, as may be necessary, results in the imposition of project revisions
and/or project conditions of approval the serve to reduce energy consumption.
Utility companies serving Danville offer various programs to promote the
efficient use of energy and other resources. Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E)
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                        110

provides a variety of energy efficiency rebates and energy conservation services
for residents. PG&E also participates in several energy assistance programs for
lower income households, which help qualified homeowners and renters
conserve energy and control energy costs. These include the California Alternate
Rates for Energy (CARE) Program (providing enrolled residents a 30% to 35%
discount on their utility bills) and the Relief for Energy Assistance through
Community Help (REACH) Program (a one-time energy-assistance program
administered by PG&E and administered through the Salvation Army).
In addition, the State Department of Health and Human Services funds the
Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) which provides financial assistance to
qualified residents to offset the costs of heating and/or cooling dwellings and/or
to have their dwellings weatherized to make them more energy efficient.
The East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD), which serves the residents of
Danville, offers a variety of conservation services and incentives to its customers,
including onsite usage surveys as well as providing water conservation devices.
Examples of the incentives are the provision of water conserving showerheads,
kitchen and faucet aerators and low-spray hose nozzles. Examples of rebates
include rebates towards the purchase of high-efficiency clothes washers (in the
form of a combined $200 rebate from EBMUD and PG&E) and high-efficiency
toilets (a rebate of up to $50 for replacing low efficiency toilets).
3. Sustainability Action Plan
In response to legislation passed by the State of California which imposed
significant new requirements intended to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions over the next several decades, the Town of Danville prepared and
adopted a Sustainability Action Plan.                The Plan encourages more
environmentally sustainable practices in Danville to help reach emission
reduction targets that were adopted through Assembly Bill 32 in 2006. Unless
otherwise required by State law, compliance is intended to be achieved through a
combination of voluntary measures, and public education and outreach.
The SAP was prepared in 2011 and 2012 through a public process including four
study sessions with the Danville Town Council and Planning Commission. The
Plan was adopted concurrently with the Danville 2030 General Plan and an
accompanying Environmental Impact Report (EIR), in March 2013. The SAP
establishes a target for a reduction in GHG emissions in Danville by 15 percent
between 2008 and 2020, consistent with the directives of the California Air
Resources Board.

V.     HOUSING ACCOMPLISHMENTS
A.     EVALUATION OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS UNDER THE
       2007-2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
This section assesses the achievements of the adopted 2007-2014 Housing
Element, in accordance with State housing law. These results are quantified
where appropriate and compared to what was projected in the adopted Element.
Appendix C provides an expanded, policy-by-policy discussion of the housing
programs and their implementation.
B.     COMPARISON OF THE 2007-2014 RHNA ALLOCATION WITH
       UNITS BUILT
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) assigned 583 residential units
to the Town of Danville as Danville’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA) for the 2007-2014 Housing Element planning period. This allocation
included 196 very low income household units, 130 low income units, 196
moderate income units and 111 above moderate income units. Housing
developed or issued certificates of occupancy between January 1, 2007 and
December 31, 2014 are applied to the 2007-2014 RHNA. Residential units
developed or issued with certificates of occupancy after January 1, 2014 will be
applied to Danville’s 2014-2022 RHNA.
Between 2007 and 2014, there was a net production of 366 housing units (after
accounting for 49 demolitions) within the corporate limits of Danville. (Refer to
Tables 40 and 41 and Appendix B) Reflective of ABAG’s methodology for
determining housing production credit for the 2007-2014 RHNA planning
period, no credit towards Danville’s RHNA was given for housing developed
outside the Town boundary but within the Town’s sphere of influence.
While no credit is provided towards Danville’s RHNA, the development of an
affordable housing project within Danville’s sphere of influence (i.e., the
Meadow Wood at Alamo Creek a senior rental project) is available to serve
residents of Danville and surrounding communities. The project was built
during the 2007-2014 planning period and consists of 120 one- and two-bedroom
apartments, ranging in size from 603 to 830 square feet serving a mix of very low,
low and moderate income households. The project provides preference in the
rental of units to nurses, public school teachers, peace officers as defined by
Penal Code section 830.1(a), and persons employed as firefighters by city fire
departments or fire protection agencies of a county, city, city and county, or fire
protection district, who qualify for participation in this program.

Of the 366 net units produced, none were extremely low income units, two were
very low income units, 82 were low income units, 96 were moderate income
units, and 235 were above moderate income units. (Refer to Tables 28 and 41)
The very low, low and moderate income units that were constructed were
developed as a result of implementation of either the Town’s inclusionary
housing policies or redevelopment agency inclusionary housing policies. Table
41 and Figure B provide information on the 40 residential development projects
acted on since the Town’s adoption of an inclusionary housing ordinance in 1999.
Seven of the projects subject to inclusionary requirements (i.e., Entries 34 through
40 on Table 41) secured their planning entitlement approval during the planning
period of the Danville 2007-2014 Housing Element.
C.      APPROPRIATENESS              OF        GOALS,         POLICIES,         AND
        IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
There is no substantive difference between the overarching goals set forth in the
2007-2014 Housing Element and the 2014-2022 Housing Element. As indicated in
the prior section, and as measured by housing production figures for the past
planning period, Danville had mixed results in meeting the goals and objectives
for the past planning period. The elimination of redevelopment agencies, when
coupled with the reduction of federal funding in the CDBG and HOME
programs, served to limit opportunities for new affordable housing construction
throughout Contra Costa County. The entire Bay Area Region was severely
impacted by the housing market collapse during the Great Recession.
Countywide, 11,679 homes (or three percent of the total number of housing
units) were lost to foreclosure in 2008 with foreclosure recovery beginning in
2012. In 2013, foreclosure levels were still three times the pre-recession levels.
Many of the policies set forth in the 2007-2014 Housing Element are being carried
forward as policies for the 2014-2022 Housing Element. Where a policy has been
retained, adjustments have been made to reflect changes in baseline conditions
between the two planning periods, to reflect progress made (or lack of progress)
in the implementation of programs during the planning period, and/or to reflect
changes in State law.

    a. A Below-Market-Rate (BMR) unit is a unit that is priced to be affordable to households that are moderate
        income or below. Moderate income is defined as an annual income of 120% or less of the Area Median
        Income (AMI) for the Alameda County and Contra Costa County Area, and varies depending on the
        number of people in the household. AMI is adjusted every year. Usually, the BMR price is lower than the
        prices of other units in the same development that are being sold on the open market. Sometimes BMR

   units are priced for, and restricted to, households that are low income (80% or less of AMI) or very low
   income (50% or less of AMI). Below market rate units in these projects were made available as for-sale units
   and were units that were sized to accommodate four-person Moderate Income Households earning up to
   110% of median income. Units are deed restricted to control resale values and requiring future buyers to
   meet income restrictions for a period of twenty years.
b. Below market rate units in these projects were made available as for-rent secondary units for one- or two-
   person Very Low Income Households. The project locations were within Danville’s Redevelopment Area
   and the projects were developed consistent with the provisions of California Redevelopment Law
   inclusionary housing requirements.
c. Below market rate units in this project were made available as for-rent senior assisted living
   units. The project developer secured tax exempt funding that required a minimum of 20% of the
   units to be made available to Low Income Households. The requirement to provide 15 of 76 units as Low
   Income units was more restrictive than would have been required through imposition of the Town’s
   Inclusionary Housing Ordinance (which would have required seven units be made available for Moderate
   Income Households).
d. Below market rate units in these projects were made available as for-rent second dwelling units built on
   selected lots within the project (minimum of 25% of the lots per the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance).
   Where the property owners receive rental income for the units, the affordable housing agreement
   stipulates that owners rent to qualifying Low Income Households (i.e., households earning below <80% of
   median income). In practice, the units developed in these projects are assumed to be affordable “by-
   design” by way of their relative size (most in the 450 to 600 square foot range) and their physical
   relationship to the primary residence (consciously set to make it cost prohibitive to “absorb” the area of the
   second unit into the primary residence).
e. Below market rate units in these projects were made available as for-rent units with a year-by-year
   accounting to assure the rent schedule in place for the entire project makes all units affordable to Moderate
   Income Households earning <100% median income (i.e., a 10% “deeper” affordability standard than
   otherwise dictated by the Town’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance). With this arrangement, the projects
   are deemed to be affordable “by-design” projects, consistent with provisions set forth in the Town’s
   Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. If and when market rate rents rise to the point that the project rent
   schedule no longer makes units affordable to households earning <100% of median income, the projects are
   obligated to identify 15% of the project units as designated below market rate units and to screen tenants
   for eligibility as households earning <110% of median income.
f. Town Council authorization was secured by the developer to have two of the four below market rate units
   in the project retained in builder ownership and made available to qualifying moderate income households
   as for-rent housing – with rental levels set at 35% of actual household income of qualifying households.
g. Below market rate units in these projects were developed as a result of a density bonus process. For the
   Pintado Point project, the unit is a for-sale unit with a purchase price making it affordable to Low Income
   Households. For the Laurel Senior Housing project, the units are senior for-rent units affordable to
   Extremely Low and Very Low Income Households. For the Willow Commons project, the units are mixed
   for-rent units with either one senior Very Low Income or two senior Low Income units; up to six units for
   the Developmentally Disabled (which would are managed as Section 8 - Very Low Income units) and the
   remainder as senior for-rent Moderate Income units. For the Elworthy project, the below market rate units
   are to be for-rent very low income units.
h. The timing of delivery of these for-sale units into the market, the project densities, and the range of unit
   sizes in the projects collectively worked to make both projects affordable “by-design” projects. The vast
   majority of the 196 units in the Shadowhawk project had initial sales prices making them affordable to
   moderate income households, with more than half having initial sale prices affordable to median income
   households. Over two-thirds of the units in the Preserves @ Iron Horse Trail (IHT) project (i.e., 27 of 34
   units) had initial sale prices making them affordable to median income households. In recognition of the
   affordable “by-design” status, the project sponsors were not required to deed restrict any of the units in the
   projects with resale restrictions to require a review of income qualifications.
i. The timing of delivery of these for-rent units into the market, the project densities, and the range of unit
   sizes in the projects collectively worked to make the non-deed restricted units in the projects affordable
   “by-design” to moderate income households.

Some of the programs set forth in the 2007-2014 planning period were not
completed or, in some cases, not initiated due to staffing limitations. Focus
during the past planning period by necessity went to larger scale efforts (e.g., the
update of the Danville General Plan) rather than on the initiation, or furtherance,
of comparatively minor programs. Given the improving state of the economy,
and in recognition that the Town completed the scheduled update to its General
Plan, it is envisioned that relatively more time will be available to be put towards
implementation of programs called for in the 2014-2022 Housing Element.
Staffing limitations, difficulties encountered during the general plan update
effort, and/or a change in the number and scope of planning entitlements (an
economy-driven change) will have a direct impact on the achievement of the new
housing programs.
The primary focus of the 2014-2022 Housing Element will be to implement
housing-related measures placed into the Municipal Code by various zoning text
amendments that occurred in response to implementation measures in the 2007-
2014 Housing Element (e.g., amendment to the Density Bonus Ordinance and
establishment of a Condominium Conversion Ordinance).

VI.     HOUSING PLAN
A.      HOUSING GOALS
Sections I through V of the Housing Element present a housing needs assessment;
an analysis of constraints to housing provision; an inventory of land, financial, and
administrative resources; as well as an evaluation of past housing
accomplishments. This section presents Danville’s eight-year Housing Plan, which
sets forth Housing Goals, Policies, and Programs to address the identified housing
needs and other important housing issues.
In achieving Danville’s Housing Goals, the Town must strike a balance between the
need to provide affordable housing and preservation and enhancement of existing
neighborhoods, maintenance of high development standards, and protection of
environmental resources. Expanded discussion relative each major goal, along
with supporting policies and implementation measures, is provided in the
following sections.
Danville’s housing plan for addressing the identified housing needs is detailed
according to the following seven areas:
    GOAL 1 Increase the supply of housing with a priority on the development of
               affordable housing, including housing affordable to lower income
               households.
    GOAL 2 Improve housing affordability for both renters and homeowners.
    GOAL 3 Increase the supply of appropriate supportive housing for special
               needs populations.
    GOAL 4 Maintain and improve the quality of existing housing stock and
               residential neighborhoods.
    GOAL 5 Mitigate governmental constraints to housing development and
               affordability.
    GOAL 6 Promote equal opportunity for all residents to reside in the housing
               of their choice.
    GOAL 7 Preserve the existing affordable housing stock in Danville.

B.   HOUSING PROGRAMS
The housing programs presented in this Housing Plan define the specific actions
Danville will undertake to implement its stated housing goals and policies. The
programs presented are a mixture of existing programs and new programs.
Some of the programs listed tie back to Contra Costa County-administered
programs. Because Danville is part of the Urban County area and is within the
Contra Costa Consortium area, access to the County-administered programs is
available to Danville residents.
________________________________________________________________________
GOAL 1        INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING WITH A PRIORITY ON
              THE      DEVELOPMENT           OF     AFFORDABLE          HOUSING,
              INCLUDING HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME
              HOUSEHOLDS

Policy 1.1    Develop a comprehensive strategy to facilitate infill residential
              development that provides affordable housing and/or housing
              for special needs populations.
Comments: As Danville approaches a built out condition, infill development
              becomes a more important component for meeting future housing
              needs. Implementation of an effective infill development strategy
              will require the use of a variety of related strategies, including: (i)
              mixed use development; (ii) density bonuses; (iii) intensification of
              underdeveloped lots; (iv) development of second units; and (v)
              rezoning non-residential land for residential use. The objective of
              this policy is to facilitate the development of small infill single
              family and multifamily residential projects that might otherwise
              not occur, with assistance coming in the form of authorizing project
              densities to exceed those otherwise allowed by right under current
              zoning. Authorization of development should be linked to the
              inclusion of an affordable component and/or the accommodation
              of the needs of special housing populations.
Programs:
       1.1.1. By the end of 2016, review the merits of establishing, and approve
              where deemed appropriate, alternatives to density standards (e.g.,
              floor area ratio standards, lot coverage standards and/or other
              design standards) that would serve as a catalyst for the
              development of small infill projects.
       1.1.2. By the end of 2016, review the merits of offering, and approve
              where deemed appropriate, a tiered density bonus program based
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                    122

              on lot size to encourage consolidation of small lots for multifamily
              residential projects.
       1.1.3. By the end of 2016, review the merits of reducing the, and approve
              where deemed appropriate, reduced side and rear yard minimum
              setbacks for smaller multifamily properties to facilitate their
              development.
       1.1.4. Continue toOn an ongoing basis, continue to encourage and
              facilitate the consolidation of smaller multifamily development
              sites through a variety of incentives, including but not limited to:
              financial incentives, land write-downs, assistance with on- or off-
              site infrastructure costs, and other pre-development costs
              associated with the assemblage of multiple parcels.

Time Frame:              Pertinent Financial Resources:
   As indicated            General Fund
Policy 1.2    Promote mixed use development projects that supply housing
              located in close proximity to urban services, shopping and/or
              public transportation.
Comments: Mixed use development combines residential uses with one or
              more other uses, typically office use and/or retail uses. Mixed use
              development can be either “vertical” integration (i.e., mixing uses
              within a single structure) or “horizontal” (i.e., mixing uses on a
              larger site, with each use confined to a separate building or portion
              of the site). The intent of this policy would be to facilitate the
              development of mixed use projects containing housing that might
              otherwise not occur, with assistance coming in the form of
              authorizing underutilized parcels to redevelop at higher densities
              than would be allowed by right under current zoning. Qualifying
              projects would be eligible for relaxed development criteria (e.g.,
              would be allowed to provide less parking in recognition that
              residential uses have a parking demand that is off-peak from the
              parking demand of most commercial uses).
Programs:
       1.2.1. On an ongoing basis, refer commercial project developers to
              successful housing developers when commercial sites are in the
              early stages of review so as to encourage developers to consider a
              mixed use approach inclusive of a residential component.
       1.2.2. On an ongoing basis, provide incentives, such as density bonuses
              and increases in floor area ratios, when proposed mixed use
              development projects include a housing component.

Time Frame:              Pertinent Financial Resources:
   As indicated            General Fund
Policy 1.3    Consistent with the 2002 amendment to California Government
              Code §65852.2 and Danville’s Second Dwelling Unit Ordinance,
              facilitate the development of second units as an affordable
              housing alternative.
Objective:    A second dwelling unit is an attached or detached residential
              dwelling unit that includes permanent provisions for living,
              sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation and which is located on
              the same lot as the corresponding primary residence. It is the
              Town’s objective to increase upon the relatively strong historic
              production rate of second units within existing single family
              neighborhoods. To that end, the Town made another round of
              amendments to the Second Dwelling Unit Ordinance in 2014. In
              areas where the dominant land use is single family residential,
              second units provide an important source of housing, typically
              being housing affordable “by-design” to lower income households.
Programs:
       1.3.1. On an ongoing basis, continue to encourage development of second
              units through application of the Town’s second dwelling unit
              ordinance.
       1.3.2. On an ongoing basis, continue to encourage second units in new
              construction as a development option to meet the requirements of
              the Town’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance.
       1.3.3. By the end of 2016, initiate multi-jurisdictional discussions (using
              the Tri-Valley Affordable Housing Committee or an equivalent
              forum) with a goal of presenting a coordinated, multi-jurisdictional
              voice to pertinent utility agencies seeking reduction of capital
              facility and/or connection fees assessed on new second units.
       1.3.4. By the end of 2015, update and make general distribution (posting
              on the Town’s website) of the Town’s "How-to" brochure for
              development of second units, with updates to include “value
              engineering” suggestions to assist potential applicants as to ways to
              minimize development costs associated with construction
              regulations, impact fees, and capital facility and/or connection fees.
       1.3.5. Review and, if appropriate, amendBy the end of 2017 review, and
              approve where deemed appropriate, amendments to the
              regulations set forth in the Town’s Second Dwelling Unit

              Ordinance (amended in 2014) relative their effectiveness in meeting
              the intent of Policy 1.3 and the purpose of the Ordinance.
       1.3.6. On a unit-by-unit basis, strive to legalize illegal second units if
              these units meet the requirements specified in the zoning
              regulations and are modified to address deficiencies identified
              through a life/safety inspection performed by the Town Building
              Division.
       1.3.7. With a minimum frequency of once every three years, survey
              second dwelling unit rents to see which income groups they are
              serving.

              Housing Opportunity Center (TVHOC) in Livermore, operating as
              a non-profit organization with initial financial support from HUD
              and the five member cities. The TVHOC offers classes on how to
              find, qualify for, and buy a home as well as credit counseling and
              financial preparation. Participants can also obtain information
              about local (Town/City/County) and lender programs, including
              down payment assistance programs, first-time homebuyer

              developers in identifying land suitable for residential
              development.
Comments: As part of the 2014-2022 Housing Element update, an analysis of the
              residential development potential in Danville was conducted. (Refer
              to Tables 32, 33 and 34 and Figure A) Based on that assessment,
              Danville can potentially accommodate between 875-1,075800 to 1,000
              new units on vacant or underutilized properties during the current
              planning period. Sharing this information with potential developers
              will facilitate the development of new housing.
Programs:
       1.5.1. Annually update the residential development site inventory of the
              housing element (i.e., Tables 32, 33 and 34 and Figure A) to facilitate
              the dissemination of the amount, type, location and size of vacant
              and underutilized land suitable for residential development.

Comments: The Town partnered with Bridge Housing, Inc. to develop of a 74-
              unit rental project in the Downtown area. Subsidies required to
              make the project affordable to extremely low and very low income
              senior households required Danville’s Community Development
              Agency to pre-assign the majority of future housing set-aside funds
              to the payoff of bonds issued for the project. Similar, smaller
              subsidized housing projects may be possible for other sites in the
              Downtown area and/or its periphery.
Programs:
       1.6.1. SupportOn an ongoing basis, support affordable housing
              development by fee waiver or reduction; through direct financial
              assistance; and/or by way of zoning incentives (e.g., density
              bonuses, relaxation of parking requirements, etc.).

               2007-2014 RHNA identified in the 2007-2014 Housing Element.
Comments: Analysis done in conjunction with the preparation of the 2007-2014
               Housing Element identified a RHNA “shortfall”. The shortfall was
               established to be a need to designate an additional 8.75 acres of land
               to a multifamily land use designation with a 25 unit per acre
               minimum development density (to accommodate 187 extremely low
               and very low income units from the 2007-2014 RHNA) and to
               designate an additional 1.7 acres to a multifamily land use
               designation with a 20 unit per acre minimum development density
               (to accommodate 34 low income units from the 2007-2014 RHNA). In
               response to the RHNA shortfall, the Town, by way of the adoption of
               the 2030 General Plan, designated 8.75 acres to a newly established
               Residential – Multifamily – High (25-30 units/acre) land use
               designation and designated an additional 2.0 acres to the Residential
               – Multifamily – High/Medium (20-25 units per acre) land use
               designation. The 2030 Plan also served to recalibrate multifamily
               residential density ranges to accommodate the requisite minimum
               development densities to serve the extremely low, very low, and
               moderate income components of Danville’s 2007-2014 RHNA. Both
               properties securing new multifamily residential land use
               designations were subsequently rezoned by a Town-initiated
               rezoning action to establish the right to develop at the cited densities
               as an at-right land use.

Comments: Several of the remaining vacant or underutilized multifamily
              residential parcels in Danville are less than one acre in size. (Refer
              to Table 33) Their relatively small size may serve as a barrier from
              their being redeveloped with multifamily uses or, as applicable,
              denser multifamily uses than current present. A zoning text
              amendment review should be initiated to allow application of a
              zoning overlay that applies floor area ratio, building coverage and
              building height standards for these smaller multifamily properties
              to facilitate their redevelopment with newer, denser multifamily
              residential uses.

               identification of possible sites where residential densification
               might have merit.
Comments: The current RHNA indicates the need for Danville to accommodate
               the development of 583 new housing units during the 2014-2022
               planning period. With the provision of these units, Danville will
               have moved yet closer to a built out condition. While it is not
               possible to estimate Danville’s RHNA for the housing element
               planning period that follows the 2014-2022 planning period, it is
               likely that Danville may need to identify sites for residential
               densification for that subsequent planning period. To be in a
               position to have those sites available early in that Housing Element
               planning period, related studies should commence during the later
               stages of the current Housing Element planning period.

Policy 2.1     Support the development of additional affordable housing
               through regulatory incentives such as the Density Bonus
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                     129

              Ordinance or flexible development standards through planned
              unit development.
Comments: Consistent with Government Code §65915 and Danville’s Density
              Bonus Ordinance, Danville provides density bonuses and
              additional housing incentives to qualified new housing projects.
              The obligation to provide a density bonus is triggered when a
              residential development sets aside units for one or more of the
              following: (i) at least 5 percent of the total units as units affordable
              to very low income households; (ii) at least 10 percent of the total
              units as units affordable to low-income households; (iii) at least 10
              percent unit ownership in a planned development for moderate
              income households; or (iv) 100 percent of the units for occupancy
              by senior citizens. Development concessions or incentives may
              include, but are not limited to: (i) a reduction in site development
              standards; (ii) a modification of zoning code requirements (e.g., a
              reduction in setbacks); (iii) approval of mixed use zoning (under
              specified conditions); or (iv) other regulatory incentives or
              concessions proposed by the developer or the Town which result in
              identifiable cost reductions. A project that receives a density bonus
              and concession or incentive must retain affordability of the units
              for at least 30 years.
Programs:

Policy 2.2    Promote energy conserving practices in the location, construction,
              renovation, and maintenance of housing in Danville.
Comments: Conservation of energy remains an important issue in housing
              policy because of historic and projected rises in energy costs. The
              residential sector offers an opportunity to achieve energy savings
              through conservation measures, awareness and the application of
              appropriate technology. Energy consumption can be reduced by
              assuring new residential development is compact in design; is
              located near jobs, services, and public transportation; takes into
              consideration solar orientation; and/or complies with State energy
              conservation.      Conserving energy reduces the percentage of
              household income devoted to housing related costs through utility
              bill savings.

Comments: Under theThe Town’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, was
              reviewed and updated in 2014. Through the regulations contained
              in the Ordinance, the Town requires between 10 and 15 percent of
              housing in new developments be provided as low or moderate
              income housing. Pursuant to the inclusionary regulations, this
              housing is to be provided with appropriate deed restrictions to
              assure long term affordability of the below market rate units is
              maintained. While the ordinance provides an opportunity to use
              an "in lieu" fee, the Town will continue to use its discretion to push
              for development of affordable housing within each new qualifying
              project.

Programs:
       2.3.1. Continue to require new developments to provide the requisite
               minimum percentage of low or moderate income housing in their
               project through imposition of the regulations contained in the Town’s
               Inclusionary Housing Ordinance.
       2.3.2. Review and, if appropriate, amendBy the end of 2017 review, and
               approve where deemed appropriate, amendments to the
               regulations set forth in the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance
               (amended in 2014) to determine their effectiveness to assure they
               continue to meet the intent of Policy 2.3 and of the stated purpose of
               the Ordinance.
       2.3.3. Monitor litigation responding to Palmer/Sixth Street Properties L.P. v.
               City of Los Angeles ("Palmer"), the case considered recently California
               Court of Appeal that limits the allowable scope of local inclusionary
               requirements, and review current regulations in light of subsequent
               litigation to determine if further amendment to Danville’s
               Inclusionary Housing Ordinance is warranted.

Policy 2.4     Continue to facilitate the development of home occupations to
               enhance neighborhood safety, to contribute to the sense of
               community, to support local retail businesses, and to lessen the
               burden of housing costs.
Comments: Working at home is linked to the affordability of housing because a
              home-based business may reduce the need to rent business space
              elsewhere and thereby can lessen a household’s overall financial
              burden by leveraging housing expenses. Home businesses can also
              save considerable time and expense associated with commuting and
              allows residents who must be at home a means to supplement their
              income. The changes the Town has made since the initial adoption
              of the regulations (including updates made in 2014) have
              consistently liberalized the range of businesses that may be
              considered for operation out of the home and the operational
              restrictions for home occupations (e.g., loosening of restrictions
              regarding presence of non-occupant employees and allowed daily
              client visits).

               Housing Element and to make the requisite annual reports of
               housing efforts to HCD.
Comments: Providing a forum for regular, ongoing review of progress made to
               implement adopted housing goals, policies and implementation
               measures will help assure the Town stays on point to develop and

               Element in a timely and thorough manner.
Programs:

               Town Council to review progress made to further the goals,
               policies and implementation measures of the 2014-2022 Housing

Policy 2.6     Continue to explore opportunities to utilize the resources of the
               Successor Agency
Comments: With the elimination of redevelopment agencies throughout the state,
               the Town agreed to take on the task of serving as the Successor
               Housing Agency to the former Community Development Agency
               (CDA) of the Town. While the former CDA had actively facilitated
Public Hearing Draft – Town Council Meeting of April 7, 2015                    133

              the provision of affordable housing in the downtown project area
              through the use the CDA’s 20% housing set aside funds, the
              resources of the Successor Housing Agency are considerably more
              limited and the legal powers/obligations of the Successor Housing
              Agency are not clearly defined at this time. The Successor Housing
              Agency does have assets, including two small parcels of land, which
              could potentially be sold or used to support the provision of
              affordable housing.
Programs:
       2.6.1. Explore opportunities for the Successor Housing Agency to leverage
              its remaining assets towards provision of affordable housing units in
              the community.

Policy 2.7    Assure that all affordable housing development receiving
              governmental sector and/or private sector subsidizes contain
              mechanisms providing for long term affordability.
Comments: Once affordable housing is developed, it is important to determine
              ways to assure that the housing continues to be affordable for as long
              as feasible. This is especially true of housing projects benefiting from
              governmental and/or private sector subsidies since the typical
              magnitude of the required subsidy that is provided to make units
              available to lower income households is so large that it would be an
              irresponsible expenditure of funding if a long term of affordability
              was not built into the project’s affordability program.
Programs:
       2.7.1. Maintain affordability for intended period of time through well
              written contracts and/or deed restrictions and ongoing monitoring
              for compliance.
       2.7.2. Monitor the affordability of units developed through the Town’s
              inclusionary housing program to assure that rents paid and incomes
              of occupants are consistent with applicable guidelines and/or
              recorded affordable housing agreements.

Policy 2.9    Research the opportunities and merit of supporting shared

              appropriate      County      agencies     and/or    community-based
              organizations.
Comments: Contra Costa County has established programs to encourage and
              support the provision of shared housing. Under a shared housing
              program, a person who has a home to share is matched with a
              person, or persons, in search of a home to share. Typically, providers
              are senior residents with living space to share while home seekers are
              typically lower income adults in need of an inexpensive place to stay.
              To support such a program, Danville could make contributions to
              County agencies already providing the service and/or could support
              community-based organizations to support programs that would
              help residents find affordable housing opportunities, including
              shared housing and roommate referrals.
Programs:
       2.9.1. By the end of 2015, research the opportunities and merits of
              supporting shared housing opportunities in Danville through Town-
              contribution to appropriate County agencies and/or community-
              based organizations.

GOAL 3        INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF APPROPRIATE SUPPORTIVE
               HOUSING FOR SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATIONS
________________________________________________________________________
Policy 3.1    Continue efforts to identify and meet the housing needs for
              special needs populations.
Comments: In addition to the development of affordable housing in general,
              Danville should work to identify and address the housing needs of
              special needs households and individuals in Danville, including the
              mentally and physically disabled persons, seniors, large family
              households, persons with developmental disabilities, etc.
Programs:
       3.1.1. Allow techniques such as use of smaller unit sizes, parking
              standard reductions and common dining facilities and fewer
              amenities for senior projects and other special needs groups as
              deemed appropriate to increase affordability.
       3.1.2. Facilitate the development and operation of proposed small family
              residential care facilities (6 or fewer beds) and large family
              residential care facilities (7-12 beds) serving special needs
              households and individuals, with special emphasis on meeting the
              housing needs of Danville residents with developmental
              disabilities.
       3.1.3. As merit is determined,Where deemed appropriate and on an
              ongoing basis, support the development of housing for special
              needs populations through direct financial assistance, zoning
              incentives (e.g., density bonuses) and/or land write-downs (e.g.,
              fee waiver or reduction), with a priority given to the housing needs
              of extremely low income households.
       3.1.4. Monitor and, if appropriate, amendBy the end of 2017 review, and
              approve where deemed appropriate, amendments to existing land
              use controls, building codes, and permit and processing procedures
              relative their potential to constrain development, maintenance, and
              improvement of housing for persons with disabilities.
       3.1.5. Monitor and, if appropriate, amendBy the end of 2017 review, and
              approve where deemed appropriate, amendments to the
              Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance (adopted in 2014) relative
              its effectiveness to provide relief to Code regulations and
              permitting procedures that may have a discriminatory effect on
              housing for individuals with disabilities, with the monitoring to
              include a review of the procedures for requesting accommodation,
              the timeline for processing requests and appeals, and the criteria

              used for determining whether a requested accommodation is
              reasonable.
       3.1.6. Enforce Universal Design requirements issued by the California
              Department of Housing and Community Development.
       3.1.7. Encourage (through incentives such as parking reductions, etc.) the
              development of senior housing that offers a wide range of housing
              choices, for both affordable and market-rate, from independent
              living to assisted living with services on site, including healthcare,
              nutrition, transportation and other appropriate services.
       3.1.8. Monitor the need for farmworker housing in Danville and, if and
              when such need is documented to be present and where it is
              determined Danville is required to take action in light of the intent
              and requirements of California Health & Safety Code 17021.6,
              initiate a zoning text amendment to amend the existing A-2 and/or
              A-4 zoning regulations to allow farmworker employee housing as a
              use by right as set forth by the minimum requirements of 17021.6.

Policy 3.2     Strive to ensure that homeless individuals and families can obtain
               decent, suitable and affordable shelter.
Comments: Emergency shelters provide housing, with minimal supportive
              services, for homeless persons. Occupancy in emergency shelters is
              limited to six months or less, with such occupancy not to be denied
              because of an inability to pay. While there are not any homeless
              shelters within the San Ramon Valley, there are various facilities in
              Contra Costa County operating as a result of funding made
              available to the Urban County. As a member-jurisdiction of the
              Urban County, these facilities are available to qualifying
              households and individuals from Danville. In recognition of Senate
              Bill 2, the Town’s zoning regulations were amended in 2014 to
              make emergency shelters a permitted use upon issuance of a
              ministerial permit for properties with DBD Area 3 zoning.
              Elsewhere in the Town, emergency shelters currently may be
              considered only upon issuance of a land use permit.

Comments: California Health and Safety Code §50675.2 defines supportive
              housing as housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied
              by the target population, and that is linked to onsite or offsite
              services that assists the supportive housing resident in retaining the
              housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or
              her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community. To
              facilitate and encourage the provision of an adequate amount of
              supportive housing in Danville, the Municipal Code was amended
              in 2014 to define supportive housing and to identify zoning

Policy 3.4    Consistent with the intent and requirements of SB 2, facilitate

Comments: Transitional housing means buildings configured as rental housing
              developments, but operated under program requirements that
              require the termination of assistance and recirculating of the
              assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at a
              predetermined future point in time that shall be no less than six
              months from the beginning of the assistance. To facilitate and
              encourage the provision of an adequate amount of transitional
              housing in Danville, the Municipal Code was amended in 2014 to

              including family, senior and disabled households.
Comments: The Contra Costa County Housing Authority administers the
              Housing Choice Voucher and Shelter Care Plus programs,
              providing housing and rental assistance to lower income
              individuals and families. The Authority actively seeks to reduce
              the historic geographic isolation of lower income households and
              has established payment standards applicable to the Danville area,
              thereby promoting tenant mobility and addressing a goal of de-
              concentration of tenant-based assistance in some of the County’s
              historically concentrated lower income areas. The relatively high
              rental costs for housing in Danville can serve as a barrier for use of
              this program, but the program criteria may allow some number of
              existing or future rental units in Town to qualify. Educating
              property owners of rental properties about the program may lead
              to higher utilization of the program in Danville.

Comments: The Neighborhood Preservation Program provides loans both to
              low income households (potentially as no-interest, deferred
              payment loans) and to moderate income households (potentially as

              of their homes, with a minimum ownership of six months required.
              The loans are to correct health and safety problems and improving
              livability. The program is administered by the County through the

Comments: The Town engages in an ongoing process of review of its
              regulations for the environmental and development review and
              permitting process for consistency with State laws to ensure that
              Danville’s requirements do not act as a constraint to new

Policy 5.2    Continue to encourage use of the Planned Unit Development (P-
              1) process to allow more creative and flexible design for
              residential developments.
Comments: The use of the Planned Unit Development (P-1) process leads to the
              development of more creatively and flexibly designed residential
              projects than      under conventional zoning regulations.        The
              flexibility allowed often leads to variation in otherwise applicable
              development standards and enables the development plan to better
              respond to specific needs or environmental constraints that are
              present at the development site. The P-1 regulations also allow
              more flexibility to mix different structure type or different housing
              product within the same project. The Town eliminated the five-
              acre minimum parcel size restriction for P-1 projects in the mid
              1990s, making the process available for use by most new projects.
Programs:
       5.2.1. Encourage utilization of the Planned Unit Development (P-1) to
              allow use of, where deemed appropriate and warranted on a
              project-specific/location-specific basis, reduced street widths,
              reduced number and/or size of sidewalks, and/or use of utility or

Comments: Planning, Building and Engineering fees, combined with costs for
              required site improvements imposed through the development
              review process, add to the end-cost of housing. While Danville’s
              processing fees are comparable to fees levied by other Contra Costa
              County jurisdictions and Alameda County Tri-Valley Region
              jurisdictions, fee deferrals, reductions, or waivers provided to
              affordable housing projects would assist the development of such
              projects.

              the merits of providing new or modified review, and approve

              status, or any other arbitrary factor. The County allocates CDBG
              funds to local non-profit organizations for fair housing counseling
              and legal services. Services offered typically include advocacy and
              collaboration in support of fair housing for all; public outreach and
              education regarding fair housing rights; specialized property
              owner, management, and lender training; rental home seeking and
              relocation services; and discrimination complaint processing and
              investigation. The Contra Costa Consortium (which Danville is a
              participant) has adopted the HUD-mandated Analysis of
              Impediments (AI) to Fair Housing Choice. The AI includes: a
              comprehensive review of the County’s laws, regulations, and
              administrative policies; an assessment of how those laws affect the
              location, availability, and accessibility of housing; and an

Policy 7.1    Preserve existing affordable housing developments at risk of
              converting to market rate housing.
Comments: As of start of 2014, there were a total of 74 housing units in Danville
              that utilized public funding to develop. All 74 are located in the
              Bridge Housing/Town of Danville senior housing apartment
              project. Because they are in a project owned by a non-profit
              affordable housing developer, they are not at risk of conversion.
Programs:
       7.1.1. Continue to work with the sellers of the below market rate units
              established through the inclusionary housing program to reset the

              projects in Danville that may be at-risk to convert to
              condominiums, those projects represent an important source of
              affordable housing for lower income households. The Ordinance
              requires a discretionary permit be secured for conversion, and
