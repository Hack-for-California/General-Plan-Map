B. HISTORY OF THE ALBANY WATERFRONT
At the start of the 19th century, the Albany                          Following a very brief opening season in 1941, the
waterfront consisted of a large salt marsh, fed by                    track was converted to military use during World

development also was explored. In 1969, the City
adopted the “Albany Isles” plan for the waterfront,
calling for a marina, a 350-room hotel, and a
restaurant and shopping complex on several artificial
islands. The engineering and fiscal feasibility of the
plan were called into question and there were
objections from State agencies. Subsequent plans
were developed in the 1970s, including the 1977
“Environ” Plan which called for a 490-berth marina,
restaurants, a motel, a boat ramp, and a fishing pier.
The City was unable to secure financing for the
Environ Plan and it too did not move forward.
Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corporation continued to
control a large portion of the waterfront, including
Golden Gate Fields and about 40 acres of dry land
immediately to the north. In 1985, Santa Fe filed
plans for housing and commercial development on
its Albany landholdings. An Environmental Impact
Report was completed in 1986, but the application
was denied based on incomplete information.
Several amended EIRs were prepared in the years
that followed, and a variety of alternatives to the
project were proposed and evaluated.
Opposition to the project grew more intense, with           Measure C

 Restoring Albany Beach
 Albany Beach and the southern shoreline of the Albany Neck are currently the focus of an extensive
 improvement effort known as the Albany Beach Restoration and Public Access Project. The project is
 being led by the East Bay Regional Park District.
 At Albany Beach, the project includes clean-up of creosote-treated wood and other debris,
 construction of a parking lot, water access, picnic facilities, trash receptacles, a new restroom,
 informational signs, wetland restoration, and dune enhancement and expansion. The new parking
 lot will include bicycle racks and a staging area for non-motorized watercraft. Trail access also is
 planned, including an accessible ramp. The dunes and seasonal wetlands in this area will be planted
 with native species, and many of the hazardous non-native species will be pruned or removed.
 To the south of Albany Beach, a new 4,200-foot segment of the Bay Trail is planned, linking
 Buchanan Street to Gilman Street. The southern portion of the trail will follow the existing Golden
 Gate Fields access road. Further north, the trail will be constructed along Fleming Point west of the
 racetrack parking lot. Retaining walls and slope stabilization are proposed, in addition to drainage
 improvements, fencing, signs and pavement striping.
 The project also includes reconstruction of the shoreline along the south side of the Albany Neck.
 This will improve habitat value, prevent erosion, and increase resilience against rising sea level. Some
 of the concrete and metal rubble in this area will be removed, and the shoreline will be re-contoured
 to create intertidal and submerged habitat. Native grasses and shrubs will be planted on the upland
 slopes nearby.
 The existing Spur Trail along the Neck is being resurfaced as part of this process, with stormwater
 drainage improvements added. The project also includes removal of non-native invasive species in
 key areas, fencing to limit access to sensitive areas, and grading and rock revetments to stabilize the
 shoreline and prepare for rising sea levels. Rock clusters, artificial reefs, roosting islands, and small
 pocket beaches may be used to enhance habitat in this area.

Substantial portions of the shoreline consist of
sensitive tidal mudflats and salt marshes. Actions
to improve water quality and protect special status
species in these areas may be taken in the future.
Public access in such areas, which include the
northern shoreline of the Albany Plateau and
Neck, will continue to be limited. Interpretive
signs and exhibits along nearby trails can enhance
the visitor experience and increase the public’s
awareness of its wildlife value.
Responding to Sea Level Rise and
Other Hazards
Over the next century, the Albany waterfront will
be impacted by the effects of climate change,
particularly rising sea levels. As noted in the
Environmental Hazards Element, sea levels are
rising in response to thermal expansion of the
oceans and the melting of land ice in the polar
regions. This could lead to increased inundation,
flooding, erosion, wave heights, and groundwater
salinity along the shoreline.             The Bay

facilities throughout the park, including buildings,
signage and landscaping. The intent is not to
design all facilities to look the same, but rather to
ensure they share enough similarity in style and
materials to have a perceivable association with
one another.
Action W-1.E: Public Art Installations
Explore the feasibility of a formal program of
waterfront public art consistent with the Albany
Public Arts Master Plan, the mission of State
Parks, and the goals for the Eastshore State Park
project. Such a program would include guidelines
for art that is not formally authorized, such as the
installations and structures on the Albany Bulb.
The mission of a formal arts program would be to: (a)
provide a forum for exploring the relationship between arts
and the natural environment; (b) promote understanding of
the environmental, historical, cultural, and sociological
context of the park through art; (c) foster expressions of art
which reflect the unique setting of the Albany waterfront;
and (d) foster work that reflects the ethnic and cultural
diversity of the Bay Area. Prior to launching a formal art
program, the shoreline’s artistic values should be identified
and documented. The public should be engaged in
discussions about how best to preserve, rehabilitate and
further invest in those values.
                                                                      View east to Gateview Towers from the Albany Bulb
See the Community Services and Facilities Element for
additional policies on public art.
Action W-1.F: Removal of Safety Hazards
Work with appropriate regional and state agencies
to reduce safety hazards associated with
construction debris (rubble piles, protruding rebar,
glass, etc.) on the surface of the Neck and Bulb
areas.       Clean-up programs should minimize
disturbance of wildlife habitat and avoid wholesale
removal of vegetation.

IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS
Action W-5.A: Shoreline Improvement
Projects
Support EBRPD in the implementation of future
shoreline restoration and improvement projects.
The most recent project included stabilization of 1,800 feet
of shoreline, replacing concrete rubble and debris with a
stabilized rock toe and rock shoreline revetment. It is
intended to prevent erosion, protect water quality, and
enhance habitat. It also included upper slope landscaping
and repair of trails from Buchanan Street to the Bulb.
Off-shore habitat enhancement also may be considered.
                                                                                                                                      Photo: Doug Donaldson

Action W-6.B: General Plan and Zoning Map
Amendment
Develop a strategy for changing the General Plan
designation of publically-owned properties on the
waterfront from “Commercial Recreation” to
“Parks and Open Space,” and changing the
corresponding          zoning       designation        from
“Waterfront” to “Public Facilities” or a new
“Open Space” zone, taking into consideration the
requirements of Measure C.
The 1992 General Plan designated 137 acres along the
Albany waterfront as “Commercial Recreation.” Since
that time, about 30 acres of this area, including the Albany
Plateau and area around the west end of Buchanan Street,
has been acquired by the East Bay Regional Park District.
This area should be re-designated as “Parks and Open
Space.” However, this change could require a citywide vote
under Measure C, which could have a substantial fiscal
impact. Options for making this amendment should be
evaluated.

 Chapter 3: LAND USE ELEMENT                              Albany 2035 General Plan
Residential Categories
Low Density Residential
This designation is intended for areas where the
prevailing land use consists of detached single family
homes with front, side, and rear yards. The maximum
density is 17 units per net acre (approximately one unit
per 2,500 square feet of land area). This density limit
recognizes that about 35 percent of Albany’s existing
single family lots are between 2,500 square feet and
3,750 square feet. However, any lots to be created in
the future in Low Density Residential areas are subject
to a minimum lot size standard of 3,750 square feet.
Secondary units are permitted in all Low Density
Residential areas, subject to appropriate standards and
review procedures.
Medium Density Residential
This designation is intended for areas characterized by
a mix of single family detached homes and small
multi-unit buildings, as well as attached housing types
such as townhomes and duplexes. These areas have
many of the characteristics of lower density
neighborhoods, such as yards and driveways, but have
a more diverse mix of housing unit types than low-
density areas. The maximum density is 35 units per
net acre (approximately one unit per 1,250 square feet
of land area). New development in areas with this
designation is subject to a minimum density
requirement of 20 units per acre. Secondary units are
permitted in all Medium Density Residential areas,
subject to appropriate standards and review
procedures.
High Density Residential
This designation is intended for areas characterized by
multi-family housing. Although single family homes
and duplexes may be present, the prevailing housing
type consists of apartments, condominiums,
townhomes, and similar higher density housing types.
The maximum density is 87 units per net acre
(approximately one unit per 500 square feet of land
area). However, development at the top end of this
range is only permitted at Gateview Towers, where it
reflects the density of existing development. The
maximum elsewhere is 63 units per acre.

                           New development in areas with this designation shall
                           be subject to a minimum density requirement of 20
                           units per acre. Secondary units are permitted in all
                           High Density Residential areas, subject to appropriate
                           standards and review procedures.
                           Hillside Residential
                           This designation is intended to apply to sloped land on
                           Albany Hill. Special development standards have been
                           established for this area to conserve natural resources,
                           limit disturbance of unstable terrain, and recognize the
                           visual sensitivity of the hillside setting. The maximum
                           density is 9 units per net acre. However, development
                           at the top end of this range is not permitted on all
                           sites. Two zoning districts apply, including one
                           district on the west side of the hill with a maximum
                           density of 6 units per net acre and one district on the
                           east side of the hill with a maximum density of 9 units
                           per net acre.
                           On any given parcel with this designation, the transfer
                           of density to the least visually and environmentally
                           sensitive part of the site is encouraged in order to
                           minimize hillside disturbance, preserve the ridgeline,
                           and maximize open space preservation. Both single
                           and multi-family housing are permitted in this
                           designation, although use permit requirements apply
                           to multi-family units. Secondary units are permitted in
                           all Hillside Residential areas, subject to appropriate
                           standards and review procedures.
                           Commercial and Mixed Use Categories
                           San Pablo Avenue Mixed Use
                           The designation applies to parcels with frontage along
                           San Pablo Avenue or that are otherwise part of the
                           San Pablo Avenue business district. The General Plan
                           envisions a transformation of this corridor from auto-
                           oriented commercial uses to more attractive,
                           pedestrian-oriented, mixed use development. Retail,
                           office, service, and other commercial uses are
                           accommodated by this designation.

 Chapter 3: LAND USE ELEMENT                                Albany 2035 General Plan
Higher density residential uses are strongly
encouraged, if they are located above or behind
commercial uses facing San Pablo Avenue. Buildings
that are entirely residential may be considered, subject
to conditions specified in the General Plan.
Residential uses are subject to a minimum density
standard of 20 units per acre and a maximum of 63
units per acre.
The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for non-
residential space on any given parcel in San Pablo
Avenue Mixed Use is 0.95. Additional floor space,
up to a total FAR of 2.25, is permitted provided that
the floor space above and beyond the base FAR of
0.95 consists of residential uses. Bonuses to allow
intensities up to FAR 3.0 may be provided through
zoning. A 38-foot height limit applies. Zoning
overlay districts may apply within this area to achieve
particular General Plan objectives, such as reducing
impacts on nearby residential uses and creating
“nodes” at key locations.
Solano Avenue Mixed Use
This designation applies to parcels with frontage
along Solano Avenue or that are otherwise part of the
Solano Avenue business district. The Solano Avenue
corridor has a “Main Street” character, with small,
local-serving shops, offices, restaurants, and services
in a pedestrian-oriented setting. The corridor also
includes civic uses, multi-family housing, and unique
uses such as the Albany Theater.                 Future
development should reinforce this character and
include a similar mix of uses. Higher density
residential uses are encouraged, if they are located
above or behind commercial uses facing Solano
Avenue. Buildings that are entirely residential may be
considered, subject to conditions specified in the
General Plan. Residential uses are subject to a
minimum density standard of 20 units per acre and a
maximum of 63 units per acre.
The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for non-
residential space on any given parcel is 1.25 and the
maximum building height is 35 feet. Additional floor
space, up to a total FAR of 2.0, is permitted provided
that the floor space above and beyond the base FAR
of 1.25 consists of residential uses, and that these
uses are not located on the ground floor facing
Solano Avenue.

Albany 2035 General Plan                  Chapter 3: LAND USE ELEMENT
                           Zoning overlay districts may apply within this area to
                           achieve particular General Plan objectives, such as
                           reducing impacts on nearby residential uses and
                           creating “nodes” at key locations.
                           Commercial Recreation
                           This designation applies to the Golden Gate Fields
                           property. Consistent with voter-approved Measure C
                           (1990), the designation provides for a limited range of
                           water-oriented uses as well as park, open space,
                           conservation, recreation, and commercial recreation
                           activities. Where commercial uses occur, a maximum
                           floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.5 applies. As prescribed by
                           Measure C, uses that are not specifically authorized by
                           the Albany Zoning Ordinance for this area may only
                           be approved through a citywide ballot measure.
                           Commercial Services and Production
                           This designation permits a variety of uses, including
                           retail, production, light manufacturing, distribution,
                           and repair. Live-work uses, artist’s studios, “maker”
                           activities, and similar uses are also permitted. The
                           designation applies to a linear corridor along the
                           Union Pacific Railroad. Its intent is to provide
                           adequate space to meet the needs of larger-scale
                           commercial and creative activities and light industrial
                           uses which are consistent with the character of the city
                           and which present minimal health and safety hazards
                           to Albany residents. Properties with this designation
                           are subject to a maximum allowable FAR of 0.5.
                           Major Activity Node
                           This is an “overlay” designation that is used to identify
                           areas within the San Pablo and Solano Avenue
                           business districts that are appropriate for uses that
                           generate higher volumes of pedestrian activity.
                           Zoning regulations for activity nodes may permit
                           additional building height, or may require or
                           incentivize ground floor uses which create active street
                           life and foot traffic. The nodes areas are also priority
                           areas for future capital investment in transit,
                           streetscape improvements, public art, and other public
                           realm improvements. They are particularly important
                           to defining Albany’s “sense of place.”

includes large institutional uses, such as St. Mary’s
College High School and other religious facilities.
Utility-owned land also may be included in this
category. Residential uses are not permitted in this
designation.       To the extent permitted by law,
properties with this designation are subject to a
maximum allowable FAR of 0.95.
University Village
This designation applies to the University of
California’s Albany landholdings, also known as
University Village or UC Village. University Village
includes a mix of multi-family housing for UC
Berkeley married students and families, as well as
ancillary uses such as athletic fields, common open
space, and community facilities. Other academic and
community-oriented uses such as teaching, research,
offices, and urban agriculture are permitted.
Residential uses are subject to a maximum density of
34 units per net acre. To the extent permitted by law,
non-residential uses, including recreational and
academic buildings, are subject to a maximum
allowable FAR of 0.95. Land uses in areas with this
designation may be governed by master planning
documents prepared by the University.
Parks and Open Space
This designation includes Albany’s parks, including
portions of Albany Hill, the Albany waterfront, linear
parks such as the Ohlone Greenway (including
BART), existing City parks such as Memorial Park and
Ocean View Park, and planned City parks such as
Pierce Street Park. It may also include land within
large private developments that has been set aside as
permanent open space through conservation
easements or other means. In those park areas where
recreational facilities are permitted, structures are
subject to a height limit of 35 feet and a maximum
coverage limit of 25 percent.

                           Creek Conservation Area
                           This is an overlay designation, meaning it applies in
                           addition to one of the categories listed above. It is
                           used to identify areas within 100 feet of the centerline
                           of Codornices Creek along the southern city
                           boundary, Cerrito Creek along the northern city
                           boundary, and Village Creek, which is primarily on the
                           University Village and Golden Gate Fields properties.
                           The intent of the Creek Conservation Area is to
                           ensure that the uses permitted under the “base”
                           designation occur with minimal disruption of riparian
                           vegetation, and minimal adverse effects on flooding
                           and erosion. The City has developed a Watercourse
                           Overlay District to establish standards for achieving
                           these objectives.
                           Undesignated Areas
                           Approximately 66 acres on the General Plan Map are
                           undesignated. These areas correspond to Interstates
                           580 and 80, and the Union Pacific Railroad Corridor.
                           The City has limited jurisdiction over these areas, and
                           they are in active use as state and federally regulated
                           transportation facilities. The City will work with
                           Caltrans, Union Pacific, and other appropriate state
                           and federal regulatory agencies to ensure that the
                           underlying lands are managed in a way that is
                           consistent with this General Plan. The rights of way
                           should be safe, well-maintained, and convey a positive
                           impression of Albany. Opportunities to both improve

D. FOCUS AREAS
In most of Albany, there is a close relationship
between existing land uses and expected future land
uses. However, six areas with the potential for
change have been identified for more focused
consideration. Each of these areas presents
unique planning challenges related to urban
design, environmental protection, transportation,
and community character. The narratives below
should be used in tandem with General Plan
policies to ensure that future changes in use are          Albany’s “PDA”

Solano Avenue Corridor
The Solano Avenue commercial district extends
from Madison Street on the west to the Berkeley
border on the east. Solano Avenue embodies the
ideal qualities of a “village” shopping district,
including distinctive architecture, a comfortable
scale for pedestrians, interesting storefronts, great
restaurants, small local businesses, and iconic
buildings such as the Albany Theater. The street
invites strolling, browsing, and interacting with
friends and neighbors. Solano Avenue provides
fewer development opportunities than San Pablo
Avenue, although there are a number of sites with
the potential for change.

Landscaping and Street Trees
Trees, shrubs, and flowers enhance the city’s
appearance and bring nature into the built
environment. Trees offer shade for pedestrians,
provide privacy and a buffer from noise, improve
mental health, relieve some of the effects of air
pollution, and provide habitat for birds and urban
wildlife. Trees can have positive effects on
stormwater runoff and water quality and can
increase property values. They can also sequester
carbon, and contribute to efforts to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
There are approximately 5,000 publicly owned
trees in the City, located in City parks and along
City streets. The City has developed an urban
forestry program to promote street tree planting
and good tree maintenance practices. Pruning of
street trees is conducted on a three to four year
cycle, with a priority on fast-growing trees or
potential hazards. The City also conducts tree
planting for a fee when requested by homeowners.          Street trees on 800 block of Ramona Avenue

       SYSTEM
Overview
Albany’s transportation network is comprised of:
     a roadway system that includes travel lanes for
      motorized vehicles and bicycles, and sidewalks
      for pedestrians
     a network of off-road paths designed for use
      by bicycles and pedestrians
     railroad and elevated rail transit lines that pass
      through the city but without direct access
      within Albany.

                             Major Arterials
                             Major arterials are designed to carry heavy traffic
                             volumes across town while also providing access to
                             individual properties and cross-streets. They may
                             have medians to control cross traffic. Separate
                             turning lanes are often provided and traffic signals
                             are present at major intersections.
                             The design of major arterials must balance the
                             competing objectives of accessibility and mobility.
                             Driveways into adjacent parcels may be necessary,
                             but must be located away from intersections and
                             limited to essential access points. These roads also
                             typically have pedestrian and bicycle traffic and
                             serve as primary bus routes. Curb parking is
                             generally allowed, but may be prohibited during
                             peak travel times to provide more capacity. Where
                             there are no parking lanes, bulb outs or turnouts for

                             provided.
                             Minor Arterials
                             Minor arterials serve large segments of the City but
                             usually do not involve crosstown circulation. Major
                             intersections are signalized but may not have
                             separate turn lanes. These streets serve motor
                             vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians.
                             Collectors
                             Collectors are designed to channel traffic from local
                             streets into the arterial street system and to handle
                             short trips within neighborhoods. Collectors
                             normally have two lanes and curb parking. They
                             may include traffic signals and turning lanes at major
                             intersections. Collectors serve motor vehicles,
                             bicycles, and pedestrians.
                             Local Streets
                             Local streets carry low traffic volumes at relatively
                             low speeds. They provide access to individual
                             residences, usually via driveways and curb cuts.
                             Most of the streets in Albany are classified as local
                             streets. Average daily traffic volumes are usually
                             below 2,000 vehicles. Sidewalks are provided for
                             pedestrians, while bicycles typically share the road
                             with vehicles.

San Pablo Avenue and Buchanan Street
San Pablo Avenue and Buchanan Streets are
Albany’s busiest streets. Their width, volume, and
design contribute to the perception of these
streets as “dividing” Albany into quadrants.
Planned design changes should change that
perception, to the point where the streets become
a unifying element and a place where the city
comes together.
For over three decades, the City has endeavored
to make San Pablo Avenue a more pedestrian- and
bicycle-friendly street, starting with an Urban
Design Concept Plan in the late 1980s. In 2001, a
Streetscape Plan for the Avenue proposed new
gateways, redesigned sidewalks and crosswalks,
upgraded lighting, street trees, and a plaza at
Marin Avenue. Some of these improvements
were implemented and others were not. Among
the challenges to redesigning the Avenue are its
dual function as a State Highway, its high vehicle
volumes, and the regional nature of much of its
traffic.
A “Complete Streets Plan” for San Pablo Avenue
and Buchanan Street was adopted in 2013. The
Plan carries forward some of the concepts in the
2001 Streetscape Plan, but goes a step further to
redesign the travel lanes, parking lanes, and bus           Buchanan Street bicycle and pedestrian path

                              Class I bike paths consist of completely
                              separate rights of way and are designed for
                              the exclusive use of bicyclists and pedestrians.
                              Vehicle cross flow is minimized. Bike paths
                              provide a safe environment for younger or
                              less experienced cyclists who do not want to
                              ride alongside traffic.
                              Class II
                              Class II bike lanes provide a restricted right of
                              way and are designated for the use of
                              bicyclists with a striped lane on a street or
                              highway. Bicycle lanes are generally five feet
                              wide. Vehicle parking and vehicle/pedestrian
                              cross-flow are permitted. An examples is the
                              Marin Avenue bicycle lane.

                              boulevard is a special type of shared route
                              that has been designed to make it easier to
                              travel by bicycle. Class III routes also may be
                              marked by “sharrows” or pavement markings
                              which indicate that bicycles may use the

Railroad.
While new bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure
can increase the percentage of trips taken using
these modes of travel, additional steps are needed
to fully achieve the city’s active transportation
goals. This includes a robust education program
aimed at residents of all ages, but particularly at
school-aged children.           Local community
organizations such as Albany Strollers and Rollers

shifting to other modes of travel, it is still likely
that most trips in the city will continue to be made
by motorized vehicles. For these trips, the focus
will be on improving transportation efficiency.
Projects such as traffic signal synchronization,
signal interconnects, electronic messaging signs,
and directional signage improvements can
improve vehicle flow and direct traffic more
efficiently.
Managing transportation demand is also an
important part of reducing congestion. Albany
has a Trip Reduction Ordinance to promote
carpooling, vanpooling, bicycling, and walking as
commute         modes,     and    to     encourage
telecommuting and flextime to reduce peak hour
trips.      Establishments with more than 50
employees are required to provide information to
their employees on commute alternatives.
Potential incentives for employees include transit
fare subsidies, preferential parking for carpool
vehicles, BART shuttles, on-site child care
facilities, and guaranteed ride home programs for
persons working late. Incentives for walking or
bicycling to work include bicycle storage facilities,
and workplace showers and changing areas. The
City also supports infrastructure improvements                  Streetscape improvements along Solano Avenue
that make telecommuting more viable, such as
expanded fiber optics cabling and cellular facilities.

Group to evaluate Measure D, and explore the
possibility of a ballot measure to amend current

become more common and affordable.
If a City-sponsored ballot measure or voter
initiative is successful, current parking
requirements would likely be replaced with new
requirements that are more context sensitive, and
which balance other policy objectives such as
housing affordability and greenhouse gas
reduction. At minimum, parking requirements
should be scaled to reflect the number of
bedrooms, the proximity to public transit, and
target occupancy groups. Greater emphasis on
shared parking, spaces for shared cars and
bicycles, and new technologies such as mechanical
stacked parking, may be incorporated.
In commercial areas, there should be a continued
focus on managing the use of existing parking
rather than simply increasing the number of
spaces. In 2014, the City received a grant from
the Alameda County Transportation Commission
to study parking supply, demand, and use patterns
in the city. This is likely to lead to new parking
management recommendations, and potentially to
adjustments in the parking requirements for
different commercial activities.

Space (defined below).
Conservation Open Space. Conservation open
space consists of undeveloped land left in a
relatively natural state. Public access may be
controlled, and recreation is a secondary objective
or may not be compatible due to sensitive habitat.
This type of park includes steep hillsides,
wetlands, and areas with unique or endangered
species. Creekside Park and Albany Hill Park are
examples. The Burrowing Owl Habitat area at the
Albany Plateau is another example. Hiking trails,
interpretive facilities, and picnic areas are among
the types of uses found in such parks, although in
some cases the presence of sensitive habitat may
limit facilities altogether.

Some of these trails are local, others serve multiple
cities, and the Bay Trail is regional. The City’s
goal is to maximize the functionality and usability
of these trails by connecting them to one another
so that they serve as an integrated network.
Connecting the trails can improve access to the
shoreline, schools, shopping areas, and
recreational       facilities    from       Albany’s
neighborhoods, while providing a variety of
recreational experiences.
Future projects include completion of the Bay
Trail and improvement of the spur trail network
within McLaughlin Eastshore State Park. The Bay
Trail is planned to extend from Buchanan Street
southward, following the shoreline west of
Golden Gate Fields over Fleming Point, linking to
existing segments of the trail south of Gilman
Street in Berkeley. Albany’s Active Transportation
Plan also raises the possibility of a new pedestrian
and bicycle bridge between the shoreline and
University Village, spanning Interstate 80 and the
railroad. However, the cost of such a project is
substantial and no funding source or location has
been identified.

The phenomenon of climate change makes the
Conservation and Sustainability Element especially
important in guiding public policy over the next
20 years. Albany adopted a Climate Action Plan
(CAP) in 2010. Much of the emphasis of that
Plan is on reshaping the City’s land use and
transportation systems to reduce dependence on
carbon-emitting fossil fuels. The General Plan
advances CAP strategies by focusing Albany’s
future development along transit corridors and
improving the pedestrian, bicycle, and public
transit systems. Many of the other CAP strategies,
including those relating to buildings and energy,
waste reduction, green infrastructure, water
conservation, and food and agriculture, have been
incorporated into this Element to ensure an
internally consistent and comprehensive climate
action policy.
B. NATURAL FEATURES
Albany is located on a gentle westward-sloping
alluvial plain on the eastern shore of San
Francisco Bay.      The city’s principal natural
features are San Francisco Bay, Albany Hill,
Fleming Point, and several creeks which meander
from the hills west to the Bay. All of these           One of many eco-themed entries in the annual Solano Stroll

Soil surveys from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (2013) indicate that there are four

soils are classified as Urban Land Tierra, with
moderate to high shrink-swell and moderate
corrosivity. East of this area is a band of Urban
Land Clearlake soil. These soils are typically very
deep and poorly drained.
A third mapping unit, Millsholm silt loam, exists
on Albany Hill and in the northwestern part of the
City. These soils are very deep and well drained,
with high shrink-swell potential. The northeastern
part of the city is characterized by Tierra Loam
soils. These soils are potentially productive but
may be moderately corrosive. They also have high
shrink swell potential. Local building codes and
engineering standards account for soil
characteristics, protecting foundations and utilities
from these conditions.

                                     The City also is implementing a number of
                                     educational programs to increase awareness of
                                     litter issues and water quality.
                                     One of the most effective ways to reduce litter
                                     in waterways is by installing full trash capture
                                     devices in storm drain inlets. These devices
                                     prevent litter from entering storm drain pipes
                                     and creeks, and also reduce flooding from
                                     clogged drains. In 2013, Albany installed 17 full

` Major     Air Pollutants of Concern
  Ozone is formed by photochemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen and reactive organic gases.
  It is a pungent, colorless gas that typically peaks in the summer and early fall months. Elevated ozone
  concentrations result in reduced lung function, with particularly acute risks for the elderly, children,
  and those with respiratory conditions.
  Carbon monoxide (CO) is formed by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, with motor vehicles
  accounting for nearly all emissions. It is a colorless, odorless gas that can cause dizziness, fatigue,
  and impairments to the central nervous system. It can be fatal at high levels of exposure.
  Nitrogen dioxide is a reddish-brown gas formed from fuel combustion under high temperature or
  pressure. It is a component of smog and contributes to pollution problems such as poor visibility,
  decreased lung function, and acid rain.
  Sulfur dioxide is a colorless, irritating gas formed primarily from incomplete combustion of fuels
  containing sulfur. It irritates the respiratory tract, and can injure lung tissue when combined with
  fine particulate matter.
  Particulate matter is the term used for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the
  air. Particles up to 10 microns in diameter are referred to as PM10, while fine particles less than 2.5
  microns in diameter are called PM2.5. Particulates can be directly emitted through fuel combustion,
  or they may be formed by blowing soil, smoke, chemical reactions, deteriorating tires, and other
  sources. Particulates can transport carcinogens and other toxic compounds, reduce lung function
  and aggravate respiratory and cardio-vascular diseases.
  Toxic Air Contaminants (TACs) refer to a group of pollutants that are harmful in small quantities,
  such as benzene, formaldehyde, and hydrogen sulfide. Because diesel fuel engines are a potential
  source, new development near freeways may require filtration systems to reduce potential exposure.

these standards may not be exceeded more than once a year and others are defined such that a limited number of exceedances may
occur over a multi-year period.
2 The Bay Area was designated a marginal non-attainment area in June 2004. The threshold was subsequently lowered from 0.80 to
0.75 ppm in 2008.
3 In 2013, the EPA determined that the Bay Area met the 24-hour PM2.5 standard. However, the Bay Area will remain in non-

  Chapter 7: CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY ELEMENT                   Albany 2035 General Plan
This General Plan directs Albany’s future
development to sites where public transit is readily
available, and where services such as shopping,
restaurants, and schools are within a short walk or
bicycle ride. While it is likely that people living
and working in such developments may still own
cars, they are also likely to own fewer cars than
they would in low density subdivisions. Options
such as car-sharing, bicycling, and walking will be
readily available for short trips.
Albany does not have a BART station within its
borders, but is a short bike ride from the El
Cerrito and North Berkeley stations. San Pablo

building codes. Certain types of buildings are
particularly vulnerable to ground shaking due to
their design and construction.        For example,
unreinforced masonry buildings (URMs) may
collapse or be damaged during violent ground
shaking. In 1986, California passed legislation
requiring cities to inventory their URM buildings
and develop a program for their retrofit. There
were approximately 50 URMs identified in Albany
at the time. In 2004, the City adopted an
ordinance requiring the retrofitting of such
buildings within three years. Most buildings are
now compliant and risk levels have been reduced.
Albany also has a substantial inventory of soft-
story buildings. These are apartment buildings
typically constructed in the 1950s and 1960s with
“tuck under” parking on the ground level, and one
or two stories of housing above. The design of
such structures, with large openings and few
internal walls on the ground floor, and slender
columns supporting the weight of the upper
floors, can result in inadequate lateral support
during an earthquake. Installation of shear walls
and bracing can improve the stability of such
structures.
                                                         Installation of shear walls on a hillside home can help

  Alameda County Environmental Health and the Unified Program
  Many of the hazardous materials requirements in California have been bundled into what is
  known as the “Unified Program.” The Program ensures consistency throughout the state with
  regard to administration, permitting, inspection, and enforcement. There are 83 local
  government agencies known as Certified Unified Program Agencies (CUPA) in the state; the
  CUPA for Albany is the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health (ACDEH). ACDEH
  administers the following programs in Albany:
     Hazardous Materials Business Plans. This program requires any facility that uses, handles,
      or stores aggregate quantities of any hazardous materials equal to or greater than 55
      gallons of liquid, 500 pounds of solid, and/or 200 feet of compressed gas to report their
      chemical inventories and prepare a Hazardous Materials Business Plan.
     Accidental Release Prevention Program. Facilities that handle more than a threshold
      quantity of regulated substances must prepare a risk management plan, including
      measures to reduce the potential for an accidental release.
     Underground Storage Tank Program. This program issues five-year permits for the
      operation of underground tanks storing such substances as gasoline. Tanks must be
      monitored for leaks and designed to contain leaks in the event they occur.
     Above Ground Storage Tank Program. This requires spill prevention and control plans for
      above ground storage of petroleum products in quantities exceeding certain thresholds.
     Hazardous Waste Generator Program. Facilities that generate hazardous waste must
      register and submit electronic surveys to verify compliance with basic regulations.
     Hazardous Waste Tiered Permitting Program. This regulates the quantity of hazardous
      waste that may treated on-site. Requirements vary depending on the type of waste.

 The Measurement of Noise
 Measuring noise takes three factors into consideration: (1) the magnitude of the sound; (2) the
 frequency of the sound; and (3) the variation in sound level over time. Noise levels are usually
 expressed with an indication of the length of the measurement period. For longer periods, the
 measurement reflects the average level over the period, accounting for the variations in noise that
 occur over time. A single measure called the “equivalent sound level” or L eq is used to describe
 average noise over a specified time period.
 Sound is typically measured using decibels (dB). A measurement of 10 dB would be considered
 the lowest threshold of hearing, while 120 dB is extremely loud. Decibels are expressed on a
 logarithmic scale. In other words, a reading of 50 dB is 10 times louder than 40 dB and 100 times
 louder than 30 dB. Noise measurements are taken on a scale (expressed as “dBA”) that filters out
 very low and very high frequencies.
 Noise measurements also consider the greater sensitivity of people to noise at night. The term
 “Community Noise Equivalent Level” or CNEL describes the average noise over a 24-hour period,
 with a penalty of 5 dB added to sound levels between 7 PM and 10 PM, and a penalty of 10 dB
 added to sound levels between 10 PM and 7 AM. The term Ldn (day-night level) is similar, but
 excludes the 7 PM to 10 PM adjustment.
 The term “ambient noise” describes the composite noise from all sources at a given location. The
 US Environmental Protection Agency suggests that ideally, outdoor ambient noise levels be no
 greater than 55 dB Ldn in residential areas. The US Department of Housing and Urban
 Development has a minimum outdoor noise standard of 65 dB Ldn for residential uses. Where
 housing is located in areas with ambient noise that exceeds this level, special insulating measures
 are usually required to reduce interior noise.

Student Generation Rates
Student generation rates are used to estimate the probable number of students in a “typical” new
single family or multi-family home. This data can be used to estimate the expected impact of new
housing units on school enrollment. The rates are based on actual data on student yields at existing
development or on State of California standards.
Statewide, the student generation factors are 0.7 students per dwelling unit, including 0.5 students
in K-8 and 0.2 students in Grades 9-12. The rates tend to be higher in single family homes than in
multi-family units.
Albany’s student generation rates are slightly lower than the state average, reflecting the relatively
large number of multi-family dwelling units in the city. The 2015 Fee Justification Study reports a
yield of 0.6 students per housing unit, including 0.356 K-5 students, 0.133 students in Grades 6-8,
and 0.111 students in Grades 9-12. Based on address data for students enrolled at AUSD facilities, a
“typical” multi-family unit generally yields between 0.16 and 0.41 students. The distinction between
the multi-family rate and the overall rate (or the single family rate) is important because most future
housing construction in Albany is expected to be multi-family in format. In general, student yields
are lower in multi-family units than in single family homes due to the smaller number of bedrooms.
In the recent past, changes in enrollment have primarily been driven by births, inter-district
transfers, and turnover in the existing housing stock, rather than new housing construction. Non-
resident students accounted for nearly 13 percent of enrollment in 2012-2013, which is down from
nearly 18 percent in 2005-2006. Continued reductions in (or cessation of) inter-district transfers can
help improve long-term capacity.

The 2010 Census reported that 10 percent of
Albany’s population was 65 or older. This figure is
expected to rise substantially in the next decade as
the baby boomer generation reaches retirement
age. Regionally, projections indicate that one-
quarter of the population may be over 65 by 2035.
As the population ages, there will be a greater
demand for facilities and services that meet the
needs of seniors, including those with mobility
impairments and chronic health conditions.
