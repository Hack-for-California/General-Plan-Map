                                     Preface
The Soledad General Plan is a blueprint for the orderly growth and development of
the City for the next twenty to fifty years. The Plan envisions substantial growth for the
City during this timeframe. Complete buildout of the City and its sphere of influence
in accordance with this General Plan would accommodate about 58,000 residents
(not including the State prison population). The Plan provides policies and programs
to manage the location and pace of new development so that it may be
accommodated without financial hardship to the community, and so that the
quality of life enjoyed in Soledad is preserved and enhanced. The primary focus of
the Plan is to foster a climate conducive for expanded economic development in
Soledad, including expanded opportunities for shopping and tourism, the provision
of more and better paying jobs, and affordable housing.
Another important component of the General Plan is the Front Street Improvement
Plan and Downtown Specific Plan. In keeping with the goal of improving business
and attracting tourism, the Front Street Improvement Plan provides a framework for
the revitalization of downtown Soledad as the social and business center of the
community. The goal of the Front Street Improvement Plan is to create an attractive
and inviting place to gather and shop by providing amenities to the downtown such
as street trees and benches and by developing open plazas and walkways that
provide protection from the heat and wind.
The General Plan must accurately reflect the needs and desires of Soledad residents
if the goals and objectives the Plan are ever to be achieved. For this reason, public
participation was a key component of the process of preparing the General Plan.
Continued public input, with four public workshops followed by public hearings
before the Planning Commission and City Council, shaped the Plan to reflect the
community’s shared vision for the future City.
The General Plan must also be founded on a thorough understanding of the
community, its history and environmental setting, and previous actions that have
helped shape the present development pattern. This information has been
assembled in the General Plan Background and Environmental Setting Report which
is published separately as an appendix to the General Plan.

Introductio
                                Soledad General Plan

                          I. Introduction
The City of Soledad
The City of Soledad is located in southern Monterey County about 25 miles south of
the City of Salinas in the heart of the fertile Salinas Valley, an agricultural region of
Statewide and even national importance. To the east is the Gabilan Range and
Pinnacles National Monument. To the west is the Coast Range and the Los Padres
National Forest; beyond lies the rugged Big Sur Coast.
                             Figure I­1: Regional Location
Soledad incorporated as a City in 1921 and derives its name from the Mission Nuestra
Señora de
la Soledad (Soledad meaning "solitude") established by Father Fermin Lasuen in 1791
on land west of the Salinas River.
General Plan Context
Soledad, along with the other small towns of the Salinas Valley (King City, Gonzales,
and Greenfield) has traditionally provided housing and support services for the
surrounding agricultural operations that dominate the regional economy. However,
that traditional role may be changing. According to data published by the
                                           I­1

                                 Soledad General Plan
                                    I. Introduction
California Department of Finance, Soledad ranked eight among the fastest growing
cities in the State in 2003, based on the percentage of population increase from the
previous year. While this may be partially explained by the desirability of Monterey
County when compared with surrounding areas, it may also be the result of
skyrocketing housing costs in the southern San Francisco Bay area prompting
residents to seek more affordable housing in the outlying communities.
Although the additional development has brought much needed housing,
opportunities for hopping and better paying jobs have not yet materialized.
Moreover, the quality of new development and the rapid influx of newcomers have
raised concerns among civic leaders about how to manage the growth of the City
in a manner that preserves the best qualities of the City while providing for the
present and future needs of its residents.
One measure of a General Plan’s effectiveness is whether it continues to provide
meaningful guidance to decision­makers in their efforts to respond to changing
circumstances and opportunities relating to land use planning. The unprecedented
economic growth in central California which began in the mid­1990s could not be
foreseen by the polices of the previous General Plan, which anticipated more
                                           I­2

                                 Soledad General Plan
                                    I. Introduction
modest economic growth similar to preceding years. While the pace of new
development may be partly explained by the “spill over” of demand from high­
technology industries located in the nearby Santa Clara Valley, what is clear is that
current economic conditions offer opportunities that did not exist at the time the
1993 Plan was adopted.
In Soledad, evidence of the growing economy can be seen in the accelerating
pace of residential development that has occurred since 1997, in which an average
of about 200 new dwelling units have been constructed each year. Although new
housing helps satisfy an unmet need, the absence of commensurate growth in the
number of jobs and shopping opportunities has raised concerns that Soledad is fast
becoming a “bedroom” community in which residential development occupies a
disproportionally large percentage of the local economy. Evidence has shown that
stable economies provide a greater degree of balance among residential,
employment­producing and commercial land uses.
By the end of the 1990s, civic leaders concluded that the1993 General Plan was of
limited value in helping the City meet its economic development goals in the wake
of the growing economy. To help address these concerns, the City retained a
consultant team in the spring of 1999 under the direction of Crawford Multari & Clark
to undertake a comprehensive revision of the City’s General Plan.
Scope and Purpose of the General Plan
A General Plan is a requirement of State Law and serves as a community's blueprint
for the use and development of land within its jurisdiction. To provide a consistent
framework to address these issues, State law requires that the general plan contain
seven interrelated sections, or elements:
    Land Use. The Land Use Element describes the various uses to which land within
    the City may be committed, and designates areas where these uses may take
    place. In this sense, the Land Use Element is the most basic of the elements. It
    must be closely coordinated with the other elements to provide consistent policy
    guidance that results in orderly and logical development.
    Housing. The Housing Element describes the manner in which safe, affordable
    housing will be provided to present and future City residents anticipated through
    the time frame of the General Plan. The Housing Element also provides incentives
    for the production and rehabilitation of affordable housing within the City.
    Circulation (transportation).     The Circulation Element describes how the
    transportation needs of the city will be met during the time frame of the General
    Plan. The Circulation Element identifies where new roadways will be constructed
    to support the land uses contained in the Land Use Element, and also contains
    provisions for the use of alternate modes of transportation, including bicycle and
    pedestrian circulation plans, and transit.
    Conservation and Open Space. The Conservation and Open Space Elements
    are two separate elements required by state law but are often combined as one.
                                           I­3

                                Soledad General Plan
                                   I. Introduction
   These elements describe the diverse natural and human­made resources in and
   around Soledad, and how these resources will be preserved and protected
   during the time frame of the General Plan.
   Safety. The Safety Element inventories seismic, geologic, flood, and fire hazards
   in Soledad, and discusses how the effect of these hazards can be minimized.
   Noise.      The Noise Element describes the existing and projected noise
   environments for the City and establishes land use compatibility guidelines for
   various noise levels. On the basis of expected population and traffic growth, the
   Noise Element establishes policies and standards to protect residents from
   exposure to excessive noise.
Other elements may be added as needed to address specific issues. The Soledad
General Plan contains three such elements: Parks and Recreation, Public Services
and Facilities, and Economic Development.
   Parks and Recreation. The Parks and Recreation Element provides policies and
   standards for the development of additional parks and the expansion of
   recreation programs to meet the needs of Soledad residents.
   Public Services and Facilities. This element summarizes the infrastructure and
   public facilities needs of the City through buildout of the General Plan.
   Economic Development. This Element includes a generalized discussion of
   expected costs of operating the future city, and potential revenue sources likely
   to be available to cover those costs. Among other purposes, this element will
   assist the City in determining whether new development should be subject to
   different fees or exactions than are currently in place to better cover the costs of
   growth to the community.
Two other documents, while not part of the General Plan, provide important
guidance with regard to development.
   Downtown Specific Plan/ Front Street Improvement Plan. The Downtown Specific
   Plan/Front Street Improvement Plan (FSIP) provides specific goals, policies and
   programs for the revitalization of the City’s traditional commercial center along
   Front Street. The main goal of the FSIP is to create an attractive and inviting
   place to gather and shop by providing street trees, benches and other
   amenities, and by developing open plazas and walkways that provide
   protection from the heat and wind.
   Community Design Guidelines. Another important component of the City’s
   development regulations is a set of design guidelines for new development. The
   design guidelines are intended to supplement the policy and development
   guidance provided by the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance by describing the
   City’s expectations for the quality and character desired of new development.

                                Soledad General Plan
                                   I. Introduction
Each element of the General Plan contains goals, policies and programs that
provide guidance to decision­makers and the public when questions arise about the
appropriate use of individual parcels of land and other resources. A goal is a
desirable future condition or state towards which the community will work to
achieve. Policies are statements of the community's position regarding a particular
issue that provides guidance for decision­making. A program is an action or series of
actions, procedures or techniques that the City will employ or undertake to
implement the policies contained in the General Plan. The implementation programs
specify the agency, department or other party responsible for carrying out and
monitoring the actions described, the funding source (when one can be identified)
and a time frame for its accomplishment.
Quantified objectives are measurable milestones that can be used to judge the
effectiveness of the implementation of the Plan. For example, the Housing Element
provides quantified objectives for the number of dwelling units the City expects to be
constructed over the next five years.
The General Plan must be a comprehensive, long­term document. The Soledad
General Plan provides a framework for the orderly growth and development of the
City for the next twenty or more years from our vantage of today. The General Plan,
however, will certainly be amended from time to time to keep pace with the
changing needs of the community.
Organization of the General Plan
The Soledad General Plan is composed of six sections:
    Introduction. This section provides an introduction to the General Plan, its scope
    and purpose, and the process through which it was prepared. Public
    participation played a key role in the preparation of the Soledad General Plan.
    The introductory section also discusses prior planning efforts in the area, and the
    relationship between the Soledad General Plan and other relevant plans and
    regulations.
    Community Development. This section consists of the Land Use, Housing,
    Circulation, Parks and Recreation, Public Services and Facilities, and Economic
    Development Elements.
    Natural Resources. The Conservation and Open Space Elements are combined
    in this section.
    Hazards. This section contains the Noise and Safety Elements.
    Implementation. The Implementation section outlines the steps necessary to
    implement the goals, policies and programs of the General Plan. A timeline is
    established through which these various steps should be implemented. The
    Implementation section also contains a list of 5­year and 10­year objectives
    which are measurable outcomes by which the success of the General Plan can
    be assessed.

Appendices. For the policies and programs of the General Plan to provide
effective guidance for future land use decisions in Soledad, they must be
founded on a thorough understanding of the town's setting and historical
development pattern, and of the factors which have shaped the present land
use and population of the town. These issues are discussed in greater detail in the
General Plan Background Report, which has been prepared separately as an
appendix to the General Plan (Appendix A). Other information contained in the
appendix include standards for specific plan preparation, recommended street
sections and standards for bicycle paths.

                                     I. Introduction
The Process of Preparing the
General Plan
A general plan reflects a community's
shared vision for the future. Therefore,
before the Soledad General Plan could
be written, it was essential to understand
the public's ideas about what they
would like Soledad to be. To help with
this process, the City hired a consultant
team with expertise in consensus
building, land use planning, and
community design. To obtain input
directly from residents, the consultants
conducted four public workshops. At
the first workshop participants were
asked to identify potential problems in
Soledad and to describe their vision for Soledad residents helped create the Urban Fabric
                                              Diagram which served as the basis for the updated
the future of the community.             The General Plan.
workshop was well attended and led to the development of a set of "planning
principles" which became the guideposts for the preparation of the Plan. Based on
this input, the consultant team prepared a series of land use alternatives depicting
different visions for the future of the community. These in turn were shared with the
community at a second workshop at which participants were asked to rate the
different alternatives to express a preference. The preferred land use plan served as
the starting point for the preparation of the general plan update.
Further along in the plan preparation process, the City was approached by the
owners of property to the north between the existing City limits and Camphora­
Gloria who expressed interest in being a part of the City’s long­range development
plans. The City’s consultants prepared additional land use alternatives for these
areas which were shared with the public at two additional workshops before the
final preferred land use plan was derived.
The planning consultants and city staff also held discussions with certain “key
informants”, persons with particular expertise and/or knowledge about growth and
development in Soledad. Key informants include property owners, realtors,
representatives of local, County and state governments and planning agencies,
representatives of the school district, and others. Public participation was a
continuous and vital component to the process of preparing the Soledad General
Plan.
General Plan Background Report
The General Plan must be based on a thorough and accurate understanding of the
existing conditions in Soledad if the goals of the Plan are ever to be achieved. To
provide this basic information, a General Plan Background Report was prepared
which covers such diverse topics as the physical characteristics of the City, relating
                                            I­7

                                Soledad General Plan

to both the natural and built environments, social and economic characteristics, the
type and responsibilities of other government agencies and districts, and the nature
of existing government policies, such as those in the previous general plan. The
Background Report provided critical information about the issues to be addressed
by the General Plan, and also provided environmental baseline information for
preparation of the General Plan Environmental Impact Report (EIR) in accordance
with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
Issues and Options Report
The information contained in the Background Report, when considered within the
context of the planning principles derived from public participation, raised a number
of important issues to be resolved by the General Plan. These issues were
summarized in a series of Issues and Options Reports which identified the most critical
land use issues confronting the City and provided a range of possible General Plan
strategies to address them. The Issues and Options Reports were considered by the
Planning Commission and City Council at joint study sessions held in February and
May, 2001. The study sessions were also an opportunity to review previous land use
decisions and reaffirm the direction the City wanted to take with the General Plan.
By the summer of 2004, a final draft General Plan was completed and reviewed by
the Planning Commission, which considered various alternatives for the outward
expansion of the City. Recommendations from the Planning Commission were
forwarded to the City Council, who conducted public hearings before adopting the
Plan.
An Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was prepared in accordance with the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The impacts and mitigation measures
identified in the Final EIR were considered by the City Council before the Plan was
adopted.
Previous Planning Efforts in Soledad
1965 General Plan
The community of Soledad incorporated as a city in1921 and prepared its first
general plan in 1965. The plan provides broad guidance for land use and
development, circulation, recreation and schools, as well as implementation. No
specific timeframe is discussed; however, the plan accommodates a buildout
population of 12,000.
Although fairly simple by today’s standards, several aspects of the 1965 general plan
could be considered visionary. For example, the authors conducted a fairly
extensive survey to gauge community preferences on a variety of topics, including
employment, housing, schools and recreation. The land use plan designates areas
for housing, industrial and commercial development that extend eastward in
concentric bands around the downtown, a theme that would be repeated in
subsequent plans for the City. The Land Use chapter provides an illustration for the
                                          I­8

                              Soledad General Plan
                                 I. Introduction
preferred configuration of residential neighborhoods that incorporates pedestrian
circulation, open space and a variety of housing types.
1981 General Plan
In 1981, the City adopted a comprehensive update to the 1965 general plan. The
revised plan was intended to supplement the Central Salinas Valley General Plan
prepared by Monterey County which addresses regional planning issues, such as
open space, conservation (of agricultural land) and hazards separately from the
plans for individual towns. Thus, the 1981 general plan focuses on land use,
circulation and housing for Soledad, covering a planning area of about 570 acres
and accommodating a population of 10,250 residents by the year 2000.

                                      I. Introduction
1993 General Plan
In the early 1990s, the City prepared a comprehensive revision of the 1981 General
Plan. The 1993 General Plan contains policies and programs covering eight sections
(elements) that include land use; circulation; housing; conservation; open space;
safety; noise; and scenic highways. The Plan identifies a planning area and
expanded sphere of influence covering about 1,300 acres that extends to the east
and north of the existing developed city. The Plan covers a timeframe of twenty
years and accommodates a non­prison buildout population of about 21,332. The
main focus of the plan is to accommodate additional residential and commercial
development, to improve the number and quality of jobs within the City and the
revitalize the downtown – themes that continue today.
Soledad Redevelopment Plan
In 1983 the City adopted a Redevelopment Plan in accordance with Section 33000
et seq. of the California Health and Safety Code. Redevelopment affords broad
powers to the Redevelopment Agency to alleviate “blight” that is affecting the
redevelopment project area. Revenues from tax increments that accrue to the
Agency must be used to alleviate these blighting conditions. In addition, at least
twenty percent of the tax increments must be set aside for the purpose of improving
the supply of affordable housing within the community.
The Soledad Redevelopment Project Area covers a substantial portion of the City,
including all of Front Street and the existing downtown area, extending to the east
and south to include the residential neighborhoods surrounding the downtown and
the Los Coches Industrial Park. The primary goal of the Redevelopment Plan is to
eliminate constraints to the full utilization of land and buildings within the Project Area
and to foster a climate conducive to economic growth and vitality.
The Redevelopment Plan has been amended twice to bring it into conformity with
changes to the Community Redevelopment Law that have occurred since its
adoption. Among the redevelopment projects identified in the Plan are:
q Economic development programs to attract and retain commercial and
    industrial businesses.
q Downtown revitalization programs to address the needs of downtown businesses.
q Improvement of public facilities and infrastructure.
q Housing programs to improve the supply of affordable housing.
Downtown Specific Plan (1981) and the 1995 Downtown Specific Plan and Front Street
Rehabilitation Plan
The Downtown Specific Plan and Front Street Rehabilitation Plan expands upon the
principles contained in the first Downtown Soledad Specific Plan adopted in 1981.
As the name implies, the Plan combines the requirements for a specific plan, as
described in Government Code Section 65450, with a rehabilitation plan that can be
implemented with funds from the Soledad Redevelopment Agency. The Plan
provides a conceptual design plan and design guidelines for the development and
                                             I­10

rehabilitation of properties in the downtown which, for purposes of the Plan, is an
area bounded by Front Street, Park Street, the Front Street/US 101 interchange to the
north and Market Street to the east (see Figure II­2). The Plan also provides an
estimate for the costs of individual rehabilitation projects. Land uses designated by
the Specific Plan are consistent with those identified by the 1993 General Plan.

Relationship of the General Plan to Other Plans
The Soledad General Plan governs land use decisions within the incorporated
boundaries of the city. Lands outside the city are governed by Monterey County.
Another important regional planning agency is the Association of Monterey Bay
Area Governments (AMBAG), which was formed to provide a framework for
addressing issues of regional importance among its twenty member cities, which are:
         City of Capitola      City of Carmel­by­the­Sea              City of Del Rey Oaks
         City of Gonzales      City of Greenfield                     City of Hollister
         City of King City     City of Marina               City of Monterey
         City of Pacific Grove City of Salinas              City of San Juan Bautista
         City of Sand City     City of Santa Cruz                     City of Scotts Valley
         City of Seaside       City of Soledad              City of Watsonville
         County of Monterey    County of Santa Cruz
The primary emphasis of AMBAG’s work involves the preparation of plans and
technical studies to address transportation and air quality problems.
Other planning documents that affect Soledad include the Air Quality Management
Plan (AQMP) recently adopted by MBAG to comply with State and federal Clean Air
laws, and the Congestion Management Plan (CMP) which is intended to reduce
traffic on the county's highways. The Soledad General Plan contains policies and
programs to supplement the requirements of each of these plans.
Special Districts
In addition to the City, there are two special districts closely involved with shaping
Soledad's future: the Soledad Unified School District and the Mission Soledad Rural
Fire Protection District. The School District provides education facilities and services
for elementary through high school aged children. A new high school in Soledad
opened in the fall of 1999.
The Mission Soledad Rural Fire Protection District was formed in 1951 and contracts to
the City for fire protection services. The fire district is roughly 42,000 acres in size
bounded by the foothills of the Gabilan Range and the Santa Lucia Mountains. (A
more complete discussion of public services is provided in the Public Services and
Facilities Element beginning on page VII­1.)
                                               I­12

                                Community Development
The Community Development section of the General Plan establishes goals, policies
and programs to guide the growth and development of the City. The Community
Development section is divided into six general plan elements:
    Land Use
    Economic Development
    Housing
    Circulation
    Parks and Recreation, and
    Public Services and Facilities
The elements of the Community Development chapter must work in concert with
other elements of the General Plan to determine the location, rate, and timing of
growth and to plan for the development of new housing, public facilities and
services.
                                     II. Land Use
                                    A Vision Of the Future
          Soledad is a vibrant, economically sound and culturally diverse community of
          about 58,000 residents in the heart of the Salinas Valley wine industry. Soledad
          residents know their neighbors as well as the neighborhood in which they live,
          and take pride in both. New neighborhoods are distinct and recognizable and
          possess a uniquely pedestrian character in which schools, parks and shopping are
          all within easy walking distance. And yet each new neighborhood is integrated
          with the fabric of the town.
          Most of the everyday shopping needs of Soledad residents are provided by local
          businesses, along with stable, well paying jobs. The downtown area along Front
          Street attracts locals and visitors alike with its eclectic mix of traditional
          markets, restaurants and open plazas, and the numerous festivals held there each
          year. Residential overcrowding is thing of the past, the result of housing
          opportunities affordable to all incomes. Lastly, Soledad is a City that continues
          to look to the future while embracing the diversity and character of its past.
Introduction
When considering the seven topics, or elements that a general plan is required to
cover (land use, circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise and safety),
the issue of land use is probably of greatest interest to the public. The Land Use
Element determines the locations within the City and its planning area where
residential, commercial, industrial, public, and open space land uses may occur at
present and in the future. The Land Use Element also works with the other parts of
the plan to determine the location, rate and timing of new growth and
development.
Land Use Issues Addressed By the General Plan
q To achieve the vision articulated by the General Plan, additional residential land
    will be needed.
    The City’s population experienced steady growth throughout the 1990s and the
    pace accelerated between 1997 and 2001. If population growth trends
    experienced over the past three years continue into the future, the City could
    have as many as 27,000 non­prison residents by the year 2020. To meet the future
    demand for urban land, additional residential acreage will be needed.
                                                  II­2

                                Soledad General Plan
                                      II. Land Use
q The outward expansion of the City will need to be managed in a manner that
  preserves maximum flexibility for the City to respond to the future demand for
  urban land while preserving the most productive soils for agriculture.
  All of the land surrounding the City is composed of productive agricultural soils.
  As a result, the outward expansion of the City may only occur at the expense of
  converting these lands to an urban use. To achieve the vision embodied in the
  General Plan, the management of land within the City’s planning area will need
  to provide maximum flexibility for the City to meet its land use needs while
  protecting the remaining productive agricultural lands.
q In order to protect the most productive agricultural lands, non­soil dependent
  land uses should be accommodated within the City, or within an
  agricultural/industrial business park developed in conjunction with Monterey
  County.
  Monterey County and the cities of the Salinas Valley have adopted the principle
  of city centered growth in which urban development is concentrated in the cities
  where urban services are available to support such uses. The General Plan
  incorporates city centered growth principles to guide land use decisions within its
  proposed sphere of influence in a manner that preserves productive agricultural
  lands and enables both the City and the County to achieve its economic and
  land use management objectives. To that end, the expansion of non­soil
  dependent land uses must be accommodated in the City’s industrial business
  park or perhaps in an industrial business park developed near the existing Dole
  processing plant as a joint venture with the County.
q The City needs to grow in a manner that helps achieve a better balance among
  residential, commercial and industrial land uses.
  At first glance, the City’s ratio of jobs to housing is enviable due in large part to
  the large number of jobs at the prisons. Although the prisons are part of the City,
  they are physically disconnected by more than two miles of farmland and the
  majority of employees do not live, shop or even visit Soledad during the
  workweek. Moreover, the City does not generate property tax or sales tax
  revenues from the prisons, as it would from private industry or commerce located
  elsewhere in the City.          For these reasons, the General Plan needs to
  accommodate additional employment generating land uses.
q Residents of Soledad desire additional goods and services, including more
  convenience shopping.
  Soledad residents want a greater variety of local shopping opportunities, such as
  a grocery store, drug store and department stores. When residents travel to other
  towns to shop, not only is it inconvenient, but the sales taxes and other revenues
  generated by these expenditures are lost to Soledad and are said to "leak" to
  surrounding communities. If Soledad is to capture these revenues and achieve a
  measure of fiscal health and stability, a wider range of retail opportunities must
  be provided.
                                           II­2

                                Soledad General Plan
                                      II. Land Use
q The City’s location makes is well suited to take advantage of opportunities for
  additional visitor­serving uses.
  Soledad is located in the heart of a burgeoning wine industry and is a short drive
  to the Monterey Peninsula. Soledad is also literally the gateway to Pinnacles
  National Monument which lies some fifteen miles to the east. These attractions
  provide opportunities for the City to capture additional "bed" tax, sales tax and
  other revenues derived from visitors.
q The Downtown area needs to be revitalized.
  The area along Front Street and the blocks immediately to the east constitute the
  City’s downtown. The future role of the downtown, as envisioned by the
  Downtown Specific Plan/Front Street Rehabilitation Plan, is to continue as the
  cultural, dining and entertainment center of the City. Considerable progress has
  been made toward implementation of the Downtown Specific Plan/Front Street
  Rehabilitation Plan, especially as it relates to streetscape improvements along
  Front Street. However, one issue that needs to be resolved is the appropriate use
  of the properties owned by the Union Pacific Railroad on the west side of the
  tracks.
  The railroad provides an opportunity for Soledad residents to use the train as a
  viable option to the automobile for trips to surrounding areas for work, shopping
  or pleasure. Although daily commuter rail service is not presently provided,
  passenger service does pass through Soledad daily and the potential exists for
  daily commuter service to be provided sometime in the future. In 1994 the State
  legislature passed the Transit Village Development Planning Act (Government
  Code Section 65460) to promote residential and commercial development in
  close proximity to transit centers with the goal of facilitating the use of the State’s
  substantial rail infrastructure. The Act allows local jurisdictions to adopt a transit
  village plan with a range of complementary residential, commercial and
  employment land uses in proximity to a transit center to make transit use a
  convenient and viable alternative transportation mode. The downtown could
  be revitalized in a way that incorporates provisions for transit use as one of its
  main goals.
q The timing and location of new development will need to be closely coordinated
  with the extension of public services.
  The future development of the City can only be accommodated if sufficient
  infrastructure capacity (services and facilities) is provided concurrently or in
  advance of new development.
q The General Plan needs to provide guidance with regard to the City’s
  expectations for the quality and character of new development (urban design).
  The rapid pace of residential development over the past few years has raised
  concerns about the quality of the design of new neighborhoods. Because the
  General Plan applies throughout the City and its planning area, it is usually more
  concerned with the larger­scale issues of neighborhood design and ensuring that
  new development is integrated with the existing town in a complementary way.

                                     II. Land Use
  Accordingly, policy guidance is provided to help articulate the community’s
  expectations. A separate set of detailed community design guidelines has also
  been prepared to augment this broad policy guidance.
q Residential overcrowding remains a serious problem in Soledad.
  Although considerable residential development has occurred over the past few
  years, the average household size has gradually been increasing, from about 4.5
  in 1990 to about 4.83 in 2000. The alleviation of overcrowding can be addressed
  in a number of ways by the General Plan, starting with the designation of
  sufficient land for different residential products (e.g., apartments, townhouses,
  etc.) affordable to the full range of incomes in Soledad.

City of Soledad Planning Area and Sphere of Influence
Planning Area
The area covered by the general plan is often referred to as the City’s planning area
which includes the incorporated limits as well as “...any land outside its boundaries
which in the planning agency’s judgement bears a relation to its planning”
(Government Code Section 65300) The City’s planning area is shown on Figure II­1
and covers an area generally defined by the ridegline of the Gabilan Range to the
east and the foothills of the coast range to the west, extending north past the
Soledad prison, and to the south about mid­way between Soledad and Greenfield.
In addition to identifying areas into which the City plans to eventually grow and
provide services, the city’s planning area makes an important statement to other
jurisdictions ­ most notably the County ­ regarding the City’s expectations for land
use surrounding its borders.
Sphere of Influence
The Cortese­Knox Act defines a sphere of influence as a “...plan for the probable
ultimate physical boundaries and service area of a local agency...” (Government
Code Section 56076). In practice “ultimate” is often defined as twenty years. Under
Section 56080, a sphere of influence may include an urban service area which
identifies portions of a city’s sphere of influence where urban services are provided,
or where services are expected to be provided during the first five years of an
adopted capital improvement program.
Spheres of influence and other changes to the organization of local governments
are decided by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo), which consists of
representatives from member jurisdictions within the County. In addition to
establishing and amending spheres of influence, LAFCo exercises jurisdiction over
annexations (adding land to a city or special district), detachment from a city or
district, and the incorporation of new cities, among others. Accordingly, LAFCo
policies are key to identifying areas for future City expansion.
In establishing or revising a sphere of influence, LAFCo is guided by policies aimed at
fostering orderly growth. The two overriding concerns of Monterey County LAFCo
with regard to the expansion of spheres of influence are 1) the ability of the local
jurisdiction to provide public services in a timely and cost­effective manner, and 2)
minimizing the premature conversion of prime agricultural lands. At a minimum,
these two factors must be addressed in order for the sphere to be amended.
With regard to agricultural land, Monterey County LAFCo policies discourage
annexation or incorporation proposals which would allow, or would likely lead to, the
conversion of prime agricultural land unless the affected jurisdiction has
demonstrated that effective measures have been adopted to preserve the
remaining prime lands identified within its planning area/proposed sphere of
influence. Such measures could include:
T        Establishing agricultural preserves;

General Plan Area
The Soledad General Plan is intended to guide land use decisions for the next twenty
to fifty years. Although there is no requirement that general plans adhere to this or
any other timeframe, most plans look no further than twenty years into the future
because our ability to reliably predict conditions relevant to land use planning
diminishes quickly the further out in time they go. Nonetheless, the need to
effectively manage land and resources does not suddenly end when “buildout” is
achieved under the general plan. Moreover, circumstances may be such that
buildout conditions are reached much sooner than anticipated. The value of taking
a long­term perspective to land use planning is akin to steering a ship by aiming at a
distant landmark: although unforseen obstacles may arise which cause the course to
be altered from time to time, the goal remains constantly in view.
To help provide this long­term perspective, the Soledad General Plan provides for
the long­term (ie, greater than twenty years) growth and development needs of the
City. Although there is no legal requirement for a general plan to look that far into
the future, it makes a powerful statement about the long­term direction of City
growth and development. And just as the general plan itself should be looked upon
as a “living” document that changes in response to circumstances and
opportunities, the same flexibility should be applied to the long­term plan.
The long­term plan shows future urban development proceeding generally north
between the 101 freeway and the foothills and between the existing City limits and
Camphora Gloria Road. Additional land for industrial development is designated
between the existing Dole processing plant and the freeway, with additional
commercial land along the freeway proper.

Land Use Diagram
Background
Defining the future size of the City, both in its aerial extent and in population, was the
focus of the initial community outreach efforts leading to the preparation of a Draft
General Plan. A number alternatives were presented to workshop participants to
conceptually illustrate a range of possibilities for the future growth and development
of the City. The alternative preferred by workshop participants shows future urban
expansion to the north and east between the existing City limits and Camphora­
Gloria Road and supporting a long­term buildout population of about 58,000
residents (excluding the prisons).
The initial preferred land use plan, or “urban fabric diagram” (see Figure II­3), was
intended to help the community identify a preferred vision for the future of the City.
Although it was deliberately conceptual, it provided an important bridge between
the community’s vision for the City and the provisions of State law which require the
Land Use Diagram (Figure II­9) to be property­specific. Accordingly, the boundary
lines between land use designations shown on the Land Use Diagram are drawn as
specifically as possible, and generally follow property lines.
Land Use Designations
The Land Use Diagram for the City of Soledad is shown on Figure II­9 and assigns a
land use designation to all property within the City, both public and private, and
properties within the City’s sphere of influence (see Figure II­1 and the discussion
above). When questions arise regarding the land use designation for a particular
parcel of land, the map should be interpreted by the Planning Commission. The
individual land use designations are described below:
Single Family Residential     This land use designation allows for single family
residential
(1 ­ 6 units per acre)        development with up to six dwellings per acre, and
                              allows a range of other uses which includes schools,
                              churches and public facilities.
Duplex Residential            This designation allows for the construction of duplexes
(two
(7 ­ 12 units per acre)       attached units on the same lot) and attached housing
clusters.
Multiple Residential          The Multiple Residential designation allows for the
                              development
(13 ­ 20 units per acre)      of    multi­family      housing    such    as   apartments,
                              condominiums and townhouses.
General Commercial            The General Commercial designation is intended to
                              support uses of a community retail nature such as
                                            II­9

                           Soledad General Plan
                                 II. Land Use
                        appliance stores, food stores, offices, banks and other
                        uses for the community as a whole.
Neighborhood Commercial Neighborhood Commercial land uses provide goods
                        and services for a specific neighborhood, such as
                        convenience stores, food stores, drug stores, etc.
Downtown Commercial     A mix of retail, office, and other service uses appropriate
                        for the Central Business District, also potentially including
                        some residential uses on upper floors.
Service Commercial      Uses such as wholesale and retail stores and shops of a
                        heavy commercial and business park character
                        conducted inside or outside a building, such as auto
                        repair shops, farm equipment repair and sales, etc.
Industrial              Manufacturing, processing, repair, storage and/or
                        agricultural related industries in a conventional industrial
                        or business park setting.
Public/Institutional    Schools, government         buildings, libraries, churches,
hospitals, etc.
Recreational            Open space lands that provide active recreation areas,
                        with maintained landscaping and facilities.
Open Space/Grazing Land Undisturbed open space uses that maintain scenic and
                        natural habitat values as well as flood zone safety and
                        safety from other hazards. Grazing land is generally
                        located on hillsides above the 400 foot contour
                        elevation.
Agriculture             Agricultural lands intended for soil­dependent uses.

Expansion Areas
The Land Use Diagram designates areas adjacent to the City where it will eventually
grow and extend public services over the next twenty or more years. These areas
are designated Expansion Area/Specific Plan Required and are primarily residential
in nature, but will also provide the range of complementary land uses necessary to
support liveable neighborhoods that are integrated with the fabric of the
community.
A specific plan will be required in advance of annexation and development of each
sub­area identified on the Land Use Diagram (Figure II­9). A specific plan is a
planning tool authorized by State law (Government Code Section 65450) that can
be used to identify appropriate land uses for an area and establish development
guidelines in greater detail than provided by the General Plan. However, a specific
plan is not as detailed as an individual development plan or subdivision proposal,
and will be used to bridge the gap between the broad land use policies contained
in the General Plan, and the detailed development guidelines found in the City’s
Zoning Ordinance.
The General Plan provides standards for the preparation of specific plans for new
expansion areas in Appendix B on page XII­2. Standards are provided for the
allowable mix of land uses and for the overall objectives to be achieved through the
specific plan process.
The following is a description of each specific plan sub­area along with a brief
discussion of development constraints and opportunities and the overall objectives
to be achieved.
NORTHWEST EXPANSION AREA
The Northwest Expansion Area designates commercial, industrial and residential land
uses that would serve the City’s long term development needs. The properties in this
area are owned primarily by the Braga and Silva families (in 2004) and consist of
about 1,548 acres south of Camphora­Gloria Road, and north of Highway 101. To
the south and west lie the San Vicente West, North Entry Commercial and Mirrasou
Specific Plan areas. The Dole food processing plant lies within this specific plan area
north of Highway 101 on Camphora­Gloria Road.
The Northwest Expansion Area is envisioned as a source of land for the City’s long­
term industrial and commercial development needs. In addition, this specific plan
area is intended to support additional residential neighborhoods with parks, schools,
neighborhood serving commercial development and a range of housing products.
The main focus of development within the Northwest Expansion Area is an industrial
park surrounding the Dole plant which could be developed as a joint effort between
the City and the County. The industrial park would provide suitable sites for large­
scale agricultural support industries similar to Dole that would provide jobs for the
City and region.

NORTH ENTRY COMMERCIAL
The North Entry Commercial area consists of the properties designated for
commercial development adjacent to the Highway 101 interchange at the north
entrance to the City. The properties in this area are owned primarily by the Braga
and Moranda families and consists of approximately 146 acres. The current land use
consists of irrigated row crop cultivation. To the north and northeast is highly
productive agricultural land.          To the east are residential, recreational and
commercial uses within the City of Soledad east of San Vicente Road. At the
southerly end of the Moranda property is the confluence of Front Street and San
Vicente Road which provides the northerly entrance to the downtown commercial
core area.
The North Entry Commercial area’s high visibility, and its proximity to the freeway
interchange and future growth areas in the City make it ideally suited for future large
scale commercial development. Accordingly, new development must be designed
with sensitivity to the area’s visual prominence, and incorporate elements that reflect
positively on the City.
Uses envisioned for this area include a major regional shopping center and other
retail uses such as offices, neighborhood parks, and higher density housing that will
benefit from proximity to the anticipated shopping, services and employment
opportunities.

Vehicular traffic is anticipated to be high when this area reaches full development,
which emphasizes the need for a well planned circulation system. This specific plan
area will be served by an arterial road system including Gabilan Drive, and a future
north­south roadway as shown on the Circulation Diagram (Figure V­2). The street
system serving the residential and office areas should continue the grid system of
streets originating in the downtown area and to allow multiple access points to the
commercial area.
The conceptual illustration provided below shows how this area might be
developed. It should be noted that this is an illustration, only, and depicts only one
of many possible design solutions that may arise through the preparation of the
specific plan required for the area.

SAN VICENTE WEST
The San Vicente West area is located west of San Vicente Street and north of
Gabilan Drive and consists of approximately 179 acres. Current land use consists of
irrigated row crops. To the west and north is agricultural land; to the east are
residential neighborhoods within the City of Soledad. This specific plan area lies
adjacent to the Mirassou property (Section 16) to the east and adjoins the North
Entry Commercial Area to the south. San Vicente West is also at the most westerly
end of the natural drainage system that originates in the Gabilan Range northeast of
the City.
Uses envisioned for this area include low­ and medium­density residential, retail, and
neighborhood parks. Medium density multi­family uses will benefit by proximity to
anticipated shopping, services and employment opportunities. Retail and offices
are appropriate in the southern portion of the specific plan area adjacent to the
North Entry Commercial area described above.

MIRASSOU
The Mirassou specific plan area is comprised of 650 developable acres (section 16
and several adjoining parcels) and is currently used for various agricultural
operations including vineyards and grazing. Topography is gently undulating to the
west and becoming hilly and steep toward the east in the foothills of the Gabilan
Range.
The Mirassou Specific Plan area is envisioned as one of the City’s major future growth
areas. A number of objectives have been identified for this area including:
T Preserve the scenic hills above the 400­foot contour as grazing land or accessible
     open space.
T Provide a range of residential product types that include multi­family and estate
     lots, as well as conventional single family development;
T Incorporate a nine­or 18 hole public golf course;
T Provide drainage and open space to solve the chronic flooding problem
     associated with the westerly portion of the plan area;
T Provide neighborhood serving commercial development and limited office
     space;
T Provide locations for public and quasi­public land uses that include schools, parks
     and public safety facilities;

MIRAVALE II
Miravalle II includes several large parcels east of the area known as Miravale I, and
the Orchard Lane Estates area (an area of County lands immediately east of
Granada Street). Development of this area would complete the east side of the City
which adjoins the Estancia Vineyards (to the east) which is currently encumbered by
a Land Conservation Act contract with the County of Monterey. Bryant Canyon
flood channel is a significant feature, providing a separation between the specific
plan area and the adjoining vineyards. The channel provides an opportunity for use
as an open space buffer between the urban and agricultural areas, and as a
corridor for a future public trail system around the City’s eastern flank.
Vehicular circulation connections to Miravale II have largely been determined by
the development of Miravale I. Orchard Lane provides access from the south and
Gabilan Drive from the west. Metz Road (State Highway 146) borders the specific
plan area on the south. Additional access to the specific plan area will be provided
by the northerly extension of Bryant Canyon Road and Orchard Lane north from
Metz Road. Gabilan Drive provides the most direct access to the City’s north and
northwest areas (i.e., North Entry Commercial area, Soledad High School and
Highway 101 north), and by Metz Road, which will provides access to South
Monterey County via Metz Road and/or Highway 101. It may be appropriate to
consider ceasing the use of portions of Bryant Canyon Road for vehicular access
and to utilize Orchard Lane as the primary arterial road in the area. This could
reduce development and maintenance costs and enable the use of Bryant Canyon
Road right of way as a pedestrian trail.
The primary land use envisioned for this area is residences at a variety of densities,
with limited complementary neighborhood commercial uses fronting Metz Road.
Other uses envisioned for this area include neighborhood parks, expansion of the
historic Soledad Cemetery, and provision of an attractive open space corridor with
a pedestrian trail along the edge of Bryant Canyon Road.
Although Miravale II is an expansion area, development of the area has already
undergone environmental review and will not be subject to the preparation of a
specific plan

General Plan Holding Capacity
Table II­1 summarizes the acreage designated for various land uses by the General
Plan, and their corresponding maximum theoretical development potential. Table II­
1 shows that the General Plan could accommodate a non­prison population of
between 53,000 ­ 61,000 residents at full buildout, in addition to about 10 ­12 million
square feet of commercial and industrial development. It should be noted that
these figures represent an estimate of conditions at full buildout of the land
designated for these uses inclusive of existing development.
Table II­2 provides a summary of the General Plan “holding capacity”, which is the
number of dwelling units, commercial and industrial floor space, etc., that can be
accommodated based on the amount of land designated for these uses. Due to
market forces, the size and shape of parcels and other factors, the maximum
development potential is rarely achieved. For this reason, holding capacity is
expressed as 80 percent of the gross development potential (acres x building
intensity). However, the actual buildout population achieved by the general plan will
likely be much less because existing residential neighborhoods are developed at
densities much less than 80% of their maximum allowable density, and the residential
density of new expansion areas will likewise be constrained by slope, irregularly
shaped lots and preferences reflected in the marketplace.
According to the 2000 Census, the City had about 2,472 dwelling units, not counting
dwellings approved or under construction. Since then, about 600 additional units
have been constructed, which brings the total in the City to about 3,072. This leaves
a remaining development potential of 6,600 to 8,600 units that could be constructed
within the City’s general plan area in accordance with the General Plan.

Land Use Intensity Standards
In accordance with State law, the General Plan must specify standards of population
density and building intensity for each land use designation. Standards for building
intensity for residential designations are stated in terms of the maximum number of
dwelling units allowed per gross acre and the allowable range of dwelling units per
gross acre. Standards for population density for residential land uses are derived by
multiplying the maximum number of dwellings allowed per gross acre by the average
number of persons per dwelling unit, which for purposes of this General Plan is
assumed to be 4.55 based on the 2000 US Census. For example, the maximum
population standard for Low Density Residential development is about 6 X 4.55 = 27.3
persons per acre.
For non­residential land uses, building intensity standards are expressed in terms of
maximum allowable floor­area ratios (FARs). A floor­area ratio is the ratio of building
size to lot area:
                                 Floor Area Ratio = Maximum Building Area Allowed 
                                                        Net Area of Lot
The FAR is most often used to determine the maximum allowable building size for a
particular lot, as follows:
                                                     II­25

                                           Soledad General Plan
                                                 II. Land Use
     Maximum Building Area Allowed =  Net Area of Lot  X  Floor Area Ratio
For example, a 5,000 square foot lot with a FAR of 1.00 will allow a building of 5,000
gross square feet, regardless of the number of stories in the building (e.g., 2,500
square feet on two floors, or 5,000 square feet on one floor). The same lot with a FAR
of 0.50 would allow a 2,500 square foot building, or a 10,000 square foot building with
a FAR of 2.00.
Table II­3 lists the standards for the allowable range of dwelling units per gross acre,
and the maximum allowable floor­area ratio for non­residential land uses.

                               Single Family                   6 units/acre
                               Multi­family                    20 units/acre
                         Commercial                            FAR* of 0.4
                         Industrial                            FAR of 0.6
                         Public/Institutional                  FAR of 0.4
     * Floor Area Ratio (FAR), is the ratio of building area to the area of the lot. For example, a floor area
ratio of one on a one acre lot results in a building floor area of 43,560 square feet.
Corresponding Zoning Designations
The land use designations contained in the General Plan describe the general uses to
which land may be committed in the City of Soledad. They do not imply the
appropriate land use for a given parcel of land, which will vary based on a variety of
factors, such as the location, size and shape of the property, and market conditions
for particular land uses. Site­specific development standards are provided in the
Soledad Zoning Ordinance which divides the City into districts, or zones. By law the
zoning districts must be consistent with the land use designations shown on the Land
Use Diagram.
Table II­4 summarizes the various zoning districts that may be used to implement the
land use classifications shown on the Land Use Diagram (Figure II­8). In addition to
these base zoning districts, there are a number of combining districts that provide
additional standards applicable to specific areas of the City.

General
L­1     The Soledad general plan area is shown on Figure II­9. The land use
        designations and policies of this General Plan apply to the general plan area.
        Within the City’s planning area, the City will support the following:
        a.   Apply the City Centered Growth Principles as recommended by the City
             Centered Growth Task Force;
        b.   Preserve agriculture on large lots outside the City’s sphere of influence as
             it may be amended by the updated general plan;
        c.   No new Land Conservation Act contracts to be entered into within the
             sphere of influence;
        d.   No expansion of non­soil dependent land uses;
        e.   No urban services from the City unless an equitable cost and revenue
             sharing agreement between the City and the County is executed;
        f.   Execution of a Memorandum of Understanding with Monterey County
             formalizing the land use management strategy for the City’s sphere of
             influence embodied in the items listed above.
L­2     Further annexations to the City may occur when a) a substantial portion of the
        development capacity within the existing city limits has been developed, b) a
        substantial public benefit can be realized through the annexation, such as the
        provision of public open space, additional parkland, or the protection of
        scenic vistas, or natural resources, or c) a special type of use is proposed that
        cannot be practically accommodated in the existing city limits, and d) the
        project can be found to provide a financial benefit to the City or to be fiscally
        neutral. The Planning Commission shall review the merits of a request for
        annexation based on these criteria, and make a recommendation to the City
        Council.

L­5   New development shall not be allowed unless adequate public services are
      available to serve such new development, or that can be provided at the
      time of development.
L­6   New development shall pay its fair share of providing additional public
      services needed to accommodate such development.
L­7   Master plans for sewer, water, roads, drainage and other public improvements
      shall be required for new development on large undeveloped parcels and
      may be included in the specific plan required by policy L­3, and as
      determined by the City.
L­8   The City shall permit only low­intensity land uses in areas where natural
      conditions such as floodplains and steep hillsides are likely to pose a threat to
      public safety or produce excessive maintenance costs.
L­9   To help maintain the beauty of the City, property owners shall be encouraged
      to maintain their property in a neat and orderly manner. The City will continue
      to enforce the property maintenance standards of the Soledad Municipal
      Code.
Jobs/Housing Balance
L­10  The City shall monitor development and adjust land use designations and new
      residential project approvals as needed to promote a reasonable balance
      between employment­generating land uses and housing.
L­11  The City shall encourage large residential development projects to be phased
      or timed with development that will provide primary wage­earner jobs.
Residential Development
L­12  The City shall maintain an adequate supply of land in appropriate
      designations to accommodate projected household growth, maintain
      affordability to moderate and below moderate income groups, and maintain
      acceptable vacancy rates.
L­13  The City shall require that residential projects be designed to reflect and
      consider the relationship of the project to surrounding uses. Residential
      densities and lot patterns will be determined by these and other factors. As a
      result, the maximum density specified by the General Plan land use
      designations or zoning for a given parcel of land may not be realized.

                                        II. Land Use
L­14 The maximum allowable residential density for new residential subdivisions or
     development projects shall be computed based on the gross area of the lot
     before dedications for highway setbacks, parks, streets, or other requirements.
L­15 The City shall require new subdivided lots to be adequate in size and shape for
     the range of primary and accessory uses designated for the area.
L­16 The pace of new residential development should be such that new residents
     can be absorbed into the fabric of the town and existing residents are not
     overwhelmed by newcomers. This can be accomplished in part by requiring
     phasing of larger residential projects and by ensuring that adequate
     infrastructure and public improvements are in place concurrently, or in
     advance of new development.
L­17 Major new residential development is appropriate in the areas on the east
     and north sides of the developed portions of the City.
L­18 The infill of existing residential lots shall be encouraged.
L­19 In general, higher densities of residential development shall be located in
     areas served by the widest range of urban services, and shall be preferred
     along collector and arterial streets, within walking distance of schools, city
     parks and transit stops.
L­20 The approval of new residential subdivisions shall incorporate provisions to
     ensure that an appropriate amount of new multi­family development is
     constructed concurrently, or in advance of, new single family residences.
Commercial Development
L­21 New commercial development shall be encouraged in Soledad near the
     freeway interchanges with Highway 101.                Limited new neighborhood
     commercial development will be allowed within areas designated Expansion
     Area, and/or at specified nodes to provide for the everyday needs of the
     surrounding residential neighborhoods.
L­22 The City will ensure that adequate commercial land is designated to meet the
     present and future needs of residents of the City and maintain economic
     vitality.
L­23 In general, new retail commercial development should provide a wider range
     of shopping opportunities for the community.
L­24 New commercial development shall be designed to encourage safe and
     efficient pedestrian circulation within and between commercial sites and
     nearby residential neighborhoods.
L­25 New commercial development shall be designed to minimize the visibility of
     parking areas from public roadways.

                                   II. Land Use
L­26 The visitor­serving sector of the local economy shall be maintained and
     expanded. New motels/hotels shall especially be encouraged in areas within
     walking distance of the downtown. Visitors to the nearby Pinnacles National
     Monument offers another potential market for visitor­serving land uses.
L­27 Residences shall be allowed in conjunction with compatible commercial
     development on land designated Downtown Commercial.
L­28 Offices and medical facilities may be located in areas designated for office
     development and within the Downtown.
L­29 A Service Commercial land use designation shall be established to
     accommodate businesses that require large amounts of floor area, such as
     lumber yards, home improvement outlets, agriculture and ranch­related
     businesses and other similar uses.

The Downtown
L­30    The Downtown shall be developed in accordance with the design standards
        contained in the Downtown Specific Plan/Front Street Improvement Plan.
L­31    The Downtown area along Front Street shall be developed into the physical
        and social center of Soledad in accordance with the vision captured by the
        Downtown Specific Plan/Front Street Improvement Plan. As outlying areas
        develop with commercial businesses, the role of the downtown should be the
        focus of community events and gatherings, entertainment and dining.
        Pedestrian and bicycle access to the downtown shall be improved.
Public­Quasi­Public/Office Development
L­32    The City shall designate adequate, appropriately located land for the
        development of City and County facilities and offices, schools, medical
        facilities, water facilities, and public safety facilities.
L­33    The expansion of government offices shall be encouraged on land near the
        present City Hall and in the Downtown. The post office should be retained in
        the downtown.
L­34    When considering plans for large­scale development, the City shall designate
        adequate, appropriately­located land for the development of quasi­public
        land uses, such as, hospitals, churches, private schools, cemeteries, and utility
        uses.
L­35    The City shall promote the clustering of public and quasi­public uses such as
        schools and parks, libraries, child care facilities, and community activity
        centers. Joint use of public facilities shall be promoted, and agreements for
        sharing costs and operational responsibilities among public service providers
        shall be encouraged.
L­36    The City shall encourage efforts to locate adequate emergency services and
        other types of health care facilities in Soledad to meet the present and future
        needs of its residents.
L­37    Health care and dental care services, including residential care facilities and
        senior care services, shall be expanded to meet the needs of the City’s
        population.
Industrial Development
L­38    The City and Redevelopment Agency shall promote the development of
        clean industries that do not generate large amounts of air pollution, have the
        potential to pollute groundwater resources, or that store, use or produce large
        volumes of hazardous materials.
L­39    The City and Redevelopment Agency shall promote the expansion of light
        industrial and business park development in the Los Coches industrial park.
                                               II­32

                                       II. Land Use
L­40  Access to the Los Coches industrial park from the US 101 freeway shall be
      improved to reduce potential conflicts of truck traffic with neighboring uses, to
      improve safety and to improve access efficiency.
L­41  The City will work with Monterey County to establish an industrial park aimed
      primarily at agriculture support businesses along Camphora­Gloria Road
      between the existing Dole processing plant and the 101 freeway.
Expansion Areas/Specific Plan Areas
L­42  The City shall use Community Design Guidelines as a decision­making tool to
      ensure that new development incorporates the qualities and character
      desired by Soledad residents.
L­43  Specific plans prepared for major expansion areas shall incorporate the
      standards described in Appendix B – Standards for Specific Plans. In general:
      a. New residential projects should be designed to integrate with existing
           neighborhoods to ensure that they do not destroy the established
           character. Subdivisions in City expansion areas should be designed so that
           individual, separately developed projects work together to create true
           neighborhoods with a sense of identity, instead of disjointed or isolated
           enclaves.
      b. Subdivision design should emphasize pedestrian connectivity within each
           project, and to adjacent neighborhoods, and nearby schools and parks.
           All streets and walkways should be designed to provide safe and pleasant
           conditions for pedestrians. Streets within neighborhoods should be no
           wider than needed to accommodate parking and two low­speed travel
           lanes. Sidewalks should be separated from curbs by parkway strips of at
           least four feet in width; and the parkways should be planted with canopy
           street trees.
      c. Specific plans should provide a range of residential housing types
           affordable to the widest range of income groups, consistent with the goals,
           policies and programs of the Housing Element of the General Plan.
      d. Subdivisions should be designed to provide usable public open spaces in
           the form of parks, linear bicycle and pedestrian trails, squares, and greens,
           as appropriate.
L­44  The City shall require that all new development be designed to complement
      the scale and character of existing development. Views of the surrounding
      hills and mountains shall be preserved through such means as design review,
      sign control, undergrounding of utilities, grading and tree removal standards.
L­45  The City shall require all new development to be planned and designed in a
      manner which employs design, construction and maintenance techniques
      that:
      a. Avoids locating structures along ridgelines and steep slopes.
      b. Incorporates design and screening measures to minimize the visibility of
                                            II­33

                                     II. Land Use
         structures and graded areas.
     c. Maintains the character and visual quality of the area.
L­46 New development on hillsides shall employ design, construction and
     maintenance techniques that:
     a. Ensure that development near or on portions of hillsides do not cause or
         worsen natural hazards such as erosion, sedimentation, or fire hazards.
     b. Minimize risk to life and property from slope failure, landslides and flooding.
     c. Include erosion and sediment control measures including temporary
         vegetation sufficient to stabilize disturbed areas.
     d. Maintain the character and visual quality of the hillside.
L­47 The City may, where appropriate, require new development to provide
     pedestrian amenities along public sidewalks, such as seating and ‘pocket
     parks’.
L­48 The entrances to Soledad from the north and south by way of Highway 101 are
     the community’s "gateways". New public and private development in these
     locations shall include elements such as signage, landscaping and
     landscaped center medians, and appropriate architectural detailing that
     announce that one has arrived in Soledad.
L­49 The form, scale and character of new residential development shall emulate
     the best characteristics of the existing residential neighborhoods, such as
     single and two­story dwellings with adequate off­street parking, landscaped
     front yards with trees, and sidewalks.
L­50 Multi­family development shall include usable open space for each dwelling
     and shall be designed to be integrated with the surrounding neighborhood.
L­51 All exterior lighting in new development shall be located and designed so as
     to avoid shining directly onto nearby residential properties, and shall minimize
     offsite glare. Proponents of commercial or industrial projects on property
     adjacent to residential areas shall submit a lighting plan to the City for review
     and approval; said plan shall incorporate features such low level, downward­
     directed exterior lights to achieve the intent of this policy.
L­52 Historically or architecturally significant buildings shall not be demolished or
     substantially changed in outward appearance in a way that diminishes the
     historical character, unless doing so is necessary to remove a threat to health
     and safety and other means to avoid the threat are infeasible.

                                      A Vision Of the Future
             The City is fiscally sound, economically diverse and financially stable. Soledad
             businesses provide most of the day to day needs of its residents. The Los Coches
             industrial park is nearly built­out with small incubator businesses as well as
             larger, well established firms that provide stable, well paying jobs. An
             agriculture industrial park, created as a joint venture between the City and
             Monterey County, is occupied by several large businesses that offer quality
             employment for Soledad residents and strengthen economic cooperation between
    Introduction
    Economic development refers to policies and programs to help increase the
    community’s economic activity in order to create more and better jobs, and to
    provide greater choice and more competitive prices for goods and services. A
    healthy economy also tends to increase revenues to the local government through
    more property tax and through additional sales tax. Economic vitality and land use
    policies are closely linked. Encouraging commercial and industrial growth is at the
    root of a successful economic development strategy. Many of the land use policies
    are, effectively, economic development policies. Similarly, as discussed earlier in this
    section, fiscal impacts are also closely tied to economic growth. Thus, policies and
    programs to enhance the city’s fiscal position overlap many of those aimed at more
    general economic development.
    Economic Development Issues
    q New commercial and industrial development is needed to help improve the City’s
        fiscal condition.
        One way to improve the City’s finances and enable improved and expanded
        levels of services, is to encourage new commercial and industrial development
        which will expand the City’s tax base and revenue stream.
    q A healthy economy is essential to generate taxes and related revenues, to
        provide desired public facilities and services, and to provide higher­paying jobs.
        The City derives revenues from a variety of sources, including sales taxes, bed
        taxes on motel rooms, and fees for new development. In order to provide a
        desirable level of services during the time frame of the General Plan, revenues
        must be generated to pay for the needed improvements to facilities and
        increased operating costs.
                                                    III­1

Soledad General Plan                                                  III. Economic Development
    q Many residents have low wage jobs. Thus, providing local jobs, and especially
       higher paying jobs, is important.
       Soledad has limited industrial or professional businesses that provide high paying
       jobs. For this reason, most of the employed residents work outside the community.
       Providing more and better jobs in Soledad would have a number of benefits. For
       example, as fewer persons commute to other towns to work, less traffic will be
       generated on local highways and air quality will be improved. In addition, a work
       force that lives, works and shops locally would greatly increase local sales taxes
       and other revenues to the City. Attracting more and better jobs to Soledad will
       require that office vacancies be filled, retail businesses recruited and light
       industrial and service oriented industries pursued aggressively.
    q The Los Coches Industrial Park remains largely vacant.
       A recent study completed by Applied Development Economics recommends a
       number of strategies to help revitalize the business park, including re­configuring
       the size and shape of the lots, adding landscaping along street frontages and
       continuing the City’s marketing efforts. The City has begun implementing several
       of the study’s recommendations. In addition, the City must recruit and work with
       developers including partnering through funding assistance to bring the Park up to
       developable standards in a competitive marketplace.
    q Retail sales “leakage” caused by residents purchasing day­to­day items such as
       groceries, clothing, and prescription drugs in surrounding communities is of
       particular concern.
       Achieving a greater degree of balance among housing, shopping and
       employment opportunities provides diversity to the local economy, which in turn
       fosters stability over the long term. Studies have shown that the City could support
       a retail center of 100,000 square feet or more which would capture a sizeable
       portion of the “leaked” expenditures. The Mission Soledad shopping center has
       been constructed near the southerly interchange with Highway 101 which will
       help capture a greater portion of the ‘leaked’ expenditures.
       The City must expedite these plans and partner with developers to clear land,
       build requisite infrastructure, signage, provide beautification and landscaping
       and bring sites up to developable standards competitive in today’s marketplace.
       The City must simultaneously recruit and provide requisite partnership and
       incentives to tenants and end users, particularly those businesses most desired by
       residents. These include restaurants that provide a more diverse cuisine; fast food;
       convenience stores; service and gift shops; and clothing/shoe stores.
    Economic Development Strategies
    Economic development strategies tend to focus on three broad components: 1)
    “locality” development, 2) business development, and 3) labor force enhancement.
    Locality development refers to efforts to make the community more conducive to
    economic growth.            Examples include enhanced municipal services and
                                               III­2

Soledad General Plan                                                 III. Economic Development
    infrastructure, improved community aesthetics and safety, and quality schools. All of
    these features tend to attract businesses and their workers.
    Business development encompasses those efforts most typically associated with
    economic development, policies and programs to improve business opportunities
    and the business climate. Examples include zoning adequate land for commercial
    and industrial uses, permit streamlining, tax or fee relief for desirable business
    development, land banking, low interest loans, incubator strategies, and many more
    programs.
    Labor force enhancement includes those programs to increase the skills of the local
    workers and to better match those skills with desirable employers. If, for example, a
    community wants to attract “high tech” businesses, then it must have a work force
    with the education and training to supply the workers for those businesses. Examples
    of labor force enhancement strategies include training programs (often in
    conjunction with a local community college or adult school), job hotlines to match
    workers with employment opportunities, and mentoring or apprenticeship programs.
    Any economic development program must realistically acknowledge the constraints
    inhibiting business growth and build on the community’s opportunities. While the City
    has engaged in programs within all of these general strategies with mixed success,
    the future emphasis will likely be on locality enhancement and business
    development.
    Redevelopment
    In 1983 the City adopted a redevelopment plan in accordance with Section 33000 et
    seq. of the California Health and Safety Code. Redevelopment affords broad powers
    to the Redevelopment Agency to alleviate “blight” that is affecting the project area,
    including economic conditions of blight such as vacant or underutilized buildings. Tax
    increments accrued to the Agency provide a funding mechanism for redevelopment
    programs that must be used to alleviate these blighting conditions. In addition, at
    least twenty percent of the tax increments must be set aside for the purpose of
    improving the supply of affordable housing within the community.
    The Soledad Redevelopment Plan has been amended twice to bring it into
    conformity with changes to the Community Redevelopment Law that have occurred
    since its adoption. However, the boundaries of the redevelopment project area
    have remained the same. Redevelopment goals identified in the Plan include:
    q    Economic development programs to attract and retain commercial and
         industrial businesses.
    q    Downtown revitalization programs to address the needs of downtown businesses.
         The City has nearly completed implementation of the Front Street Improvement
         Plan/Downtown Specific Plan which is aimed at revitalizing the Downtown. In
         addition, the Downtown is home to numerous special events such as the farmers
         market, the Christmas festival, and the Wind and Wine Festival all of which add to
         the vitality of Downtown.
    q    Improvement of public facilities and infrastructure.
    q    Housing programs to improve the supply of affordable housing.
                                              III­3

Soledad General Plan                                                    III. Economic Development
    Efforts to implement these projects have been funded mostly through tax increments
    on new development and other sources. For example, redevelopment funds were
    used to prepare an update of the Downtown Specific Plan/Front Street Revitalization
    Plan. A portion of the Specific Plan’s streetscape improvements have been installed
    at the north entrance to town.
    Other Economic Development Opportunities
    There are several opportunities which the City can incorporate into its economic
    development strategies.
    ‘ The city is located relatively near Pinnacles National Monument. This may provide
        opportunities for the creation of a staging area into the Monument and could be
        a stimulus for associated visitor­oriented development and tourism revenues.
    ‘ Wine grapes and wineries are becoming a larger portion of the agricultural
        economy of the Salinas Valley. In addition to Estancia and Golden State Vintners
        currently located within the City, a number of large, corporate wineries have also
        located near Soledad (Mondavi and Kendall Jackson). As the wine industry
        continues to expand it is possible that another large winery or similar business
        could locate in Soledad, and/or that the local wine industry could be promoted
        with a tasting room/retail outlet.
    ‘ The City is located within a short drive of the Monterey Peninsula which is a major
        tourist destination.
    As noted before, there is significant leakage of sales in certain sectors, including those
    that cater to furniture, building materials, appliances, autos and other goods that
    require larger buildings for retailing.
    In terms of improving the city’s attraction for business generally, several opportunities
    exist. First, the ongoing efforts to upgrade the city’s image through redevelopment is
    important for attracting investment. Requiring improved levels of ongoing property
    maintenance and revitalization reinforces these other efforts. Other opportunities
    exist for streetscape improvements and the creation of public parks which can
    improve the city’s image and leverage greater private investment.
    Providing higher paying jobs is a difficult challenge. Continued promotion of clean
    industries (policy L­38) and the efforts to develop the industrial park (policy L­40) are
    clearly aimed in this direction. The prisons are the largest single full­time employer in
    Soledad and are likely to remain so into the future; regional employment, however,
    continues to be dominated by seasonal agriculture. Factors that could affect future
    employment in Soledad include:
    ‘ Prison expansion or contraction
    ‘ The location of large­scale agricultural processing operations in Soledad.
    ‘ Regulatory changes (such as City­centered growth) in other communities or in the
        unincorporated county.
    ‘ Introduction of an unknown and unanticipated industry or quasi­public use.

Soledad General Plan                                                                    III. Economic Development
    Economic development can be encouraged by providing incentives for desirable
    new projects and by streamlining the development review process.
    The problems Soledad faces in terms of economic vitality are significant but there are
    opportunities for improvement. The successful approach must be long term and
    incremental, starting with the items discussed above.
    Economic Development Goals, Policies and Programs
                                                            Goals
    1. To improve the City’s overall economy and fiscal condition.
    2. To ensure that new development does not impose a substantial financial burden
        to the City.
    3. To provide good local jobs for Soledad residents.
                                                           Policies
    E­1     The City will work with local business groups, such as the Soledad Chamber of
            Commerce and the Old Town Merchants Association to promote Soledad
            businesses and to explore new business opportunities. Among the possibilities
            warranting additional study include:
            <More visitor­serving uses catering to visitors to Pinnacles National Monument; 
            <Community shopping center including major chain grocery and drug stores; 
            <A wine tasting boutique showcasing local wineries; 
            <A train depot and train services; 
            <Restoration of the Los Coches (Richardson) Adobe and development of a hotel and restaurant at the 
                 property; 
            <Recruitment of agricultural processing and support industries; 
    E­2     When deemed appropriate by the City, fiscal impact analyses may be
            required to determine the possible fiscal effects of new development on the
            City and other public agencies. These studies may be used to formulate
            conditions of approval for new projects, if deemed appropriate, and will be
            utilized to recruit and expedite development of sought­after projects and
            businesses of most benefit to the community.
    E­3     The City shall encourage efforts to attract and retain commercial and office
            tenants to Soledad. Efforts shall focus on those sectors that are presently
            undersupplied in the community and for which there may be local demand,
            and on regional markets that may be attracted to Soledad by locations near
            Highway 101.

    E­4    The City shall coordinate with the Chamber of Commerce to promote tourism.
           The City will consider using a portion of the Transient Occupancy Tax and
           Redevelopment monies for that purpose.
    E­5    The City shall investigate the feasibility of adding new attractions to the
           community such as, but not limited to, new cultural facilities, special events or
           special educational facilities. All such efforts shall be coordinated with the
           business community. One priority is a to recruit a small to mid­size movie
           theater.
    E­6    The City and its Redevelopment Agency shall continue to upgrade the image
           of Soledad through the Downtown Specific Plan and the provision of
           incremental improvements to the streetscapes and park system.
    E­7    The City shall consider incentives for new development that provide a
           substantial fiscal benefit to the community, such as retail sales taxes, transient
           occupancy taxes or higher­paying jobs.
    E­8    The City shall require fiscal impact assessments for newly proposed specific
           plans. The City will use those assessments to explicitly consider likely net fiscal
           impacts in the plan evaluation and to develop conditions of approval that
           mitigate adverse fiscal impacts, if deemed necessary.
    E­9    The City shall accommodate and encourage higher­end residential
           development in appropriate locations, such as the areas within newly
           annexed areas that are designated for specific plans.
    E­10   The City shall periodically review its demographic profile to highlight special
           subgroups whose spending preferences create opportunities for targeted
           business development. The City will respect the ethnicity of its residents in its
           land use and economic development efforts and the impact these efforts
           may have on its residents.
    E­11   The City shall explore ways to assist the school district and other regional
           educational institutions in providing effective adult education and training to
           improve the skill levels of the City’s residents.
                                              Programs
    3.1    The City will establish and maintain a program to monitor the fiscal status of
           the City as it relates to the implementation of the General Plan.

                                 A Vision Of The Future
             All of Soledad’s residents have sound, affordable housing. Residential
             neighborhoods are attractive, well maintained and pedestrian­friendly.
             There is sufficient choice in the variety of housing so that the diverse
             housing needs of all the City’s residents are met.
Introduction
State law is more specific about the content of housing elements than any other
portion of the general plan. The Housing Element is also the only element that is
actually subject to review and "certification" by the state.
The Housing Element is required by State law to include all of the following
information:
q Information about the existing housing stock, covering such items as the amount,
    type, cost, tenure, and structural conditions of the units.
q An analysis of potential barriers to housing production including both
    governmental and non­governmental constraints.
q Information about energy conservation opportunities in housing rehabilitation and
    new construction.
q Information about existing subsidized housing and the possibility of its being lost
    due to conversion to market­rate units.
q Specific goals, measurable objectives, policies and implementation measures.
    Objectives must include targets for housing unit production, based on a "fair share
    allocation".
The Soledad Housing Element was last updated in 2003 (City of Soledad Housing
Element, A Chapter of the Soledad General plan, March, 2003). The data and
analysis required by State law for Housing Elements, including detailed demographic,
income and other information is provided in the City of Soledad Housing Element,
which is published separately. In addition, Chapter 2 of the General Plan Background
Report provides additional supporting information regarding housing in Soledad.
                                                IV­1

Housing Issues
q Soledad needs to continue to make efforts to achieve its regional allocation of
    housing for all income groups.
    As described above, changes to State law require that each city and county take
    steps to produce its share of housing to meet the region's housing needs. Table IV­
    1 describes Soledad's regional fair share by income category.
q A priority of the Housing Element will be the preservation and rehabilitation of
    existing housing for low income households.
    The analysis contained in the 2003 Housing Element Update suggests that rental
    housing stock in Soledad can be considered "affordable" by regional standards.
    Therefore, a priority of the Housing Element will be to preserve and rehabilitate
    existing housing first, and to allow existing housing to be demolished only in
    circumstances where it cannot feasibly be preserved.
‘ There is a substantial need for rental housing for households with moderate and
    above moderate incomes.
    The Fair Share allocation and previous construction trends indicate that a
    substantial amount of the housing for low and very low incomes is provided by the
    marketplace in Soledad. The income category with the greatest projected
    housing need is for households with ‘above moderate’ incomes, or over 120% of
    the County median.
‘ Housing for households with special needs, such as seniors, farmworkers, large
    families and households headed by single females, will need to be addressed by
    the General Plan.
    Soledad has a large number of seniors and families headed by single females.
    There is also a high degree of overcrowding, due to the presence of large families
    in smaller rental units. The special needs of these groups should be addressed by
    the Housing Element.
Fair Share Allocation: Overall Production Objective
The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) estimates
the statewide need for housing, which is then broken down into regions. Within each
region, the area council of governments (in Soledad's case, the Association of
Monterey Bay Area Governments) prepares a more specific regional distribution of
the needs to the local counties and cities. This so­called "fair share allocation" is a
specific number of units in different price ranges assigned to each local jurisdiction.
In 1990, AMBAG calculated that the City of Soledad should accommodate 1,192 new
housing units by 1996 to achieve an overall housing inventory of 2,807 units. This
                                           IV­2

represents about 200 units per year. Of this total allocation, about 20 percent (about
247 units) were needed for households with low, or very low incomes.
In January, 2000 the City was estimated to have about 2,669 units which is short of the
overall target set by AMBAG. Still, the City has made considerable progress toward
achieving its share of market rate (for moderate and above moderate incomes)
housing which constituted the largest portion of the City’s fair share requirement in
1996.
In 2000 AMBAG assigned a Fair Share Housing Allocation to Soledad of 1,283 units
between 2000 and 2007. These estimates were further refined to include the 527
residential building permits issued between January, 2000 and November 2002 to
arrive at an adjusted housing need of 799 units. Since 525 permits were for units
affordable to ‘above moderate’ incomes, the remaining housing need by 2007 is as
shown on Table IV­1.

Based on past housing construction levels, the objective for lower income housing
seems achievable. Between 1995 and 1999, about 615 building permits for residential
construction were issued, or about 123 units per year. This total includes 100 units of
multi­family rental dwellings, or about 40 percent of the projected housing needs for
low and very low income households. The balance of 515 units constructed are
affordable to households of moderate or high incomes, meaning that about 24
percent of the future allocation for this income group has been constructed. The
remainder needed for each income group will be achieved through development of
the land uses designated by this General Plan and adopted specific plans.
Housing Goals, Policies and Programs
                                           Goals
1. To provide an adequate supply of sound, affordable housing in a safe and
     satisfying environment for all residents of the City of Soledad, consistent with the
     housing allocation adopted by the Association of Monterey Bay Area
     Governments.
                                            IV­3

2. To promote community character, livability, affordability and housing choice, by
   requiring an integrated mix of housing types in new residential areas.
3. To promote the needs of persons who have special needs not readily addressed
   without community leadership, including the homeless, large families, senior
   citizens, and single parents.
4. To encourage the maintenance, improvement, and rehabilitation of the city’s
   existing housing stock and residential neighborhoods, with special attention on
   conserving existing affordable housing.
5. To maintain balance in land use regulation so as to refrain from unnecessary
   governmental constraints on the production of affordable housing and to create
   incentive for the production of affordable housing.
6. To promote the maintenance and improvement of energy efficiency in the city’s
   existing and new housing stock.
7. To ensure equal housing opportunities for all persons regardless of age, race, sex,
   religion, national origin or other barriers that prevent choice in housing.

Adequate Sites and New Construction
H­ 1    The City of Soledad shall promote the expansion of its LAFCO Sphere of
        Influence and annexation of additional land consistent with its General Plan
        Land Use Element to accommodate long­term demand for residential
        development.
H­ 2    The City of Soledad shall ensure adequate vacant land suitably zoned for
        residential development and/or redevelopment is available to meet the city’s
        housing need as identified by the Association of Monterey Bay Area
        Governments.
H­ 3    The City of Soledad shall require new residential areas to contain a mix of
        housing types targeted to very low, low, moderate, and above moderate
        households in approximately the proportion that each of these income
        categories represent in the AMBAG Fair Share Housing Allocation.
H­ 4    The City shall promote the development of affordable housing by maintaining
        an active grant writing program aimed at securing funds for affordable
        housing projects.
Special Needs
H­ 5    The City shall provide incentives to housing developers that provide housing
        opportunities for large families in new residential development areas.
H­ 6    The City shall require housing developers to offer an optional design to
        homebuyers whose household has one or more disabled person.
                                            IV­4

       development review procedures, and development fees do not unreasonably
       constraint the development, conservation, and rehabilitation of housing.
H­ 10 The City of Soledad shall ensure the availability of adequate public facilities for
       the expected housing need of the city.
Energy Conservation
H­ 11 The City of Soledad shall support and initiate, where feasible, public and

Notes:
1. The planning period for the Housing Element is January 1, 2000 through January 1, 2007.
2. 102 of these units would be built by the Soledad Housing Authority through the redevelopment of
existing properties; 50 of these units are already approved and to be built by CHISPA; and 25 of these units
would come through the redevelopment of a dilapidated farm labor camp (lot no. 1 in the list of vacant
sites).
3. 50 of these units are already approved and to be built by CHISPA; the remaining 190 units would be
part of the Miravale I project.
4. 46 of these units are already approved and to be built by CHISPA.
5. This is the difference between total expected growth (at 4.9 percent annually) and the combined
growth expected in very­low, low, and moderate­income categories.
6. This represents a 4.9 percent annual average growth rate for a five­year period (through 2007).

                 A Vision Of The Future
               The circulation system in Soledad operates safely and efficiently for
               pedestrians, bicycles and motor vehicles, and provides logical connections
               among residential neighborhoods, the downtown, shopping areas, employment
               centers and parks and recreation facilities. The train makes regular stops at
               Soledad’s new train station, bringing visitors and commuters to the
               downtown. Walking and biking are preferred to automobiles for trips within
               the community.
    Introduction
    The Circulation Element provides goals and policies aimed at meeting the
    transportation needs of the City, including the provision and maintenance of
    transportation infrastructure. The Circulation Element identifies specific roadway
    deficiencies, as well as improvements necessary to achieve and maintain an
    acceptable level of service (LOS) on the transportation system through buildout of
    the City. Major goals and policies of the Element include:
    ‘ Annual review of the roadway system to identify problems or deficiencies;
    ‘ Establishment of truck routes;
    ‘ Preparation of a five­year capital improvement program, including improvements
        to Gabilan Drive, and the Moranda Road/Front Street intersection;
    ‘ Coordination with Caltrans and Southern Pacific Railroad for improvements;
    ‘ Uniform development of streets, improved LOS;
    ‘ Support alternate transportation, including public transit, bicycles, and
        pedestrians;
    Chapter 4. of the General Plan Background Report provides a more detailed
    discussion of the regulatory framework, existing traffic conditions and other
    information to support the policies and programs of the Circulation Element.
    Circulation Issues
    ‘ Buildout of the General Plan and Specific Plans will significantly increase the
        volume of traffic in the City and require substantial improvements to the City’s
        circulation system.
                                                   V­1

Soledad General Plan                                                                  V. Circulation
       To achieve and maintain a desirable level of service on City streets and
       intersections through buildout of the General Plan, the capacity of a number of
       streets and intersections will need to be significantly increased.
                                           ‘ The freeway interchanges need to be re­
                                               configured to provide more efficient access
                                               to Soledad and more efficient access to
                                               properties at the interchanges.
                                           Soledad is served by two interchanges with US
                                           Highway 101 at the north and south entrances
                                           to the City. In addition to providing vehicular
                                           access from the freeway, the lands surrounding
                                           the interchanges create ideal opportunities for
                                           highway      oriented      retail    and     industrial
                                           development. Consequently, the 1993 General
                                           Plan designates lands surrounding the
                                           interchanges for commercial and industrial
                                           development.         The      interchanges       were
                                           constructed years ago when Soledad was a
                                           small (2,800 residents) service center for the
                                           surrounding          agricultural         operations.
                                           Consequently, the interchanges were not
                                           designed to efficiently accommodate traffic
       volumes associated with the types of urban development anticipated by the 1993
       General Plan.
       For example, southbound traffic using the northerly interchange must travel under
       the overpass and make a sharp left turn to reach the land designated for
       commercial development at the northerly terminus of Moranda Road. The
       overpass configuration creates an isolated piece of commercial land (Bragga
       Islet) between Front Street and the freeway. The southerly interchange is not
       designed to provide efficient access to adjoining and surrounding commercial
       and industrial properties.

                                                           greater weight and size, loaded
       trucks have much less maneuverability and much longer stopping distance which

    ‘ The City has a number of at­grade railroad crossings serving properties west of the
        railroad right­of­way.
        The 1993 Circulation Element identifies the need for two at­grade railroad
        crossings to access the property west of the tracks and designated for
        commercial development. It is unclear whether two crossings will be needed or
        that such crossings can be designed to provide an adequate margin of safety.
    ‘ Truck access to industrial areas east of the Los Coches Industrial Park needs to be
        provided.
        The Land Use Diagram (Figure II­9) designates additional land for additional
        industrial development east of the Los Coches Industrial Park and south of Gabilan
        Drive and east of Bryant Canyon Road. For this industrial land to be viable, an
        additional truck access route will need to be provided to the southern freeway
        interchange and to avoid additional truck traffic through residential
        neighborhoods.
    Regional Setting and Travel Patterns
    Soledad is located in the southern Salinas Valley along Highway 101, one of the three
    main north­south traffic arteries serving central California. Highway 101 connects the
    Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay metropolitan areas following a mostly coastal
    route that travels inland through the Salinas Valley. Access to Soledad is provided by
    two interchanges which serve as the principal north and south entrances to the City.
    Most employed persons in Soledad work out of town, following a daily commute
    pattern that sees traffic leaving town in the morning to travel north on Highway 101 to
    jobs at the Soledad State Prison, the City of Salinas, the Monterey Peninsula and the
    southern Bay Area. Seasonal variation in traffic is most pronounced during the
    summer and fall as a result of vacationers and seasonal farm workers.
    Streets and Highways Serving Soledad
    The local street pattern is illustrated by Figure V­1 which shows a mostly grid system of
    streets serving the older portions of town east of Front Street and the freeway right­of­
    way, and more curvilinear streets within newer residential neighborhoods constructed
    over the past ten years.
    The following street classification scheme is used in Soledad:
    Principal arterials consist of freeways, expressways or other principal roads that
    connect major population centers and other points of traffic generation. Access to
    principal arterials is strictly controlled; they are not intended for local trips. Highway
    101 is the principal arterial serving the City, connecting Soledad with destinations to
    the north and south in the Salinas Valley.

Soledad General Plan                                                                           V. Circulation
    Arterials carry traffic between principal arterials and between population centers, or
    they may carry large volumes of traffic within urban areas. They are not intended to
    provide primary access to residences and are best used for controlled access to
    areas of retail and service commercial uses, industrial facilities and major community
    facilities. Examples of arterials in Soledad include Front Street, Metz Road (Highway
    146), and East Street.
    Collector roads enable traffic to move to and from local roads, arterial roads and
    activity centers. They are principal roads serving residential areas and carry relatively
    high volumes of traffic. Residential driveway access from collector roads should be
    limited according to traffic volumes, parcel sizes and sight distances.
    Local roads are used primarily for access to adjacent properties.

     PRINCIPLE ARTERIALS
     US Highway 101        Divided, four­lane freeway which runs north­south along the coastal portion of
                           California. Highway 101 runs adjacent to Soledad in an north­south direction.
     ARTERIALS
     Metz Road             Otherwise known as Highway 146 and is operated and maintained by Caltrans.
                           Metz is a two­lane roadway which runs east to Pinnacles National Monument and
                           south to King City. Metz Road/Highway 146 is a State designated scenic highway.
     Front Street          Two­lane arterial which runs from Fourth Street to Moranda Road, paralleling
                           Highway 101. Front Street is actually the old alignment of Highway 101.
     East Street           Sized as a collector but functions as a two­lane arterial. East Street is operated by
                           Caltrans because it is a portion of Highway 146.
     North Street          Runs from Main east to the East Street/Andalucia Drive­Metz Road/East Street
                           intersection.
     Main Street           Runs from Front Street to Gabilan Drive three blocks west of East Street/Andalucia
                           Drive.
     Gabilan Drive         A four­lane arterial which extends from Orchard Lane to San Vicente Street.
                           Gabilan is proposed for expansion through to Highway 101 at the northerly
                           interchange.

    Bicycle and Pedestrian Circulation
    The flat topography, relatively low traffic volumes and compact form of the City
    make bicycle riding a viable alternative to the use of automobiles in Soledad. For
    these reasons, bicycle circulation should be encouraged as a non­polluting
    transportation mode for local trips, exercise and recreation.
    Bikeways are classified as follows (see also Appendix D):
        Class I Bike Paths may be either:
            <    Joint­use  facilities  designed  for  shared  pedestrian  and  bicycle  use,  completely  separated  from 
                 vehicles, or 
            <    A  joint­use  facility  in  conjunction  with  a  Class  II  Bike  Lane  where  a  portion  of  the  bikeway  is 
                 separated from vehicles. 
        Class II, Bike Lanes are restricted from vehicle or pedestrian use, except for parking
        and pedestrian crossings.
        A Class III, Bike Route is any other bikeway shared with moving vehicles and/or
        pedestrians.
    Class II bikeways exist throughout the City. Class II bikeways provide a striped lane
    (with a minimum width of 1.5 meters) for one­way bike travel within the paved area of
    a street or highway. Class II bike lanes are within an exclusive right­of­way designated
    for use by bicycles only, except that cross traffic is permitted for driveway access.
    They include a 6­inch solid white stripe separating the bike lane from the traffic lane.
    Pedestrian circulation is also an important component of the transportation network.
    Providing logical              connections between residential neighborhoods and
    neighborhood­serving shopping centers helps reduce traffic and improve air quality.
    Pedestrian trails may be used to connect open space/recreational areas with
    residential neighborhoods, motels and the downtown.
    It may be appropriate to consider ceasing the use of portions of Bryant Canyon Road
    for vehicular access and to utilize Orchard Lane as the primary arterial road in the
    area. This could reduce development and maintenance costs and enable the use of
    Bryant Canyon Road right of way as a pedestrian trail.
                                                                V­8

    Truck Routes
    Truck routes are designed to provide access to areas of the City that utilize truck
    service (principally commercial and industrial areas) and to provide through­truck
    traffic with efficient routes which avoid residential areas and congested streets as
    much as possible. Trucks making local deliveries are allowed to divert from these
    routes to businesses. Streets used for truck routes are designed to support the weight
    of the heavier vehicles and have intersections with sufficient room for turning
    movements. Figure V­2 depicts the existing and proposed truck routes within the City
    of Soledad.
    Parking
    Parking is an important component of urban development that affects land use and
    development patterns, as well as travel behavior. Parking should be provided to
    meet the needs of commercial and other types of businesses, while providing safe
    access for pedestrians and bicyclists. However, parking lots should not dominate new
    development or detract from the character of commercial districts, which may view
    parking as a critical marketing tool.
    The Downtown Specific Plan/Front Street Rehabilitation Plan provides for parking in
    lots owned or operated by the City to serve surrounding commercial businesses.
    Consolidating parking in publicly­owned lots will enable full development of
    downtown commercial properties, without disrupting the pedestrian character of the
    area.
    Providing parking standards in the zoning ordinance that meet the realistic needs of
    development is the best way to ensure the provision of adequate parking in Soledad.
    Public Transit
    Soledad is currently not served by regularly scheduled intra­city public transit.
    However, the Monterey­Salinas Transit system provides regularly scheduled service
    between King City and Salinas with a stop in Soledad. In addition taxi service is
    provided on­demand within the City. Greyhound Bus Lines provides inter­city
    transportation to locations north and south; the bus stops in Soledad four times per
    day.
    Airports
    The closest commercial aviation airports to Soledad are located in Monterey and the
    City of San Jose.
    Transportation Demand Management
    Transportation demand management (TDM) refers to strategies aimed primarily at
    reducing the overall generation of motor vehicle trips. Such strategies encourage
                                               V­9

Soledad General Plan                                                              V. Circulation
    carpooling, transit ridership, bicycling or the use of other modes of travel to stem the
    increase in motor vehicle use, with corresponding improvements to traffic flow and air
    quality. In addition to helping to alleviate congestion and improve air quality, the use
    of TDM strategies is often a cost­effective alternative to expensive roadway
    improvements that may be needed to accommodate new development.

Soledad General Plan                                                           V. Circulation
    Transportation Demand Management strategies are traditionally applied at the trip
    destination, such as the workplace or shopping center, rather than the trip origin.
    With the exception of prison employees, such measures may have limited value until
    the City attracts larger employers and/or creates job centers. However, other
    techniques may be employed to reduce or slow traffic, such as the installation of
    ‘traffic calming’ devices such as speed tables, roundabouts, road humps and pocket
    parks. Neckdowns/bulb­outs should be considered at all intersections to provide
    traffic calming effects on all residential streets and at mid­block with controlled
    crossings where blocks are long between intersections.
    Circulation Diagram
    Figure V­2 is the Circulation Diagram for the City of Soledad. The map describes
    improvements to the circulation system necessary to meet the present and future
    needs of the City in support of the land uses described in the Land Use Element. The
    Circulation Diagram assigns the roadway classifications described above to the
    streets and highways serving the City.
    Appendix C provides typical cross sections for each roadway classification. These
    road sections should not be considered strict standards that must be followed for the
    design of each roadway type. Rather, these should be considered guidelines which
    may vary depending on local conditions. The design of new roadways will be
    determined by the City.

    Circulation Goals, Policies And Programs
                                               Goals
        1. To provide a safe and efficient circulation network to meet the present and
            future needs of the City.
        2. To encourage the use of alternate forms of transportation other than the
            automobile.
        3. To create a pedestrian friendly, walkable community.
                                             Policies 
    Traffic Management
    C­1     Level of Service "D" or better shall generally be maintained on all streets and
            intersections. Lower levels of service may be accepted during peak times or as
            a temporary condition, if improvements to address the problem are
            programmed to be developed. To identify potential impacts of new
            development on traffic service levels, the City shall require the preparation of
            traffic impact analyses generally at the sole expense of the developer for
            developments determined to be large enough to have potentially significant
            traffic impacts.
    C­2     Streets shall be dedicated, widened, extended and constructed in
            accordance with City standards. Dedication and improvements of full rights­
            of­way shall not be required in existing developed areas where the City
            determines such improvements are infeasible or undesirable.                  New
            development shall be responsible for improving a minimum one­half street
            along the outer­boundaries of each subdivision along subdivision property
            where street extensions are identified. Other deviations from these standards
            shall be permitted upon a determination by the City Engineer that safe and
            adequate public access and circulation are preserved by such deviations.
    C­3     The City shall require that roadway rights­of­way be wide enough to
            accommodate the travel lanes needed to carry long­range forecasted traffic
            volumes, as well as any planned bikeways and required drainage, utilities,
            landscaping, and suitable separations.
    C­4     On arterial roadways, intersection spacing shall be maximized. New driveways
            along collector and arterial roadways shall be minimized or prohibited
            completely.
    C­5     The street system in residential neighborhoods shall provide safe and logical
            connections to the existing street pattern, and connectivity to the range of
            complementary land uses within neighborhoods (housing, schools, parks,
            neighborhood shopping, etc.). The use of multiple collector streets shall be
            favored over the use of arterials in new residential subdivisions.

    C­6    The City shall not approve new commercial or industrial development that
           encourages customers, employees or deliveries to use residential streets. The
           circulation system shall be designed so that non­residential traffic (especially
           truck traffic) is confined to non­residential areas.
    C­7    Development on commercial land west of the railroad tracks shall be chosen
           to minimize the volume of traffic utilizing at­grade vehicular railroad crossings.

    C­8    The City shall manage the street network so that the standards presented in
           policies C­1 and C­12. are not exceeded. The City will require new
           development to mitigate the traffic impacts it causes, or the City will limit
           development along streets where congestion levels are unacceptable.
    C­9    New local streets shall be developed consistent with the goals, policies and
           programs of the Land Use Element of the General Plan.
    C­10   Facilities that promote the use of alternate modes of transportation, including
           bicycle lanes, pedestrian and hiking trails, park­and­ride lots and facilities for
           public transit shall be incorporated into new development, and shall be
           encouraged in existing development.
    C­11   The City will continue to support the policies and programs of the Monterey
           County Congestion Management Plan.
    C­12   The following standards apply to the streets shown on Figure V­2. These
           standards may be interpreted with flexibility where necessary to achieve the
           overall objectives of the policies of the General Plan.

    Parking
    C­17   The City shall require the provision of adequate off­street parking in
           conjunction with all new development. Parking shall be located convenient
           to new development and shall be easily accessible from the street. The
           adequacy and appropriateness of parking requirements in the Zoning
           Ordinance shall be periodically evaluated.
    C­18   Parking and storage for recreational vehicles and boats should be provided so
           that required off­street parking is available for passenger vehicles. However,
           RV and boat parking spaces shall not be developed in residential areas.
    C­19   On­street truck parking shall be prohibited where such parking restricts
           adequate sight distances or otherwise poses a potentially hazardous situation.
    Bicycle Circulation
    C­20   The City shall establish a safe and convenient network of identified bicycle
           routes connecting residential areas by the shortest possible routes with
           recreation, shopping, employment areas and schools.               The City shall
           cooperate with surrounding jurisdictions in designing and implementing an
           area­wide bicycle system.
    C­21   Bicycle routes shall emphasize paths separate from vehicle traffic to the
           maximum extent feasible, but shall also include bicycle lanes within public
           streets.
    C­22   Bike lanes and paths shall be designed and maintained to improve bicycling
           safety, and convenience, and encourage people to use bicycles to commute
           to work or school.
    C­23   Bike lanes and paths shall be established when:
           a. The street section is re­paved, re­striped, or changes are made to its cross­
               sectional design.
           b. The street section is being changed as part of a development project.
           c. The construction of bike lanes or paths is called for by the City's Capital
               Improvement Plan.
    C­24   Stop signs shall be minimized along Class I bicycle paths so long as safety for
           bicyclists, pedestrians and motorists is maintained.
    C­25   New development shall provide bike lanes and paths, secure bicycle storage
           and parking facilities.

    C­29    Pedestrian crossings at heavily traveled intersections shall be made as safe as
            possible, utilizing neckdowns/bulb­outs where feasible. Crossing controls shall
            be installed when traffic levels warrant.
    C­30    The City will consider ceasing the use of portions of Bryant Canyon Road for
            vehicular access and to utilize Orchard Lane as the primary arterial road in the
            eastern portion of the City. This could reduce development and maintenance
            costs and enable the use of Bryant Canyon Road right of way as a pedestrian
            trail.
    Transit
    C­31    The City shall work with transit providers to plan and implement additional
            transit services within and to the City that are timely, cost­effective, and

                                             A Vision Of The Future
                 Neighborhood parks and recreation facilities are provided within easy walking
                 distance of every Soledad resident. A regional open space/park has been
                 established with hiking trails in the foothills of the Gabilan Range east of town.
                 The City’s pedestrian circulation system provides ready access to a regional
                 trail/bicycle system established along the Salinas River. Recreation programs
                 for residents of all ages and abilities are thriving throughout the community.
Introduction
Parks and recreation are essential components of a community. Just as a community
must plan for its commercial and residential land uses, it must also plan for its parks
and recreation facilities. Parks provide amenities such as active and passive
recreation areas, a visual contrast to the surrounding developed environment, and
an area for relaxation and enjoyment for all age groups.
Studies have shown that a community's economy is strengthened if it contains high­
quality parks and recreation. Besides providing amenities for the enjoyment of the
local citizenry, parks improve a community’s image which often translates directly
into increased revenues from tourism and an improved climate for businesses and
employers. Communities containing well­developed and attractive park and
recreation facilities are generally considered to have a higher quality of life than
communities that do not.1
Parks and Recreation Issues
‘ New and expanded parks and recreation facilities and programs will be needed
      to meet the needs of Soledad residents anticipated by the General Plan.
      In order to achieve and maintain the desired parks­to­population ratio of at least
      5 acres per 1,000 residents, new and expanded parks and recreational facilities
      will need to be provided. Specific plans prepared for the development of large
      undeveloped areas should incorporate parks and open space amenities.

    ‘ Additional organized recreation programs, and especially programs to meet the
          needs of youths and seniors, are needed.
          Organized recreation programs in Soledad are provided by the YMCA, the Mission
          Soledad Recreation District, and by the schools in addition to private, non­profit
          organizations, such as Little League. However, these programs are intensively
          used and additional facilities and programs will be needed to keep pace with the
          growing population.
    Existing Park and Recreation Facilities
    Soledad currently has approximately 27 acres of land dedicated to open space and
    recreational uses. These consist of public parks and recreational facilities, including a
    little league field and indoor swimming pool. Based on an estimated January 2004
    population of 13,000 there are approximately 2.0 acres of parkland per 1,000 Soledad
    residents. Nearby regional parks and open space areas include Mission Nuestra
    Senora de la Soledad, Pinnacles National Monument and the Arroyo Seco area.
    Figure VI­1 shows the public parks and recreation facilities in Soledad.
    Soledad’s Parkland Needs
    A desired ratio of parkland to population is one acre per 200­250 residents, or 4 to 5
    acres per 1000 residents. To achieve the a ratio of 4 acres per 1000 residents for a
    total (prison and non­prison) at buildout, an additional 260 acres of developed
    parkland will be needed.
    Types of Parks
    The following are descriptions of the various types of parks that may be developed in
    Soledad, or developed near the City in cooperation with other jurisdictions.
    Linear Park. A linear park is often developed along natural or human­made corridors,
    such as creeks, drainage facilities or roads. The size of a linear park may vary, but
    should be of sufficient width to protect sensitive resources and to accommodate a
    pedestrian and/or bicycle trail. Facilities provided with linear parks are usually limited
    to seating, picnic tables, and in some instances, a tot­lot and par course. (See Figure
    VI­2)
    Pocket Park Or Mini­Park. A pocket park is a small facility designed to serve a limited
    population or group (such as seniors or small children) within about a one­quarter mile
    radius. Such parks are typically between 0.25 to 2 acres in size and provide limited
    amenities that may include play equipment, seating, picnic areas, and landscaping.
    Neighborhood Park. Neighborhood parks serve primarily one neighborhood and
    provide active and passive facilities for all age groups. Such parks may range in size
    of 2 to 15 acres and generally provide open turf areas, picnic areas, play equipment,
    multi­use game courts, drinking fountains, restrooms, parking and landscaping.
    Neighborhood parks serve an area within one­quarter to one­half mile of the site.
                                                VI­2

Soledad General Plan                                                    VI. Parks and Recreation
    Community Parks. A community park serves multiple neighborhoods or an entire
    community. These parks are usually developed on large sites (15 to 30 acres) and
    provide a wide range of facilities and activities such as larger play areas for children,
    picnic areas, play fields and courts (tennis, basketball, baseball, etc.), and open turf
    areas, as well as parking, lighting, landscaping and restrooms.
    Regional Parks. Regional parks serve multiple communities and provide larger
    facilities and amenities on sites ranging in size from 100 to 200 acres. Regional parks
    may provide large open areas, group picnic facilities, trails, campgrounds, sports
    fields, a golf course, courts for tennis and volleyball, and other amenities such as
    parking, landscaping and restrooms. The communities served by a regional park
    should be within one hour driving distance, and may be subject to user fees. The
    Draft Monterey County General Plan proposes to locate a regional park near
    Soledad between the existing city limits and the Los Coches Adobe near the
    confluence of the Salinas River and Arroyo Seco.
    Recreation
    Recreation consists of leisure or sport activities performed for entertainment or
    personal satisfaction. Within a community, recreation may be provided by public
    and private entities. Health clubs, dance studios, skating rinks, bowling alleys and
    local theaters are all examples of private recreation. Indoor and outdoor recreation
    provided on public parkland, at a community center, or a municipal golf course are
    all examples of public recreation. Public recreation facilities are either located on
    public land or available to the public through a government sponsored joint use
    agreement.

                                             Policies 
    Parks
    PR­1.  The City will acquire future park and recreation land and facilities by:
           a. Requiring park dedications from future residential subdivisions at the rate of
               three acres per 1,000 population anticipated in the project;
           b. Requiring payment of a park impact fee, or requiring the dedication of
               land and improvements in­lieu of fees, from all new development;
           c. Cooperating with Monterey County to acquire land for a new regional
               park in the Soledad planning area;
           d. Acquiring parkland near existing or potential public park or recreation sites,
               or near quasi­ public or private sites that have a good opportunity for a
               joint use agreement.        Acquired parkland should be contiguous to
               proposed or existing park and recreation facilities or provide a logical
               connection.
           e. Pursuing joint use agreements with public and private schools, other public
               government agencies, private park and recreation providers, and
               institutions with potential parkland to make existing or proposed park and
               recreation facilities available to the community on an extended basis.
    PR­2.  The City will pursue the development of parks, open space and trails in areas
           subject to natural or human caused hazards such as natural or developed
           flood channels, hillsides and sensitive resource areas.

Soledad General Plan                                                      VI. Parks and Recreation
    PR­3   The City will support the development of a regional park within its planning
           area. One potential location is south of the City in the vicinity of the
           confluence of the Salinas River and Arroyo Seco near the Los Coches Adobe.
           Such a location would also afford opportunities for preservation of the adobe
           through its incorporation into the park. Another potential regional park
           location lies within the foothills of the Gabilan Range where the General Plan
           designates areas of open space and trails.
    Recreation
    PR­4.  The City will work with the YMCA, the Soledad Mission Recreation District, the
           Soledad Unified School District, Monterey County and other agencies (public
           and private) to expand Soledad's recreation facilities and programs. The City
           should provide youth, adult and senior programs for City residents, with special
           emphasis on youth programs.
    PR­5.  The City will encourage the development of private recreation facilities,
           including a Boys and Girl’s Club or similar youth oriented facility.
    PR­6.  The City will strive to develop a balanced recreation program that provides
           activities for all age groups.
    PR­7.  The City will pursue joint use agreements to augment its park and recreation
           facilities and programs.
    PR­8.  The City will develop a program for the participation of private enterprise in
           the development and maintenance of parks and recreation facilities.
    PR­9.  As recreation facilities become available, the City will develop a community
           recreation program. The recreation program shall include youth/teen, adult
           and senior programs. Generally programs for which there is a large demand
           should be provided; however, the more specialized a recreation program, the
           more financially self­supporting it should become.
    Trails
    PR­10. The City should provide a pedestrian network within the City Limits. The system
           should:
           a. Accommodate pedestrians and bicycles.
           b. Connect residential neighborhoods with: 1) Soledad's downtown, 2)
               schools, 3) City park and recreation facilities, and 4) regional trails.
    PR­11. The City will work with other Salinas Valley communities, the Association of
           Governments, the Soledad Union School District, and Monterey County to
           provide regional trail connections throughout the Salinas Valley.

    Acquisition and Development
    PR­12. The City will:
           a. Provide parkland that can accommodate needed recreation.
           b. Adequately plan for park and recreation acquisitions/dedications. Some
               land may be acquired and left undeveloped (as open space) or leased to
               a private agency for an interim period until park or recreation funds
               become available.
           c. Accept park and/or recreation donations or dedications (in fee or
               easement) if said action will provide viable park and/or recreation
               resources. Donations and dedications should be consistent with the
               guidelines in Table VI­1.
           d. Acquire park and/or recreation lands or facilities (including trails) when
               money and resources (such as land) are available. City acquisitions should
               be consistent with the guidelines in Table VI­1. Trail corridors may also be
               obtained 1) when negotiating new or improved public works easements
               (such as road, sewer or water easements), and 2) with new public or
               private development.
           e. Generally obtain fee ownership for land: 1) that may require or have
               frequent public access to the site or through the site, 2) for which buying
               the development rights is almost as expensive as obtaining the land in fee,
               3) which contains sensitive habitat requiring monitoring and enforcement,
               or 4) on which enforcing an easement will be difficult or costly.
           f.  Obtain an easement or development rights: 1) for lands on which
               continuation of the underlying private use is compatible with its
               designation in this General Plan and direct management by the City is not
               required, 2) to protect viewsheds or scenic resources that involve little or no
               public access, or 3) where the cost of development rights is substantially
               less than fee ownership.

Soledad General Plan                                                                                 VI. Parks and Recreation
    PR­13 The City shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) a park plan for each City
            park or individual recreation site prior to development. Plans should be
            general enough to allow some alterations over the life of the plan. Park plans
            shall comply with applicable provisions of the City Zoning Ordinance, and
            shall generally include:
            a. A site plan. The site plan shall depict the entire project site, neighboring
                  properties, the size of the parcel(s) comprising the site and proposed
                  structures/facilities, topographic contours, and any structures/facilities that
                  will be removed. Facilities depicted on the plan shall include recreation
                  as well as support facilities, such as parking, restrooms, signs, and staging
                  areas.
            b. A grading plan. The grading plan shall show existing topography and
                  proposed grades, and the amount of cut and fill required for project
                  completion.
            c. Building elevations. Drawings should be provided that illustrate what the
                  proposed facilities and structures will look like once developed. Details,
                  such as building height, colors and construction materials of
                  facilities/structures, should be indicated. North, south, east and west
                  elevations of facilities/structures shall be provided. The design of such
                  structures shall comply with all applicable provisions of the City Zoning
                  Ordinance and Community Design Guidelines.
            d. A landscape and irrigation plan. This plan shall indicate proposed
                  landscaping, existing landscaping that will remain, plants to be removed,
                  and proposed irrigation. Landscape plans shall emphasize native
                  vegetation. In or adjacent to natural areas use of native vegetation shall
                  be encouraged and invasive non­natives shall be discouraged. Water
                  conservation and limited maintenance shall be emphasized.
            e. A written statement addressing education or cultural facilities the site will
                  provide, future maintenance responsibilities, public safety, nuisance issues,
                  facility aesthetics, and resource protection.
    PR­14 Parks shall be designed to accommodate various age groups and abilities.
            An individual park or recreation facility does not need to be accessible to all
            age groups or abilities; however, Soledad’s overall park and recreation
            system shall meet the special needs of the City's population.
    PR­15 Parks shall include adequate support facilities such as parking and restrooms.
    PR­16 Parks shall be designed to be compatible with the neighborhoods in which
            they are located, and shall provide security and privacy to adjoining
            properties. Where necessary, buffers shall be provided between park and
            recreation lands and adjacent development to provide privacy and a
            physical separation between uses.2 
       2 
          Buffers may include setbacks, landscaping, fencing, and/or dramatic breaks or changes in topography.

Soledad General Plan                                                    VI. Parks and Recreation
    Management
    PR­17 The City will promote community involvement in park and recreation facilities
           and programs by:
           a. Periodically using surveys and other methods to evaluate City parks and
                recreation lands, programs, and facilities. Surveys should ascertain the
                degree of facility/program use, public preferences, and needed
                changes.
           b. Involving the community in park and recreation planning, development,
                and maintenance. Workshops may be conducted at the planning stage
                to gain community input regarding needed facilities and community
                concerns. Special needs groups (such as teens) will also be included in
                the planning and design phase of projects.
    PR­18 At the design stage, park and recreation design competitions may be used
           to heighten community involvement and interests in parks.
    PR­19 ‘Adopt­a­park’ and ‘park­watch’ programs may be used to gain community
           involvement and to provide needed maintenance and security.
    PR­20 The community will be made aware of park and recreation projects and
           resources by way of public notices, newsletters or other means. For example,
           a newsletter can be used to record park and recreation accomplishments,
           needs, upcoming projects, and to thank persons or organizations for their
           help. Encouraging community events in local parks can augment community
           appreciation of existing facilities.
    PR­21. A current record of all park, recreation and open space holdings (by fee and
           easement) shall be kept by the City and shall be available for public
           information.
    PR­22 The City will protect parkland and individual recreation sites by designating
           public park and recreation areas in the City's General Plan and on zoning
           maps.
    PR­23 Public or private development adjacent to existing or proposed park and
           recreation sites shall be required to locate such development consistent with
           this Element unless there is no practicable alternative.
    PR­24. New development shall be required to add to proposed or existing park and
           recreation projects where legally feasible. Public or private development
           shall provide, as appropriate and legally feasible: 1) a buffer between
           proposed development and existing park, recreation and/or open space
           parcels to minimize conflicts between development and existing facilities;
           and 2) gates, fences, or other deterrents when such facilities are deemed
           necessary to discourage prohibited or non­compatible uses from entering
           park, recreation or open space lands.
    PR­25. New development shall not adversely impact adjacent park, recreation or
           open space lands.

Soledad General Plan                                                                                  VI. Parks and Recreation
    PR­26 The construction of new public or private roads through City park and
             recreation areas shall be discouraged. In general, public or private roads
             shall avoid going through existing or proposed park and recreation parcels
             unless the road's construction would provide needed access to park and/or
             recreation facilities presently under served.
    PR­27. The expansion of adjacent private property uses onto park and recreation
             lands shall be prohibited unless such an encroachment benefits the public
             and is consistent with the designation of the land as parks or recreation. All
             encroachments must be approved by the City Council.
    PR­28. The City will manage park and recreation facilities and programs by working
             to develop a stable funding source(s) for park and recreation activities.
             Maintenance assessment districts shall be formed to provide funding.
    PR­29. The City will allow the following uses and areas on public parkland, subject to
             an approved or amended park plan:3
             a. Active public recreation. Active recreation includes activities or facilities
                   typical of urban parks, including play fields (such as soccer or softball), a
                   swimming pool, tennis courts, picnic areas (group and individual), golf
                   courses and golf­related facilities, basketball courts, a skateboard park,
                   community centers, and similar facilities.
             b. Passive public recreation. Passive recreation includes low­intensity
                   activities such as bird watching, nature photography, nature study, and
                   similar uses. Within a passive area of a park, facilities may include trails
                   (paved or dirt), individual picnic tables, benches, viewing platforms,
                   interpretive areas, and similar uses depending on the sensitivity of the
                   resource area.
             c. Open space areas. An open space area is land or water which remains
                   in a predominantly natural or undeveloped state. Such lands protect and
                   preserve the community's natural and historical resources, define the
                   urban boundary, and provide visual and physical relief from urban
                   development. Open space may consist of small portions of a parcel or
                   large tracts of land. Such lands may include creeks, marshes, watershed,
                   and floodplains; scenic resources; plant and animal habitat; cultural
                   resources; passive recreation areas and dual uses such as storm water
                   retention facilities constructed to enhance maximum use and aesthetics.
             d. Landscaped areas, including turf for play, as a buffer between adjacent
                   uses, and for aesthetic quality.
             e. Public art and education programs (including interpretive displays).
             f.    Community gardens, botanic gardens, or nurseries.4 
       3 
          An individual park may contain more than one of these uses or a combination of these uses. 
       4 
          Only public nurseries are allowed that are used for restocking parks, open space and other public areas.

Soledad General Plan                                                       VI. Parks and Recreation
           g. Nature study, resource conservation and/or restoration.
           h. Park accessory facilities (such as parking lots, access roads, storage sheds
              for park or recreation equipment or facilities, and restrooms). Unrelated
              public facilities such as water wells, storage tanks and similar facilities may
              be located in public parks only when useable park area is not diminished
              and where found to be aesthetically compatible. Dual use facilities such
              as storm water retention shall be allowed if the construction complements
              park uses and minimizes impacts during high park use periods.
           i. Area for private vendors, concessions, and/or community events. The
              park system may include small areas for private vendors (such as a hot
              dog stand, popcorn stand, etc.) and areas for community events such as
              farmers market, festivals, etc.). In general, each park shall have a limited
              number of private vendors and community events it may sponsor at any
              one time. Private vendors, concessionaires, and community organizations
              should pay a fee for use of park facilities/lands.
           j. Other public, private or quasi public recreation facility located on public
              parkland through a joint use agreement.
           k. Similar uses to those enumerated above which the City Council
              determines are appropriate and beneficial public uses within a park.
    PR­30 The City shall support the establishment of a County regional park within the
           Soledad Planning Area as a means of providing passive recreation with hiking
           and equestrian trails. Sites suitable for such a facility include the foothills of the
           Gabilan Range or the Los Coches Adobe property.
    Funding
    PR­31 The City will use an array of funding mechanisms to finance park and
           recreation facilities and programs. These sources may change over time as
           park and recreation needs change.
    PR­32 The City will pursue the following financing options as a first priority:
           a. Acquire parkland through subdivisions and through the collection of park
              and recreation impact fees.
           b. Private donations of lands, funds and equipment. This may be
              accomplished by providing information to landowners regarding the
              general tax advantages of donating land or facilities to nonprofit
              organizations and agencies, and the market value of conservation
              easements. Community organizations will be encouraged to help finance
              projects through maintenance or monetary donations.
           c. Federal, State and local grants. Grants, when available, shall help
              finance park, recreation and/or open space land or facility acquisitions,
              development, and maintenance.

           d. Joint use agreements and joint ventures. The City will work with Monterey
               County, the State, land trusts, local school districts, community
               organizations, and private individuals to augment the City's options for
               park and recreation acquisition, development and maintenance.
    PR­33 New development shall be required where legally feasible to provide its fair
           share of public park and recreation opportunities. New development within
           the City shall be required to provide park and recreation lands or facilities
           consistent with this Element. Conditions placed on new development shall be
           reasonable and consistent with the nature and extent of such development
           plans. The City shall require the dedication and improvement of park land
           even in circumstances where the total cost to improve such parkland
           exceeds the value of the corresponding development impact fee.
    PR­34. The City may charge fees for certain City park and recreation programs.
           Where allowed by law, fees shall differentiate between residents and non­
           residents, with non­residents paying a slightly larger fee. A portion of park
           maintenance costs shall be provided through park fees. For example, some
           maintenance costs can be provided through fees for group picnic areas,
           sport field uses, rent of community center rooms for private functions such as
           weddings.
    PR­35 The City should establish a goal of funding at least 80% of its recreation
           programs through program fees.
    PR­36 The City shall encourage fundraising events to help pay for parks and
           recreation facilities and programs.
    PR­37 The City will pursue other long­term financing sources when such sources will
           provide viable park and recreation opportunities to Soledad residents at a
           reasonable cost.
    PR­38 The City will work independently or jointly with another agency (such as a
           land trust) to create a park and recreation non­profit foundation. Establishing
           such a non­profit will enable the City to jointly file grant applications under a
           501(c) tax status and allow persons to donate land or facilities to a non­profit
           agency.
    PR­39 The City will require the establishment of maintenance assessment districts to
           fund park and roadway landscaping maintenance. Users from areas outside
           of special benefit areas shall be required to pay user fees while those paying
           assessments shall not be required to pay such fees.
                                          Programs
    6.1    The City will pursue joint use agreements to augment Soledad's park and

     VII. Public Services and Facilities
           A Vision Of The Future
           The City provides the range of public services that Soledad residents expect at
           an equitable cost. Thanks to the City’s far­sightedness, the financing scheme
           implemented in 2002 has led to the timely expansion of infrastructure capacity
           to serve new development, with new development paying its fair share.
Introduction
As the City continues to grow in accordance with the General Plan, services will
need to be increased to accommodate the additional population. The Public
Services and Facilities Element establishes goals, policies and programs to insure that
the provision of public services and facilities keeps pace with new development,
and that present infrastructure inadequacies are remedied. This element also
identifies public facilities desired by the residents of Soledad, and discusses strategies
to help pay for needed improvements over the time frame of the Plan.
The City of Soledad is a full service city and provides water supply, wastewater
collection and treatment and solid waste collection, police protection, and fire
protection. The locations of all major city facilities are shown on Figure VII­1.
Information regarding the City’s public services, including water supply; wastewater
collection and treatment; storm drainage and flooding; police and fire protection;
solid waste, schools; health care; and others, is provided in Chapter 6. of the General
Plan Background Report.
Public Services Issues
‘ Water, sewer service and storm drainage capacity will need to be expanded to
    accommodate buildout of the General Plan.
    Buildout of the General Plan will require a substantial increase in water supply,
    expansion of wastewater treatment capacity, and the extension of infrastructure
    to areas presently not served. The wastewater treatment plant is nearing
    capacity and in need of expansion, a condition exacerbated by seasonal
    wastewater flows from water intensive agricultural and/or industrial operations
    and existing storm water flows which reduce percolation capacity during the
    winter.
                                               VII­1

Soledad General Plan                                          VII. Public Services and Facilities
       Water supply systems, namely municipal water wells, are taxed during the dry
       season with some existing wells exhibiting evidence of reduced production.
       Water storage facilities could also be taxed beyond current storage capacity
       due to a combination of reduced sources, higher water use and fire fighting
       demand.
       Better street lighting, road maintenance, storm drainage, curbs, gutters and
       crosswalks are needed in the older parts of town. Sidewalks and handicap
       access ramps have been added.
    ‘ To accommodate significant development of agricultural processing facilities, a
       separate wastewater system or pre­treatment system may be needed.
       The processing of agricultural products is often water­ and wastewater­intensive,
       which can reduce treatment plant capacity during peak operations. To
       accommodate additional agricultural processing businesses, as well as the
       continued development of the other land uses recommended by the General
       Plan, a separate treatment or pre­treatment system for agricultural processing
       may be needed.
    ‘ Funding is necessary for public services improvements and desirable new
       facilities.
       New development is expected to pay its fair share for the cost of providing
       additional services. However, the cost of upgrading, expanding and maintaining
       public facilities that serve existing residents must be borne by the existing
       residents. Moreover, funding must be provided for the ongoing cost of
       maintenance and repair. Current Public Works department staffing and
       equipment is inadequate to properly maintain existing infrastructure.
    ‘ Police and Fire Department officials have expressed concern about emergency
       response times not within preferred standards (less than 5 minutes) in the north
       end of town. This concern will grow as the city expands to the north farther away
       from existing facilities.
       Policies of the General Plan need to address the timely improvement of police
       and fire protection services.
    ‘  Some schools in Soledad are at or over maximum capacity due to a growing
       population and a lack of facilities.
       Although a number of new schools have been constructed over the past five
       years (such as the new High School, and the Rose Ferrero and Frank Ledesma
       Elementary Schools), the funding and construction of school facilities must occur
       concurrently or in advance of new residential development.

    1. To provide the level of public services desired by the residents at an equitable
        cost.
    2. To ensure the provision of public services keeps pace with new development.
    3. To ensure increased maintenance funding/staffing/equipment requirements

                                              Policies 
    Services and Facilities
    S­1     The City shall ensure through the development review process that adequate
            public facilities and services are available to serve new development. New
            development shall not be allowed until adequate public services and
            facilities to serve such development are provided. Where existing facilities
            are inadequate, new development may only be approved when the
            following conditions are met:
            a. The developer and/or City can demonstrate that all necessary public
                facilities will be adequately financed and installed in time (through fees or
                other means); and
            b. The facilities improvements are consistent with applicable facility plans
                approved by the City or other agencies in which the City is a participant.
    S­2     The City shall plan for the expansion of needed water and sewer
            infrastructure including, but not limited to, the expansion of water production,
            storage and distribution facilities, the expansion of wastewater collection and
            treatment capacity, and storm drainage facility expansion.
    S­3     Public facilities, such as wells, pumps, tanks, and yards shall be located and
            designed so that noise, light, odors, and appearances do not adversely
            affect nearby land uses.
    Funding
    S­4     Where new development requires the construction of new public facilities,
            the new development shall pay its fair share of the construction. Where
            necessary, the City shall require the dedication of land within newly
            developing areas for public facilities.
    S­5     The City shall require that new development pay its fair share of the cost of all
            existing facilities it uses based on the demand for these facilities attributable
                                                VII­4

           to the new development; exceptions may be made when new development
           provides alternative sources of funding or equipment to offset any shortfall in
           revenues.
    S­6    When adopting, amending and imposing fees and developer exactions, the
           City shall consider the effects of such fees and exactions on project
           economics and the City’s development goals.
    S­7    User fees will be charged to recover the costs of City­provided services,
           except when administration of such fees makes them not cost effective, or
           when fees are waived or reduced to explicitly promote some other public
           benefit, or other long­term sources of funding have been established.
    Water
    S­8    The City shall promote the efficient use of water and reduced water demand
           by:
           a. Requiring water­conserving design and equipment in new construction;
           b. Encouraging water­conserving landscaping and other conservation
                measures;
           c. Encouraging the retrofitting of existing fixtures with water­conserving
                fixtures;
    S­9    The City will explore the potential for use of reclaimed water for landscape
           irrigation or other appropriate use.
    S­10   The City will manage the increase in water demand from new development
           to help insure groundwater resources are not overdrafted. The City will work
           with Monterey County and public and private water entities to plan for the
           efficient, long term management of groundwater resources.
    S­11   Gravity flow for sewer and water service shall be employed wherever
           feasible.
    Drainage
    S­12   The City shall encourage the use of natural drainage systems where feasible
           to preserve and enhance natural features.
    S­13   The City shall support efforts to acquire land or obtain easements for drainage
           and other public uses of flood channels where it is desirable to maintain
           channels in a natural state.
    S­14   The City shall strive to improve the quality of urban stormwater runoff and
           quality of groundwater recharge through the use of appropriate mitigation
           measures including, but not limited to, infiltration/sedimentation basins, oil/grit
           separators, and other management practices, including storm water
           retention.
    S­15   The City shall require new development to adequately mitigate increases in
           stormwater peak flows and/or volume. Mitigation measures shall take into
                                               VII­5

           recharge related to existing and proposed water wells.
    S­16   The City shall encourage project designs that minimize drainage
           concentrations and impervious coverage and maintain, to the extent
           feasible, natural site drainage conditions. Drainage onto adjacent properties
           shall be restricted to pre­project levels minus any runoff from the area to be
           developed.
    S­17   The City shall require projects to allocate land as necessary for the purpose of
           retaining flows and/or for the incorporation of mitigation measures for water
           quality and supply impacts related to urban runoff.

           addressed and roadway function is not reduced, including provisions for off
           street student drop­off/pick up.
    S­22   The City will work closely with the school district to secure adequate funding
           for new school facilities, and where legally feasible, shall provide a
           mechanism which requires development projects to mitigate the cost of
           providing school facilities needed to serve such development, consistent with
           relevant provisions of State law.
    S­23   The City, to the extent feasible, shall ensure that new school facilities are

                                           Natural Resources
The area surrounding Soledad possesses diverse natural resources that include rich
agricultural soils and scenic hillsides and vistas. These natural and human­made
resources help shape the City’s identity and play an important role in the quality of
life. The General Plan must provide guidance for the protection and conservation of
these valuable resources.

                        Open Space
            A Vision Of The Future
          The City of Soledad is an attractive small city well separated from neighboring
          communities by open space and agricultural areas. The most productive
          agricultural land surrounding the City has been permanently preserved. The
          City’s support of efforts by conservation organizations have helped protect and
          preserve sensitive resources along the Salinas River and elsewhere in the
          region. The Los Coches adobe has been fully restored and the adjoining land
          developed as a visitor­serving attraction. Development in the eastern portion
          of the City has protected views of the hills and views from the hills across the
          Salinas Valley.
Introduction
The Conservation and Open Space Elements are combined into one element that
provides policies and programs to protect and preserve the natural resources in and
around Soledad, including agricultural lands, hillsides and scenic areas, and
undeveloped natural areas.
Chapter 5. of the General Plan Background Report provides an overview of natural,
cultural and open space resources that occur within the City’s planning area.
Conservation/Open Space Issues
‘ The soil in and around Soledad is considered “Prime Agricultural Land” with very
    few exceptions. This is a resource of local, regional and even national
    importance. As the City expands outward, it is essential that agricultural land not
    needed for urban development is protected.
    The higher quality agricultural soils are located closer to the Valley floor along the
    floodplain of the Salinas River; higher elevations possess less productive soils.
    Although these areas may still have productive soils when compared to other
    areas of California, slope and the availability of irrigation water may limit
    agricultural productivity. Regardless, land within the City’s planning area not
    required for urban development should be preserved for continuing agricultural
    operations.

Soledad General Plan                                          VIII. Conservation/Open Space
‘ Continued development of the City will contribute to the incremental area­wide
    deterioration of air quality.
    The increase in population and the level of additional development anticipated
    by the General Plan will increase the volume of vehicle traffic on local roads, with
    a corresponding increase in emissions. The increase in emissions associated with
    buildout of the General Plan could hinder efforts to achieve federal and State air
    quality standards.
‘ Development of the undisturbed (un­farmed) areas within and surrounding
    Soledad could result in the incremental loss of valuable habitat for native plants
    and animals.
    Portions of the City’s planning area, especially along the Salinas River and areas
    to the east within the foothills of the Gabilan range, may contain habitat for
    special status plant and animal species. As the City contemplates outward
    expansion, these resources should be identified and preserved, where feasible.
    This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to,
    preparing site­specific analyses of proposed development sites and limiting
    development in areas where other mitigation would not be feasible.
‘ New development could uncover or damage previously undiscovered artifacts
    of cultural and/or historical importance.
    Native peoples were known to inhabit the Soledad area. Although the only
    archaeological site identified within the City is at the Los Coches Adobe,
    previously unknown sites could be discovered during construction activities as the
    City continues to develop in accordance with the General Plan.
‘ Views from the City and within the City are a valuable resource that should be
    preserved.
    The eastern portion of the City lies on the upper slopes of the Salinas Valley and
    affords panoramic views of the Valley floor and the Coast Ranges to the west.
    As the City expands onto less productive agricultural soils to the east, it is
    important to take advantage of, and preserve, views afforded from these areas.
Agricultural Resources
Monterey County is one of the primary agricultural regions in the State of California.
Over 1.3 million acres (approximately 62% of the total land in the county) are used
for various agricultural purposes, of which over 225,000 acres (17 %) are assessed
some level of importance for their agricultural productivity. The total value of
agricultural products produced in Monterey County in 1999 was nearly $2.5 billion;
the total value has been increasing steadily in real dollars (accounting for inflation)
since 1989. Head lettuce is the number one cash crop, with gross production
totaling over $359 million (M) in 1998, and $423M in 1999.

Monterey County is also experiencing growth in its cities and residential communities,
which places pressure on agricultural lands. In recent years, agricultural land in
desirable areas has been converted to residential and other non­agricultural uses.
To help illustrate this trend, data from the State Farmland Mapping and Monitoring
Program (FMMP) for the years 1992­1996 are compared on Table VIII­1 for the
conversion of prime agricultural land to developed land.
                                         Table VIII­1

Table VIII­1 shows that, although the total acreage of prime agricultural land in
Monterey County may be declining overall, the loss is at least partially mitigated by
the conversion of non­prime lands to prime. The additional prime land is attributable
to a number of factors, such as:
‘ The application of irrigation to lands previously not irrigated or farmed;
‘ The conversion of grazing land to wine grape vineyards;
‘ The re­classification of soils previously thought to be of lesser suitability.
Of the three factors listed above, growth in prime agricultural lands in Monterey
County is primarily attributable to the proliferation of wine grapes. The acreage
devoted to wine grapes has grown steadily during the 1990s and is projected to
continue as the market for premium wines continues to expand. The acreage
devoted to wine grapes has risen steadily from 36,000 acres in 1997 to 41,400 acres in
1999; grapes are now the fifth most valuable crop harvested in Monterey County.
Approximately 99 percent of the gains in prime farmland in 1996 were attributable to
vineyard development.

Views of the surrounding vineyards and the Valley floor are impressive from the
foothills of the Gabilan Range and the higher elevations within the developed city.
The higher vantage points afford nearly unobstructed panoramas of the Salinas
Valley and the Sierra de Salinas Range to the west.
When approaching the City from either the north or south on Highway 101, the most
prominent view of the City is the commercial businesses along the east side of Front
Street which form a nearly solid facade when viewed from the west. The freeway
interchanges serving the City are important visual gateways that provide visitors with
their first impressions of the form and character of the community.
Air Quality
The City of Soledad is located within the North Central Coast Air Basin (NCCAB),
which includes Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Benito Counties. Federal, State, and
regional authorities regulate air quality in the NCCAB. The EPA is involved in local air
quality planning through the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA). At the State level, the
Lewis­Presley Air Quality Management Act and the California Clean Air Act of 1988
set air quality planning and regulatory responsibilities for the NCCAB. California Air
Resources Board (ARB) is charged with the responsibility for coordinating efforts to
attain and maintain ambient air quality standards and conducting research into the
causes of, and solutions to, air pollution problems.
Monterey Bay Region 2000 Air Quality Management Plan
The most recent Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) was adopted by the
Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District (MBUAPCD) in 2000 to satisfy the
requirements of the Clean Air Act as described above. The NCCB does not meet
the State Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone or inhalable particulate matter
(PM 10).The health based State ozone standard is exceeded when ozone levels
exceed 0.09 parts per million during a one hour period. From 1997 to 2000 the State
ozone standard was exceeded on 21 days for a total of 40 hours. Air monitoring data
for 2000 show that the District meets the criteria for a nonattainment­transitional area
having had less than three exceedances of the State ozone standard at any one air
monitoring station. While the classification of nonattainment/transitional is by
operation of law, the Air Resources Board does not recognize the designation until it
has validated the data.
The California Clean Air Act of 1988 required preparation of a 1991 plan showing
how the State ozone standard would be met with subsequent updates every three
years. The 2000 is the third update to the 1991 Air Quality Management Plan for the
Monterey Bay Region (AQMP). Attainment of the PM10 standard is addressed in the
"1998 Report on Attainment of the California Particulate Matter Standards in the
Monterey Bay Region."
The 2000 AQMP includes:
‘ Current air quality data and analysis of air quality trends
‘ Revised emission inventory and emission forecasts
‘ Description of the District's photochemical modeling results
‘ Updated analysis of emission reductions needed to meet and maintain the State
    ozone standard

‘ Recommended adoption of three control measures
Biological Resources
Although native vegetation on the valley floor has been substantially altered, the
extent of agricultural fields and the presence of large tracts of undeveloped land in
and around the City of Soledad contribute to a diverse assemblage of resident and
migrant wildlife species. Habitat types of particular importance to wildlife include
any native grasslands and any vegetated areas along the Salinas River and the
foothills of the Gabilan Range east of the City. Depending on the crop type and
management practices, the agricultural fields can provide important foraging
opportunities for some species of wildlife. Remnant native trees and areas of dense
landscaping in urbanized areas can also support a variety of wildlife species.
Riparian communities and native grassland that occur within the City’s planning
area are considered to have a high inventory priority with the California Natural
Diversity Database. These communities have been designated as sensitive due to
rarity and continuing loss as a result of development, flood control improvements,
and other factors.

Energy Production and Conservation
Deregulation of the utilities industry in 1996 has resulted in a dysfunctional energy
market and rising wholesale energy prices in California. On January 17, 2001,
Governor Davis proclaimed a State of Emergency in California due to an electrical
energy shortage. The State is attempting to stabilize the utilities industry by allowing
increased production and encouraging conservation. The state offers a wide variety
of rebates and incentives to help businesses, agricultural users and consumers
reduce their electricity use. At the local level, energy conservation and efficiency
can be encouraged in new and existing structures through design, insulation, and
weatherization.
Archaeological, Cultural and Historical Resources
Chapter 5. of the General Plan Background Report provides an overview of the
major periods of history in the central Salinas Valley and the settlement of Soledad.
Native American archaeological sites in the Salinas Valley tend to be situated at the
base of hills and on the valley floor near sources of water. The only source of
constant flowing water is the Salinas River. Consequently, there is low potential for
identifying Native American cultural resources within most areas of the City’s sphere
of influence.
An archival search of maps, records and literature on file at the Northwestern
Information Center of California Archaeological Site Inventory was conducted and
given the file number 98­423 in 1999 for the Miravale Partnership­Hambey Property
Environmental Impact Report. A search of State records was conducted to
ascertain if any archaeological sites or surveys existed within one­half mile of the
project site and if any cultural resources were listed on inventories. The search
findings revealed there was no recorded Native American or historic cultural
resources listed with the Historic Resources Information System.
Conservation/Open Space Goals, Policies And Programs
    Goals
1. To protect the City's natural, cultural, visual and historical resources.
2. To provide open space and rural lands that meet the needs of present and
    future City populations.
3. To protect resources (such as valuable agricultural lands), and be sensitive to the
    factors which allow these resources to remain viable.
5. To provide for passive recreation on areas kept open (such as along the river)
    where such low intensity uses will not damage the resources that are being
    protected.

                                         Policies 
Agricultural Resources
C/OS­1     The City shall discourage “leapfrog” development and development in
           peninsulas extending into agricultural lands to avoid adverse effects on
           agricultural operations.
C/OS­2     The City shall retain the agricultural land use designation on lands within its
           planning area until the land is needed for urban development.
C/OS­3     The City shall ensure that new development and public infrastructure
           projects do not encourage expansion of urban uses outside the general
           plan area into areas designated Agriculture by the Monterey County
           General Plan.
C/OS­4     The City shall support the agricultural economy by encouraging the
           location of agricultural support industries in the City, establishing and
           promoting marketing of local farm products, and providing its regional fair
           share of adequate housing to meet the needs of agricultural labor.
C/OS­5     The City shall require a right­to­farm condition to all future subdivision
           maps adjacent to farmlands.
C/OS­6     The City shall require development within or adjacent to designated
           agricultural areas to minimize conflicts with adjacent agricultural uses.
Scenic Resources
C/OS­7     The City shall require new public and private development to protect
           scenic resources by:
           a. Prohibiting structures along ridgelines, steep slopes (above the 400 foot
               elevation contour), or in other highly visible locations unless no
               practical alternative is available, or such a location is necessary to
               protect public health and safety;
           b. Utilizing natural landforms and vegetation for screening structures,
               access roads, building foundations, and cut and fill slopes;
           c. Requiring landscaping which provides a landscape transition between
               developed areas and adjacent open space or undeveloped areas;
               and is compatible with the scenic resource being protected;
           d. Incorporating sound Soil Conservation Service practices and
               minimizing land alterations. Land alterations shall be minimized by:
               keeping cuts and fills to a minimum; limiting grading to the smallest

Soledad General Plan                                               VIII. Conservation/Open Space
               practical area of land; limiting land exposure to the shortest practical
               amount of time; replanting graded areas to insure establishment of
               plant cover before the next rainy season; and creating grading
               contours that blend with the natural contours on site or look like
               contours that would naturally occur;
            e. Designing roads, parking, and utilities to minimize visual impacts. If
               possible, utilities shall be underground. Roadways and parking shall fit
               the natural terrain; and
            f. Designing projects to fit the site's scale and character. Structures shall
               be designed and located so: they do not silhouette against ridgelines,
               or hilltops; roof lines and vertical architectural features blend with and
               do not detract from the natural background or ridge outline;
               residential density and massing is decreased with increased elevation
               where it would mar the scenic quality of the scenic resource; they fit
               the natural terrain, and they utilize building materials, colors, and
               textures that blend with the natural landscape and avoid the creation
               of high­contrast situations.
Hillside Protection
C/OS­8         The City shall require public or private development to:
               a. The City shall designate hillside areas above the 400 foot elevation
                   contour as Open Space/Grazing, Public Facility (parkland) or
                   Agriculture.
               b. Locate primary structures, accessory structures, paving, and
                   grading at the base of a hill (generally that are below the 400 foot
                   contour or 15 percent slope) unless: (1) no practicable alternative
                   is available, (2) the location on a greater slope or at a greater
                   elevation provides more aesthetic quality, or (3) the location is
                   necessary to protect public health and safety.
               c. Utilize design, construction, and maintenance techniques that: (1)
                   preserve and enhance the hillsides; (2) ensure that development
                   near or on portions of a hill do not cause, or make worse natural
                   hazards (such as erosion, sedimentation, fire, or water quality
                   concerns); (3) include erosion and sediment control practices
                   including temporary vegetation sufficient to stabilize disturbed
                   areas; (4) minimize risk to life and property from slope failure,
                   landslides, and flooding; (5) maintain the character and visual
                   quality of the adjacent hillside.
               d. Incorporate recreation and public access on or near hillsides
                   consistent with this Element.
C/OS­9         The City shall support the preservation and enhancement of natural
               land forms, natural vegetation, and natural resources to the maximum
               extent feasible.
Plant, Animal and Related Habitat Protection
C/OS­10        The City shall support State and federal laws and policies to preserve
               populations of rare, threatened, and endangered species by ensuring
                                             VIII­9

              development does not adversely affect such species in a significant
              way or by fully mitigating adverse effects.
C/OS­11       The City shall require that significant natural, open space, and cultural
              resources be identified in advance of development and incorporated
              into site­specific development project design to the extent feasible.
C/OS­12       The City shall require developers to use native and compatible non­

              possible in fulfilling landscaping requirements imposed as conditions of
              project approvals or project mitigations.
Air Quality
C/OS­13       The City will encourage the improvement of air quality in Soledad and
              in the region by implementing the measures described in the
              Monterey County Air Quality Management Plan. Such measures
              include, but are not limited to, measures to reduce dependence on
              the automobile and encourage the use of alternate modes of
              transportation such as buses, bicycles and walking.
C/OS­14       The City shall, to the extent feasible, separate sensitive land uses from
              significant sources of air pollution.
C/OS­15       The City shall submit development proposals to the APCD for review
              and comment in compliance with CEQA prior to consideration by the
              decision­making body.
C/OS­16       The City shall promote and encourage the use of alternate modes of
              transportation by incorporating public transit, bicycle, and pedestrian
              modes in City transportation planning and by requiring new
              development to provide adequate pedestrian and bikeway facilities.
Tree Preservation/Landscaping
C/OS­17       When considering the approval of activities that result in the removal
              of mature trees, the following factors shall be considered:
              a. The size, age, health and species of tree(s) to be removed.
              b. Whether or not the removal of the tree(s) is necessary for the
                   reasonable development and use of the site.
              c. Whether the tree(s) to be removed is (are) a native or introduced
                   species.
C/OS­18       The City shall institute and promote a vigorous program of tree
              planting in new development areas and in older portions of the City to
              increase the number and density of tree cover.
C/OS­19       When mature trees are removed to accommodate new
              development, they shall be replaced at a ratio of at least two new
              trees for every one tree removed, or such additional number and size

              of trees as considered appropriate by the reviewing body at the time
              of approval of such development.
C/OS­20       The City will continue to trim and maintain trees within public drainage
              channels to insure continued vigor and to protect public health and
              safety. The City will encourage the continued maintenance of trees
              on private property and, where necessary, may require trees to be
              trimmed or other maintenance when necessary to protect the public
              health and safety.
C/OS­21       Landscaping plans for new development incorporate water
              conservation methods and shall employ native varieties of plants that
              are drought tolerant.
C/OS­22       Where necessary the City shall employ the services of a qualified
              landscape architect and/or arborist in managing the City’s tree
              resources.

Archaeological and Cultural Resources
C/OS­23         If development of a site uncovers cultural resources, the
                recommendations of Appendix K of the Guidelines for Implementation
                of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code
                Section 15000 et seq.) shall be followed for identification,
                documentation, and preservation of the resource.
C/OS­24         The City shall document and record data or information relevant to
                prehistoric and historic cultural resources which may be impacted by
                proposed development. The accumulation of such data shall act as a
                tool to assist decision­makers in determinations of the potential
                development effects to prehistoric and historical resources located
                within the City.
Mineral Resources
C/OS­25         Approval by Monterey County of new or expanded mining operations
                near Soledad shall ensure that no adverse visual impacts result, no
                additional truck traffic is routed through the City of Highway 146 and
                that air quality and flood control issues are resolved.
C/OS­26         The City and County shall discourage urban uses adjacent to State­
                designated regional resource deposits if such uses would be
                incompatible with mining operations, or would restrict future extraction
                of significant mineral resources.
    Programs
8.1    Consistent with APCD standards, the City shall require new development to
       utilize the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for all new emission
       sources. Implementation of these control technologies shall be applied
       through the review of new development projects and through the Air
       Pollution Control District's permitting and environmental review process.

    Hazards
This chapter of the General Plan identifies areas subject to natural or human­made
hazards, and establishes goals, policies and programs to protect people and
property from their effects. Another hazard­related issue relates to noise and the
exposure of people to excessive amounts of noise. Noise can be considered a
health hazard that can also have profound effects on the quality of life in suburban
communities.

As Soledad continues to grow in accordance with the General Plan, these hazards
must be addressed so that the health and safety of present and future residents is
protected.
                                      IX. Safety
            A Vision Of The Future
          City residents and their property are protected from natural and human­
          caused hazards, including floods, fire, geologic and seismic events. Emergency
          response providers (police, fire and ambulance) are staffed and equipped to
          maintain the desired response time to all portions of the City. Health care is
          provided in Soledad.
Introduction
The Safety Element identifies potential natural and human­made hazards and
provides policies, programs and standards to protect people and property from such
hazards. Chapters 5. And 6. of the General Plan Background Report provides a
more detailed discussion of geologic, fire, flooding and other hazards that affect the
Soledad planning area.
Safety Issues
‘ Drainage facilities serving Soledad will require expansion to accommodate
    additional development.
    Runoff generated from new development will necessitate improvements to the
    drainage system serving Soledad. In addition, the drainage system must be
    properly maintained to eliminate obstructions that could worsen flooding.
‘ Efforts to minimize the effects of seismic hazards should be incorporated into the
    design of new development and should be incorporated into existing
    development to the extent feasible.
    Earthquakes can neither be predicted nor avoided. However, prudent steps can
    be taken to help minimize their effects in a seismically­active area such as
    Soledad. The City should continue its efforts to minimize this risk in new
    development by enforcing the provisions of the Uniform Building Code.
‘ New development must be protected from major fire hazards.
                                                IX­1

New development in the outlying areas of the City could be exposed to the
threat of wildland fires originating in the surrounding hillsides. Such development
should incorporate measures to help protect structures and residents.

Soledad General Plan                                                                IX. Safety
Flood Hazards
Regional flood hazards are described in terms of the 100­year flood event, and are
mapped for most of California by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA). The 100­year flood zone for Soledad is shown in Figure IX­2. The limits of the
flood zone generally correspond to areas of the Salinas River however, flooding in
the City of Soledad is not limited to the River. Areas of the community affected by
flooding include many of the downtown streets which received overflow from the
Bryant Canyon Channel in the March 1995 flood (see Figure IX­1). Other areas that
flooded in this storm include the Gabilan and San Vicente elementary schools and
portions of subdivisions adjacent to the Mirrisou property where water overflowed
drainage ditches and onto lots.
Seismic Hazards
The City of Soledad is located in a seismically active region. The alluvial Salinas
Valley is bordered both to the east and west by active or potentially active fault
zones. Faults are caused by movement of the earth’s crust, which forces bedrock
units located on opposite sides of a fault line to slide past each other. These lines are
not discretely defined, so movement of the ground surface can occur throughout a
fairly wide area that overlies a fault zone. An active fault is defined as a fault that
has a historic seismic record (activity in the last 100 years) or displaces Holocene
(11,000 years and younger) deposits. Faults that exhibit signs of geologically recent
movement (active within the past 11,000 years) are considered the most likely to
experience movement in the near future. Therefore, active faults are generally
thought to have the greatest fault rupture potential. Most agencies, however, will
consider potentially active faults (active within the past two million years) as being
capable of generating future earthquakes. Faults classified as inactive are not
considered to present a significant fault rupture hazard or seismic source.
Structural damage associated with earthquake hazards can be minimized with
proper foundation engineering based on an analysis of the soils on a given building
site, thereby limiting the damage to habitable structures in areas most likely to have
these occurrences. The land use designations and policies of the General Plan
respond to the need to protect existing and future development from seismic
hazards.
Fire Hazard
The City maintains a professionally staffed, full service fire department supplemented
by a strong volunteer program. The fire department is located adjacent to City Hall.
The Mission Soledad Rural Fire Protection District provides contract fire protection
services to the City. Additionally, the City has a mutual aid agreement with the
California Division of Forestry (CDF) for fire protection service. The undeveloped
hillsides east of the City are susceptible to occasional brush fires as fuel accumulates
over time. Additionally, structural fires may occur within the City.

              A Vision Of The Future
            Residential neighborhoods are quiet and peaceful consistent with the City’s
            small town character. Residents are protected from excessive noise caused by
            increased vehicular traffic, railroad noise and noise from the 101 freeway.
Introduction
Noise has become an important factor in the planning process because an overall
increase in noise levels from increased urban development, the spread of noise­
producing activities into formerly quiet areas, and greater awareness of impacts of
noise on human health. The Noise Element provides policies, programs and
standards to alleviate the problems associated with excessive noise. The Noise
Element identifies the major sources of noise, estimates their impacts on the
community, and provides various methods to mitigate its impact.
All of the elements of the General Plan are related and interdependent. The Noise
Element is most closely related to the Land Use, Circulation and Housing Elements by
identifying noise­sensitive land uses, including residential neighborhoods, schools,
churches, hospitals and playgrounds, and recommending standards that will lessen
noise impacts on these land uses. The Noise Element estimates noise levels from new
and existing roadways so that standards can be developed to mitigate these
impacts. Lastly, the Noise Element recommends standards for the design of new
housing to mitigate noise levels in high noise impact areas.
Chapter 7. of the General Plan Background Report provides an overview of how
noise is measured and the regulatory and environmental strategies applicable to
noise management.
Noise Issues
‘ Noise levels are likely to increase due to urban development and increased
    traffic.
    The principal sources of noise in Soledad are streets and highways. The growth in
    traffic volumes on streets and highways and rail traffic, and the resulting increase
    in noise levels, can be at least partially mitigated by locating new sensitive land
                                                   X­1

Soledad General Plan                                                                                                           X. Noise
     uses away from these noise sources, and by requiring the incorporation of sound
     mitigation in new development.
‘ New or expanded industrial development could result in noise levels considered
     excessive by nearby sensitive land uses.
     Soledad has a substantial amount of undeveloped industrial land that could be
     developed during the timeframe of the General Plan. Industrial uses are more
     likely to involve noise­generating activities that could be considered a nuisance
     by surrounding sensitive land uses, such as residential neighborhoods.
The Existing Noise Environment in Soledad
The major noise source in Soledad, as in most other communities, is traffic. Other
noise generators such as railroads, aircraft, farming activities, quarry activities, and
industrial and food packaging facilities can contribute to local ambient noise levels.
Land Use Compatibility Standards
Some land uses are more tolerant of noise than others. For example, schools,
hospitals, churches, and residences are more sensitive to noise intrusion than
commercial or industrial activities. For this reason, land use compatibility with the
noise environment is an important consideration in the planning and design of new
developments. As ambient noise levels affect the perceived amenity or livability of
a development, so too can the mismanagement of noise impacts or impair the
economic health and growth potential of a community by reducing the area's
desirability as a place to live, shop and work.
     State Guidelines and Standards
     Section 1092 of Title 25, Chapter 1, Subchapter 1, Article 4, of the California
     Administrative Code includes noise insulation standards which detail specific
     requirements for new multi­family structures (hotels, motels, apartments, condos,
     and other attached dwellings) located within the 60 CNEL contour adjacent to
     roads, railroads, rapid transit lines, airports or industrial areas.5 An acoustic
     analysis is required showing that these multi­family units have been designed to
     limit interior noise levels with doors and windows closed to 45 CNEL in any
     habitable room. Title 21 of the California Administration Code (Subchapter 6,
     Article 2, Section 5014) also specifies that multi­family attached units incorporate
     noise reduction features sufficient to assure that interior noise levels in all
     habitable rooms do not exceed 45 CNEL.
     Section 65302 (f) of the Government Code specifies that it is the responsibility of
     the local agency preparing the general plan to specify the manner in which the
     noise element will be integrated into the zoning plan and tied to the Land Use
  5 
          An exception is made for railroads where there are no nighttime (10 PM to 7 AM) operations and where daytime (7 AM to 
         10 PM) operations do not exceed four per day.
                                                                 X­2

Soledad General Plan                                                                X. Noise
    Element, Circulation Element, and the local Noise Ordinance. The Noise Element,
    once adopted, also becomes the guideline for determining compliance with the
    State noise insulation standards discussed above.
    The Office of Noise Control, established by the California Noise Control Act of
    1973, has developed criteria and guidelines for local agencies for use in setting
    standards for human exposure to noise and preparing noise elements. The noise
    standards developed by the Office of Noise Control and intended as guidelines
    for municipal noise elements are summarized in Figure X­1. Standards for interior
    noise levels are provided by Table X­1.
    Each locality, in developing a noise element, must make a determination
    regarding how much noise is too much. A community's sensitivity to noise may
    be taken into account by starting with the general guidelines and then applying
    adjustment factors which allow acceptability standards to be set which 1)
    reflect the desires of the community and its assessment of the relative
    importance of noise pollution and 2) are below the known levels of health
    impairment.
    Local Policies and Standards
    Policies and implementation programs outlined in the Noise Element focus on
    establishing noise projections for proper planning and reducing the noise impacts
    at sensitive receptor locations. They include: 1) identifying noise sources and
    determining noise exposure levels; 2) adopting acceptable levels of noise for
    land use categories; 3) adopting a comprehensive noise ordinance; 4)
    promoting effective enforcement of existing federal and state noise standards; 5)
    requiring proper acoustical site planning and acoustical construction; and 6)
    evaluating noise analyses which have been required for new development
    projects.

                                         Policies
N­1     The City shall not allow development of new noise­sensitive land uses where
        existing or ambient noise levels exceed those shown on Figure X­1, as
        measured immediately within the property line of the new development,
        unless effective noise mitigation measures have been incorporated into the
        development design to achieve the standards set by Figure X­1.
N­2     Where non­residential land uses are likely to generate noise levels exceeding
        those shown on Figure X­1 on adjacent or nearby existing or planned noise­
        sensitive uses, the City shall require preparation of an acoustical analysis as
        part of the environmental review process so that noise mitigation may be
        included in the project design.
N­3     New residential development shall comply with State Noise Insulation
        Standards.
N­4     New commercial and industrial development shall incorporate design
        elements to minimize the noise impact when residential neighborhoods are
        nearby.
N­5     Where noise mitigation measures are required to achieve the standards
        described in Figure X­2, the emphasis of such measures shall be placed on
        site planning and project design. The use of noise barriers shall be considered
        as a means of achieving the noise standards only after all other practical
        design­related mitigation measures have been integrated into the project.

Soledad General Plan                                        XI. Implementing the General Plan
     XI. Implementing the General Plan
The process of implementing or carrying out the goals, policies and programs
contained in the Soledad General Plan will require the completion of a series of
steps. The implementation process will begin with the formal adoption of the plan
itself by the City Council after completion and certification of an environmental
impact report (EIR) and the recommendation of the Planning Commission. The EIR
will identify the environmental consequences that will likely result if further land use
and development occurs in Soledad as envisioned by the General Plan. The next
step will be for the City to initiate amendments to its zoning ordinance and zoning
map to incorporate the changes outlined in the plan.
At the conclusion of this process, the plan will be carried out through the review and
approval of specific plans for the major new growth areas and through residential
subdivisions and commercial or industrial development in accordance with the
goals, policies and programs of the plan. The establishment of new public services,
facilities, and infrastructure as recommended by the plan are also important in
realizing the goals of the plan. Table XI­1 summarizes the important steps toward
implementation.
The plan also identifies a number of desirable objectives to be achieved in the next
five years and the next ten years. These objectives are summarized in Table X­1 and
include [to be decided by City Council]. These objectives represent measurable
milestones by which the success of the plan can be periodically evaluated.
Following Table X­1 is an implementation timeline for each program, including the
responsible department/agency.
Interpreting The General Plan
The entire text of this document and the Land Use Diagram (Figure II­9), Circulation
Diagram (Figure V­2) and other maps which accompany it constitute the Soledad
General Plan. Rezoning of parcels to a higher intensity of use consistent with the land
use designation on the Land Use Diagram will require that an appropriate
application be filed with the City Community Development Department. This will
ensure that the proposal can be reviewed and appropriately conditioned so as to
carry out the overall purposes and intent of this plan, and to preserve, protect and
perpetuate the existing scale, design and small town character of Soledad.
The wide range and complexity of subject matter covered by the General Plan is
certain to generate questions of interpretation. As questions arise, the City
Community Development Department can interpret the Plan and/or refer the matter
to the Planning Commission. Interpretations made by the Planning Commission may
be appealed to the City Council.
                                          XI­2

Soledad General Plan                                         XI. Implementing the General Plan
The word "general" is key to understanding the nature of the plan's policies and
programs. It implies overall agreement on major issues without a straight­jacket of
inflexibility; it implies variation and encourages innovation while working toward the
achievement of common goals; and it implies the need for adjustment of policies
and proposals as changing conditions may dictate. While not inflexible, neither is the
plan to be viewed as totally malleable so as to accommodate whatever position or
policy may be sought through interpretation.
A properly administered general plan demands that the rule of "reasonableness" be
applied to permit flexibility, variation and adjustment as long as the integrity of basic
policies and proposals is maintained.
Achieving Zoning Consistency With The General Plan
State law requires the City's zoning ordinance and zone map be consistent with the
policies and programs of the General Plan. In order to fulfill these requirements and
give the town the types of zoning districts and procedural regulations needed, a
high priority of the City after adoption of the plan will be to revise its zone map and
any amendments to the ordinance necessary to fully carry out the provisions of the
General Plan.
Amendment of the City’s Sphere of Influence and Annexations
To The City
The vision for the future of Soledad embodied in this General Plan will require
amendments to the City’s sphere of influence. The sphere will necessarily
correspond to portions of the Land Use Diagram where services and facilities may be
provided in a timely manner, consistent with the provisions of State law. Expansion of
the sphere of influence requires approval of the Monterey County Local Agency
Formation Commission (LAFCo).
Accordingly, the land within the existing City limits is not sufficient to accommodate
development to meet the needs of the City during the time­frame of the General
Plan. Therefore, annexations to the City will be necessary in the future to achieve
the overall intent of this plan.        When evaluating the appropriateness of future
annexations to the City, the following criteria should be considered:
1. The costs and capability of providing adequate public facilities and the levels of
    government services required.
2. The effects on adjacent areas, social and economic interests, and the
    governmental structure of the City.
3. Conformity with LAFCO policies which seek efficient patterns of urban
    development, including those that favor guiding urbanization away from existing
    sensitive resource areas and encourage the development of existing vacant
    lands within the existing urban area before allowing development outside the
    current boundaries.

Soledad General Plan                                        XI. Implementing the General Plan
The State Planning and Zoning Law (effective January 1, 1985), requires a systematic
approach to General Plan implementation. Section 65400 of the Government Code
requires the Community Development Department to investigate and recommend
to the City Council
    "...reasonable and practical means for implementing the General Plan or
    elements of the General Plan, so that it will serve as an effective guide for
    orderly growth and development, preservation and conservation of open
    space land and natural resources, and the efficient expenditure of pubic
    funds relating to the subjects addressed in the General Plan."
State law also requires the City Council to receive an annual report on the status of
the General Plan and progress toward its implementation. This requirement seeks to
avoid the often fragmented and incomplete attention to plan implementation that
has characterized the actions of some cities and counties. The most common
implementation practices have been to respond to requests for plan amendments
and zoning applications, to prepare a capital improvement program, and to
undertake special projects as desired. To assist in the ongoing monitoring of the
plan's implementation, Table X­1 sets forth a series of objectives by which the success
of the plan can be assessed.
Amendments and Updates
State law allows the General Plan to be amended four times per calendar year.
Individual amendments may be initiated by the public, as for a specific
development project, or by staff, the Planning Commission or City Council. The
Planning Commission must review and make a recommendation to the City Council
on all proposed changes to the General Plan. The City Council must decide all
General Plan amendments, which are also subject to compliance with the relevant
provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
To respond to change and to continue to adequately address the needs of the
residents of Soledad, a comprehensive revision or update of the General Plan may
be needed from time to time. Although State law does not set a specific time frame
for such a comprehensive update (except for the Housing Element, which must be
updated at least every five years), the objectives of the Plan should be reviewed
annually to determine the progress toward achievement of the goals described
therein.

                         Standards for Specific Plans
The Land Use Diagram (Figure II­9) designates land within the City’s sphere of
influence and outside the current City limits as Expansion Area/Specific Plan
Required. The Expansion Areas are further divided into sub­areas where a specific
plan will be required prior to annexation and development. The Land Use Element
provides general descriptions and development goals for each specific plan area
and conceptual illustrations for how these areas might be developed to achieve the
City’s overall land use objectives.
Each specific plan shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions of
Government Code Section 65451, and shall address the following:
     1. The distribution, location, extent and the uses of land, including open
         space, within the area covered by the plan.
     2. The proposed distribution, location, extent and intensity of major
         components of public and private transportation, sewage, water,
         drainage, solid waste disposal, energy, and other essential facilities
         proposed to be located within the area covered by the plan.
     3. Standards and criteria by which development will proceed, and
         standards for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural
         resources, where applicable.
     4. A program of implementation measures including regulations, programs,
         public works projects, and financing measures to carry out 1., 2. and 3.,
         above.
In addition to the requirements described above, all specific plans shall be planned
and designed to carry out the objectives, standards and design principles described
below. The intent of these principles is to guide the preparation of specific plans to
create neighborhoods that are pedestrian friendly, have a distinct identity and
provide convenient access to services and adjoining neighborhoods.
Neighborhood Design and Land Use
1. New residential projects should be designed to integrate with existing
     neighborhoods. Subdivisions in City expansion areas should be designed so that
     individual, separately developed projects work together to create true
     neighborhoods with a sense of identity, instead of disjointed or isolated enclaves.
2. Higher­density residential uses and appropriate support services should be
     concentrated along segments of the transportation system with good road
     connections to the remainder of the City.
3. The ground floor of each non­residential structure shall be limited to pedestrian­
     oriented uses. These may include walk­in uses such as restaurants, retail stores,
                                           XII­2

Soledad General Plan                                                              XII. Appendix
    health/fitness facilities, personal services, community service organizations, and
    similar uses. To encourage visual continuity and pedestrian activity, at least 60
    percent of the total street frontage ground floor length of any new or
    reconstructed building shall be differentiated architecturally by recessed
    windows and entries, display windows, offset surfaces, differentiated piers and
    columns, offset planes, textured materials, awnings, and compatibility
    landscaping or other details, or other displays which are of interest to pedestrians.
4. Concentrations of medium­ and high­density residential uses and higher
    intensities of non­residential uses should be provided within one­quarter mile of
    transit stops and/or neighborhood serving commercial centers. Multi­family
    development shall be integrated with surrounding single family residential
    development in form, scale and architectural character and should be
    considered for construction concurrently or in advance of single family residential
    products.
5. Specific plans should support the development of integrated mixed­use areas by
    mixing residential, neighborhood retail, open space, and public uses while
    making it possible to travel by transit, bicycle, or foot, as well as by automobile.
    One way to achieve this objective is through the design of 'neo­traditional'
    neighborhoods as illustrated by Figure A­1.
6. Adequate buffers should be provided between residential and incompatible
    non­residential land uses.
7. Specific plans should incorporate design elements, building forms, colors and
    materials that recall traditional patterns as described in the Community Design
    Guidelines as they may be adopted by the City Council.
8. Residential developments that appear as continuous walled­off areas,
    disconnected and isolated from the rest of the community shall be discouraged
    where alternate scenarios are feasible. While walls and fences may be useful for
    security, sound attenuation and privacy, these objectives can often be met by
    creative design that controls the height and length of walls, develops breaks and
    variations in relief, and uses landscaping, along with natural topographical
    changes, for screening.
9. Specific plans should provide a range of residential housing types affordable to
    the widest range of income groups, consistent with the goals, policies and
    programs of the Housing Element of the General Plan.
10. Specific plan areas should be planned where feasible to help to achieve a
    jobs/housing balance within the City.

         Public facilities (roads, drainage, As determined by the City Council in conjunction
         sewer, water,others)                with the applicable service provider.
        Notes:
        1. Includes specialized housing such as rest homes, senior housing, etc.
        2. May include buffers between urban development and incompatible land uses.
Streets and Circulation
12.     New public streets and sidewalks should be aligned with, and be connected
        to those of adjacent developments to interconnect the community and
        simplify traffic circulation patterns.
13.     The use of multiple collector streets shall be favored over the development of
        arterial streets in new neighborhoods.
14.     Blocks should generally not be more than 520 feet long, except along non­
        access frontages.
15.     Subdivision design should emphasize pedestrian connectivity within each
        project, and to adjacent neighborhoods, and nearby schools and parks. All
        streets and walkways should be designed to provide safe and pleasant
        conditions for pedestrians. Streets within neighborhoods should be no wider
        than needed to accommodate parking and two low­speed travel lanes.
        Sidewalks in residential neighborhoods should be separated from curbs by
        parkway strips of at least four feet in width; and the parkways should be
        planted with canopy street trees.
16.     The use of cul­de­sac streets should be minimized wherever possible. Where
        the use of cul­de­sacs is unavoidable, the end of each cul­de­sac should be
        provided a pedestrian walkway between private parcels to provide linkages
                                                 XII­4

Soledad General Plan                                                                XII. Appendix
        to adjacent cul­de­sacs, streets, and/or parks, schools, or open space areas
        provided that public safety, security and vandalism issues are adequately
        addressed.
17.     Specific plans should provide a bicycle path and pedestrian walkway
        network to link public facilities, housing, and neighborhood­serving
        commercial centers.
18.     Specific plans shall be designed to accommodate public transit.
19.     Roundabouts, neckdowns/bulbouts and other traffic calming strategies shall
        be employed as an alternative to conventional intersection controls, where
        feasible.
Parks, Open Space and Natural Features
20.     New subdivisions adjacent to planned or existing parks or other public open
        spaces, or the landscaped grounds of schools or other public facilities should
        maximize visibility and pedestrian access to these areas. Where these
        facilities are not already planned, the subdivision should be designed to
        provide usable public open spaces in the form of parks, linear bicycle and
        pedestrian trails, squares, and greens, as appropriate.
21.     Parks and open space shall be provided as required by the standards
        contained in the Parks and Recreation Element. Specific plans shall
        incorporate the widest range of park types (mini­parks, neighborhood parks,
        community parks, or regional parks) as provided in the Parks and Recreation
        Element. Linear parks shall be provided adjacent to drainage areas or
        sensitive habitat areas and shall incorporate pedestrian, bicycle and/or
        equestrian trails as provided in the standards of the Parks and Recreation
        Element.
22.     Natural amenities (such as views, mature trees, rock outcrops, and similar
        features) should be preserved and incorporated into proposed development
        to the greatest extent feasible. The clustering of units in hillside areas is
        encouraged as a means of achieving this goal.
23.     Public access and visibility to drainage features, and the separation of
        residences and other uses from such features should be provided through the
        use of single­loaded frontage roads in combination with multi­use trails.
        Pedestrian access to and along creeks and other drainage features may
        need to be restricted to flatter areas (e.g. beyond top of bank, natural
        benches) where grading needs and erosion potential are minimal, and
        where sensitive environmental resources require protection.
Public Services
24.     Specific plans shall be designed and constructed to provide all public
        infrastructure, facilities, and services needed to serve both initial and buildout
        populations of the plan area, including, but not limited to: adequate sewer,
        water and storm drain capacity, distribution and collection systems; public

Specific Plan Contents
26.     Specific plans shall generally include the following information (not
        necessarily in the order presented):
        I.   Introduction. The introduction should briefly describe the objectives to be
             achieved by the project, the timeframe for its implementation, and how it
             meets the purpose and intent of the Soledad General Plan.
        II. Overview of Existing Conditions. This chapter should discuss the existing
             environmental setting (topography, drainage, biological resources, etc.),
             as well as infrastructure (water, sewer, drainage, etc.) serving the project
             site.
        III. Development Plan. This chapter should describe how the project will be
             developed, subdivided, etc., to meet the objectives described in the
             introduction. The development plan need not be precise, but should
             include the following:
             a. Land use plan. The proposed land use and zoning designations should
                 be described in detail, along with the development standards and
                 allowable land uses intended for each. The land use plan should be
                 quantitative and include the total acreage and numbers of dwelling
                 units for each phase of the project.
             b. A preliminary subdivision design showing proposed lotting pattern, lot
                 sizes, streets, etc.
             c. A preliminary grading and drainage plan.
             d. A preliminary landscaping plan
