                               GENERAL PLAN
                         INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
                               This General Plan formalizes a long-term vision for the physical
INTRODUCTION                   evolution of Crescent City and outlines policies, standards, and
                               programs to guide day-to-day decisions concerning Crescent City’s
                               development. Designed to meet State general plan and coastal planning
                               requirements, the General Plan consists of two documents: this General
                               Plan Policy Document and a General Plan Background Report. This
                               Policy Document is divided into two parts. Part I is the General Plan
                               Introduction and Summary, which provides background about the
                               General Plan, describes Crescent City’s land use history, and reviews
                               the plan’s major themes and proposals. This section is a summary only,
                               and does not set official policy. The lengthier and more detailed Part
                               II presents Crescent City’s formal General Plan policy statements in the
                               form of goals, policies, standards, implementation programs, and
                               quantified objectives, expressed in both text and diagrams.
                               A general plan is a legal document that serves as a community’s “blue
N    ATURE, CONTENT,           print” or “constitution” for land use and development. State law
                               requires that every city and county in California adopt a general plan
AND PURPOSE OF THE
GENERAL PLAN                   that is comprehensive and long-term. The plans must outline proposals
                               for the physical development of the county or city, and any land outside
                               its boundaries which in the planning agency’s judgment bears relation
                               to its planning (California Government Code Section 65300 et seq.).
                               General plans must be comprehensive both in their geographic coverage
                               and in the range of subjects they cover. In the case of the Crescent City
                               General Plan, the geographic coverage is the city’s Planning Area,
                               which encompasses incorporated territory and unincorporated territory
                               that may directly or indirectly affect the city’s future development.
                               General plans must be long-term in perspective. General plan time
                               horizons vary, but typically range anywhere from 15 to 25 years into
                               the future. In the case of the Crescent City General Plan Update, the
                               City has established the time horizon as the year 2020.
                               Every general plan in California must address seven topics or
                               "elements." The importance of each of the seven required topics will,
                               of course, vary from community to community. Following are brief
                               descriptions of what State law requires be addressed in each of the
                               seven elements.
Crescent City General Plan                          1                                                May 21, 2001

General Plan Summary                                                                     Policy Document
                     1. The Land Use Element designates the general distribution and
                          intensity of all uses of the land in the community. This includes
                          residential uses, commercial uses, industrial uses, public facilities,
                          and open space, among others.
                     2. The Circulation Element identifies the general location and extent
                          of existing and proposed major transportation facilities, including
                          major roadways, rail and transit, and airports.
                     3. The Housing Element is a comprehensive assessment of current
                          and projected housing needs for all segments of the community and
                          all economic groups that also embodies policies and programs for
                          providing adequate housing.
                     4. The Conservation Element addresses the conservation;
                          development; and use of natural resources including water, forests,
                          soils, rivers, and mineral deposits.
                     5. Overlapping the conservation element, the Open Space Element
                          details plans and measures for preserving open space for: protection
                          of natural resources—such as wildlife habitat; the managed
                          production of resources—such as agricultural and timber land;
                          outdoor recreation—such as parks, trails, and scenic vistas; and
                          public health and safety—such as areas subject to geologic hazards,
                          tsunamis, flooding, and fires.
                     6. The Noise Element identifies and appraises noise problems and
                          includes policies to protect the community from excessive noise.
                     7.   The Safety Element establishes policies and programs to protect the
                          community from risks associated with seismic, geologic, flood, and
                          wildfire hazards.
                     The general plan may also address other topics that the community feels
                     are relevant to its development, such as scenic resources, historic
                     preservation, and urban design.
                     For each locally-relevant mandated issue or optional issue addressed,
                     the general plan must do the following:
                        C Describe the nature and significance of the issue in the community
                          (Background Information)
                        C Set-out policy in text and maps for how the jurisdiction will
                          respond to the issue (Policy)
                        C Outline specific programs for implementing policies
                          (Implementation Programs)
                     The format and structure of the general plan is left to local discretion,
                     but regardless of the format or issues addressed, all substantive parts of

                           the plan must be consistent with one another (i.e., internally consistent).
                           For instance, the policies in the land use element must be consistent
                           with those of the housing element and vice versa.
                           Updating Crescent City’s General Plan will serve several important
PURPOSES OF THIS           purposes related to the way the City plans and how the community
GENERAL PLAN               participates in the planning process. These purposes include the
                           following:
                           C Establishing within City government the capacity to analyze local and
                             regional conditions and needs in order to respond effectively to the
                             problems and opportunities facing the Crescent City community;
                           C Identifying of Crescent City’s environmental, social, and economic
                             goals;
                           C Recording the City government's policies and standards for the
                             maintenance and improvement of existing development and the
                             location and characteristics of future development;
                           C Providing Crescent City’s citizens with information about their
                             community and with opportunities to participate in the local planning
                             and decision-making process;
                           C Improving the coordination of community development and
                             environmental protection activities among the City, Del Norte
                             County, and other regional, State, and Federal agencies; and
                           C Establishing a basis for subsequent planning efforts, such as
                             preparation of specific plans, redevelopment plans, and special
                             studies, to deal with unique problems or areas in the community.
                           Carrying out the plan following its adoption requires a number of
I MPLEMENTING THE
GENERAL PLAN
                           individual actions and outgoing programs involving virtually every City
                           department, special district (i.e., Harbor District), non-profit
                           organization, and many other public agencies and private organizations.
                           The legal authority for these various actions and programs derive from
                           two essential powers of local government: corporate and police powers.
                           Using their “corporate power,” local governments collect money
                           through bonds, fees, assessments, and taxes, and spend it to provide
                           services and facilities such as police and fire protection, streets, water
                           systems, sewage disposal facilities, drainage facilities, and parks.
                           Using their “police power,” local governments regulate the use of
                           private property through zoning, subdivision, and building regulations
                           in order “to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the public.” The
                           general plan provides the formal framework for the exercise of these
                           powers by local officials.

General Plan Summary                                                            Policy Document
                     To ensure that the policies and proposals of the general plan are
                     systematically implemented, State law since the early 1970s has
                     increasingly insisted that the actions and decisions of local government
                     concerning both its own projects and the private projects it approves are
                     consistent with its adopted general plan. The courts have supported and
                     furthered this trend through their interpretations of State law. Zoning
                     must be consistent with the general plan. Local government approval
                     of subdivisions must be consistent with the general plan. Local public
                     works projects must be consistent with the general plan. The same is
                     true for development agreements, coastal zoning, redevelopment plans,
                     specific plans, and many other plans and actions of cities and counties.
                     The general plan is a long-term document with a planning horizon of
                     15 to 25 years. To achieve its purposes, the plan must be flexible
                     enough to respond to changing conditions and at the same time specific
                     enough to provide predictability and consistency in guiding day-to-day
R    EVISING AND
AMENDING THE
                     land use and development decisions. Over the years, conditions and
                     community needs change and new opportunities arise; the plan needs
                     to keep up with these changes and new opportunities. Every year the
GENERAL PLAN         Planning Commission should review the plan’s implementation
                     programs to assess the City’s progress in carrying out the plan. Every
                     five to ten years, the plan should be thoroughly reviewed and updated
                     as necessary. From time to time, the City will be asked to consider
                     proposals for specific amendments to the plan. The City will initiate
                     some of these proposals itself, but most will be initiated by private
                     property owners and developers. Most general plan amendments
                     involve changes in land use designations for individual parcels.
                     State law limits general plan amendments to four times per year, but
                     each amendment can include multiple changes. Like the adoption of
                     the general plan itself, general amendments are subject to
                     environmental review, public notice, and hearing requirements and
                     must not create inconsistencies with other parts of the plan.
                     Crescent City is the northernmost incorporated city on the California
REGIONAL SETTING AND Coast. The city, which covers approximately 1.4 square miles or 900
PLANNING AREA        acres, is bounded by the ocean, broad beaches, coastal bluffs, the
                     Crescent City Harbor, scattered forests, and rural residences. Crescent
                     City is the most urbanized part of the Del Norte County and is the
                     county’s only incorporated city. Another incorporated portion of
                     Crescent City is the Pelican Bay State Prison.

                           Figure 1 shows the city’s location within the state and region. By law,
                           the General Plan must cover all territory within the boundaries of the
                           city as well as "any land outside its boundaries which, in the planning
                           agency's judgment, bears relation to its planning." (Government Code
                           Section 65300). For purposes of the Crescent City General Plan, the
                           Planning Area has been defined on the north by an east- west line
                           coinciding with Blackwell Road and includes the area within the urban
                           boundary north of Blackwell Road. The eastern boundary follows
                           south along Elk Valley Road and then follows the Federal and State
                           lands on the east (see Figure 2).
                           Crescent City has experienced several changes through the years that
CRESCENT CITY’S            have substantially affected the nature of planning in the city. The

HISTORY
                           City’s current economy and land use development.
NATIVE AMERICAN SETTLEMENT Prior to the arrival of European settlers, two cultural groups occupied
                           what is now Del Norte County: the Tolowa and the Yurok. Tolowa
                           territory covered the northern part of the county, and Yurok the
                           southern part. Although the Tolowa are not a federally recognized
                           tribe, today they are among the residents of the Smith River Rancheria,
                           located near the mouth of the Smith River.
TRANSPORTATION AND         The first Europeans to see Del Norte County were most likely Spanish
EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT        who had arrived by ship in the 17th and 18th centuries. The first
                           American to explore the country overland was Jedediah Strong Smith,
                           for whom the Smith River is named. In 1828, Smith and his party of
                           trappers traded with Native Americans, came upon Lake Earl, and
                           camped at Crescent City.
                           During the 1840s and 1850s, there were a number of sea explorations
                           of Crescent Bay. The town of Crescent City was established in 1853
                           by J. F. Wendell, who was issued a land warrant for 230 acres.
                           The first “road” in Del Norte County, the Kelsey Trail from Crescent
                           City to Yreka, was opened in 1855. In 1857, the Crescent City &
                           Yreka Plank & Turnpike Company began construction on a road
                           between Crescent City and Waldo, Oregon (Sailor’s Diggings); it was
                           completed in 1860. The survey for the Klamath Road, from Crescent
                           City to Eureka, began in 1887 and, in the summer of 1894, the road was
                           completed. A narrow-gauge railroad was constructed from Crescent
                           City to Smith River by the Hobbs-Wall company in 1890. In 1919, the
                           first contract for the Redwood Highway was granted.
                           To facilitate the use of Crescent Bay as a harbor, the Battery Point
                           Lighthouse was erected in 1856. It survived the 1964 tsunami and is
                           currently open to the public.

General Plan Summary                                                            Policy Document
                     Generally, the settlers in Crescent City and the rest of Del Norte County
                     were non-Native Americans from the east, although a fairly large influx
                     of immigrants from China occurred between 1860 and 1880 (this
                     population was virtually gone by 1900). Crescent City and Del Norte
                     County have never been heavily populated, but the highest population
                     numbers— relative to the overall population of California—probably
                     occurred in the 1850s with the discovery of gold.
MINING               In 1848, Major Pierson B. Reading discovered gold on the Trinity
                     River, and by 1850, northwestern California was teeming with miners.
                     Shortly after, Crescent City was laid out in early 1853 and became a
                     bustling shipping and trade center, catering to and supplying the miners.
                     Gold discoveries in the immediate vicinity of Crescent City and on the
                     south fork of the Smith River fueled the boom. During this period,
                     residents and miners began requesting more transportation routes.
                     Within a few years, however, a decline in the production of local mines
                     and the opening of more promising gold fields elsewhere, drove all but
                     a handful of miners from the area. By the late 1850s the boom was
                     over.
TIMBER               The timber industry has historically played a large role in Crescent
                     City’s and Del Norte County’s economy. This dates back to the 1850s,
                     when the area experienced a boom in settlement as a result of lumbering
                     activity that followed the mining industry and the need to supply
                     lumber for mining and housing purposes, not just in the county, but
                     throughout California’s mining communities. Locally-produced lumber
                     was shipped to Crescent City for reshipment to San Francisco. Rugged
                     terrain and the lack of a good harbor made getting the timber to market
                     difficult; thus, the timber business was not particularly profitable.
                     The northern California timber industry peaked in the post World War
                     II years (1945 to 1950) as a result of strong housing and construction
                     demand and an abundance of raw materials. Shortly after 1950, the
                     number of mills began to drop as the industry transitioned from one
                     based on harvesting old growth timber to one that relies on younger,
                     smaller, less valuable second growth that is relatively more expensive
                     to grow. Mill closures were also hastened by timber industry trends
                     toward consolidation of operations, downsizing, and increasing
                     efficiency resulting from technological advancement.
                     The decline in Del Norte County’s timber industry is illustrated by
                     the volume of timber harvested, which dropped from 202,986 million
                     board feet (mbf) in 1985 to 65,036 mbf in 1995, a 68.5 percent
                     reduction. The result of this decline has been the closure of over 35
                     lumber mills; there are no longer any operating mills in Del Norte
                     County. There are, however, over 146,000 acres of privately-held
                     redwood and fir forestland capable of ongoing log production in the

FISHING AND CANNING         Through its history, Crescent City has been home to a significant
                            amount of commercial fishing and canning activity, and it continues to
                            be. Over the years, commercial fishers have caught salmon, albacore,
                            shrimp, crab, halibut, cod, and tuna in the coastal waters and rivers of
                            Del Norte County. Salmon, sometimes referred to as “river silver,” were
                            caught around Point St. George as early as 1877.
                            Marine fishing, both commercial and sport, continues to be important to
                            the Crescent City economy. In 1995, the annual commercial fish
                            landing at the Crescent City harbor was valued at over $11.6 million.
                            Harbor-related sports fisheries also contributed significantly to fishery-
                            related businesses and the tourist economy.
RECREATION AND TOURISM      Today, one of the biggest industries in Crescent City and Del Norte
                            County is tourism. Historic landmarks relating to early settlement in the
                            Crescent City area are open to the public. Additionally, there are a
                            number of public and commercial tourist attractions within Crescent
                            City including Battery Point Lighthouse and Crescent City Marine
                            Mammal Center.
                            Many tourists in Crescent City come to see the rugged beauty of State
                            and National Parks, which attracts many hikers and campers. Coastal
                            beaches, coastal trails, harbors, and parks provide a variety of water
                            activities. Other natural attractions in Del Norte County include
                            Redwood National Park, Jedediah Smith Redwood State Park, Del Norte
                            Coast Redwood State Park, Smith River National Recreation Area, and
                            the Lake Earl State Park and Wildlife Area. Commercial visitor
                            attractions, a variety of accommodations, and visitor services are located
                            in and adjacent to these recreation areas.
TSUNAMI OF 1964             On the early hours of March 28, 1964, a giant tidal wave or tsunami
                            generated by the Great Alaska Earthquake struck Crescent City. Tidal
                            surges, as high as 20 feet, swept up logs from local beaches and crushed
                            them against buildings as the wave swept through the city. Crescent
                            City suffered considerable property damage and loss of life as a result
                            of the tsunami. The devastation extended for approximately two miles
                            along Crescent City harbor and coastline. There were over 11 fatalities,
                            29 city blocks in ruin or partial ruin, and 289 businesses and homes hit
                            causing over $16 million in damages. The Crescent City Harbor was
                            left in a state of near total devastation. The 1964 tsunami exceeded a
                            100-year event at Crescent City and a 500-year event at some other
                            California coastal sites.

 General Plan Summary                                                                Policy Document
                         Crescent City’s combination of near-shore undersea topography,
                         resonant characteristics of the surrounding shoreline, and exposed
                         position on the coast, make the city particulary susceptible to tsunamis
                         originating in the Pacific. Given the intense seismic activity in the
                         Pacific Ocean, Crescent City will continue to be threatened by tsunamis.
PELICAN BAY STATE PRISON The opening of the Pelican Bay State Prison in December 1989 has been
                         a major physical and economic impact on Crescent City. First, the prison
                         brought an influx of prison staff (approximately 1,500 employees) who
                         settled into the Crescent City area. Second, the prison increased traffic
                         north of the city. Third, the prison has increased activity for many small
                         businesses that provide goods and services to the prison. Such small
                         service industries include medical transcription, psychological services,
                         vehicle services, food services/food contracts, recreation contracts, and
                         counseling contracts. Lastly, with the annexation of the prison in 1992,
                         approximately 3,800 inmates were added to the group quarters
                         population. This increase in population means the City gets additional
                         State assistance for local services and improvements. See Figure 3 to
                         see the prison’s location relative to Crescent City.
                         Crescent City initiated its General Plan Update program in September
HOW THIS GENERAL         1997, when it retained a multi-disciplinary consulting team headed by
                         J. Laurence Mintier & Associates. This update process was part of a
                         joint effort by the City and Del Norte County to update their General
                         Plans. The City and County conducted joint public meetings and
                         coordinated land use and policy decision-making for the Crescent City
                         area.
                         As the initial step in the update, the consultants collaborated with the
                         City’s Planning Department to reach out to the community to identify
PLAN WAS PREPARED        the important planning issues in the Crescent City Planning Area. This
                         outreach consisted of a series of townhall meetings to discuss the City’s
                         General Plan Revision.
 May 21, 2001                              8                                Crescent City General Plan

                            Following-up on these meetings, City Staff and the Consultants
                            completed the first major report produced as part of the General Plan
                            Update, the General Plan Background Report. That report describes
                            existing conditions and trends in Crescent City. After completion of the
                            Background Report, the next major step in the Update process was to
                            identify key issues and options for the General Plan. The result was the
                            Policy Issues Report, which presented the most critical policy issues to
                            be addressed in the revised General Plan. These issues emerged from the
                            General Plan Background Report and the input received at the townhall
                            meetings and through public correspondence.
                            Following the simultaneous publication of the Background Report and
                            the Policy Issues Report in May 1998, the City hosted another round of
                            townhall meetings. During these meetings, City Staff and the
                            Consultants explained various issues regarding these documents and
                            provided the public with an opportunity to comment.
                            Based on the discussion at the October 1997 townhall meetings and the
                            comments submitted to the City in response to the May 1998 townhall
                            meetings, the Consultants and City staff began work on this Policy
                            Document. This document embodies a reorganized, updated set of goals
                            and policies from the City’s 1976 General Plan and 1984 Coastal
                            Element, as well as numerous new policies responding to new City
                            needs.
                            Between 1999 and 2001, the City completed the balance of the General
                            Plan, including the Background Report, Policy Issues Report, Policy
                            Document, and Environmental Impact Report.
                            The following summarize the key concepts that serve as the foundation
K     EY CONCEPTS
                            for the Land Use Diagram and the goals, policies, and implementation
                            measures which constitute the formal substance of the Plan.
CONSOLIDATION OF COASTAL    In 1984, the City adopted the Coastal Element of its General Plan as part
AND NON-COASTAL PLANNING    of its Local Coastal Program certification. That action formally divided
POLICY                      the City’s comprehensive planning approach by establishing two sets of
                            policies, one for the non-coastal and uncertified areas (the 1976 General
                            Plan), and one for the areas within the Coastal Zone (see Figure 4)
                            which were certified with the State Coastal Commission (the 1984 Local
                            Coastal Plan). This Policy Document updates and consolidates the
                            City’s planning policies and programs into a single document, unifying
                            policies that had been separated since 1984. Therefore, this General Plan
                            also supersedes the 1984 Local Coastal Plan. Those policies subject to
                            Coastal Commission certification are identified by the wave symbol
                            (     ).

 General Plan Summary                                                                 Policy Document
ECONOMIC TRANSITION       Crescent City and Del Norte County are in transition from a resource
                          production economy to a more diversified economy. Government, retail
                          trade, and services have now become the largest employers in the
                          county. Between 1993 and 1995, prior to initiation of this Plan revision,
                          the Del Norte Economic Development Corporation and Chamber of
                          Commerce 2020 Committee prepared economic reports for the
                          community addressing future economic needs and goals. These reports
                          supported the pursuit of diversified manufacturing, tourism, technology,
                          telecommunication-based businesses, and small business development.
                          This General Plan builds upon those reports by creating goals, policies,
                          and implementation programs to assist the city in its transition.
ADDRESSING POTENTIAL      The city of Crescent City’s population (excluding the prison population)
GROWTH                    has scarcely grown since 1990. As of 1996, the city had a total
                          population of 4,653 (8,334 with the prison population). By the end of
                          the General Plan timeframe (2020), the city is expected to grow to 7,484
                          persons (growing at the historical growth rate of 2.0 percent). This
                          represents an increase of 2,831 persons from the 1996 population. This
                          increase would result in the demand for 1,089 new dwelling units, and
                          new commercial, industrial, and public facility development. Under the
                          same historical growth rate of 2.0 percent, Del Norte County’s total
                          population is expected to grow to approximately 42,000 persons and
                          16,000 dwelling units by the year 2020 (see Figure 5).
                          Since Crescent City has a very limited land supply, the majority of the
                          growth must be accommodated by: 1) promoting infill of vacant and
                          underutilized lots; 2) intensification or reuse of land; and 3) annexing
                          county land. Crescent City will need to become a more compact city.
                          Increased density will have several beneficial effects: 1) limit sprawl
                          and thus reduce pressure for rural residential development; 2) create a
                          more walkable community; 3) increase public transit opportunities; 4)
                          reduce the cost of public services by limiting infrastructure expansion;
                          5) maintain the existing grid system of the city; and 6) minimize the
                          impact of new development on the natural environment.
VI                    SIT This General Plan introduces a new land use designation called Visitor
O                     R   and Local Commercial that promotes both visitor-serving and regional
A                     ND  commercial development. This designation creates a new focus for the
L                     OCA city taking advantage of the exposure of Highway 101 and the
L                     CO
                          recreational amenities of Front Street. The traditional commercial focus
M                     MER
                          on the central business district is replaced by a new focus on land along
CI                    AL
                          Highway 101 and Front Street to accommodate the tourists that frequent
                          these locations (see Figure 6). Along these routes will be a
                          concentration of visitor-serving commercial uses such as quality
                          lodging, dining, shopping, recreation, and entertainment which will
                          create a focus or destination for tourists. The designation is also
  May 21, 2001                            10                                 Crescent City General Plan




                            designed to provide community commercial opportunities that tap into
                            the regional market.
BUSINESS- PROFESSIONAL      This General Plan introduces another land use designation called
DESIGNATION                 Business-Professional. The intent of this designation is to serve as a
                            transition between residential uses on the northwest side and commercial
                            uses located along the Highway 101 couplet and Front Street and to
                            attract and retain professional, administrative, government, business, and
                            related uses (see Figure 7). Uses in this designation primarily include
                            administrative, business, and professional offices.
HIGHWAY 101 AND FRONT       For decades the City, Del Norte County, the Del Norte Local
STREET                      Transportation Commission, and Caltrans have considered the concept
                            of a Highway 101 bypass of Crescent City. The 1976 Crescent City and
                            Del Norte County General Plan proposed four alternative bypass routes
                            that would create a bypass east of the highway’s existing location. The
                            bypass concept (but not a specific route) was adopted by Caltrans and
                            was included in the Regional Transportation Plan. Due to the
                            tremendous cost, environmental impacts, and because the bypass will
                            likely draw business away from the central area of Crescent City, the
                            City opposed the bypass concept.
                            Currently (October 2000), Caltrans is in the process of updating the
                            Route Concept Plan for Highway 101. The Plan will likely meet the
                            City’s goals by improving and enhancing the existing route by
                            reconfiguring traffic lanes to improve traffic flow which will ultimately
                            create a regional center and visitor-serving environment. In addition, the
                            City supports the improvement and enhancement of Front Street to make
                            it more efficient, provide more parking, and make it a pedestrian-friendly
                            environment.
                            Promoting opportunities for pedestrian and bicycle travel is an important
 Crescent City General Plan                   11                                           May 21, 2001

 General Plan Summary                                                                   Policy Document
CITYWIDE                   feature of this General Plan. This plan seeks to expand Crescent City’s
PEDESTRIAN/BICYCLE TRAIL   bike route/trail system in several ways: 1) creating linkages among
                           sidewalks, bike routes, and pedestrian and equestrian trails; 2) creating
                           bicycle links from downtown to the coast; 3) creating a coastal trail from
                           Point St. George to South Beach; and 4) creating better linkages to the
                           Pacific Coast Bike Route (see Figure 8); and 5) creating a linkage from
                           downtown to Redwood National and State Parks. Building such a
                           network of trails will not only enhance alternative modes of travel within
                           the city, but also create additional leisure/recreational opportunities for
                           tourists and residents.
COMPATIBILITY WITH THE DEL To minimize land use conflicts and to promote consistency in
NORTE COUNTY GENERAL PLAN  development standards, the City and Del Norte County have coordinated
                           their general plans. The goals, policies, and implementation measures
                           of the two General Plans are as consistent as practical, given the
                           difference in perspectives between the City and County concerning the
                           future development of the Crescent City area. Additionally, all the land
                           use designations within this General Plan are consistent with those of the
                           Del Norte County General Plan.
                           As noted in the Introduction, the Crescent City General Plan consists of
ORGANIZATION OF THE        two documents: the General Plan Background Report and this General Plan Policy
                           Document.
GENERAL PLAN
GENERAL PLAN BACKGROUND    The General Plan Background Report, which inventories and analyzes
REPORT                     existing conditions and trends in the city of Crescent City, provides the
                           formal supporting documentation for General Plan policy. This report
                           addresses the following 6 subject areas:
                           C  Chapter 1: Resources/Conservation;
                           C  Chapter 2: Land Use and Population;
                           C  Chapter 3: Transportation and Circulation;
                           C  Chapter 4: Public Facilities and Services;
                           C  Chapter 5: Safety; and
                           C  Chapter 6: Noise.
GENERAL PLAN               This General Plan Policy Document is divided into two main parts. Part
POLICY DOCUMENT            I is an introduction and summary of the General Plan, describing the
                           nature of the plan, highlighting the key issues addressed in the plan,
                           setting forth a vision of the city’s development, and outlining the plan’s
                           main proposals. Part I does not constitute formal general plan policy,
                           but is rather a guide to understanding and interpreting Part II of the
                           Policy Document.
 May 21, 2001                                12                                Crescent City General Plan




                            Part II contains explicit statements of goals, policies, standards,
                            implementation programs, and quantified objectives that constitute the
                            formal policy of Crescent City for land use, development, and
                            environmental quality. Part II is divided into seven sections
                            corresponding to the relative importance of their subjects in Crescent
                            City. The sections are as follows:
                            C  Section 1: Land Use and Community Development;
                            C  Section 2: Housing (not part of this update);
                            C  Section 3: Transportation and Circulation;
                            C  Section 4: Public Facilities and Services;
                            C  Section 5: Recreational and Cultural Resources;
                            C  Section 6: Natural Resources/Conservation; and
                            C  Section 7: Safety.
                            Each section includes goal statements relating to different aspects of the
                            issue addressed in the section. Under each goal statement, there are
                            policies which amplify the goal statement. Implementation programs are
                            listed at the end of each section and describe briefly the proposed action,
                            the City agencies or departments with primary responsibility for carrying
                            out the program, and the time frame for accomplishing the program.
                            Section 1 (Land Use and Community Development) also describes the
                            designations appearing on the Land Use Diagram and outlines the
                            legally-required standards of density and intensity for these land use
                            designations. Section 3 (Transportation and Circulation) describes the
                            proposed circulation system, including a description of the street
                            classification system.
                            As indicated earlier, the formal policy content of this General Plan is
                            presented in Part II of this Policy Document. Part II is divided into
                            seven sections, each of which deals with a single topical issue and
                            several subissues related to the main topic. Following is a general
S     UMMARY OF
                            summary of each section set forth in Part II.

 General Plan Summary                                                                              Policy Document
SECTION               This section is the most familiar part of a general plan. It contains the
1:                    Land Use Diagram that prescribes the uses for all land within the
LAND                  Crescent City Planning Area; describes standards for each of the land
USE                   use designations shown on the Land Use Diagram; and presents a series
                      of goals, policies, and programs designed to guide day-to-day decisions
AND
                      concerning land use, development, and environmental protection in
COMMUNITY             Crescent City.
DEVELOPMENT
                      Section 1 contains goals, policies, and programs related to the following
                      issues:
                      C  Growth and Development;
                      C  Residential Development;
                      C  Commercial Development;
                      C  Industrial Development;
                      C  Economic Development;
                      C  Community Design and Appearance; and
                      C  Harbor Development.
Land Use Diagram      The Land Use Diagram depicts 20 land use designations falling within
                      seven major categories (one of which represents simplified County
                      designations), as shown in the following chart:

SECTION 2:                  In August 1992, the Crescent City City Council adopted the City of
HOUSING                     Crescent City & Del Norte County Housing Element jointly with the
(SEPARATE DOCUMENT)         County Board of Supervisors. The element was prepared and adopted
                            according to specific statutory requirements established by the State of
                            California. These requirements include a schedule for periodic updates
                            which calls for the City to update its element in 2003. Because of this
                            schedule, the City’s Housing Element was not updated in conjunction
                            with the General Plan Revision Program, and is, therefore, not included
                            in this Policy Document.
SECTION 3:                  This Policy Document addresses several transportation issues that are
TRANSPORTATION              critical to future development in Crescent City. The most critical
                            consideration related to transportation in Crescent City is the assurance
                            that all new and existing development has safe and reliable access for the
                            motorist, cyclist, and pedestrian. This Policy Document, therefore,
                            concentrates on policies that will ensure the development of a complete
                            roadway and trail system consisting of City-maintained roads, State
                            highways, and bike and pedestrian trails that serve the needs of both
                            residents and visitors. Section 3 focuses on cooperating with other
                            public agencies to develop strategies that will improve the overall
                            operation of Crescent City’s transportation network, and which are
                            feasible, both physically and fiscally.
                            In addition to addressing future roadway plans and improvements,
                            Section 3 of Part II of this Policy Document contains goals, policies, and
                            programs related to the following issues:
                            C State Highways;
                            C City Roads;
                            C Public Transportation;
                            C Non-Motorized Transportation;
                            C Air Transportation;
                            C Maritime Transportation; and
                            C Tele-transportation.
SECTION 4:                  One of the most important results of any comprehensive planning effort
PUBLIC FACILITIES           should be the assurance that all facilities and services needed to
AND SERVICES                adequately serve development will be accounted for. While the
                            development of specific plans for facilities and services is beyond the
                            scope of the General Plan, this Policy Document does establish a
                            framework for guiding planning decisions related to facility
                            development and service provision. The general emphasis of the
                            policies and programs in Section 4 of Part II is on ensuring adequate
                            services, while discouraging unnecessary, wasteful, or inefficient
                            extension of existing systems.

 General Plan Summary                                                             Policy Document
                      The policies and programs articulated in this section will ensure that
                      current and future residents of and businesses in Crescent City are served
                      by a well-rounded, efficient, and environmentally safe system of public
                      facilities and services.
                      The issues covered in this section include the following:
                      C General Public Facilities, and Services;
                      C Water Supply and Delivery;
                      C Wastewater Treatment, Collection, and Disposal;
                      C Solid Waste Disposal;
                      C Storm Drainage and Flooding;
                      C School Facilities;
                      C Protection Services; and
                      C Utilities.
                      C
SECTION 5:            Crescent City is blessed with an outstanding array of recreational and
RECREATIONAL AND      cultural assets. The city’s physical setting provides vast natural
CULTURAL RESOURCES    opportunities for outdoor recreation. In addition, Crescent City has
                      significant historic and cultural richness. The goals, policies, and
                      programs in Section 5 of Part II of this Policy Document articulate
                      Crescent City’s high level of commitment to ensuring high quality
                      recreational opportunities for Crescent City residents and visitors and to
                      preserve the city’s cultural heritage. The provision of access to the city’s
                      natural areas—both coastal and non-coastal— is an essential focus of the
                      goals and policies in Section 5. The policy content of the section is
                      divided into following six topics:
                      C City Parks and Recreation;
                      C Recreation Trails;
                      C Coastal Zone Recreation;
                      C Coastal Zone Public Access;
                      C Coastal Visual Resources;
                      C Private Recreational Facilities and Opportunities; and
                      C Cultural Resources.
SECT                  The natural resources in and around Crescent City contribute to the
ION 6:                city’s economy and are important elements in the quality of life for
NATURAL RESOURCES/    Crescent City’s residents. These resources exist in limited quantity and
CONSERVATION          are at risk of destruction or degradation through continued urban
                      development. Recognizing the importance of this objective, Section 6
                      of this Policy Document presents policies addressing the full range of the
                      city’s natural assets. The section includes goals, policies, and programs
                      addressing the following subjects:

                            C  Timber Resources.
SECTION 7:                  Crescent City is located in a region that is subject to some potentially
HEALTH AND SAFETY           significant natural hazards. Most importantly, the area is vulnerable to
                            earthquakes and their associated seismic effects. The primary intent
                            of this section is to protect Crescent City residents, businesses, and
                            visitors from the harmful effects of natural and man-made hazards. In
                            doing so, the City hopes to protect both the physical well-being of its
                            residents and visitors and to ensure that development investments fully
                            consider the implications of potentially hazardous conditions in the area.
                              The section includes goals, policies, and programs addressing the
                            following subjects:
                            C  General Hazards;
                            C  Seismic Hazards;

                                              PART II
               GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
Part II of this Policy Document contains explicit statements of goals, policies, standards, implementation
programs, and quantified objectives that constitute the formal policy of Crescent City for land use,
development, and environmental quality. Part II is divided into the following seven sections:
C    Section 1: Land Use/Community                       C    Section 5: Recreational and Cultural
                 Development                                              Resources
C    Section 2: Housing                                  C    Section 6: Natural Resources/Conservation
C    Section 3: Transportation and Circulation           C    Section 7: Health & Safety
C    Section 4: Public Facilities and Services
Each section includes goal statements relating to different sub-issues or different aspects of the issue
addressed in the section. Under each goal statement, there are policies which amplify the goal statement.
Implementation programs at the end of each section describe briefly the proposed action, the City
agencies or departments with primary responsibility for carrying out the program, and the time frame for
accomplishing the program. Section 1 (Land Use and Community Development) also describes the
designations appearing on the Land Use Diagram and outlines the legally-required standards of density
and intensity for these land use designations. Section 3 (Transportation) describes the proposed
circulation system, including a description of the street classification system.
The following statements define goals, policies, standards, implementation programs, and quantified
objectives as they are used in this document:
Goal: The ultimate purpose of an effort stated in a way that is general in nature and immeasurable.
Policy: A specific statement in text or diagram guiding action and implying clear commitment.
Standard: A specific, often quantified, guideline incorporated in a policy or implementation program,
     defining the relationship between two or more variables. Standards can often translate directly into
     regulatory controls.
Implementation Program: An action, procedure, program, or technique that carries out general plan
     policy. Implementation programs also specify primary responsibility for carrying out the action and
     a time frame for its accomplishment.
Quantified Objective (Housing only): The number of housing units that the City expects to be
     constructed and the number of households the City expects will be assisted through Housing Element
     programs and based on general market conditions during the time frame of the element.
To interpret and understand the City’s overall land use and development philosophy, users of this Policy
Document should remember that the goals, policies, and programs articulated in Part II are as important, if
not more so, than the Land Use Diagram. Accordingly, any review of development proposals must
consider this Policy Document as a whole, rather than focusing solely on the Land Use Diagram or on
particular policies and programs.
This Policy Document updates and consolidates the City’s planning policies and programs into a single

document, unifying policies that had been separated since 1984. Those policies which remain unique to
the Coastal Zone have been identified by the wave symbol (       ). Those policies which are not a part of
the City’s Local Coastal Plan have been identified by a crescent symbol ( ). All other policies apply
citywide, including the Coastal Zone.

                                           SECTION 1
                                     LAND USE AND
                     COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
This section contains diagrams, designations, standards, goals, policies, and programs that set the basic
framework to guide the type, location, intensity, and quality of future development and the protection of
Crescent City’s natural and built environment.
LAND USE DIAGRAM AND STANDARDS
The most familiar part of any general plan is the map, or land use diagram, showing the types and locations
of development called for in the plan. In order to accurately interpret the development implications of the
various designations shown on the diagram, the reader must understand the intent of and the standards for
each designation. The following sub-sections first describe how the standards are expressed generally, then
outline the standards for each of the designations shown on Crescent City’s General Plan Land Use Diagram.
PLANNING AREA
State planning law requires that the general plan cover all territory with the boundaries of the adopting city
or county as well as “any land outside its boundary which in the planning agency’s judgement bears relation
to its planning” (Government Code Section 65300). To carry out this directive, most cities formally delineate
a “planning area” boundary in their general plans. For the purposes of the Crescent City General Plan, the
Planning Area is defined by an east west line coinciding with Blackwell Road, following south along Elk
Valley Road, and then following the Federal and State lands on the east. Figure 2 shows the boundary of the
Planning Area.
URBAN BOUNDARY
Within part of the Planning Area, the City and County have defined an urban boundary line that encompasses
all land considered for future water and sewer service expansion and thus for future urban development and
annexation (see Figure 2). Since it is costly to provide infrastructure in low density areas such as rural
communities, extension of water and sewer service is generally prohibited outside this boundary by both
jurisdictions. Since development within this boundary is subject to higher densities and intensities, the City
and County can provide long-term service planning within this area.
ALLOWABLE USES AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
Each of the designations shown on the Land Use Diagram provides for a unique range of allowable uses
consistent with the intent of the designation. The uses specified in the following subsections for each
designation are indicative, not inclusive, of the range of uses allowed in the designation. Zoning more
precisely specifies the allowable uses for individual parcels, consistent with General Plan prescriptions. In
addition to the principal uses, the Zoning Ordinance typically authorizes similar and compatible uses, such
as incidental or accessory uses (e.g., garage in a single family district) and public and quasi-public uses (e.g.,
fire station or church in a single-family district). Generally one zoning district is used to implement a land
use designation. Some areas may, however, be subject to transitional designations, such as a rural residential
zone used within an urban boundary until community services can be provided. Table 1-1 provides a matrix

Section 1: Land Use and Community Development                                                      Policy Document
indicating which zoning districts are considered consistent with the specified General Plan land use
designations.
In some cases, uses are found which were legally established prior to the adoption of a land use designation
or zoning and are not in conformance with uses permitted in such designations. These are known as “non-
conforming uses.” Existing non-conforming uses may be continued, but may not be expanded.
State law requires that general plans include standards of population density and/or building intensity for all
of the territory covered by the plan. To satisfy this requirement, this General Plan includes standards for each
of the land use designations appearing on the Land Use Diagram. These standards are stated differently for
residential and non-residential development (see Table 1-2).

Policy Document                                                      Section 1: Land Use and Community Development
Residential Uses
Standards of development density for residential uses are stated in terms of the allowable range of dwelling
units per net acre. For purposes of determining maximum development entitlements, the total area of a
particular parcel or lot is calculated. Where public roadways are involved, the total area is determined by
subtracting the area dedicated as a public right-of-way; where private roads are involved, the right-of-way
is not subtracted, so the total area is synonymous with the gross area. Where multiple designations are found
on a property, the density of each designation is calculated individually.
The policies of this General Plan require that project design reflect and consider natural features, suitability
of soils, availability of water, hazards, circulation, and the relationship of the project to surrounding uses.
The actual density of residential development and intensity of commercial development, as well as lot
patterns, will be determined by these and other factors. As a result, the maximum density specified by land
use designations or zoning for a given parcel of land may not be realized. This General Plan also has
provisions for clustering gross density on a project-wide basis, thus permitting overall density to be clustered
into pockets of higher density development within the project that are balanced by areas of lower density,
while not changing the overall designated density. This program provides for easier mitigation of
environmental factors with minimal loss of development density.
In accordance with the Coastal Housing Act, local governments are required to encourage the provision of
low and/or moderate income housing as a part of residential development projects within the Coastal Zone.
Projects that include residential development must be reviewed for consistency with the requirements of the
Act for low- and moderate-income housing. Also, the provision of bonus densities and/or other incentives
as outlined in the Act as defined by the State housing regulations for low- and moderate-income housing shall
be permitted, subject to review on a case-by-case basis. Where bonus densities are provided, environmental
impacts shall either be determined to be insignificant or mitigated to less-than-significant level, and a program
verifying that the bonus units will be occupied by low- and/or moderate-income households shall be
approved.
Also Pursuant to California Government Code (Sec. 65915 et seq) and the Coastal Housing Act, the granting
of a bonus in density for residential development that provides qualifying low- and/or moderate- income
housing shall be permitted, subject to individual project review. As defined by State law, the additional
density is to be calculated based on the maximum basic density identified by the Land Use Diagram. No
change in the basic permitted density itself shall be necessary for the bonus, provided that the following
findings are made:
         a)       The proposal is found to qualify for bonus units under State guidelines; and
         b)       A program for insuring continued use as low and/or moderate income units is included in
                  any approval.
Where bonus units that have been approved and constructed are proposed to be converted to non-low- or
moderate-income use, a General Plan amendment making the Land Use Diagram density and overall
(original) project area density consistent with each other shall have been approved first before the conversion
is permitted.
Under California Government Code (Sec 65852.1), the City also continues to consider use permits for second
dwellings for seniors (“granny housing”) which, subject to public health and safety issues, shall be deemed
a residential use consistent with the single family and multifamily designations of this Plan. Such units shall
not be considered to exceed the allowable density for the lot upon which it is located.
Departing from the City’s past practices, this General Plan specifies residential development standards in
terms of a range of dwelling units per acre. In the past, the City’s standards specified only the maximum
number of units permitted per acre. The difference is that the updated standards also specify a minimum

Section 1: Land Use and Community Development                                                             Policy Document
density for residential designations. The new approach responds to the City’s Housing Element (adopted in
1992), which includes a policy and a program calling for establishment of minimum residential densities to
“limit underutilization of land and maximize development potential.” The specification of minimum densities
also allows for more certainty with respect the nature of future development and the overall development
pattern. This certainty is critical to effective infrastructure planning and financing in urban areas (e.g., sizing
of service lines and treatment facilities and establishing financing mechanisms and fee structures). The
specification of minimum residential densities is also valuable to private property interests since it allows for
a more definitive determination of the type of development likely to occur or be permitted in a particular area.
Non-Residential Uses
This General Plan presents standards of building intensity for non-                  Various Building Configurations
residential uses such as commercial and industrial development in                 Representing a Floor-Area Ratio of 1.00
terms of maximum floor-area ratios (FARs). A floor-area ratio is the                          on the Same Lot
ratio of the gross building square footage on a lot to the net square
footage of the lot (or parcel). For example, on a lot with 10,000 net
square feet of land area, an FAR of 1.00 will allow 10,000 square feet
of gross square feet of building floor area to be built, regardless of the
number of stories in the building (e.g., 5,000 square feet per floor on
two floors or 10,000 square feet on one floor). On the same 10,000-
square-foot lot, an FAR of 0.50 would allow 5,000 square feet of floor
area, and an FAR of 0.25 would allow 2,500 square feet. The
diagram to the right shows graphically how various building
configurations representing an FAR of 1.00 could cover a lot.
The FAR standards presented in this report were developed based on consideration of factors such as sewage
disposal methods, parking requirements, and building height needs or limitations. FAR standards can, in turn,
assist in assessing such planning questions as potential traffic generation, or sewer and water line needs in
areas not yet fully developed.
Some land use designations and types of development may not be entirely compatible with the typical density
or FAR approaches. These include commercial mobilehome parks and campgrounds, and resource land use
designations such as timberland and agriculture. In the former case, special development conditions can be
utilized setting a density ratio of spaces to acreage, rather than residential units per acre. Resources lands are
generally focused upon resource production with minimum parcel sizes set for management purposes.
Residential development can be viewed as accessory activity or as not necessary to the primary use and can
be limited or prohibited. Structures associated with resource production activities, such as barns, storage, or
milling buildings, are also typically secondary.
LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
The Land Use Diagram of this General Plan, which follows page 1-26, uses 21 residential, commercial,
industrial, and other land use designations to depict the types of land uses that will be allowed in the different
geographic areas of Crescent City’s Planning Area.

The following sections set forth the purpose of each designation appearing on the Land Use
Diagram.
RESIDENTIAL
Residential 0-2 (SF 0-2)
This designation provides for very low to low density residential development within the urban boundary that
has few or no community services, or where only community water is available. The need for development
of these areas at higher urban densities is dependent upon the extension of urban services. Residential density
may not exceed two dwelling units per acre. The principal permitted use under the Residential 0-2
designation is single family residential with accessory buildings and home occupations. The City may grant
conditional use permits for home enterprise, second units, guest lodging, small public facilities, large care
homes as defined by the California Health and Safety Code, and small, non-intensive, quiet, neighborhood
commercial uses such as grocery stores that are compatible with surrounding neighborhoods. Farm animals
should be limited generally to larger parcels.
Residential 2-6 (SF 2-6)
This designation provides for low to moderate residential development within the urban boundary. The
principal permitted uses under this designation are single family dwellings with accessory buildings and home
occupations. Residential densities range from two to six dwelling units per acre. The City may grant
conditional use permits for churches, second units, guest lodging, parking lots, small public facilities, large
care homes as defined by the California Health and Safety Code, and small neighborhood commercial uses
that are compatible with surrounding neighborhoods, such as owner/resident grocery shops.
Multi-Family Residential 6-15 (MF 6-15)
This designation provides for moderate to high density residential development within the urban boundary.
Residential densities range from a minimum of six to a maximum of 15 dwelling units per acre. The principal
permitted uses are duplexes and clustered multiple-unit buildings. Other uses permitted in this designation
include single family dwellings, accessory buildings, and home occupations. The City may grant conditional
use permits for churches, day care (exceeding 14 children), convalescent or assisted care homes, professional
offices, guest lodging, parking lots, and small public facilities.
Multi-Family Residential 15-30 (MF 15-30)
This designation provides for high density residential development within the urban boundary. Residential
densities range from a minimum of 15 to a maximum of 30 dwelling units per acre. The principal permitted
use under this designation is multiple-unit buildings. Other uses in this designation include two-family
dwellings, townhouses (row houses), rooming houses, accessory buildings, and home occupations. The City
may grant conditional use permits for churches, day care (exceeding 14 children), dormitories, guest lodging,
convalescent or assisted care homes, nonprofit organizations, parking lots, and small public facilities.
Mobilehome Park (MHPK)
This designation provides for mobilehome residential use in a mobilehome park setting. Uses that may be

Light Industrial (LI)
This designation provides for mixed commercial, heavy commercial, and light, non-nuisance industrial uses
that may not require prime retail sales and industrial manufacturing locations. This designation is intended
primarily for establishments engaged in serving equipment, materials and products, but which do not
necessarily require the manufacturing, assembling, packaging, or processing of articles or merchandise for
distribution and retail sales. These areas may also serve as transition areas between general industrial uses
and less intense commercial, residential, or resource areas. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for light
industrial designation development is 0.50. The principal permitted uses include, but are not limited to,
general commercial uses (not including residential, hospital, or convalescent home uses); retail sales; enclosed

industries. The principal permitted uses shall include, but not be limited to, storage; warehousing; machine
and welding shops; outdoor contractor sales and storage yards; light manufacturing where no significant air,
odor, water, visual or hazard issue is found; retail sales; and offices. This may include existing industrial use
areas that have limited effect on surrounding uses; areas which have historically served resource production
and related product manufacturing; and areas of potential limited industrial use which would be subject to
physical performance standards. Its purpose is to provide for such industry and manufacturing and to prevent
the intrusion of incompatible uses which could curtail economic production. The maximum floor area ratio
(FAR) for industrial designation development is 0.60.
The City may grant a conditional use permit for uses such as mineral processing, animal product processing,
wood processing, hazardous materials processing or production, vehicle dismantling, recycled materials
processing, or other uses that may be objectionable due to offensive air, odor, water, visual, or hazardous
conditions. Non-residential public uses may also be granted. No permanent or transient residential

Open Space (OS)
This designation is intended to set aside areas to be used for permanent open space to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of the people and visitors of the Crescent City area and to provide spaces for the location
and preservation of unusual natural features, historical and cultural sites, and areas that provide energy, water,
and recreational activities. This designation is also intended to set aside areas to be used for wind or weather
screens and for visual effect. Public property uses include, but are not limited to, parks and playgrounds, vista
areas, general open spaces, beaches, wooded areas, drainage canals and channels, airport flight path zones,
and marinas. Private property uses include commercial recreation, farming, energy production, transmission
corridors, mineral production, water conservation, cemeteries, and marinas.
Natural Resource (NR)
The Natural Resource (NR) designation provides for the protection, enhancement, and restoration of
environmentally-sensitive habitat areas and for resource dependent uses consistent with the continuance of
such uses. This designation applies to sensitive habitat areas including coastal sand dunes, coastal wetlands,
and riparian corridors (i.e., Elk Creek). Due to the nature of the designation, its density is zero. However,
subject to dedication of easement or ownership of undisturbed NR habitat as part of a development project,
an incentive density may be granted for use in non-NR portions of the same parcel. The incentive shall not
exceed the lowest density land use designation immediately adjacent to the habitat areas multiplied by the
area of the habitat to be dedicated, divided by three. Dedication should be to a public or quasi-public agency
at the time of development.
The allowable uses within designated NR shall be limited to:
     1.  Fish and wildlife management;
     2.  Nature study;
     3.  Wetland restoration;
     4.  Hunting and fishing including development of duck blinds and similar minor facilities;
     5.  Those recreational facilities included in a State Park and Recreation/Department of Fish and Game
         Master Plan submitted and approved as an amendment to the Local Coastal Program;
     6. In all areas, the maintenance of flood drainage control and drainage channels;
     7. In all areas, removal of windblown trees which threaten existing structures;
     8. In riparian habitat areas the following uses are allowed:
         a. Recreational trails;
         b. Hunting and fishing;
         c. Maintenance of existing flood control and drainage channels;
         d. Wells within rural areas;
         e. Road maintenance and repair of existing roads. New stream crossings shall be limited when
              feasible to right angle crossings of streams and stream corridors.
No single-family residences or other structures shall be permitted within an NR area, unless it would result
in denial of substantially all reasonable use of the parcel of land.

GENERALIZED COUNTY DESIGNATIONS
The generalized county designations are simplified designations that combine several county designations
to areas outside the urban boundary but within the Planning Area. Since these areas are outside of the urban
boundary and thus lack services such as water and sewer, it is unlikely the City will annex any of this land
within the timeframe of the General Plan (2020).
County Resources (CR)
The County Resources designation applies to areas where timber and agricultural production are the primary
focus. Other development is minimal and the provision of public services is limited. County designations
included under this broad category include:
C    Agricultural General (AG-5)
C    Agricultural General (AG-20)
C    Timberland (TBR)
C    Greenery (G)
C    Resource Conservation Area (RCA)
County Rural Development (CRD)
The County Rural Development designation applies to areas where a rural lifestyle prevails and services are
provided by a combination of private on-site and limited public facilities. County designations included
under this broad category include:
C    Rural Mobilehome Park (RMP)
C    Rural Neighborhood (RN)
C    Rural Residential 1 du/ac (RR1A)
C    Rural Residential 1 du/2 ac (RR2A)
C    Visitor-Serving Commercial (VSC)

GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
Goal 1.A. To encourage the overall economic and social growth of the City while maintaining its position
              of importance in the county and improving its overall aesthetic appeal.
Policies
1.A.1.        The City shall provide for an orderly outward expansion/annexation of new and existing urban
              development within the Urban Boundary so that it is contiguous with existing development,
              allows for the efficient and incremental expansion of infrastructure and public services, and
              minimizes impacts on the environment.
1.A.2.        The City shall encourage infill development that makes efficient use of existing public
              infrastructure and is compatible with existing development.

          7.  Need for Upgrading Existing             To what degree do existing drainage systems, water delivery systems, sewer
              Infrastructure                          collection systems, streets and roads, and other infrastructure need to be brought up
                                                      to city standards; can the city bear this cost?

               Time Frame: Ongoing
COMMUNITY DESIGN, VISUAL QUALITY, AND APPEARANCE
Goal 1.J.      To maintain and enhance the quality of Crescent City’s built environment (i.e., historical
               buildings, major corridors, city entrances, landscape, and streetscape).
Policies
1.J.1.    The City shall preserve, to the greatest degree possible, the remaining older structures which serve
          as a physical reminder of the City’s historical past. The City shall give priority to preserving those
          structures of architectural or historical significance.
1.J.2.    The City shall work jointly with the Redevelopment Agency to aggressively support facade
          improvements for buildings in the VLC area, including provision of incentives. Buildings along the
          Highway 101 couplet, Front Street, and 3rd Street should have the highest priority.
1.J.3.    The City shall make the improvement or removal of dilapidated buildings throughout the city a code
          enforcement program priority. This is particularly important in the downtown area and the residential
          neighborhoods of the city.
1.J.4.    The City shall selectively allow conversion of older structures from single-family residential to other
          uses (such as commercial or multi-family residential) if the intrinsic character and outward
          appearance of the structure is not altered. Demolition of these structures should be very selective.
1.J.5.    The City shall ensure that all new development in the Crescent City area be of quality design and
          provide an adequate level of amenities.
1.J.6     The City shall develop an active program for providing public art.

1.J.7.   The City shall pursue streetscape improvements, such as public art, landscaping, and street
         enhancement, in the VLC area.
1.J.8.   The City shall establish landmark features (e.g., sculptures) at the terminus of key downtown area
         streets, most importantly where Front Street and 9th Street meet Highway 101.
1.J.9.   The City shall work jointly with the Redevelopment Agency to develop community gateway entry
         facilities.
1.J.10. The City’s major highway entrances should be developed as scenic corridors through the use of an
         architectural design theme, removal of overhead utilities, landscaping, and similar measures to
         improve the appearance of the approaches to the City.
1.J.11. The City shall work jointly with the Redevelopment Agency to create unified landscaping and
         streetscape elements (i.e., streetlights, seating, signage, and banners), to create a downtown identity,
         and to unify the three central theme elements of Crescent City (i.e., Redwood National Park, Seacoast
         Fishing Village, and Crescent City’s historical past (e.g. 1964 Tsunami)).
1.J.12. The City shall work jointly with the Redevelopment Agency to enhance the pedestrian environment
         through streetscape elements such as attractive planter boxes, comfortable seating, attractive and
         functional lighting and street signs, and attractive trash receptacles.
1.J.13. The City shall replace “freeway style” streetlights with more attractive “human scale” lights.
1.J.14. The City shall encourage and assist in the development of murals to enliven blank walls in the areas
         designated Visitor and Local Commercial (VLC) and Business Professional (BP). The murals shall
         be consistent with the city’s three central themes.
Implementation Programs
See Implementation Program 1.1.
HARBOR DEVELOPMENT
Goal 1.K. To ensure optimum utilization of the Harbor’s commercial tourism and recreational potential,
              while allowing for appropriate public and private uses, developing access as a Harbor,
              conserving the Harbor’s open water, improving the Harbor’s aesthetic appeal, and increasing its
              economic viability.
Harbor Development Policies
1.K.1. The continuing development and expansion of the Harbor should seek to satisfy as reasonably as
         possible all commercial, recreational, and public demands. In planning for the limited area of the
         Harbor, the plan should consider reserving portions of the Harbor area and its expansion area in the
         following three categories:
              1. Harbor Dependent: Those activities which would require immediate access to the Harbor
                   waters;
              2. Harbor Related: Activities which are dependent in some way upon a Harbor location; and
              3. Harbor Consistent: Activities which would benefit from a Harbor location and would
                   enhance the overall viability of the Harbor.
Crescent City General Plan                               1-21                                           May 21, 2001

Section 1: Land Use and Community Development                                                      Policy Document
1.K.2. The City should encourage the Harbor District to adopt design criteria for new construction in the
          Harbor, specifically in regards to establishing a motif for commercial activities.       (Revised)
1.K.3. The City, County, and Harbor District should continue to effectively plan and coordinate for the
          overall development of the Harbor and its adjacent land.
Harbor Safety and Design Policies
1.K.4. The City, County, and Harbor District should continue to petition appropriate Federal and State
          agencies to accelerate the study of litoral sand movement and its relationship to harbor sanding,
          beach sand replenishment, coastal bluff erosion (north of Battery Point), and suitable locations for
          ocean disposal.
1.K.5. The City, County, and Harbor District should apply for assistance in evaluation of the cost-benefit
          ratio of an extension of the breakwater system in relationship not only to tonnage shipped from the
          harbor, but also in protecting the substantial investment in local, State, and Federal agencies.
1.K.6. Since the present Coast Guard Dock and Station do not allow an immediate view of vessels crossing
          the entrance bar and the dock locates the cutter in the more congested area of the Harbor (which
          increased its time to be underway), the City and County should encourage the Harbor District and
          Coast Guard to consider removing personnel quarters and docking facility away from the congested
          area of the inner harbor basin . The dock could be of filled material which reduce maintenance and
          increase available space.
1.K.7. The City should build a Coast Guard Helicopter pad facility in the Harbor area for emergency use.
          In that this use would be infrequent and not water dependent, the City shall consider the Harbor area
          east of Highway 101.
1.K.8. Since the wooden construction of Citizen’s Dock is expensive to maintain and costly to insure, the
          City should consider studying the feasibility of replacing the wooden structure with aggregate fill.
1.K.9. The City shall locate energy facilities, oil and gas development, tanker facilities, refineries, electric
          generating plants, and electric cogenerating projects within those areas designated as Harbor Related.
          The City shall allow the development of such a facility upon the inclusion and approval of the proper
          protection devices to prevent crude oil, gas, petroleum, or other hazardous substances from being
          spilled, or from contaminating areas beyond the project site.
Diking, Dredging, Filling, and Shoreline Structure Policies
1.K.10. The City shall be supportive of any permitted Harbor dredging which will encourage harbor
          development.
1.K.11. The City shall limit the filling and dredging of coastal waters to those uses that are consistent with
          Section 30233 of the California Coastal Act, and which directly enhance harbor dependent uses such
          as recreational or industrial programs.
1.K.12. The City shall restrict the diking, dredging, and filling of wetlands in Elk Creek and McNamara
          annexation within the Coastal Zone to those allowable uses identified within Section 30233 of the
          California Coastal Act.
1.K.13. The City shall, in conjunction with the Harbor District, County of Del Norte, Del Norte Hospital
          District, Coastal Commission staff, and the Department of Fish and Game, develop a sand
May 21, 2001                                           1-22                              Crescent City General Plan

         management program for the dispersal of sand on existing fine-grained sand beaches only. The plan
         shall include, but not be limited to, the amount of sand to be placed yearly, months of the year when
         placement is possible, hours of operation, and the need for an annual sand budget. Any such program
         shall require a Local Coastal Plan amendment approved by the California Coast Commission.
1.K.14. The City’s priority for use of any dredged sand is to be for the Battery Point Recreational Area
         development. The placement of sand in this area shall conform with any sand management program
         approved by the California Coastal Commission and the following restrictions:
              The following uses for said sand are prohibited:
                  C The development of a parking and picnic area.
                  C The filling between Battery Point and the mainland.
         If the recreational boating marine takes place, the placement of sand for a jetty shall be the least
         amount needed to provide for a single-wide roadway on top of the jetty.
1.K.15. If the recreational boating marina takes place, the City shall ensure that the placement of sand for a
         jetty be the least amount needed to provide for a single-wide roadway on top of the jetty.
1.K.16. The City shall require that new development minimize risks to life and property in areas of high
         geologic hazard, assure stability and structural integrity, and neither create nor contribute
         significantly to erosion, geologic instability, or destruction of the site or surrounding area or in any
         way require the construction of protective devices that would substantially alter natural landforms
         along bluffs and cliffs.
1.K.17. The City shall approve revetments, breakwaters, groins, harbor channels, seawall, cliff retaining wall,
         and other such construction that alters natural shoreline processes when required to serve coastal-
         dependent uses or to protect existing structures or public beaches in danger from erosion, and when
         designed to eliminate or mitigate adverse impacts on local shoreline sand supply. “Existing
         structure” means a structure in existence on March 14, 2001.
1.K.18. The City shall include a condition in the approval of all new development on ocean fronting parcels
         that no shoreline protective structure shall be allowed in the future to protect the development from
         bluff erosion. Prior to the issuance of a coastal development permit for the development, a deed
         restriction acceptable to the Planning Director shall be recorded memorializing the prohibition on
         future shoreline protective structures.
Implementation Programs
Existing programs are deemed sufficient.

Housing Goals and Programs
Following are the goals, policies, and program objectives, which have been developed
in consultation with local governmental agencies and non-profit organizations which are
active in addressing housing issues in the community. Reflected in these statements is
an overall intent to continue with the successful approach of reliance on the open
housing market and local government encouragement of projects oriented to special
needs
GOAL A: To insure total dwelling capacity equal to the County and City new
construction objectives outlined in the above Housing Program Objectives table for the
2001-2008 time period.
The City and County Vacant Land studies (Housing Background Tables 29 and 30)
indicate that the feasible potential of vacant land for the 2001-2008 period is 1,078 units
in the City and 2,650 units in the County. These amounts will easily accommodate the
projected needs outlined in the Housing Program Objectives table.

CITY OF CRESCENT CITY AND DEL NORTE COUNTY
The Background section indicates that City and County off-site improvement
requirements are limited, that permit fees do not equal total cost, and that permit
processing times are basically speedy, increasing only as involvement with State review
agencies increases. The continuing financial constraints of small California
communities such as the City and County limit the ability to provide additional staffing or
blanket relief of costs. However, both the City and County have considered requests on
a case-by-case basis for targeted income projects.
POLICIES
2.D.1. The City and County shall continue to maintain opportunities for all income
groups by use of clustered development to maximize density and minimize land
development and/or construction costs.
2.D.2. The County will continue to give special consideration to housing projects for
very low and low-income groups by considering bonding assistance, deferred
agreements, or improvement waivers on a case-by-case basis.
2.D.3. The City will continue to give special consideration to housing projects for very
low and low-income groups by considering zero-interest loans for sidewalks, deferred
agreements, Redevelopment Agency loans or grants, or parking and setback waivers
on a case-by-case basis.
2.D.4. The City and County will continue to provide comment when state or federal
policies place additional constraints or costs which impact housing development.
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS:
2.24. The County will develop proposals for zoning ordinance amendments providing for
the development of parcels consistent with General Plan densities, and re-examining
the minimum project size for D cluster and PC Planned Community zones, in order to
provide for maximization of density for any potential project.

            Timeframe:                  2001-2004
GOAL E: To conserve and improve existing housing stock.
Conservation of housing stock includes both the preservation of structures and retention
of assistance for affordable units. Based upon the history of rehabilitation efforts and
the continual aging of the housing stock, the Background section estimates that
approximately on-third of the housing stock over 30 years in age will need rehabilitative
work. This is reflected as a quantified objective reflected in the Housing Program
Objectives table at the beginning of this Section. As assessment of assisted units

        TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION
This section outlines the City’s goals, policies, and programs for the continued development and enhancement
of Crescent City’s transportation and circulation system. The section includes goals, policies, and programs
addressing the following subjects:
C   Street and Highway System;
C   Public Transportation;
C   Bicycle Transportation;
C   Pedestrian Transportation;
C   Air Transportation;
C   Maritime Transportation; and
C   Teletransportation.
CIRCULATION DIAGRAM
The Circulation Diagram depicts the proposed circulation system for the City of Crescent City to support
existing and planned development under the Land Use Diagram (see Figure 3-1). The circulation system is
also listed in Table 3-1. This circulation system is shown on the diagram by means of a set of roadway
classifications, developed to guide Crescent City’s long-range planning and programming. Roadways are
classified in this system based on the linkages they provide, their function in the hierarchy of roadways, and
their importance to the land use pattern, traveler, and general welfare.
ROADWAY FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
Roadways serve two necessary but conflicting, functions: mobility and property access. High and constant
speeds, with few interruptions and limited conflicting traffic, are desirable for mobility. A functional
classification system provides for specialization in meeting the access and mobility requirements of the
development permitted under the General Plan. Local streets emphasize property access; freeways and
arterials emphasize high mobility for through-traffic; and collectors attempt to achieve a balance between both
functions.
An efficient transportation system is an important component of a strong and dynamic economy. Access
control is the greatest single correlative to traffic safety and regional mobility. Good access management
practices will ensure that the transportation system will continue to serve the needs of Crescent City by
insuring safe, efficient, and convenient mobility.
The Circulation Diagram represents the official functional classification of existing and proposed streets,
roadways, and highways in the city. This diagram depicts the State highways, arterial, and collector roadway
system in Crescent City. All other roadways are classified as local streets. The following paragraphs define
the linkage and functions provided by each class of roadways.

ROADWAY NETWORK
Freeways
Freeways are facilities that exclusively have a traffic-carrying role. No access is provided to freeways except
at designated interchanges. Freeways are designed to be high speed, high capacity facilities intended to move
as many as 20,000 cars per lane per day. Currently, the only freeway in Crescent City is the portion of U.S.
101 north of Parkway Drive.
May 21, 2001                                                    3-2                             Crescent City General Plan


Policy Document                                                              Section 3: Transportation and Circulation
Arterials
Arterial streets are intended to serve moderate levels of through traffic, but they tend to provide some access
to adjacent land uses as well. Particularly in the central portion of Crescent City on U.S. 101, the provision
of access to the adjacent land is quite important. Arterial streets will typically have four to six lanes (total)
for through traffic, and if the right-of-way permits, a separate median lane for left turn movements. Usually,
median lanes are landscaped so that turns can only be made at intersections. However, the median may be
striped to allow turns into and from driveways to be made from the median. Ideally, arterial streets will be
designed to concentrate access points through the provision of common driveways or possibly by locating
driveways on a cross-street where the opportunity exists. Arterial streets are usually designed so that the only
interruption to through-traffic flow is due to the presence of traffic signals at key crossing locations.
Within the Crescent City limits, U.S. 101 and Northcrest Drive function as arterial streets. Front Street is
designed as an arterial street with four lanes plus a left-turn median lane; however, it does not carry the traffic
volume typically associated with an arterial; it is shown as an arterial on Figure 3-1.
U.S. 101 has several cross-sections as it passes through the city. South of Anchor Way, it is a two-lane State
Highway. From Anchor Way to just south of Elk Valley Road, a central two-way left turn median was added.
Between a point south of Elk Valley Road and Front Street, U.S. 101 has two lanes in each direction plus the
left-turn median. The highway becomes a one-way couplet between Front Street and 9th Street, with three
lanes northbound on M Street and two lanes southbound on L Street. From there, the highway reverts to two
through lanes in each direction plus the left turn median to Parkway Drive, where it becomes a freeway. Part
of U.S. 101 between Northcrest Drive and 9th Street contains a third southbound lane; this converts to a
right-turn lane at 9th Street.
Northcrest Drive includes two lanes in each direction plus a left-turn median lane throughout its length within
the city limits. North of Old Mill Road in the unincorporated area, it reverts to a two-lane facility with a
left-turn median in some locations.
Collector Streets
Collector streets connect the local street network with the arterial network, and they also provide access to
adjoining properties. There is generally little driveway control imposed or needed on collectors. They are
differentiated from arterials also in that there may be periodic four-way stop controls along their length. They
differ from local streets in that most local streets are controlled by two-way stop signs at their intersection
with collectors. Collector streets typically have one lane in each direction. In some isolated cases, left turn
lanes may be created at key intersections with arterial streets.
Within the Crescent City limits, the following streets function as collectors: Pebble Beach Drive, A Street,
H Street, Battery Street, Howe Drive, a short section of Elk Valley Road, 5th Street, and 9th Street. Within
Crescent City's unincorporated urban area, the following function as collector streets: Old Mill Road,
Madison Avenue, Washington Boulevard west of Inyo Street, Small Avenue, Harding Avenue, Cooper
Avenue, Pacific Avenue, Inyo Street, Glenn Street, El Dorado Street, Napa, Jefferson, Arlington, Union, and
Meridian Street.
Local Streets
Local streets have the principal function to provide access to adjoining property. They are intended to be low
volume and low speed facilities. Typically, they have one lane in each direction. In urban areas,
the streets are generally wide enough to allow parking on both sides of the street. Local streets are usually
controlled by stop signs at their intersections with arterials and collectors. Stop and/or yield control may also
be present at the intersection of two local streets if conditions warrant.

All streets in the area not designated as freeway, arterial or collectors are defined as local streets.
BICYCLE ROUTE NETWORK
The City of Crescent City established a bike route system that utilizes lightly used residential streets, other
street sections with separate bike lanes, and sections of bike paths. The Del Norte County and Crescent City
Bicycle Facilities Plan identifies a system of bikeway routes in the city and county. The Plan, which was
originally adopted in 1987 and periodically updated, designates bikeway routes in the greater Crescent City
area. Figure 3-2 and Table 3-2 identifies these routes.

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT PROPOSALS
HIGHWAY 101
The City has considered circulation modifications and enhancements of the circulation system to support new
land use concepts contained in this General Plan. One of the most important of the land use concepts is the
creation of a new land use designation that is applied to the Highway 101 couplet corridor between Front
Street and 9th Street and to the Front Street corridor. The new land use designation — Visitor and Local
Commercial (VLC) — is designed to attract regional retail and visitor-serving uses.
Objectives and Description of the Proposed Concept for Highway 101
Highway 101 in Crescent City serves three primary functions:
     P    servicing traffic passing through the city;
     P    servicing traffic accessing the downtown and waterfront areas; and
     P    servicing the lands immediately adjacent to the highway.
Within central Crescent City, Highway 101 performs well at providing a through-traffic function. However,
it is the City’s belief that more can be done to provide service to the greater downtown and waterfront areas,
and to the land area between L and M Streets, which make up the couplet through the city’s center. The
objectives of the proposed modifications are to retain service to through traffic while enhancing the other two
functions.
Improving Service to Adjacent Properties
The City believes that the current (January 2000) configuration of the couplet has excessive through- traffic
capacity which could be used to serve the other functions with no loss in service to through traffic. Both L
and M Streets are 40 feet wide, curb-to-curb. Southbound traffic on L Street is handled by two travel lanes.
Northbound traffic is handled by M Street which is striped for three lanes and serves through traffic. The fact
that traffic is balanced in both directions indicates that two lanes are sufficient to serve the through traffic
component. The couplet can be entered on either end by arterial streets (Highway 101) that each provide two
lanes for through traffic, and there are no plans to widen either of the outer segments. Thus, the third lane
on M Street provides through capacity that is not needed, and is not likely to be needed in the future.
Improving Service to the Waterfront and Central Crescent City
The General Plan designates a “Y-shaped” area starting along the southern part of Highway 101, from A
Street to M Street (bounded by Front and Third Streets), and then north to Ninth Street (bounded by K and
M Streets) as Visitor and Local Commercial (VLC) which provides for regional retail and visitor-serving
commercial uses. Intensification of uses and increased levels of activity are desired in this area, and provision
of improved access to the area is a concern and desire of the City.
Proposed Transportation Improvement Alternatives
Alternative 1: Bulbing of Highway 101 Couplet
By bulbing Highway 101, the couplet would maintain its function of providing through traffic and create a
more pedestrian-friendly environment that is conducive to shopping and other commercial activities.
Designing bulbs into the beginnings of each block can help channelize traffic and also provide streetscaping
opportunities. The bulbs would also reduce the crossing distance for pedestrians.
Crescent City General Plan                             3-5                                              May 21, 2001

Section 3: Transportation and Circulation                                                           Policy Document
The third lane on M Street could be refocused into a left-turn lane, and a similar concept could be applied to
L Street (See 3-3a). Left-turn lanes could better serve the block between the two streets and enhance access
onto and from the parcels within the couplet. This concept is similar to what has recently been constructed
on Highway 101 in the center of Eureka (except that in Eureka, the couplet is wide enough to provide for
three through lanes and parking on both sides).
Alternative 2: Roundabout at the “S-Curve”
The second alternative involves improving access to the downtown and Front Street by redesigning the area
known as the “S-Curve” just south of Front Street. The concept shown in Figure 3-3a uses many of the
elements of a traffic circle to place more emphasis on allowing northbound traffic to turn left onto Front Street
from Highway 101. It incorporates the traffic signal proposed at the Front Street/L Street intersection. Front
Street between L and M Streets is proposed to be effectively converted to a one-way westbound operation,
and creating half of a traffic circle for northbound-to-westbound traffic provides a higher-speed left turn lane.
Eastbound traffic from Front Street is also directed around the circle, and the southern half of the circle
creates a new opportunity to turn left. Because the space is too small to create a true circle, the eastbound-to-
northbound traffic is controlled by a stop sign.
The concept is intended to retain the proposed safety improvements that should occur with the installation
of the L Street and Front Street traffic signal while reducing, removing, and/or better controlling other key
conflicting traffic movements. It also is intended to make the accessibility to Front Street and the intensified
commercial area more attractive to northbound traffic.
Alternative 3A: Front Street - Closure at M Street
To prevent possible cut-over traffic from the new stop sign location at the roundabout on the southern
entrance of the couplet, the third alternative proposes that the eastern leg of the M/Front Street intersection
be closed, with access to this area being provided by the current connection from N Street (See Figure 3-3a).
Alternative 3B: Front Street - Right turn only
Another alternative for Front Street at the M/Front Street intersection is to keep the street open, but only allow
for right turns onto M Street/Highway 101 from Front Street. Since a right turn from Highway 101 onto
Front Street would likely slow down traffic into the city, such a turn would be prohibited (See Figure 3-3b).
Alternative 4: Combination of Alternatives 1, 2, & 3A or 3B
Alternative 4 includes selecting two of the three or all three of the alternatives.
FRONT STREET
The Visitor and Local Commercial (VLC) designation also applies to Front Street. Similar to the
improvements to Highway 101, the City has considered circulation modifications and enhancements to Front
Street to support regional retail and visitor-serving uses.

Policy Document                                                              Section 3: Transportation and Circulation
Objectives and Description of the Proposed Concept for Front Street
Front Street in Crescent City between D and L Streets is 78-feet wide, and is currently striped to provide two
lanes for through traffic in each direction as well as a median for left-turning traffic. This existing
configuration provides significantly more capacity than is needed on this street, and significantly more than
will be needed in the foreseeable future. The intent of the proposed concept is to make better use of the street
for other functions.
There are periodic events in the Beachfront Park area and in the adjoining cultural institutions which require
more parking than is available in the immediate vicinity. There is no general parking shortage most of the
time, except for larger events where people must walk several blocks from available parking. One possible
treatment for Front Street is to simply narrow the street, moving the south-side curb in, and turning the land
into more park area. However, that is an expensive proposal, and there is no shortage of parkland in the
vicinity.
The proposed concept is to increase the parking supply for Beachfront Park and the cultural institutions by
creating angle parking on the south side of the street. The design provides for an island separating the angle
parking from the single remaining eastbound through lane, so that potential safety problems inherent in angle
parking are minimized. The concept provides for one lane in each direction for through traffic, retention of
the median (in a different location) to serve left-turning traffic, as well as the provision of the angle parking.
In addition, the north curb could be modified to incorporate the bulbing treatment proposed for L and M
Streets; this portion of the concept would provide for enhanced streetscaping and would also reduce the width
of the street for crossing pedestrians (see Figure 3-4).
Other than the bulbing option, this concept could be achieved by simply restriping the street with traditional
striping materials. Alternatively, at additional cost, the left-turn median could be made permanent with
concrete curbing, and landscaping could be added. The bulbing concept should be done by reconstructing
the curbline and sidewalks.

            facilities.
Implementation Programs
Existing programs are deemed sufficient.
COASTAL ZONE ACCESS
Goal 5.D. To provide the full benefits of access to coastal recreation resources to all residents of and visitors
            to Crescent City.
Policies
5.D.1.      The City recognizes the importance of access to and along the shoreline. Therefore, all City-
            owned beachfront property, including its dry sand beaches, shall be maintained in a manner to
            protect all existing accessways. If, in the future, the City finds that existing public accessways are
            inadequate to meet recreational needs, it shall encourage the development of additional accessways
            consistent with the City’s ability to pay maintenance costs and obtain adequate funding to develop
            said areas.
5.D.2.      The City shall assure that the public can easily locate existing access points. These access points
            shall be visibly marked. This recommendation is particularly applicable to public access south of
            Elk Creek.
5.D.3.       The City shall maintain the coastal access points which the City owns as identified in Table 5-2
            and illustrated in Figure 5-2.

Policy Document                                                          Section 5: Recreational and Cultural Resources
5.D.4. The City shall work actively towards the attainment of maximum coastal access for the public, where
         it is consistent with public safety, property owner rights, and the protection of fragile coastal
         resources.
5.D.5. The City shall strive to protect the rights of private property owners in all considerations of public
         access.
5.D.6. The City shall require funding assistance to improve and maintain existing access and to acquire and
         develop any new access and facility.
5.D.7. The City shall ensure that the design and construction by any public entity of shoreline access
         facilities (e.g., parking, trails, stairways, etc.) considers public safety potentials for vandalism and
         the protection of fragile coastal resources.
5.D.8. The City will continue implementing its zoning ordinance to develop and maintain shoreline access
         facilities.
5.D.9. The City shall ensure that the development along the immediate shoreline provides public access to
         the shoreline except where:
         a. Findings are made consistent with Section 30212 of the Coastal Act that access is inconsistent
              with public safety or that agriculture would be adversely affected;
         b. Access would have unavoidable adverse impacts on environmentally-sensitive habitat areas;
         c. An existing vertical accessway, adequate to meet anticipated access needs, is located a quarter
              of a mile or less from the development;
         d. The parcel is too small to allow for an adequate vertical access corridor without passing within
              twenty-five feet of a proposed dwelling; or
         e. Project site is too small for the proposed development and the access with improvement related
              to its use (i.e., parking).
5.D.10. The City shall discourage accessways to rocky beaches in areas where public safety is of concern or
         where increased visitor pressure on biological areas or areas of unique character, sensitive to visitor
         pressure, will be degraded.
5.D.11. The City shall ensure that existing lateral access be maintained by seeking lateral access easements
         (inland of the mean high tide line to the first line of vegetation or to the crest of the paralleling bluff
         in areas of coastal bluffs) for the immediate shoreline.
5.D.12. The City shall issue no permit for a project that obstructs lateral access on the immediate shoreline,
         inland of the mean tide line to the first line of vegetation, or the crest of the paralleling bluff. The
         City will, however, grant exceptions for the placement of navigational aids or shoreline protective
         devices to protect existing structures (i.e., main residence, commercial or industrial buildings,
         roadways, and public parking areas).
5.D.13. The City shall seek funding for suitable, improved access points for use by the physically limited.
5.D.14. The City shall prohibit opening of any required accessway to public use until a public agency,
         including the State, or a private association agrees to accept responsibility for maintenance and
         liability of the accessway.
5.D.15. The City shall grant priority to developments that provide access for the general public over a wide
         range of income levels, ages, and social groups over other private development.

5.D.16. The City should place signs on Highway 101 indicating shoreline access.
5.D.17. The City shall continue to restrict the operation of motor vehicles on beaches within the city limits
          except that the City shall provide exceptions fro emergency operations of the Crescent City Police
          Department or other public authority.
5.D.18. For any new development at the former Seaside Hospital site (APN 118-020-28), including any
          recreational or visitor serving commercial development, the City, or the Commission on appeal, shall
          require an offer of dedication for public access to the City or other public or private association
          acceptable to the Executive Director of the California Coastal Commission, if the approving authority
          finds that the proposed development would create significant adverse individual or cumulative
          impacts on the public's demand for and use of public access facilities, and the offer of dedication
          would alleviate the impacts and be reasonably related to the impacts in nature and extent. Any offer
          of dedication for lateral public access along the beach shall be located at the westerly portion of the
          property extending to the mean high tide line (the westerly property limit). Any offer of dedication
          for lateral public access along any portion of the blufftop shall allow for a lateral access trail to be
          constructed and maintained as public access and shall be located far enough inland from the top of
          the bluff to not require the construction of protective devices that could substantially alter natural
          landforms and bluffs and cliffs. Any offer of dedication for a vertical public access to the beach shall
          follow the Second Street public right-of-way, West of Front Street. The City may accept and shall
          not oppose any other agency, so approved by the Executive Director of the Coastal Commission,
          from accepting any offers of dedication.
Implementation Programs
Existing programs are deemed sufficient.
COASTAL VISUAL RESOURCES
Goal 5.E:      The City shall encourage the maintenance of the visual and scenic beauty of Crescent City.
Policies
5.E.1     The City shall continue to provide for protection of designated scenic resources through such means
          as land use designation, zoning, design review, and sign control.
5.E.2     The City shall encourage the continuation and infill of existing urban land use areas, where
          appropriate, in order to maintain views in those designated coastal scenic areas shown in Table 5-3
          and shown on Figure 5-3.

         Land Use and Community Development section and the Zoning Ordinance..
5.E.4. The City shall require new development in highly scenic coastal areas designated in the California
         Coastline Preservation and Recreation Plan (State Department of Parks and Recreation) to be
         subordinate to the character of its setting.
5.E.5. The City shall permit existing residential uses on the west side of Pebble Beach Drive to continue.
         The City shall reserve publically-owned parcels west of Pebble Beach Drive for use as open space,
         public access, and road maintenance and slope protection of Pebble Beach Drive.
5.E.6. The City's major entrances at Highway 101 north, Highway 101 south, and Front Street shall be
         developed as scenic gateways through the use of architectural review, removal of overhead utilities,
         landscaping, and sign regulations.
5.E.7. The City shall limit nonconforming or unpermitted signs as well as signs advertising commercial or
         privately-owned businesses in these areas zoned Open Space. The City shall continue its sign
         amortization program and support participation in centralized logo signage programs.
5.E.8. The City shall develop a roadway sign program which provides for specially marked scenic driving
         routes, which visitors can follow to visit coastal scenic areas in the Crescent City urban area,
         including the Harbor and Lighthouse-to-Lighthouse routes. Where feasible, these routes should link
         with any county scenic drive routes.
5.E.9. The City shall preserve those structures that are historically and architecturally significant unless
         proven that (a) the structure is over 50 percent unrepairable or, (b) adequate funding, either public
         or private, is unavailable to restore the structure.
5.E.10. The City has identified the Battery Point Lighthouse as having historical significance. The City shall

         utilizing identified scenic or commercial areas, for use when funding for undergrounding is available.
5.E.12. The City shall require the placement of new or relocated utility lines underground whenever feasible.
         When it is not feasible to place utility lines underground, the lines should be aligned so that they do
         not interfere with scenic resources.
5.E.13. The City shall, whenever feasible, require all public facilities and new development to use low-
         energy shielded lights so they are directed downward for better efficiency and to minimize nighttime
         glare.
5.E.14. The City should require lights in the Pt. St. George and Pebble Beach area to be shielded so they are
         directed down and away from the ocean to minimize impact on off-reef and island habitats.
5.E.15. The City shall limit nonconforming or unpermitted signs as well as signs advertising commercial or
         privately-owned businesses in these areas zoned Open Space. The City shall develop provisions for
         permit term limit organization and support participation in centralized logo signage programs.

         sites in order to preserve and protect these resources from vandalism and the unauthorized removal
         of artifacts.
5.G.8. The City shall require that discretionary development projects are designed to mitigate potential
         impacts to significant paleontological or cultural resources whenever possible. Determinations of
         impacts, significance, and mitigation shall be made by qualified archaeological (in consultation with
         recognized local Native American groups), historical, or paleontological consultants, depending on
         the type of resource in question.

            resources.
6.A.5.      The City shall enforce regulations which promote that all surface and subsurface waters be
            maintained at the highest level of quality to insure the safety of public health and the biological
            productivity of coastal waters.
6.A.6.      The City shall encourage community programs (e.g., fish hatcheries, habitat rehabilitation)
            designed to improve the quality of coastal fisheries and other marine resources.
6.A.7.      The City shall require implementation of approved management measures specified for urban areas
            in the recently approved State Water Resource Control Board and California Coastal Commission's
            Nonpoint Source Pollution Control Program to minimize polluted runoff from construction
            activities and land use activities to ensure the safety of public health and the biological productivity
            of coastal waters.
6.A.8.      The City shall enforce regulations which promote that all subsurface water be maintained at a high
            level of quality to ensure the safety of public health.
Offshore Rocks and Islands Policies
6.A.9.      The City shall require that offshore rocks and islands, except for permitted navigational aides, be
            maintained in their existing state to insure the viability of the wildlife inhabiting or utilizing these
            sites.
Intertidal Zone, Beaches, and Bluffs Policies
6.A.10.     The City shall require that all tidepools and tidal flats be managed to maintain their present
            characteristics and shall encourage the application of all feasible measures to mitigate uses that
            might prove harmful to the biota inhabiting these areas.
6.A.11.     The City shall encourage the California Department of Fish and Game to carefully monitor
            recreational activities at or near tidepools and tidal flats to insure the continued viability of these
            habitats.
6.A.12.     In order to discourage all but light recreational use of tidepool regions, the City shall ensure that
            shoreline access and recreational facilities are located so as to direct use towards the open, sandy
            beaches of the City.
6.A.13.     The City shall cooperate with the State to prohibit the collecting of all tidepool organisms with
            exceptions for scientific purposes on a permit basis.
6.A.14.     In order to ensure the continued productivity of intertidal areas, the City shall continue to work
            with the State to regulate vehicle access in the intertidal zone.
6.A.15.      The City shall require geologic studies for new construction within the area of demonstration on
            bluff tops to determine:
                 i. their suitability for development; and
                 ii. the necessary setbacks required to avoid hazards associated with bluff failure.
May 21, 2001                                              6-2                                Crescent City General Plan
          Note: The area of demonstration of stability includes the base, face, and top of all bluffs and cliffs.
          The extent of the bluff top considered should include the area between the face of the bluff and a
          line described on the bluff top by the intersection of a plane inclined at a 20 degree angle from
          horizontal passing through the toe of the bluff or cliff, or 50 feet inland from the edge of the cliff
          or bluff, whichever is greater. The City may, however, designate a smaller area of demonstration
          in specific areas of known geologic stability (as determined by adequate geologic evaluation and
          historic evidence) or where adequate protective works already exist. The City may designate a
          larger area of demonstration or exclude development entirely in areas of known high instability.
6.A.16.   The City may permit the extraction of sand and gravel consistent with applicable marine resources,
          extraction, and habitat policies.

        owned lands in order to preserve important wildlife corridors and to provide habitat protection of
        State or Federally listed rare, threatened, or endangered, and/or other special status species.
Environmentally-Sensitive Habitat Areas Policies
6.D.10. The City shall define the following as specific environmentally-sensitive habitat areas:
              Coastal Wetland - Lands within the coastal zone which may be covered periodically or
              permanently with shallow water such as saltwater marshes, freshwater marshes, open or closed
              brackish water marshes, swamps, mudflats, bogs, and fens.
              Riparian Vegetation - The plant cover normally found along water courses including rivers,
              streams, creeks and sloughs, usually characterized by dense growths of trees and shrubs.
6.D.11. The City shall maintain maps that identify the locations of specific environmentally-sensitive
        coastal wetlands and riparian habitat areas within the incorporated portion of the Crescent City
        Planning Area. Due to the scale of such maps, questions may arise as to the specific boundary
        limits of an identified environmentally sensitive habitat area. Where there is a dispute over the
        boundary or location of an environmentally sensitive habitats area, the City may request the
        applicant to provide the following information:
              a. A base map delineating topographic lines, adjacent roads, location of dikes, levees, flood
                  control channels, and tide gates;
              b. Vegetation map;
              c. Soils map; and
              d. A biologist’s report, where necessary.
Coastal Sand Dune Policies
6.D.12. To ensure their values as groundwater recharge regions and wildlife habitats, the City shall
        encourage the maintenance in their existing states or return to their natural states where feasible
        of coastal sand dunes, as mapped on the City sensitive habitat maps.
6.D.13. The City shall discourage the removal or unnecessary disturbance of dune vegetation.
Coastal Wetlands Policies
6.D.14. If it is determined that a designated sensitive habitat area is a wetland, the City shall require that
        a study be conducted of the area to define the precise boundary of the wetland. City approval of
        any development in this area shall await the applicant’s completion of a site-specific study of the
        presence and location of wetlands. The study shall utilize the criteria contained in the U.S. Army
        Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual. The City shall, on the basis of this study and
        after consulting with the California Department of Fish and Game and U.S. Army Corps of
        Engineers, determine whether all or part of the site constitutes wetlands, and will apply General
        Plan policies accordingly.
6.D.15. The City shall permit the diking, filling, or dredging of wetlands in accordance with other
        applicable provisions of this General Plan where there is no feasible less environmentally-
        damaging alternative and where feasible mitigation measures have been provided to minimize
        adverse environmental effects. Within the coastal zone, such projects shall be limited to those
                                                    6-5

Section 6: Natural Resources/Conservation                                                          Policy Document
            identified in Section 30233 of the Coastal Act.
6.D.16.     The City shall ensure that development in areas adjacent to environmentally-sensitive wetland
            habitat areas be sited and designed to prevent impacts which could significantly degrade such
            areas, and shall be compatible with the continuance of such habitat areas. The primary tool to
            reduce impacts around wetlands between the development and the edge of the wetland shall be a
            buffer of 50 feet in width. A buffer of less than 50 feet may be utilized where it can be determined
            that there is no adverse impact on the wetland. A determination to utilize a buffer area of less than
            50 feet shall be made in cooperation with the California Department of Fish and Game and the
            City’s determination shall be based upon specific findings as to the adequacy of the proposed
            buffer to protect the identified resource. Firewood removal by owner for on site use and
            commercial timber harvest pursuant to CDF timber harvest requirements are to be considered as
            allowable uses within 50-foot buffer areas.
6.D.17.     The City shall require that dredging and spoils disposal be planned and carried out to avoid
            significant disruption to marine and wildlife habitats and water circulation. Dredge spoils suitable
            for beach replenishment (as determined by compliance with 404 permit requirements) should be
            used for such purposes to appropriate beaches or into suitable longshore current systems.
6.D.18.     The City shall discourage direct runoff of pollutants and siltation into wetland areas from
            development. Development shall be designed in such a manner that pollutants and siltation will
            not significantly adversely affect the value or function of wetlands.
6.D.19.     The City shall require new development to mitigate wetland loss through any combination of the
            following, in descending order of desirability:
                 a. Avoidance of wetland habitat;
                 b. Where avoidance is not possible, minimization of impacts on the resource; or
                 c. Replacement, including use of a mitigation banking program.
6.D.20.     In cases where the City requires replacement for a wetland loss, the level of replacement will be
            determined according to the following criteria:
                 a. On-site mitigation shall be preferred to off-site, and in-kind mitigation shall be preferred
                     to out-of-kind;
                 b. Functional replacement ratios may vary to the extent necessary to incorporate a margin of
                     safety reflecting the expected degree of success associated with the mitigation plan; and
                 c. Acreage replacement ratios may vary depending on the relative functions and values of
                     those wetlands being lost and those being supplied, including compensation for temporal
                     losses.
Riparian Area Policies
6.D.21.     The City shall ensure that riparian vegetation be maintained along streams/creeks, and other water
            courses for their qualities as wildlife habitat, stream buffer zones, and bank stabilization.
6.D.22.     The City shall require mitigation for development projects where segments of stream habitat are
            unavoidably altered. Such impacts should be mitigated on-site with in-kind habitat replacement
            or elsewhere in the stream system through stream or riparian habitat restoration work.
6.D.23.     The City shall require development projects proposing to encroach into a creek corridor or creek
            setback to do one or more of the following, in descending order of desirability:
May 21, 2001                                            6-6                              Crescent City General Plan

               a.  Avoid the disturbance of riparian vegetation;
               b.  Replace riparian vegetation (on-site, in-kind);
               c.  Restore another section of creek (in-kind); and/or
               d.  Participate in a mitigation banking program.
6.D.24.   The City should provide for diversified recreational use of fish and wildlife while providing
          preservation of their habitat.
6.D.25.   The City should seek funding to reestablish riparian vegetation in selected stream corridors.
6.D.26.   The City shall continue to require the use of feasible and practical best management practices
          (BMPs) to protect streams from the adverse effects of construction activities and urban runoff and
          to encourage the use of BMPs for agricultural activities.       [See also Policy 4.E.9.]

TIMBER RESOURCES
Goal 6.G.       To conserve forest resources, enhance the quality and diversity of forest ecosystems, reduce
                conflicts between forestry and other uses, and to encourage a continued yield of forest products
                in the Planning Area.
Policies
6.G.1.      The City shall encourage the County to continue to maintain in a commercial timberland use those
            lands possessing climate and soils suitable for growing commercial conifer timber crops (including
            spruce) through the State Timberland Production Zone (TPZ) program.
May 21, 2001                                             6-8                               Crescent City General Plan
6.G.2.    The City shall encourage the County to ensure that other lands within the Coastal Zone designated
          Timberland, and not identified as commercial timberland per Policy 6.G.1 and not specifically
          designated for another use, shall be included as commercial timberland and subject to the
          restrictions of Policy 6.G.1.
6.G.3.    The City should encourage the County to require the placement of commercial timberland uses and
          adjacent uses so that, in general, lower intensity uses are adjacent to commercial timberlands with
          higher intensity uses placed in a logical transition away from these timberlands. Lower intensity

                                  HEALTH & SAFETY
This section contains the goals, policies, and programs that set the basic framework for the protection of
public health and safety related to natural and man-made safety hazards. This section includes goals, policies,
and programs addressing the following subjects:
C   General Hazards;
C   Seismic Hazards;
C   Geologic Hazards;
C   Flood Hazards;
C   Fire Hazards;
C   Hazardous Materials;
C   Disaster Planning; and
C   Noise.
GENERAL HAZARDS
Goal 7.A. To protect the public health, safety, and welfare and minimize the damage to structures, property,
              and infrastructure as a result of seismic, geologic, fire, and flood hazards.
Policies
7.A.1    The City shall evaluate proposed projects and land use policy decisions based on the environmental
         hazards identified in this element. Low intensity/occupancy uses (such as open space, agricultural
         production, or extremely low density residential land use) shall be preferred in hazard areas.
7.A.2    The City shall work with local, State, and Federal agencies to maintain natural hazards information
         or sources of information that can be used to fulfill the natural hazard disclosure statements.
7.A.3    To the extent practicable, the City shall discourage the location of “critical facilities or uses” from
         being located in areas subject to natural hazards as identified in this section. For purposes of the
         General Plan, “critical facilities or uses” are defined as facilities or uses (i.e., hospitals, fire stations,
         utility installations, communication centers) that would be used to respond to the needs of the City
         in the event of a natural or manmade hazardous event or uses with high occupancies, such as schools.
Implementation Programs
Existing programs are deemed sufficient.
SEISMIC HAZARDS
Goal 7.B. To minimize the loss of life, injury, and property damage due to seismic hazards.
Policies
7.B.1. Since no active or potentially active earthquake faults have been identified within Crescent City
         Planning Area, the provisions of the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone are not applicable.
Crescent City General Plan                               7-1                                              May 21, 2001

Section 7: Health & Safety                                                                           Policy Document
7.B.2. The City shall utilize the most current seismic design criteria in the construction of new public
          buildings. Buildings meant to accommodate activities and equipment related to public safety,
          especially police, fire, and communications services, should be constructed to ensure continued
          operation and availability of services after an earthquake.
7.B.3. The City should consider establishing a program to have structures highly susceptible to seismic
          damage either reinforced or demolished. Priority for abatement action should be based on the type
          of occupancy and the severity of risk.
7.B.4. The City shall require site-specific investigations prior to the construction of all high intensity and/or
          public use structures. Site-specific investigations should assess the potential for liquefaction induced
          ground failures and suggest measures to mitigate the hazards from vertical and/or horizontal
          displacement. If it is found that engineering techniques cannot mitigate the hazards to within
          acceptable risk levels appropriate with the intended land use, the location of the proposed
          development shall be reconsidered.
7.B.5. The City shall continue to use the amended California Uniform Building Code, and adopt the new
          version if appropriate to the City’s needs.
7.B.6. In order to minimize risks, the City should periodically inspect and improve new public roads,
          bridges, and overpasses should be designed to the most current seismic design criteria, and existing
          bridges.
7.B.7. To reduce the probability of ruptured utility lines, the City shall ensure that new major pipes, both
          for sewer and water, be made of the strongest, most flexible materials available and still be
          economically feasible.
7.B.8.     The City, in conjunction with local, State and Federal agencies, should begin a program of
          disseminating available seismic safety information to citizens and property owners.
7.B.9. The City should require all public and private schools within the City to undergo periodic inspections
          and upgrading, when necessary, to ensure conformity to current Field Act Standards.
7.B.10. The City shall require that construction contemplated in low-lying coastal areas, those in the zone
          of possible run-up, be designed in accordance with recommendations stated in the report entitled,
          Protection of Crescent City, California From Tsunami Waves.
7.B.11. The City should encourage State and Federal agencies to further investigate the phenomena of
          “resonance” in the coastal area off Crescent City to see if remedial measures could be instituted to
          decrease the effect.
7.B.12. The City should urge State and Federal agencies to develop new programs to aid local governments
          in dealing effectively with existing buildings and facilities that might present a hazard to life and
          property in the event of a severe earthquake.
7.B.13. The City should urge State and Federal agencies to continue research aimed at refining earthquake
          data and developing workable building code provisions based on seismic monitoring and construction
          technology and testing.

Policy Document                                                                            Section 7: Health & Safety
7.1      The City should review existing codes and ordinances regulating development and modify them if
         necessary to ensure their consistency with seismic policies.
              Responsibility: Building Department
              Time Frame: First five years
7.2      The City shall recommend that programs be initiated through the Uniform Code for the Abatement
         of Hazardous Structures for the identification and abatement of buildings susceptible to earthquake
         damage. These programs should be long range in order to avoid economic hardship and/or
         dislocation problems. Structures should be allowed to remain as is if their occupancy is significantly
         reduced, or if their use is made less critical. In establishing a program of hazardous building
         abatement, the following structures should be given priority:
              C   unreinforced masonry structures;
              C   buildings constructed prior to a specific date determined by the history of adoption and
                  enforcement of building codes; and
              C   critical facilities: essential facilities whose use is necessary during an emergency, building
                  whose occupancy is involuntary, high occupancy buildings.
         Single family dwellings should be given lowest priority in abatement programs, since they are
         predominantly wood frame construction and should, therefore, perform relatively well during seismic
         shaking.
              Responsibility: Building Department
              Time Frame: Ongoing
7.3      The City, with the assistance of other governmental agencies, should develop and disseminate
         seismic safety information to the City’s citizens. This should include such matters as:
              C   what to do in case of an earthquake;
              C   how to get official information in case of a disaster;
              C   directions to the closest disaster center; and/or
              C   public health information.
              Responsibility: Building Department
              Time Frame: As needed
7.4      The City should ensure that adequate records are kept of the materials penetrated and rates of
         penetration in water (or other) wells drilled in the Smith River Plain. Generally, one or two core
         holes fifty feet deep should accomplish this, drilled under the supervision of an engineering
         geologist.
              Responsibility: Public Works Department
              Time Frame: As needed

GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
Goal 7.C.      To minimize the loss of life, injury, and property damage due to geological hazards.
Policies
7.C.1. Any development proposed adjacent to a coastline erosion area should be preceded by:
          C    an assessment of the rates of coastal retreat;
          C    in the case of bluffs, a detailed examination of underlying geology by a registered geologist or
               engineering geologist; and
          C    an analysis of the potential for tsunami run-up.
          The results of the assessment of coastal retreat and geologic analysis shall be utilized to identify the
          setback or special construction measures required to insure that the proposed development will not
          require the use of shoreline protection over the full economic life of the proposed development (i.e.
          75-100 years).
7.C.2. In lieu of the above, the City may establish specific area setbacks of sufficient distance to mitigate
          potential coastal erosion hazards.
7.C.3. The City shall petition appropriate Federal and State agencies to aid in a study of coastal bluff
          erosion and its impact on the Crescent City Harbor. The study should include:
          C    the source of harbor deposition material, specifically the impact of beach erosion north of Battery
               Point;
          C    the impact harbor deposition has on beach sand replenishment south of Crescent City Harbor;
          C    the impact of harbor dredging practices on the former hospital site west of Front and A St.;
          C    the impact of harbor dredging on potential tsunamis hazard;
          C    the direct and indirect costs of harbor dredging to the City; and
          C    the economic benefit of harbor dredging to the City.
          Additionally, the City should request of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers a more detailed study of
          the critical coastline erosion areas in and adjacent to Crescent City, to ascertain the feasibility of
          installing seawalls, as recommended by the Corps.
7.C.4. The City should maintain in its Public Works division a public file of all geological and soil
          investigations.
7.C.5. The City should support the County’s efforts to inform the public of how they can minimize slope
          stability problems on their own property.
7.C.6. The City, in conjunction with other governmental agencies, when feasible, should utilize lands
          subject to severe geologic hazards for low intensity park and recreational activities or open space.
7.C.7. The City shall require that any construction contemplated on filled areas be preceded by an analysis
          of the fill and its capabilities or limitations.

Implementation Programs
7.5 The City should designate a responsible person to coordinate the ongoing implementation of those
     geologic hazard policies which will require engineering and/or geologic expertise. Under this person’s
     direction, procedures should be established for:
         1) requiring detailed geologic and/or soils investigations for proposals within landslide and coastal
              erosion areas designated herein;
         2) reviewing of such investigations;
         3) establishing a systematic filing procedure for such investigations so that over time, a detailed
              database can be developed for specific areas;
         4) establish a standardized landslide and coastal erosion report procedure and format; and
         5) develop and make available to the public upon request information on potential slope stability
              problems and mitigation measures designed for the City; and
         6) establishing the required building setbacks and/or foundation design for proposed new
              development based upon the full economic life of the proposed new development (i.e. 75-100
              years) such that the need for future shoreline protection works is fully precluded.
                  Responsibility: Public Works Department
                  Time Frame:          First two years

         and not rely on traditional structural flood control techniques.
7.D.3. When structures are deemed necessary in flood prone areas, the City should require appropriate flood
         proofing standards.
7.D.4. The City should revise floodplain districts to coincide with flood prone areas designed in conjunction
         with the National Flood Insurance Program.
7.D.5. The City should restrict and control construction of roads in flood prone areas due to their growth
         inducement potential.
7.D.6. The City shall maintain/develop an effective emergency warning system is of critical importance for
         flood hazard areas.
7.D.7. The City should use the National Flood Insurance Program as a framework for the City’s flood
         damage prevention policies and programs.
7.D.8. The City should provide flood hazard information for owners and buyers of lands which are unsuited
         for intended purposes because of flood or shore erosion hazard.

7.E.4. The City should not approve major developments if fire fighting services are not available or are not
         adequate for the area.
7.E.5    These City shall apply the following standards to all subdivisions planned for structural
         development.
         C    There will be at least two different ingress/egress routes.
         C    The minimum right of way for any street, roadway, or thoroughfare within a subdivision shall
              conform to the classifications and improvements of the City’s Public Facility Design Standard
              requirements. Where critical conditions warrant, added width for vegetative treatment or vehicle
              turn-outs may be recommended.
         C    Cul-de-sacs should not exceed 600 feet, terminated by a turn-around right-of-way of not less than
              90 feet in diameter.
         C    Street grades shall be limited to 15 percent, except for short distances where topographic
              conditions make lesser grades impractical.
         C    No street or road shall have a center line radius of curvature of less than 50 feet.
         C    No dead end roads are allowed within any subdivision unless deeded limited access emergency
              service roads tie two or more dead end roads together. Emergency service roads shall be no less
              than 16 feet wide with a 24 foot right-of-way.
         C    All streets and roads will be named and signed at each intersection with a street sign containing
              street names in letters at least four inches high. The street sign will also show block number and
              directional arrows in numbers at least one inch high. All improved lots must display four inch
              high house numbers on the curb in front of the lot, on the house, or on a sign not less than three
              feet high conspicuously posted with numbers four inches high readily readable from the frontage
              street.
         C    Any lot within a subdivision that does not have street or thorough-fare frontage must have two
              ingress/egress routes. One of these routes may be a service alley with no less than 20 feet right
              of way and no more than 300 feet in length.
7.E.6    The County Fire Protection Districts' shall conduct a review of structures in the county that do not
         meet current fire code. A list of these structures shall be prepared, and a system shall be designed
         to assign priorities for retrofitting. This program shall be conducted in conjunction with the County's
         current efforts to retrofit such structures.
7.E.7    The city shall coordinate with utility providers to develop a plan for directing existing water supply
         and or finding alternative water supplies for use during fire fighting activities that may occur in the
         areas surrounding Crescent City.

              Time Frame:           Ongoing
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Goal 7.F.     To minimize the risk of loss of life, injury, serious illness, damage to property, and economic and
              social dislocations resulting from the use, transport, treatment, and disposal of hazardous
              materials and hazardous material wastes.
Policies
7.F.1. The City shall provide educational materials and information to the public regarding the types of
          household hazardous waste and the proper methods of disposal.
7.F.2. The City shall provide disposal options to the public for the proper disposal of household hazardous
          waste.
7.F.3. The City shall ensure that new hazardous waste facilities and those commercial and industrial land
          uses that use or produce hazardous materials or waste are sited in an appropriate manner to maintain
          an acceptable level of risk.
7.F.4. The City shall maintain a hazardous materials response capability for the control and cleanup of
          hazardous materials releases and accidents.
7.F.5. The City shall work with the Highway Patrol to limit the movement of hazardous wastes to approved
          routes within the Crescent City Planning Area.

DISASTER PLANNING
Goal 7.G. To provide planning, response, and recovery capabilities to deal with the range of natural and
              manmade hazards that could impact the Crescent City Planning Area.
Policies
7.G.1. The City should continue to assign high priority to the maintenance and continual updating of the
          Emergency Response Plan to ensure that the City will be able to respond effectively in the face of
          disaster. This plan shall include an effective emergency evacuation system. This system shall
          include redundant routes to facilitate an effective evacuation.
7.G.2. The City shall design an effective emergency evacuation system for tsunami inundation areas.
May 21, 2001                                             7-8                               Crescent City General Plan
Policy Document                                                                           Section 7: Health & Safety
7.G.3. The City shall encourage all agencies responsible for public health and safety services to routinely
         evaluate the response of their facilities to a damaging earthquake and develop contingency plans for
         post-disaster emergency operations.
7.G.4. Even though location and amount of damage to roads cannot be precisely predicted, the City should
         prepare and maintain a generalized contingency evacuation plan, indicating alternative routes based
         on the most probable assumed failures. Such a plan would facilitate efficient emergency operations
         following a major flood, wildland fire, tsunami, and other seismic events.
7.G.5. Since an effective emergency warning system is of critical importance in the event of tsunami or
         flood events, the City shall continue to cooperate with all appropriate State and Federal agencies in
         efforts to improve their facilities and programs for the operation of the early warning system.
7.G.6. The City shall locate VHF receivers, capable of automatically receiving early warning messages, in
         all hazard prone areas of the City.
[See also Policy 6.A.15.]
Implementation Programs
7.11     In revising and updating the Emergency Response Plan, emphasis should be placed upon Readiness
         Condition No. 4 (the Normal peace time situation) in accordance with the recommendations outlined
         in this section, under Disaster Planning.
              Responsibility: Public Works
              Time Frame: Ongoing
7.12     The City shall develop a public education outreach program and planning initiatives to minimize the
         risks of both life and property to tsunami hazards. Public education shall be focused on providing
         hotel/motel fact sheets, beachfront signage, mailers to residents, inclusion local schools’ public safety
         curriculum. The tsunami planning initiatives shall include detailed procedures for hazard assessment,
         warning, and evacuation response.

NOISE
Goal 7.H. To prevent incompatible land uses, by reason of excessive noise levels, from occurring in the
              future. This includes protecting sensitive land uses from exposure to excessive noise and to
              protect the economic base of the city by preventing the encroachment of incompatible land uses
              within areas affected by existing or planned noise-producing uses.
Policies
7.H.1. The City shall consider the following land uses to be “noise sensitive”:
         C    single and multi-family residential;
         C    group homes;
         C    hospitals and extended medical facilities;

          C    schools and other learning institutions;
          C    libraries; or
          C    similar uses as may be determined by the City.
7.H.2. Where there are development of new noise sensitive land uses, the City shall require a detailed noise
          impact analysis in areas where current or future exterior noise levels from transportation sources
          exceed 65 CNEL/Ldn or 55 CNEL/Ldn from stationary sources. This study shall include
          recommendations and evidence to establish mitigation which will reduce noise exposure to
          acceptable levels.
7.H.3. Transportation-Related Noise. The development of new noise sensitive land uses adjacent to existing
          or planned transportation facilities or development of new transportation facilities adjacent to existing
          or planned sensitive land uses shall require a noise impact analysis in areas where current or future
          exterior noise levels from transportation sources exceeds 65 CNEL/Ldn. This study shall include
          recommendations and evidence to establish mitigation which will reduce noise exposure to
          acceptable levels. Areas subject to this criteria are defined as follows:
          •    Roadway Noise. For major roadways in the city, the future noise levels estimated on Table 7-1
               shall be used to determine the applicability of this policy.
          •    Aircraft Noise. Until completion and adoption of new noise contours for McNamara Field, the
               noise contours estimated on Figure 7-1 shall be used to determine the applicability of this policy.
7.H.4     Stationary Noise. Proposed projects which include potentially significant noise generation (i.e., with
          the potential to exceed the standards shown on Table 7-2) or development of new land uses adjacent
          to an existing or proposed stationary source of noise shall be required to submit a noise study that
          includes specific recommendations for mitigation. This policy does not apply to noise levels
          associated with agricultural and gravel extraction (but not processing) operations.

 standards may be applied on the receptor side of noise barriers or other property-line noise mitigation measures.
 2
   Sound level measurements shall be made with the noise meter set to the slow response setting.
7.H.5. In the event that acceptable outdoor noise levels cannot be achieved by various noise mitigation
          measures, indoor noise levels for residential uses shall not exceed 45 CNEL/Ldn with windows and
          doors closed.
7.H.6. The City should encourage the Del Norte Unified School District (DNUSD) to locate and design
          schools so that interior noise levels in classrooms do not exceed 45 CNEL/Ldn and exterior noise
          exposures do not exceed 65 CNEL/Ldn at classroom buildings and 70 CNEL/Ldn on playgrounds
          or athletic fields.
7.H.7. The City should design and locate passive recreational areas so that noise levels do not exceed 65
          CNEL/Ldn and active recreational areas (e.g., sports fields, playgrounds) so that noise levels do not
          exceed 70 CNEL/Ldn.
7.H.8. The City shall encourage the County to investigate the use of noise-reducing flight procedures for
          airplanes and helicopters, such as maintaining minimum flight altitudes, using less noise sensitive
          flight paths, or flying during less sensitive hours.
7.H.9. The City should cooperate with the County and other agencies active in Del Norte County in noise
          abatement measures.
7.H.10. The City should develop performance standards (acceptable noise levels) for residential, public,
          industrial, commercial, and recreational uses.
7.H.11. The City should consider noise standards in future development. The City shall evaluate the new
          development according to the impact of such development upon the immediate area.
7.H.12. The City should not allow existing activities within a commonly zoned area to increase the noise
          level over 5 dB (A) above the ambient noise level.
7.H.13. The City, in recognizing that noise data for the citywide area is limited, should develop a more
          adequate database as resources become available.

Airport Noise
7.H.14. The City shall encourage the County to consider the establishment of an air corridor zone which
         would alert citizens of the effects of future jet flights upon the area.
7.H.15. The City shall encourage the County to consider not allowing the construction of any noise sensitive
         facilities (i.e., schools, hospitals, etc.) within 1/4 mile of the corridor.
7.H.16. The City shall encourage the County to consider any future lengthening of runways to accommodate
         commercial jet flights should, if feasible, be extended on the northern ends of the runways to reduce
         noise impact in the approach area.
7.H.17. The City shall encourage the County to consider restricting the use of current non-residential land
         use within the corridor to compatible uses of industrial, commercial, or open space.
7.H.18. The City should encourage the County to consider investigating the possibility of a prop-jet air
         corridor.
7.H.19. The City shall encourage the County to consider the compatibility of land use in regards to the noise
         level generated and the noise level acceptable by adjoining uses of land. No proposed use of land
         should be allowed which would eventually infringe upon the use of the adjoining land, (unless the
         proposed use is contractually bound to acceptable performance standards).
Implementation Programs
7.13     The City should develop a comprehensive noise ordinance based on quantitative measures of
         acceptable noise levels identified in this element.

Introduction
2014-2019 Housing Element Contents
The Housing Element of the General Plan is a comprehensive statement by the City of Crescent City of its
current and future housing needs and proposed actions to facilitate the provision of housing to meet
those needs at all income levels. The policies contained in this element reflect the requirements of the
statewide housing priority to allow for the “attainment of decent housing and a suitable living
environment for every Californian,” as well as a reflection of the unique concerns of the community.
The Housing Element purpose is to establish specific goals, policies, and objectives relative to the provision
of housing and to adopt an action (implementation) plan toward this end. In addition, the Housing
Element identifies and analyzes housing needs and resources and constraints to meeting those needs.
The Crescent City Housing Element is based on seven strategic goals:
Goal A: To support housing development opportunities meeting quantified City objectives.
    Goal B:     To assist in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of extremely low-,
                very low-, low-, and moderate-income households.
    Goal C:     To pursue conservation and enhancement of existing housing units to provide
                adequate, safe, and decent housing for all Crescent City residents.
    Goal D:     To address, and where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental
                constraints for all housing, including housing for special needs groups.
    Goal E:     To pursue sustainable development and energy efficiency for new residential
                development and existing housing stock, including green building technologies.
    Goal F:     To promote housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, gender, age, sexual
                orientation, marital status, or national origin.
    Goal G:     To ensure that the goals and programs of this document are reviewed and utilized
                during the planning period and updated in a timely manner.
In accordance with state law, the Housing Element is to be consistent and compatible with other General
Plan elements. Additionally, the Housing Element is to provide clear policy and direction for making
decisions pertaining to zoning, subdivision approval, housing allocations, and capital improvements. State
law (Government Code Sections 65580 through 65589) mandates the contents of the Housing Element.
By law, the Housing Element must:
       Include a housing needs assessment and a resources and constraints inventory relevant to
        meeting those needs,
       Contain a statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies relevant to the
        maintenance, improvement, and development of housing,

City of Crescent City Housing Element
        Incorporate a program that sets forth a five-year schedule of actions that the local government is
         undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the Housing Element
         goals and objectives,
        Identify adequate residential sites available for a variety of housing types for all income levels,
        Assist in developing adequate housing to meet the needs of extremely low-, very low-, low-, and
         moderate-income households,
        Address governmental constraints to housing maintenance, improvement, and development,
        Conserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable housing stock, and
        Promote housing opportunities for all persons.
For the purposes of this document, unless otherwise specified, affordable housing shall mean housing for
households making 80 percent or less of the area median income (AMI) for Crescent City and Del Norte
County. Even though the focus of a Housing Element will be on lower- and moderate-income households,
the element must also address the housing needs and policy issues for the entire community and be
consistent with the adopted policies of the other General Plan elements.
The Housing Element’s overall focus is to balance the desire of residents, maintaining neighborhood
character, minimize visual and other impacts of new development, and similar concerns while also
addressing the needs of lower- and moderate-income households and special needs groups (such as
seniors and individuals with disabilities).

Quantified Objectives
The following table summarizes the City of Crescent City’s quantified objectives for the Housing Element
planning period (2014 - 2019). These objectives are established by the State Housing and Community
Development Department through the 2014-2019 Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) plan for the
region. While the City is not responsible for developing new housing, these numbers represent a
reasonable expectation of the maximum number of new units that will be developed and conserved, and
the households that will be assisted over the next planning period based on policies and programs
contained in this document.

City of Crescent City Housing Element
Public Participation
State housing law requires jurisdictions to make a diligent effort to achieve participation by all segments
of the community in preparing a Housing Element update. The Crescent City Housing Element was
prepared as a collective result of combined efforts of the City staff, consultant teams (Michael Baker) &
(Planwest Partners), Planning Commission, and City Council.
The Draft Housing Element was considered by the Planning Commission at a public hearing held on
October 22, 2015. No comments were received during the public hearing. Additionally, the Draft Housing
Element was considered by the City Council on November 16, 2015, Key comments from the City Council
and Planning Commission meetings were addressed and incorporated within this Draft Housing Element.
Public input was sought by advertising the public meetings in the local newspaper and radio. Furthermore,
meetings are advertised on the City’s website and public meetings can be viewed via the internet. The
City has posted the draft Housing Element on its website for public review. And copies of the document
are available at City Hall, the City Library, and the Housing Authority.
The Planning Commission considered the final draft Housing Element on May 26, 2016 and recommended
it be forwarded to the City Council for adoption. The City Council considered and adopted the Housing
Element on June 6, 2016.
General Plan Consistency
State law requires that the Housing Element contain a statement of “the means by which consistency will
be achieved with other general plan elements and community goals” (California Government Code Section
65583[c][6][B]. This requires an evaluation of two primary characteristics: (1) an identification of other
General Plan goals, policies, and programs that could affect implementation of the Housing Element or
that could be affected by the implementation of the Housing Element, and (2) an identification of actions
to ensure consistency between the Housing Element and affected parts of other General Plan elements.
The 2001 Crescent City General Plan contains several elements with goals and policies also related to
housing. A review of the other General Plan elements demonstrates consistency with all other policies
and programs. The City will maintain this consistency in the future by ensuring General Plan amendments
are evaluated for consistency with all other General Plan elements.
                                                                                                     Page 28

Appendix A – Housing Needs Assessment


                                                                      City of Crescent City Housing Element
Introduction
The Housing Needs Assessment provides a demographic profile of the City (shown in Figures 1 and 2) by
analyzing the following types of information: population and housing characteristics, special housing
needs groups, housing conditions, and other important information to support the goals, policies, and
programs to meet the needs of current and future residents.
The U.S. Decennial Census, completed every ten years, is an important source of information for the
Housing Needs Assessment. It provides to the most reliable and in-depth data for demographic
characteristics of a locality. The California Department of Finance (DOF) also provides valuable data that
is more current. Whenever possible, DOF data and other local sources were used in the Housing Needs
Assessment. The data presented in the Housing Needs Assessment will not only guide the development
of housing goals and policies, but will also be integrated into the body of the Housing Element to present
the current status of housing and housing-related issues in the City of Crescent City. Definitions of various
U.S. Census Bureau terms used throughout this document are provided in Appendix C for clarification.
The Housing Needs Assessment is organized into three main sections. The first section focuses on
demographic information, such as population trends, ethnicity, age, household composition, income,
employment, housing characteristics, general housing needs by income, and housing needs for special
segments of the population. This section also outlines the characteristics of the community and identifies
those characteristics that may have significant impacts on housing needs in the community.
The second section identifies possible governmental and non-governmental constraints to housing
development in Crescent City. The City has planning, zoning, and building standards that guide and affect
residential development patterns and influence housing availability and affordability. Environmental and
housing market conditions also affect the location, availability, affordability, and type of housing that is
constructed in Crescent City. The “non-governmental” influences include such factors as the availability
and cost of financing, land, and materials for building homes; natural conditions that affect the cost of
preparing and developing land for housing; and the business decisions of individuals and organizations in
home building, finance, real estate, and rental housing that impact housing cost and availability.
The third section identifies City resources and opportunities for affordable housing, which includes an
inventory of adequate sites for affordable housing units, funding resources, and a description of the City’s
current housing programs that work to provide affordable housing to the residents of Crescent City.

Findings Summary
Population and Household Characteristics
The United States Census Bureau estimates the City of Crescent City’s 2013 population to be 7,188
persons, including those in Pelican Bay State Prison. Excluding the prison, the City’s 2009 population was
4,041 persons. Crescent City’s total population (including those incarcerated) grew by 4.9 percent from
2000 to 2014.
The City’s median household income increased by 47.5 percent between 2000 and 2013. However,
approximately 43 percent of the City’s households earn incomes below the low-income ceiling. The City’s
poverty rate is approximately 34.6 percent, and 34.7 percent of those in poverty reside in female-headed
households. The unemployment rate in 2013 was 17.5 percent, which was higher than the county’s rate
(12.3 percent) and the State of California’s rate (8.2 percent). Most of the City’s residents are of Caucasian
ethnicity (72 percent).
Special Needs Housing
The total number of seniors in the retirement age group (55 to 64) increased from 2000 to 2010. The
retirement age group (55 to 64) increased by approximately 2.6 percent, which indicates a need for
continued housing for seniors with varying housing requirements. Approximately 98 seniors lived under
the poverty level in 2010. Most seniors in Crescent City rent their homes. The percentage of seniors
owning their own homes increased by 6.2 percent from 2000 to 2010. Seniors aged 55–64 have the
highest rate of renting among persons over the age of 55.
Most people with disabilities have a mental-related disability. Single-parent households make up 25.3
percent of all households and 48.9 percent of those are female-headed households. Of all single-parent
households, a higher percentage of female-headed households are in poverty (53.4 percent) than male-
headed households. Ownership rates appear to have decreased since 2000 (17.8 percent) for larger
families, which had an ownership rate of 7.8 percent in 2010.
Housing Characteristics
The City’s housing stock is mostly single-family housing and renter-occupied. The majority of the City’s
housing stock was constructed prior to 1979 (61.9 percent), with approximately 28.0 percent of the
housing stock constructed prior to 1959 and 33.9 percent constructed between 1960 and 1979. Based on
a July, 2015 housing conditions survey (addressed below), 68 percent of the housing units in the City are
considered to be in sound condition. Since 2000 the number of total housing units has increased while
the vacancy rate has also increased from 11.3 percent to 13.1 percent.
The percentage of one-bedroom and four-bedroom homes decreased from 2000 to 2013, while the
housing unit size increased for two- and three-bedroom homes. Similarly, the household size decreased
for all owner-occupied units, except one- and two person households. However, household size increased
for one-, two-, and three person renter-occupied units and remained relatively constant for four- and five-
person households. Most overcrowding conditions in the City occur among renter households, with 4.4
percent of renter households being overcrowded compared to approximately 0.5% percent of owner
households. Similarly, most overpayment conditions in the City occur among renter households, with
approximately 36.0 percent of renters overpaying and 4.7 percent of owners overpaying.
                                                                                                      Page A-4

                                                                     City of Crescent City Housing Element
A July 2015 housing costs survey showed that resale homes ranged in sold price from $51,708 to $287,131
over a one-year period. In 2014 approximately 10 rentals were available in the City in which a few two-
bedroom apartments ranged from $625 to $875 per month. The survey did identify one mobile home park
in the City, but did not reveal any mobile homes for sale within the City. However, approximately 15
mobile homes were available for sale or were sold in Del Norte County. The sale prices ranged from
$19,465 to $65,100.
Governmental Constraints
Development standards in the City do not necessarily constrain development, but higher-density single-
family housing types are not allowed. Processing times are approximately one week for both single- and
multi-family development and can be one to two months if discretionary review is needed. These
requirements are not considered constraints as they ensure the maintenance of health and safety
standards.
The California Coastal Commission administers the California Coastal Act, which calls for the preparation
of a Local Coastal Program to implement state policies that govern development in the coastal zone. Local
Coastal Programs prescribe uses, densities, urban/rural boundaries, and availability of public services.
Crescent City is charged with timely processing local projects, but review of discretionary projects by the
Coastal Commission can add up to six to eight months to a project. Given the seasonal construction cycles
as a result of the region’s climate, the additional six- to eight-month review can add approximately one
year to a project.
Non-Governmental Constraints
Land prices ranged from $35,000 to $1.2 million, with the average cost being $90,000 per acre for land
zoned for single-family uses. The higher priced land, particularly those parcels above $100,000, accounts
for specialty properties, such as ocean locations. No multi-family land was for sale at the time of the
Housing Element’s publication. However, a multi-family project sold for $105,000 per acre in 2007.
Construction costs for a simple single-family home are estimated to be approximately $233,420, or
approximately $155 per square foot.

Regional Context
The City of Crescent City is the only incorporated city in Del Norte County. It is in the northwestern area
of the county and is bounded by the Pacific Ocean and coastal bluffs, scattered forests, and suburban and
rural residences. The City is 85 miles north of Eureka, and it is approximately 20 miles south of the Oregon
state line and 330 miles south of Portland. Crescent City is the largest population center in Del Norte
County and is bisected by U.S. Highway 101. The City of Crescent City was incorporated in 1854 and is the
Del Norte county seat. Logging and fishing were the primary industries that supported the early
residences.
Population Trends
Table 1 presents regional population change. The United State Census estimated that the City’s 2013
population to be 7,470, with 4,260 persons in households and 3,210 in group-quarters. Group quarters
include all people not living in households. This includes the institutionalized population living in
correctional institutions, nursing homes, and juvenile institutions and the non-institutionalized population
living in college dormitories, military quarters, and group homes. The Census estimates that the total
2010 population in group quarters is 3,580 people. The City annexed Pelican Bay State Prison in 1991,
which explains the reason for a 65 percent growth rate from 1990 to 2000. Accordingly, the DOF includes
the Pelican Bay State Prison in the group quarter population estimates for the City. The California
Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Department states that the current prison population for
2010 is 3,466 persons. Therefore, 114 persons are in group quarters in the City outside of the prison.
Table 2 presents the population changes for Crescent City. The City’s 2013 population represents a -2.76
percent growth rate from the year 2009. While the overall growth rate of the City is decreasing, the
addition of the prison population presents a distorted picture of the overall growth rate. A more reliable
source of the City’s growth rate is the population in households. From 2000 to 2010, the population in
households increased by over 10 percent. Additionally, from 2010 to 2013 the population in households
increased by 4.8 percent. Similarly, the incarcerated population in group quarters increased from 2000 to
2010.

Population projections for the City of Crescent City were not available. The DOF provides projections for
all counties through 2050. Table 3 shows the expected population growth for Del Norte County from 2020
to 2050. The county is expected to experience a strong growth rate and based on the City’s population
growth in the past, it will most likely mirror the county trend.

Household Income and Poverty
Household Income
Table 6 lists the income distributions for households in the City of Crescent City in 2000 and 2013. It also
shows the median income of the City, which grew by approximately 47.5 percent from $20,133 in 2000
to $29,700 in 2013. The Table 7 numbers suggest the extremely low-income household proportion has
decreased, while the proportion of households earning more than the median income has increased.
Table 7 illustrates the number of households in each income group based on the 2000 Census survey.
Approximately 43 percent of the City’s households have incomes at or below the low-income level.
Approximately 17 percent of households earn incomes that fall into the moderate-income category, and
the remaining households fall into the above moderate-income category. For 2009 information, it is
assumed that the number of households within each income group grew proportionately to the
population.
Table 8 illustrates the monthly median household incomes in each income group by household size up to
a four-person household. It also displays rents households can afford to spend on rent each month.

Income Limits and Poverty
The State of California publishes annual income limits for each county that are used to determine eligibility
for assisted housing programs within that county, including Crescent City residents. The California Health
and Safety Code requires that the state limits for the low-, very low-, and extremely low-income categories
will be the same as those in the equivalent levels established by the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) for its Housing Choice Voucher program. The income limits by household size
are shown in Table 9.

Table 10 shows the poverty rates for each age group in Crescent City as well as for single-parent families.
The poverty rate is the percentage of people in a given group that live below the poverty level out of the
total population of the City. The City’s overall poverty rate is approximately 34.6 percent. The percentage
of population below poverty level illustrates the proportion of each population group that makes up all of
the population below the poverty level. This column shows that approximately 21 percent of all people in
poverty live in male-headed single-parent families and 44 percent live in female-headed single-parent
families. The remainder lives in married family households or on their own.

Special Needs
Senior Population
Table 13 illustrates the population of residents aged 55 and older in 2000 and 2010. The proportion of
retirement age residents (55–64) increased significantly between 2000 and 2010 as the first groups of
baby boomers reached retirement age. Additionally, residents over the age of 75 increased as well. This
may indicate an increased demand for senior living options, which includes, but is not limited to, assisted
living and retirement communities. Further, the increasing senior population would indicate that there is
an additional demand for programs that assist seniors with repair and maintenance of their housing. As
                                                                                                  Page A-12

Table 14 illustrates the tenure of senior households in the City. The majority of senior households rented
their homes. There was a slight increase in home ownership for seniors in 2010. Between 2000 and 2010
there was an increase in homeownership for seniors in all age groups. Seniors age 55 to 64 account for
the largest share of homeownership, approximately 22 percent, a 5.8 percent increase from 2000. The
largest proportion of renter households remains the same, age group 55 to 64, with a slight increase. As
shown in Table 10, 98 households headed by a senior citizen existed below the poverty level in 2010.

Persons with Developmental Disabilities
According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code a "Developmental disability" means a
disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to
continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual which includes mental
retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term shall also include disabling conditions found
to be closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals
with mental retardation, but shall not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in
nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional housing
environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision is
provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical
attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood,
the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community based services to
approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide
system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The
Redwood Coast Regional Center is one of 21 regional centers in the State of California that provides point
of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities. The center is a private, non-profit
community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals
with developmental disabilities and their families.
The following information from the Redwood Coast Regional Center, charged by the State of California
with the care of people with developmental disabilities, defined as those with severe, life-long disabilities
attributable to mental and/or physical impairments provides a closer look at the disabled population.

In order to assist in the housing needs for persons with Developmental Disabilities, the City will implement
programs to coordinate housing activities and outreach with the Regional Center and, encourage housing
providers to designate a portion of new affordable housing developments for persons with disabilities,
especially persons with developmental disabilities, and pursue funding sources designated for persons
with special needs and disabilities.

Large Households
A large family is one with five or more family members. Large families are considered a special needs
group because they need larger homes, but don’t necessarily make enough money to afford many of the
larger homes available. Thus, a large family may struggle to find suitable affordable housing. The number
of large families is shown in Table 19. The proportion of renter households as a percentage of all large
households increased and the proportion of owner households decreased since 2000.

Homeless
The City does not have a record or study quantifying the number of homeless persons. However, the City
of Crescent City Police Department estimates the number of cold homeless to be approximately 50
individuals within the city limits.
The Crescent City Police Department indicates that many of the homeless individuals are transients,
travelling along Highway 101. Further, they stated that there has not been a perceptible change in the
number of homeless residents in the past three years. The department receives approximately two calls
per day regarding homeless incidents such as panhandling and public intoxication.
Table 20 illustrates the available homeless assistance programs in the City. No transitional houses or
homeless shelters are located within the City. The Harrington House is an emergency shelter for women
and children affected by domestic violence. Further, groups such as Rural Human Services (RHS) and CAN
also provide support services.

Farmworkers
The City of Crescent City is not located in an agricultural region. Accordingly, Crescent City and other
agencies do not operate farmworker housing complexes. The majority of farming operations occur in Del
Norte County, and demographic information provided reflects countywide data. Most farmworkers’
incomes fall into the low- or very low-income categories. According to the California Economic
Development Department’s occupational profile updated in 2014, farmworkers and laborers were making
an average hourly wage of $9.01 per hour, and the projected demand for farmworkers is expected to
increase by 12.0 percent by 2022.
The United States Department of Agriculture 2012 Census information indicates Del Norte County has 121
farms with 833 farmworkers. Of those 833 farmworkers, 230 worked more than 150 days per year and
603 worked less than 150 days. Assuming that there were the same number of farmworkers in 2014 as
there were in 2012 and that the proportion of farmworkers mirrors the proportion of the City’s population
to the county’s, then there would have been approximately 206 farmworkers in Crescent City in 2014.
Further, assuming that there is the same proportion of seasonal (those working less than 150 days per
year) and permanent (those working more than 150 days per year) farmworkers as in the county, Crescent
City would have approximately 130 seasonal and 76 permanent farmworkers.
                                                                                                                 Page A-18

Del Norte County’s 2014 Housing Element states that past Regional Housing Needs Allocation Plans
prepared for the County conclude that the housing needs of farmworkers is addressed in the overall
allocation of housing needs. Therefore, housing needs for farmworkers are based on income and are
reflected in the objectives for new units.
Housing Characteristics
Housing Composition
The composition of housing units in Crescent City is predominantly single-family. Table 21 displays the
number of each type of housing unit for 2009, 2012, and 2014. The DOF indicates that there was an
increase of mobile homes from 34 to 58 between 2009 and 2014.

Housing Conditions
Age of Housing Stock
Housing Element law requires an estimate of substandard housing in the community. Determining the
percentage of units built prior to 1960 provides an estimate of major rehabilitation or replacement need.
One can also assume that homes built prior to 1980 may also have rehabilitation needs. Table 22 shows
the age of the housing stock. Approximately 29 percent of the units were built before 1960 and an
additional 35 percent of units were built between 1960 and 1980, totaling 64 percent of homes that likely
require rehabilitation or replacement depending on the level of maintenance the units have had. The City
Building Official estimates that approximately 30 percent of the City’s total housing stock is substandard
enough to warrant some form of rehabilitation or replacement.

    Housing Condition Summary
    The City of Crescent City conducted a Housing Condition Survey in July 2015. A total of 488 dwelling units
    were surveyed over a two-day period. The survey examined the condition of the foundation, siding,
    roofing, electrical, and windows. While approximately 68 percent of the City’s housing stock falls within
    the “sound” condition, some houses within this condition still need miscellaneous repairs, such as
    repainting. Approximately 22 percent of the City’s housing stock is in less than sound condition. However,
    only 2 percent of the units surveyed were found to have substantial or dilapidated conditions. The most
    common repair needed is replacement or patching and painting of siding materials. The results of the
    survey are presented in Table 23.

Occupancy & Tenure
Tables 24, 25, and 26 illustrate the tenure and occupancy of housing in Crescent City. The most recent
tenure information comes from the 2010 Census. According to this information, the majority of occupied
housing units were renter-occupied (68.8 percent). It is likely that this proportion is similar now.
Occupancy information is available from the Census bureau for 2010. The number of housing units
increased by approximately 9 percent between 2000 and 2010, while the vacancy rate decreased by
approximately 1 percent between 2000 and 2010.

Overcrowded Housing
The U.S. Census Bureau defines overcrowding as more than 1.01 persons per room. Severe overcrowding
occurs when there are more than 1.5 persons per room. Table 29 illustrates the number and percentage
of units in the City according to occupants per room. Approximately 4.4 percent of all renter-occupied
units are either overcrowded or severely overcrowded. Only .5 percent of owner-occupied housing was
seen to be overcrowded.

Housing Cost
Single-Family Home Costs
Table 30 lists the prices of resale homes sold in the City from July 31 2014, through July 31, 2015. The
table provides the qualifying annual income for a family to be able to afford the corresponding average
home sale price. The qualifying income for the average sales price of a two-bedroom home would be
approximately $34,505, which is in the above low category of incomes. Recent homes sales information
indicates a lack of homes priced at an affordable level for households in the extremely low-, and very low-
income groups. The households in these categories make up 30 percent of all City households.

Mobile Home Costs
A mobile home unit survey found one mobile home park located within the City of Crescent City with 58
mobile homes, which comprises approximately 1.8 percent of the total housing units in the City. The MLS
survey listing indicated 15 mobile homes were for sale between April 24, 2008, and April 2, 2009. The
numbers of units sold were one one-bedroom, nine two-bedroom, and five three-bedroom mobile homes.
The average price for the two-bedroom units was $19,455, while the average price for the three-bedroom
units was $65,100. The average cost per square foot was $40.82, which is approximately 25 percent more
than the 2001 average per square foot cost of $32.51 per square foot. Delivery and set-up costs can range
from $20,000 to $25,000 depending on the distances the units must travel. Permanent foundations are
required by state law for mobile homes. Estimated engineered foundations costs are $2,000, while
perimeter foundations cost from $12,000 to $15,000. These costs only include construction costs not land
costs, site development, and financing costs.
Overpayment
Definitions of housing affordability can vary but in general, a household should pay no more than 30
percent of its monthly income on housing costs. Households that pay more than this are considered “cost-
burdened” and households that pay more than 35 percent are considered “severely cost-burdened.”
Measuring the number of people paying more than this percentage helps define an area’s affordability

The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), developed by the Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) to assist jurisdictions with their consolidated plans, has special tabulation data
based on the American Community Survey 2011. According to this data (see Table 33), there were 115
owner households and 255 renter households earning less than 50 percent of the median family income
(MFI) in the City in 2011.
As part of Assembly Bill (AB) 2634, the City must estimate its existing and projected number of extremely
low-income households. The overpayment information from CHAS assists in the estimate of the existing
number of extremely low-income households. There were approximately 325 extremely low-income
households in the City of Crescent City in 2011. It is estimated that of the 1,297 renter-occupied
households, 315 households fell into the extremely low-income category. Of the 499 owner-occupied
households, 10 households fell into the extremely low-income category. Of the low-income households,
approximately 380 renters and approximately 49 owners were cost burdened. Approximately 800 lower-
income households in Crescent City were overpaying in 2011.
Additionally, the projected number of extremely low-income households can be estimated by assuming
half of the City’s very low-income RHNA is actually for extremely low-income households. Table 41
displays the breakdown of the City’s RHNA, revealing a need for 42 additional extremely low-income
households through the end of the planning period.

Housing Constraints
Governmental and Non-Governmental Constraints
Various interrelated factors may constrain the ability of the private and public sectors to provide adequate
housing that meets the housing needs for all economic sectors of the community. These constraints can
be divided into two categories: governmental and non-governmental. Governmental constraints consist
of land use controls, development standards, processing fees, development impact fees, code
enforcement, site improvement costs, development permit and approval processing, and provision for a
variety of housing. Non-governmental constraints include land availability, land cost, construction costs,
and availability of financing.
Governmental Constraints
Land Use Controls
The City of Crescent City’s General Plan establishes policies that guide all new development, including any
residential development. These policies, along with zoning regulations, control the amount and
distribution of land allocated for different land uses in the City. Table 34 shows the land use designations
established by the General Plan that allow for residential development.
                                                                                                   Page A-26

Residential Development Standards
Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
residents as well as implement the policies of the General Plan. The Zoning Ordinance also serves to
preserve neighborhood character and integrity. Table 35 shows the residential land use zones and
densities.
The minimum single-family residential lot size is 6,000 square feet. The maximum height limit for
residential units is 35 feet or two stories, whichever is less. Parking standards for residential rural, low-
density, and single-family require two parking spaces per unit. For condominiums and apartments two
spaces are required for some projects, and for mobile home parks, two parking spaces are required. The
requirements are minimal and none is considered a constraint to development.
Provisions for a Variety of Housing
The Housing Element must identify adequate sites that are available for the development of housing types
for all economic segments of the population. Part of this is evaluating the City’s Zoning Code and its
provision for a variety of housing types. Housing types include single-family dwellings, duplexes, guest
dwellings, mobile homes, residential care facilities, multiple-unit dwellings, convalescent homes,
accessory structures, mobile home condominiums, supportive housing, and single-room occupancy units.
Some housing types are allowed by right and others are allowed with a conditional use permit. Conditions
of approval for developments may include, but shall not be limited to, requiring special yards, open
spaces, buffers, fences, walls, installation and maintenance of landscaping, street dedications and
improvements, regulation of traffic circulation, regulation of signs, regulation of hours of operation and
methods of operation, control of potential nuisances, the prescription standards for maintenance of
building and grounds, prescription of development schedules and development standards, and such other
conditions as the Planning Commission may deem necessary to ensure compatibility of the use with
surrounding developments and uses and to preserve the public health, safety, and welfare.
Table 36 summarizes the housing types permitted, conditionally permitted, and prohibited under the
City’s Zoning Ordinance.

City of Crescent City Housing Element
Assembly Bill 2634 requires the quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of
extremely low-income households. Elements must also identify zoning to encourage and facilitate single-
room occupancy (SRO) units. SRO units are to be allowed in one zone, subject to a conditional use permit.
At this time, the City of Crescent City’s Zoning Code does not identify zones where single-room occupancy
units are permitted. Housing Element law requires the City to revise the Zoning Code to allow for
supportive housing and SRO units. As stated in Action D.1.3., the City will amend its Zoning Code to allow
SRO units with a conditional use permit in the Residential Professional (RP) zone.
While the need for farmworker housing in the City is very limited, the need for farmworker or another
type of employee housing may arise in the future. Action D.1.3 is proposed to review the City’s Zoning
Code and amend it if necessary to comply with the state Employee Housing Act (Health & Safety Code
Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6).
Senate Bill 2 (Cedillo, 2007) requires local jurisdictions to strengthen provisions for addressing the housing
needs of the homeless, including the identification of a zone or zones where emergency shelters are
allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use permit and allowing transitional and supportive
housing types as residential uses. Transitional housing provides temporary housing, often with supportive
services to formerly homeless persons for a period that is typically between six months and two years.
Supportive housing does not have a limit on length of occupancy and is occupied by a target population
as defined by Health and Safety Code 53260, which includes low-income persons with mental disabilities,
AIDS, substance abuse, or chronic health conditions. The supportive services, such as job training,
rehabilitation, and counseling, help individuals gain life skills necessary for independent living.
This legislation took effect January 1, 2008. In 2015 the City amended its municipal code to allow
emergency shelters by right in the PF zone. The PF zone was determined appropriate because it is located
near essential services such as County Mental Health, Social Services, food, health care, and
transportation. There PF zone currently encompasses 6 parcels totaling approximately 86 acres of land
within the 1.5 square miles of City Limits. Table 37 provides details on the sites zoned PF. Most of these
parcels are developed including the largest parcel where the Del Norte County Fairgrounds are located.
The fairgrounds parcel is owned by the State of California while the City owns the other five parcels.
However, one of the parcels is vacant and all of the others are underutilized with vacant areas and in the
case of the fairgrounds, many of the buildings are vacant. The fairgrounds is the only location in the city
where an emergency homeless shelter has been established in the past. In addition, a homeless shelter
is located just outside the City (approximately 1,500 feet from the fairgrounds site) in the County in their
zone identified to allow emergency shelters. The City is interested in and willing to partner with agencies
or homeless service providers to develop shelters on these sites. The sites owned by the City could be sold
or leased without hearings or any other discretionary process. Other existing principally permitted uses in
the PF zone include auditoriums, public fairgrounds and related uses, hospitals, and similar uses. If the
homeless need increases in the future the City would also consider adding parcels to the PF zone. Or
alternatively, the City would identify a second zoning district or create an overlay district where
emergency shelters are allowed by right.

Emergency shelters of up to 10 beds are allowed by right. A person may stay in the shelter for up to six
days. Extensions of 20 additional days may be allowed by the shelter operator. This allows for a total of
26 days within one 12-month period. They may either be consecutive or not. To allow additional flexibility
for shelter occupants and to allow a larger variety in size of shelters Action D.1.5 is proposed to extend
the maximum stay to 60 days and to increase the maximum number of beds allowed without discretionary
review to 30.

The security plan for an emergency shelter requires approval by the chief of police. This approval is non-
discretionary and the approval is based upon objective standards that comply with statutory
requirements. Action D.1.4 proposes a policy be established detailing this approval process and the
contents of the security plan in compliance with Senate Bill 2.
As part of a governmental constraints analysis, housing elements must analyze constraints upon the
development, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities. Potential
constraints on the development of housing for persons with disabilities are the permitted uses for group
care facilities. Currently, small residential care facilities (also referred to as group care facilities) are
permitted in all residential zones and are conditionally permitted in commercial zones. Large group care
facilities are not permitted by right in any residential or commercial zone. They are conditionally permitted
in the R1, R2, R3, RP, C1, C2, and CW zones. Typically, community input for residential care facilities is
expressed at Planning Commission hearings. The City does not have specific standards or conditions that
apply to only large residential care facilities. There is also no standard set of conditions of approval for
large residential care facilities, nor does the City have siting requirements in the Land Use Element for
special housing or for residential care facilities.
The City last updated the Zoning Ordinance in 2003, and it is consistent with fair housing law. The Zoning
Ordinance defines “family” as “a household of one or more persons occupying a premise and living
together as a single nonprofit housekeeping unit, as distinguished from a group occupying a hotel, club,
fraternity or sorority house.” This definition of “family” comprises all people and therefore occupancy
standards that apply specifically to unrelated adults are not necessary. However, the Zoning Ordinance
does not differentiate between parking standards for persons with disabilities and those without them.
The City has a process for persons with disabilities to make a request for reasonable accommodation. The
agendas for City Council and Planning Commission hearings make information about reasonable
accommodation available, as does the City’s Web page. These sources state that anyone requiring
reasonable accommodation can call five days prior to a hearing to request assistance. This reasonable
accommodation is limited to public hearings and does not address expedited review of permits. While the
City implements the Uniform Building Code, private residences requesting a retrofit of their house for
accessibility are subject to the same standards and regulations and process as others seeking a building
permit. The City has not adopted any universal design elements into the building code. The City has
adopted a general process for streamlining the permit review process for a person with disabilities to
make a reasonable accommodation request, which includes exceptions to zoning and land use policies.
This reasonable accommodation procedure allows housing retrofits without discretionary review.

The City’s manufacturing zones, Commercial Manufacturing (C-M) and Manufacturing (M), also permit
residential uses. However, residential uses in these zones are limited to improvements of existing
residences and a place of residence for an owner or caretaker of the property. The C-M zone does,
however, permit multi-family residencies above ground-floor uses, subject to a use permit.
Development and Processing Fees
The City does not have development impact fees. However, the City does collect water and sewer
connection fees. Table 38 describes the proportion of the fees as a percentage of the overall cost of
development and lists the water and sewer connection fees. The City also collects fees from developers
to help cover the costs of planning and processing permits. Processing fees are calculated based on
average staff time and material costs required to process a particular type of case. Planning and processing
fees are summarized in Table 39. While these costs may impact housing affordability, these requirements
are deemed necessary to maintain the quality of life desired by City residents.

Permit Processing Procedures
Site Plan and Architectural Review – The purpose of a Site Plan and Architectural Review is to permit the
City to evaluate site plans and designs of structures to assure compatibility and harmony in appearance
in neighborhoods, reduce impacts on adjacent properties, and avoid monotonous and nonaesthetic
development. Site plan review and architectural review provisions apply to all permitted uses in the R-3,
R-P, C-1, C-2, CM, CW, and HS districts. Site Plan and Architectural Review also applies to all uses subject
to use permit review.
                                                                                                  Page A-38

                                                                       City of Crescent City Housing Element
Each site plan and architectural review project must be approved by the Architectural Review Committee
(ARC). The Architectural Review Committee consists of the five-member Planning Commission, the city
planner, and the city engineer. City planners are available to meet with applicants prior to submission of
an application.
The following review standards (see Section 17.46.035 of the City’s Municipal Code) are used by the ARC
to review projects:
          A. The architectural review committee shall review the application as to consistency with the
              applicable zoning, parking and landscaping, fencing, signage, street, sidewalk and public
              services requirements as set forth by this code.
          B. Where the city council has adopted a development plan and/or development standards for
              a specifically defined neighborhood within the city, the application shall also be reviewed
              for consistency with the criteria of such plan or standards.
          C. Where a structure(s) forty-five years or older is proposed for remodel or demolition, a
              review of the potential for impact upon a site listed on the National Historical Register or a
              site of local historical significance shall be made and considered in the architectural review
              decision. It is the goal of the city general plan to encourage property owners and other
              land managers to preserve or rehabilitate important historical and cultural sites rather
              than destroying them.
          D. If a project requires a variance or use permit, the architectural review committee shall not
              issue final approval of the project until the planning commission or city council has taken
              final action on the variance or use permit.
Within 45 days of submitting a complete application, the ARC holds a public hearing to review the project
for consistency with the applicable zoning, parking and landscaping, fencing, signage, street, sidewalk,
and public services requirements. From start to finish, the Site Plan and Architectural Review process takes
about 60 days. The application cost is $110.
Use Permits - A mixed-use project in the C-1, C-2, and CW zoning districts are subject to approval of a use
permit by the Planning Commission or in some cases the Planning Director. Processing time takes two
months for Planning Commission review and approval. Though not a requirement, staff encourages
applicants to meet with staff early in the design process to discuss potential issues. The first formal step
in the permit process is the review of the application by staff and the environmental determination. The
application then goes to public hearing with the Planning Commission.
Variances - Applications that include a request for a variance require Planning Commission approval.
Processing time and procedure is similar to that described above for the use permit.
Zoning and General Plan Amendments – Applications that require amendments to the Zoning Map, Zoning
Ordinance, or General Plan require review and approval by both the Planning Commission and City
Council. The City Council is the final decision-making body. Should the Planning Commission find that the
public health, safety, and welfare warrants an amendment, the City Council would receive a
recommendation and report of findings from the Planning Commission. However, the Planning
Commission may choose to deny an amendment should the public health, safety, and welfare not warrant
the requested change.

Permit Processing Times
The time involved in processing a development application can become a constraint to affordable housing
development. In Crescent City, most development applications for single-family and multi-family
developments take approximately one week to process as long as no discretionary approvals are needed.
If an applicant proposes developments that require discretionary review, such as a subdivision or a use
that requires a CUP, the processing time extends to between one and two months. This review period
does not present a constraint to development as some review is needed to ensure the maintenance of
health and safety standards.
Codes and Enforcement
Code Enforcement plays an important role in maintaining the quality of Crescent City’s neighborhoods.
Code Enforcement deals with a range of neighborhood issues, from abandoned vehicles parked in yards
or driveways to illegal conversions of garages into living spaces to unsanitary buildup of trash and debris
on private property.
The first “tool” in enforcing codes in Crescent City is public education. When code enforcement officers
explain that a law is being broken, most problems are resolved. Actual code “enforcement” (usually by
way of issuing citations) is normally used only when voluntary cooperation is not achieved. The City’s goal
is to stay in contact with community groups to understand local concerns, and questions regarding
neighborhood issues are welcomed.
The City of Crescent City implements the following codes: California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 24:
Part 1, 2013 California Administrative Code; Part 2, 2013 California Building Code; Part 3, 2005 National
Electrical Code (N.E.C.), 2013 California Electrical Code; Part 4, 2013 California Mechanical Code; Part 5,
2013 California Plumbing Code; Part 9, 2013 California Fire Code.
Coastal Zone
The California Coastal Act is administered by the California Coastal Commission. The act calls for the
preparation of a Local Coastal Program to implement state policies. As of March 16, 2009, the City
approved a resolution to transmit to the California Coastal Commission amendments to its local Coastal
Program Land Use Plan and implement plan elements. However, even after certification and delegation
of permit processing functions, the Coastal Commission retains authority over any change and retains
decision over most permits, either directly or a final appeals board. This program prescribes uses,
densities, urban/rural boundaries, and availability of public services on privately owned land in the City.
While local governments are charged with timely processing of permits, it is noted that any circumstance
which requires submittal of a permit to the Coastal Commission after local review adds an average of six
or more months to the permit process. Given the seasonal construction cycle in the community due to
climate, this time frame can delay the development of a project for a year or more.
The act establishes a growth control policy which determines when subdivisions can or cannot be
considered in coastal areas. The extension of community services such as water and sewer are restricted
outside of urban boundaries. The act also establishes Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Area (ESHA)
policies which have set aside open space areas that cannot be utilized for housing or any other
development. Prime Agriculture-designated lands have similar restraints on development which limit
individual parcels to one single-family residence and farm quarters upon conditional approval. Where
                                                                                                 Page A-40

                                                                        City of Crescent City Housing Element
changes in land use are permitted, Coastal Act priorities place visitor-serving and harbor/ocean-related
activities before housing.
In the mid-1980s, responsibility for provisions for low/moderate-income housing in the coastal zone was
removed from the Coastal Act and Coastal Commission jurisdiction. A separate amendment was made to
Government Code planning regulations to place this issue directly in local government hands.
On/Off-Site Improvements
In Crescent City, most development consists of infill development of existing lots as few undeveloped
parcels are large enough for subdivision. All City lots have access to City water and sewer, and in most
cases, the streets, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks are already in place. At those few locations where curb,
gutter, or sidewalk are not in place, new developments would be required to install these improvements
as a condition of project construction. The City also offers a zero percent interest loan program for new
sidewalks in previously developed areas.
With respect to development standards, permitted lot coverage ranges from 50 to 65 percent in
residential areas to exemption from lot coverage for mixed-use projects in commercial areas. Height
restrictions are generally 35 feet maximum in residential areas to 75 feet in mixed-use commercial areas,
while setbacks range from 5 to 20 feet. The City requires two parking spaces for single-family residences
with provisions for waiver to accommodate special circumstances. Multi-family developments must
provide 1.5 spaces per unit and need not be covered. The City has been able to work successfully with the
Farmers Home Administration in the past (since 1984), regarding parking for single-family residences. It is
now the City's policy to waive the excess parking requirements for low-income housing projects. There
are no recommendations for any necessary changes to the City’s improvement standards and regulations.
Non Governmental Constraints
Land Costs
The cost of raw, developable land creates a direct impact on the cost for a new home and is considered a
possible constraint. A higher cost of land raises the price of a new home. Therefore, developers sometimes
seek to obtain City approvals for the largest number of lots allowable on a parcel of land. There are no
vacant parcels for sale in Crescent City. Therefore, land costs in the surrounding area are shown in Table
40. The following list of sites was gathered through Ming Tree Real Estate (mingtreerealestate.com) and
Trulia (trulia.com) which lists vacant land for sale. Land prices ranged from $35,353 per acre to $1.2 million
per acre in Del Norte County. The higher land costs are for luxury-type properties, which are those located
near the ocean or other scenic vistas. No multi-family zoned land is offered for sale.

Construction and Labor Costs
Factors that affect the cost of building a house include the type of construction, materials, site conditions,
finishing details, amenities, and structural configuration. An Internet source of construction cost data,
provided by the Craftsman Book Company, estimates the cost of a single-story four-cornered home in
Crescent City to be approximately $155 per square foot. This cost estimate is based on a 1,500 square
foot house of good-quality construction including a two-car garage, with central heating and air
conditioning. The total construction costs, excluding land costs, are estimated at $200,475 for a house
built in a housing tract and $388,403 for a custom home.
If labor or material costs increased substantially, the cost of construction in the City of Crescent City could
rise to a level that impacts the price of new construction and rehabilitation. Therefore, increased
construction costs have the potential to constrain new housing construction and rehabilitation of existing
housing.
Availability of Financing
The cost of borrowing money to finance the construction of housing or to purchase a house affects the
amount of affordably priced housing in Crescent City. Fluctuating interest rates can eliminate many
potential homebuyers from the housing market or render a housing project that could have been
developed at lower interest rates infeasible. When interest rates decline, sales increase. The reverse has
been true when interest rates increase. Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic growth in
alternative mortgage products, including graduated mortgages and variable rate mortgages. These types
of loans allow homeowners to take advantage of lower initial interest rates and to qualify for larger home
loans.
However, variable rate mortgages are not ideal for low- and moderate-income households that live on
tight budgets. Variable rate mortgages may allow lower-income household to enter into homeownership,
but there is a definite risk of monthly housing costs rising above the financial means of that household.
Therefore, the fixed interest rate mortgage remains the preferred type of loan, especially during periods
of low, stable interest rates. Table 41 illustrates interest rates as of May 2014. The table presents both
the interest rate and annual percentage rate (APR) for different types of home loans. The interest rate is
the percentage of an amount of money which is paid for its use for a specified time, and the APR is the
yearly percentage rate that expresses the total finance charge on a loan over its entire term. The APR
includes the interest rate, fees, points, and mortgage insurance and is therefore a more complete measure
of a loan’s cost than the interest rate alone. However, the loan’s interest rate, not its APR, is used to
calculate the monthly principal and interest payment.

Environmental Constraints
There are several environmental constraints to development. The greatest environmental consideration
and threat to housing in Crescent City is the potential of a tsunami. The Great Alaskan Earthquake of 1964
generated a tsunami that struck Crescent City, causing over $16 million in damages to 289 businesses and
homes. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood maps illustrate this hazard, designating
large portions of the southern half of the City within Flood Zone V and Zone VE, which are areas of coastal
flooding and areas of coastal flooding with velocity potential. Flood Zone X extends beyond the Zone V
and Zone VE areas, reaching as far inland as 6th Street. Other areas of flooding include portions of the City
east of the fairgrounds.
While the City itself is predominantly built out, annexing land presents environmental constraints as well.
The City is physically constrained by the Pacific Ocean to the southeast and southwest; land beyond the
City to the east is hilly, forested, and has potential flooding hazards from Elk Creek. Additionally, the land
east of the City is part of the Elk Valley Rancheria, a federal reservation of the Tolowa Native Americans.
There are also man-made constraints to the location and size of housing development due to the Crescent
City Airport. Further environmental constraints include seismic hazards from earthquakes that would
result in damage to housing from liquefaction and ground shaking. The City’s challenge is to target new
housing development while balancing these constraints.
Infrastructure
Water
Water is not a constraint to development in the City of Crescent City. The City’s water supply is the Smith
River. The City has a permit for 2,600 acre-feet of water per year. The City, on average, uses approximately
1,750 acre-feet of water per year. The City’s 1992 Water System Master Plan stated that single-family
residential equivalents (SFRE) use 220 gallons of water per day. (It should be noted that one single-family
Page A-43

City of Crescent City Housing Element
home is one SFRE; a four-bedroom apartment is one SFRE; a three-bedroom apartment is 0.9 SFRE; a two-
bedroom apartment is 0.75 SFRE; and a one-bedroom apartment is 0.6 SFRE.) For the purposes of this
Housing Element and determining water capacity, it was assumed that SFREs use 300 gallons per day.
Given the City’s capacity for 2,600 acre-feet of water per year, the City can accommodate approximately
7,737 SFREs. This is more than enough capacity to handle future development within the planning period
of this Housing Element.
Sewer
Sewer capacity was a potential constraint to development. The California Regional Water Quality Control
Board issued a Cease and Desist Order in 1997. The order placed a connection restriction on the City
subject to performance standards. Since that time, the City has conducted improvements to the facility
that allowed additional connections. Further, the City is has completed all of the upgrades to the
wastewater treatment facility (WWTF). Upon completion of the upgrades, the Cease and Desist Order was
removed, and new connections will be added as long as water quality parameters are not violated.
Approximate estimates place the WWTF capacity at 1,000 SFREs. The City Public Works Department
charges a connection fee of $9,682 per single-family residential equivalent.
To comply with Senate Bill 1087, the City will immediately forward its adopted Housing Element to its
water and wastewater providers so they can grant priority for service allocations to future developments
that include units affordable to lower-income households.
                                                                                               Page A-44

                                                                       City of Crescent City Housing Element
Housing Resources and Opportunities
At-Risk Housing
In 1989, the California Government Code was amended to include a requirement that localities identify
and develop a program in their housing elements for the preservation of assisted, affordable multi-family
units. Subsequent amendments have clarified the scope of the analysis to include units developed
pursuant to inclusionary housing and density bonus programs. In the preservation analysis, localities are
required to provide an inventory of assisted, affordable units that are eligible to convert within ten years.
A survey of multi-family units in the City that are managed under affected programs was made. In the
Crescent City area, there are five affordable housing projects, none of which are at risk.
         Totem Villa Apartments – 1085 Highway 101 North. Project has 37 units for families under the
          FmHA 515 Rural Rental Housing program. Contract dates are 11/1/1990 to 11/1/2040. Eligible
          for prepayment in 2010. Verbal consultation with Housing Authority director, Susie Mendez, in
          May 2009, indicated there is no intent to discontinue participation in the contract program.
          Project is not considered at risk during the 2014-2019 planning period.
         Seagull Villa – 655 Pacific Avenue. Project has 50 units for seniors under the FmHA 515 Rural
          Rental Housing program. Contract dates are 9/10/1982 to 9/10/2032. Eligible for prepayment in
          2001. Verbal consultation with Housing Authority director, Susie Mendez, in May 2009, indicated
          there is no intent to discontinue participation in the contract program. Project is not considered
          at risk during the 2014-2019 planning period.
         Seabreeze Apartments – 1045 E. Condor Street. Project has 56 units for families under the FmHA
          515 Rural Rental Housing program. Contract dates are 11/30/1979 to 11/30/2029. Eligible for
          prepayment in 2001. Verbal consultation with Housing Authority director, Susie Mendez, in May
          2009, indicated there is no intent to discontinue participation in the contract program. Project is
          not considered at risk during the 2014-2019 planning period.
         Crescent City Senior Apartments – CBM Group – 1125 Oregon Street. Project has 38 units for
          seniors under FmHA 515 Rural Rental Housing program. Contract expires in 2041. Eligible for
          prepayment 2028. Project is not at risk within the 2014-2019 planning period.
         The Surf Senior Apartments – 108 H Street. Project has 55 units for seniors. It was established as
          a Tax-exempt Bond-financed project in 1996 (CAC-1996-246) which requires provision of base
          market rate units for a minimum of 15 years. The current owner purchased the project in 2013
          and according to the owner the units are required to remain affordable until at least 2028.
          Information obtained from the California State Treasurer/California Tax Credit Allocation
          Committee (CTAC) website. Project is not at risk during the 2014-2019 planning period.
While no units have been identified as at-risk during the next 10 years, there is the potential units could
become at-risk during that time period. Therefore, the City must provide a list of qualified entities that
work in the area that would potentially be available to help preserve these units if necessary. Below is a
list of these entities.

Coastal Zone Requirement
The City of Crescent City is required by Government Code Section 65588 to provide an additional analysis
of units constructed, demolished, and replaced within 3 miles of a coastal zone to ensure the affordable
housing stock with the coastal zone is being protected and provided. This analysis must include: The
number of new housing units approved for construction within the coastal zone (after January 1982); The
number of units for persons and families of low- and moderate-income that have been required to be
included in new housing developments within 3 miles of the coastal zone; The number of existing units
occupied by low- or moderate-income residents; and The number of low- and moderate-income
residential units that have been required for replacement or authorized for demolition or conversion.
The City’s housing stock is located within three miles of its coastal zone. The City has 236 total affordable
housing units. Of these units, 179 were constructed after 1982. No affordable units have been constructed
in the City since the early 1990s. The Surf Hotel was converted to affordable senior housing units in 1995.
The affordable units provide housing for 234 low-income households, and there are 620 active Housing
Choice Voucher families in the City. Since the last planning period, no units have been demolished or
converted within the City and within the coastal zone.
Other Programs
At this time, the City does not have housing rehabilitation programs or options available. The County’s
rehabilitation program ended in 2014 due to changes in CDBG program income regulations. The City
continues to refer homeowners to the Senior Center weatherization program. Should any new
rehabilitation programs begin, the City will actively publicize them through community outreach and
online.
Other housing programs in the City administered by Rural Human Services (RHS) include the Harrington
House which provides shelter to victims of domestic violence; and Supported Living Services Program
which serves adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Housing Authority
Residents of Crescent City are served by the Crescent City Housing Authority (CCHA). The CCHA maintains
a baseline agreement with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for 590
Housing Choice Voucher (formerly known as Section 8) housing assistance vouchers. A review of the rent
scale is conducted quarterly and additional vouchers are possible where rents are low and excess funding
is available as a result. The CCHA reports no risk of loss in the 590-voucher baseline between 2014 and
2019 and hopes to maintain 590 vouchers available beyond 2019.
                                                                                                   Page A-46

Annexations
The City has approved one annexation (the Roosevelt Annexation) since 2002. The Roosevelt Annexation
consisted of 93.8 acres. Land uses include public facilities along Washing Boulevard, commercial uses
along Northcrest Drive, and residential uses. The City of Crescent City’s pre-annexation plan anticipated a
development potential of 278 dwelling units. Key infrastructure improvements were needed to serve the
project. These improvements included upgrading the Roosevelt public water system and repairing the
sewer system; the new regional wastewater treatment facility would be completed.
Regional Housing Need
The Regional Housing Need Allocation (RHNA) is a minimum projection of additional housing units needed
to accommodate projected household growth at all income levels by the end of the Housing Element’s
statutory planning period. As shown in Table 43, the City of Crescent City is required to accommodate 77
units, 33 of which must be affordable for lower-income households, during the 2014–2019 planning
period.

RHNA Progress
In updating the Housing Element, the City may take credit for any units approved, permitted, or built after
January 1, 2014. Since 2014, building permits have been pulled for 10 new units and 87 units have had
substantial rehabilitation (56 units in the Surf Apartments and 31 units in the Oregon Street Apartments).
This development reduces the City’s RHNA for the planning period. Table 44 displays the City’s RHNA
progress toward meeting its allocation, the remaining need, a summary of the capacity of vacant sites,
and the resulting surplus of appropriate sites. Based on the City’s current vacant land inventory (Tables
46 and 47), Crescent City has an adequate amount of vacant land capacity to accommodate the remaining
need of 67 units. While the total site inventory capacity shows 139 units, it does not take into account the
additional mixed-use inventory of 270 units.

Available Vacant Sites
The City’s supply of vacant land will supply the future housing needs. Tables 45 and 47 describe the
available vacant land in Crescent City, and Figure 3 illustrates the locations of vacant parcels.
While the City has included residential, commercial, and mixed-use sites in the vacant parcel inventory,
the City is only relying on residentially zoned parcels to meet its housing need of 77 units.
The Downtown Business District (C-1), General Commercial District (C-2), and Commercial Waterfront
District (CW) districts allow 100 percent residential or mixed-use development projects with a conditional
use permit. Based on development trends (as shown in Table 45), it is safe to assume that sites zoned CW,
C-1, and C-2 have the ability to accommodate lower-, moderate-, and above moderate-income
households.
The City has included the following actions to help facilitate affordable residential development:
               Action A.2.1 is intended to encourage developers by helping to facilitate the development of
                affordable multifamily units in the upper half of the density range by providing flexibility in
                development standards (such as reduced setbacks, reduced parking requirements, and
                increased height limits) and promoting density bonuses to increase densities for developers
                interested in building in the upper end of the allowed density range. This action is intended
                to assist developers and therefore does not add any additional cost. Processing and approval
                time will be at a reasonable level.
               Action A.6.1: The City will allow for flexibility in density and design standards including
                encouraging the use of small residential lots through reduced setbacks, increased height
                limits, and increased lot coverage to help facilitate a variety of housing for lower-income and
                special needs groups which will include multi-family, single-family, and mixed-use product
                types.
                                                                                                        Page A-48

                                                                           City of Crescent City Housing Element
             Action B.1.4: To ensure that there is a sufficient supply of multifamily zoned land to meet the
              City’s regional housing needs allocation (RHNA), the City will help facilitate lot consolidations
              to combine small residential lots into larger developable lots by annually meeting with local
              developers to discuss lot consolidation opportunities to accommodate affordable housing
              units, including review of contiguous sites, as shown in Appendix A Figure 3. As
              developers/owners approach the City interested in lot consolidation for affordable housing,
              the City will offer the following incentives on a project by project basis: Allow affordable
              projects to exceed the maximum height limits; lessen set-backs, and/or reduce parking
              requirements.
              The City will also consider offsetting fees (when financially feasible) and concurrent/fast
              tracking of project application reviews to developers who provide affordable housing.
             Action B.1.5: In order to continue to maintain a supply of vacant land within the City limits
              to meet the City’s RHNA and ensure that there is a sufficient supply of land for higher-density
              housing the City will amend the Zoning Code to allow for residential development in a mixed
              use project by right (only subject to a Site Plan and Architectural review process) in the
              Commercial Waterfront District (CW). Residential will be allowed at 60 units per acre.
             Action B.3.1: The City shall promote the development of mixed-use commercial and
              residential activities in its C-1, C-2, C-W, and C-M districts by providing appropriate incentives
              for development, by allowing for departures from parking standards where feasible, and
              exemption for residential uses from zoning lot coverage limitations. The incentives for
              market-rate projects will be less generous than those allowed under state density bonus law
              for affordable and moderate income projects. The will look also look at amending the C-W
              and C-2 Districts to allow for greater lot coverage for residential uses.
Realistic Capacity
The realistic capacity of each site was determined by examining two factors. The first factor is a review of
the constructed density from sample development projects in the CW, R-1, R-2, R-3, and CZ-RP zones.
Results indicated that the constructed density varies dramatically within and between the different zones.
For example, some multifamily developments in the R-3 zone were built to within 85 percent of the
maximum density, while other projects were built to within 36 percent of the maximum density. The R-1
and CW zones present cases where the maximum allowed density was exceeded: a single-family home
constructed on a legal lot demonstrates a density of 152 percent on a sample lot in the R-1 zone and
multifamily development in the CW zone is as high as 175 percent. The second factor used to determine
the realistic capacity was to account for the installation of access points, potential flooding concerns,
parking constraints, setbacks, and environmental concerns. Given these two factors, the following realistic
capacity is assigned to each zone:
        R-1: 80 percent. This percentage is based on development standards and recent development
         listed in Table 43.
        R-2: 25 percent. This percentage is an average from three sample developments listed in Table
         43.
        R-3: 58 percent. This percentage is an average from three sample developments listed in Table
         43.
Page A-49

City of Crescent City Housing Element
         CZ-R1: 80 percent. There are no current development examples to determine capacity, so the
          realistic capacity was based on similar zones and development standards.
         C-1, C-2, and RP: 50 percent. Only one project serves as a sample development in a mixed-use
          zone. The conversion of the Camelot Inn would have a realistic unit capacity of 60 percent of the
          maximum allowed by the zoning. However, this project is not developed. Given the minimal
          examples of mixed-use projects and because mixed-use parcels cannot support a large density of
          dwelling units, 50 percent was a conservative estimate of the realistic unit capacity.
         CW: 75 percent. This percentage represents a conservative estimate of the realistic unit capacity
          and reflects the lowest realistic capacity from a sample development listed in Table 45.

Small Sites Analysis
Many of the parcels listed in Tables 45 and 46 are less than a quarter of an acre in size and it can be
difficult to build affordable multifamily housing on smaller sites. However, many of these sites have the
same owner and are adjacent to each other or to other sites in the inventory, making them prime
candidates for lot consolidation. Of the sites listed in Tables 45 and 46, each of the following groups of
sites are contiguous: 21–25, 34 and 37, 45 and 46, 49 and 59, and 51, 53, 56, 62, 55 and 66. Of the total
units the City has allocated in the inventory to meet its lower-income regional housing need, only two
units are being accommodated on sites that have potential for lot consolidation into larger sites more
feasible for development of affordable housing. To help facilitate the development of affordable housing
on smaller lots, the City has included Action B.1.4 to assist in the consolidation of small lots. The City is
also promoting the development of suitable projects such as apartments, condos, or townhouses and
encouraging these developments to include affordable housing units, thereby making them eligible for
density bonuses. The adopted Density Bonus section of the Zoning Code allows flexible development
standards if affordable housing is included in the project.
In addition, the City has included Action A.6.1 to encourage the use of small residential lots to
accommodate affordable housing units by providing incentives such as flexibility in development
standards, offset of fees (when financially feasible), and concurrent/fast tracking of project application
reviews to developers who provide affordable housing. (This action would be completed through a Zoning
Code amendment and would require final approval by the City Council.) In addition, to further promote
or allow development on small residential sites, the City will streamline the development review process,
when feasible, to help private developers.

Energy Conservation Opportunities
Opportunities for energy conservation can be found for both existing and future housing developments.
Conservation can be achieved through a variety of approaches including reducing the use of energy-
consuming items, physical modification of existing structures or land uses, and reducing the reliance on
automobiles by encouraging more mixed-use and infill development and providing pedestrian access to
commercial and recreational facilities.
Some energy conservation features are incorporated into the design of residential structures in the City
of Crescent City due to the requirements of Title 24, which outlines measures to reduce energy
consumption. These measures include low-flow plumbing fixtures, efficient heating and cooling
opportunities, dual-pane windows, and adequate insulation and weather stripping. Incorporating new
technology within residential development offers homeowners an opportunity to have homes that allow
for maximum energy conservation. Although energy regulations establish a uniform standard of energy
efficiency, they do not ensure that all available conservation features are incorporated into building
design. Additional measures may further reduce heating, cooling, and lighting loads and overall energy
consumption. While it is not feasible that all possible conservation features be included in every
development, there are often a number of economically feasible measures that may result in savings in
excess of the minimum required by Title 24.
Constructing new homes with energy-conserving features, in addition to retrofitting existing structures,
will result in a reduction in monthly utility costs. There are many ways to determine how energy efficient
an existing building is and, if needed, what improvements can be made. Many modern building design
methods are used to reduce residential energy consumption and are based on proven techniques. These
methods can be categorized in three ways:
  1. Building design that retains natural heat. Such design reduces air conditioning and heating
       demands. Proven building techniques in this category include:
              a) Location of windows and openings in relation to the path of the sun to minimize solar gain
                   in the summer and maximize solar gain in the winter;
              b) Use of “thermal mass”, earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete, and tiles that
                   absorb heat during the day and release heat at night;
              c) Use of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to reduce heat exchange
                   between the interior of a home and the exterior;
              d) Location of openings and use of ventilating devices that take advantage of natural air flow;
              e) Use of eaves and overhangs that block direct solar gain through window openings during
                   the summer but allow solar gain during the winter; and
              f)   Zone heating and cooling systems, to reduce heating and cooling in unused areas of a
                   home.
  2. Building orientation that maintains a comfortable interior temperature. Examples include:

City of Crescent City Housing Element
             a) North-south orientation of the long axis of a dwelling;
             b) Minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces; and
             c) Location of dwellings to take advantage of natural air circulation and evening breezes.
  3. Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures. Such techniques include:
             a) Use of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home;
             b) Use of natural or artificial flowing water; and
             c) Use of trees and hedges as windbreaks.
In addition to these naturally-based techniques, modern methods include:
        Use of solar energy to heat water;
        Use of radiant barriers on roofs to keep attics cool;
        Use of solar panels and other devices to generate electricity;
        High-efficiency coating on windows to repel summer heat and trap winter warmth;
        Weather stripping and other insulation to reduce heat gain and loss;
        Use of natural gas for dryers, stovetops, and ranges;
        Use of energy-efficient home appliances; and
        Use of low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators to reduce hot water use.
Major opportunities for residential energy conservation in the City will include insulation and
weatherproofing, landscaping and maximizing orientation, lowering appliance consumption, and
maximizing use of solar energy.

Appendix B – Funding Sources


                                                                      City of Crescent City Housing Element
The City and local housing agencies have several funding sources available for pursuit of various housing
activities, with the most notable financing programs summarized below:
Section 8 Program - This federally-funded program is administered through the Crescent City Housing
Authority, who offers Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers (under the HCV Program). The Section 8
program provides rental assistance to households qualifying as extremely-low and low-income. A
voucher typically covers differences between fair market rents (for standards developed by HUD) and
what a tenant is able to pay (with 30 percent the standard threshold). The number of people using
vouchers varies at any one time, with 590 the current number used by the Housing Authority.
Home Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) - HOME funds are available to assist with owner-
occupied rehabilitation projects to qualifying households (lower-income and moderate-income
households). The funds are used to make necessary repairs and upgrades related to health and safety
issues at the qualifying residences. These funds can be used for site-built and manufactured homes,
although manufactured homes must be less than 17 years old. Loans can be considered based on a loan-
to-value ratio not exceeding 75 percent, factoring in values after the work is completed.
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) - A wide range of federal CDBG funds are
available, including funds for housing rehabilitation and minor home repairs. Use of revolving loan funds
keeps this program available for succeeding years, and repairs can include roofs, windows, hot water
heaters, access improvements for the disabled, and similar actions that require immediate attention.
Low interest loan programs are also available to homeowners who rent units to low income families, for
a similar range of home improvements.
Multifamily Housing Program (MHP) - This program provides low-interest loans for development of
affordable rental housing units. The housing project is subject to qualification through State HCD. A
qualifying sponsor (private or public) can pursue these funds. A similar program, MHP-Supportive
Housing, provides loans for rental housing with supportive services for the disable who are homeless or
at risk of becoming homeless.
CalHome - This program provides grants to local agencies and nonprofit organizations to fund first- time
homebuyer mortgage assistance and owner-occupied housing rehabilitation. For small cities, who must
have been operating as a housing administrator the previous two years, recent funding limits have been
a maximum of $600,000.
Emergency Housing and Assistance Program (EHAP) - The EHAP focuses on provision of deferred loans
for capital development of emergency shelters and transitional housing for the homeless.
Transit Oriented Development Program (TOD) - This program provides funding for housing and related
infrastructure improvements near transit.
California Solar Initiative (CPUC) - Under this program, cash is offered on an incentive basis to installation
of solar systems. This program is usually paired with federal programs, allowing for coverage of up to 50
percent of the total cost of the solar system. Affordable housing projects can get up to 75 percent of the
total system costs covered.

Appendix C – Glossary


                                                                      City of Crescent City Housing Element
The following definitions are commonly used terms in a Housing Element:
Above Moderate-Income: Above moderate-income households are defined as households with incomes
over 120 percent of the county median.
Accessory Dwelling Unit: A dwelling unit that is a separate living quarter from the principle dwelling unit
and has its own kitchen and bathroom
Affordability: Annual cost of housing includes mortgage, principle and interest payments as amortized
over 25 years with a 25 percent down payment or gross rent that does not exceed 30 percent of gross
annual household income or 30 percent of gross annual income devoted to rental housing, including
utilities are defined as "affordable".
Affordable Housing: "Affordable Housing" refers to the relationship between the price of housing in a
region (either sale price or rent) and household income. Affordable housing is that which is affordable to
households of very low, low and moderate incomes. For housing to be affordable, shelter costs must not
exceed 30 percent of the gross annual income of the household.
Assisted Housing: Assisted housing refers to a unit that rents or sells for less than the prevailing market
rate due to governmental monetary intervention or contribution. The terms “assisted” and “subsidized”
are often used interchangeably.
Attainable Housing: A term often used instead of or interchangeably with “workforce” housing. It refers
to the idea that all income groups should have accessible housing. Attainable housing as a policy measure
seeks to create housing for affordable to a variety of income levels.
At-Risk Housing: Applies to existing subsidized affordable rental housing units, especially federally
subsidized developments, that are threatened with conversion to market rents because of termination of
use restrictions, due to expiration or non-renewal of subsidy arrangements.
Below Market Rate (BMR) Unit: A BMR unit is a housing unit that sells or rents for less than the going
market rate. It is typically used in reference to housing units that are directly or indirectly subsidized or
have other restrictions in order to make them affordable to very low, low or moderate- income
households.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG): The State CDBG program was established by the federal
Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended (42 USC 5301, et seq.). The primary
federal objective of the CDBG program is the development of viable urban communities by providing
decent housing and a suitable living environment and by expanding economic opportunities, principally
for persons of low and moderate income. "Persons of low and moderate income" or the "targeted income
group" (TIG) are defined as families, households, and individuals whose incomes do not exceed 80 percent
of the county median income, with adjustments for family or household size.
Condominium: A building or group of buildings in which units are owned individually, but the structure,
common areas and facilities are owned by all owners on a proportional, undivided basis.
Continuum of Care: An approach that helps communities plan for and provide a full range of emergency,
transitional, and permanent housing and service resources to address the various needs of homeless
persons at the point in time that they need them. The approach is based on the understanding that
Page C-1

City of Crescent City Housing Element
homelessness is not caused merely by a lack of shelter, but involves a variety of underlying, unmet needs
– physical, economic, and social. Designed to encourage localities to develop a coordinated and
comprehensive long-term approach to homelessness, the Continuum of Care consolidates the planning,
application, and reporting documents for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s
Shelter Plus Care, Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Single-Room Occupancy Dwellings (SRO) Program,
and Supportive Housing Program. (U.S. House Bill 2163).
Cost Burden: A household has a "housing cost burden" if it spends 30 percent or more of its income on
housing costs. A household has a "severe housing cost burden" if it spends 50 percent or more of its
income on housing. Owner housing costs consist of payments for mortgages, deeds of trust, contracts to
purchase, or similar debts on the property; real estate taxes; fire, hazard, and flood insurance on the
property; utilities; and fuels. Where applicable, owner costs also include monthly condominium fees.
Renter calculations use gross rent, which is the contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of
utilities (electricity, gas, water and sewer) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.) if these are paid by
the renter (or paid for the renter by someone else). Household income is the total pre-tax income of the
householder and all other individuals at least 15 years old in the household. In all estimates of housing
cost burdens, owners and renters for whom housing cost-to-income was not computed are excluded from
the calculations.
Decennial Census: Every ten years, the Census Bureau conducts a national household survey, producing
the richest source of nationally-available small-area data. Article I of the Constitution requires that a
census be taken every ten years for the purpose of reapportioning the U.S. House of Representatives.
The federal government uses decennial census data for apportioning congressional seats, for identifying
distressed areas, and for many other activities. Census data are collected using two survey forms: the
short form and the long form. Short form information is collected on every person and includes basic
characteristics, such as age, sex, and race. The long form is sent to one out of every six households and
collects more detailed information, such as income, housing characteristics, and employment. Most of
the indicators in DataPlace are from the long form, and are thus estimates based on the sample of
households. These values may differ considerably from the same indicators based on the short form data,
particularly for small areas.
Density: This refers to the number of housing units on a unit of land (e.g. ten units per acre).
Density Bonus Programs: Allows minimum density increase over the zoned maximum density of a
proposed residential development, if the developer makes a specified amount of units affordable to lower
income households.
Disability: A long-lasting physical, mental, or emotional condition. This condition can make it difficult for
a person to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or remembering. This
condition can also impede a person from being able to go outside the home alone or to work at a job or
business.
Development Impact Fees: A fee or charge imposed on developers to pay for a jurisdiction’s costs of
providing services to new development.
Development Right: The right granted to a land owner or other authorized party to improve a property.
Such right is usually expressed in terms of a use and intensity allowed under existing zoning regulation.
                                                                                                     Page C-2

                                                                        City of Crescent City Housing Element
Dwelling Unit: Any residential structure, whether or not attached to real property, including
condominium and cooperative units and mobile or manufactured homes. It includes both one-to-four-
family and multifamily structures. Vacation or second homes and rental properties are also included.
Elderly Units: Specific units in a development are restricted to residents over a certain age (as young as
55 years and over). Persons with disabilities may share certain developments with the elderly.
Element: A division or chapter of the Crescent City General Plan.
Emergency Shelter: (per Health and Safety Code 50801): Housing with minimal supportive services for
homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. No individual
or household may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay
Entitlement City: A city, which based on its population, is entitled to receive funding directly from HUD.
Examples of entitlement programs include CDBG and HOME.
Extremely Low-Income Limit: The upper limit for the extremely low-income category, set at 30 percent
of the HUD area median family income. This is not an official program eligibility income limit, except when
associated with a specific family size (e.g., "single person", "family of two", "family of three", etc.).
Fair Market Rent (FMR): Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are freely set rental rates defined by HUD as the
median gross rents charged for available standard units in a county or Standard Metropolitan Statistical
Area (SMSA). Fair Market Rents are used for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program and other
HUD programs and are published annually by HUD.
Farm Labor Housing (Farm Worker): Units for migrant farm workers that can be available for transitional
housing for the homeless when not occupied by migrant farm workers.
Family Households: A family household is one in which the householder lives with one or more individuals
related to him or her by birth, marriage, or adoption.
Family Income: In decennial census data, family income includes the incomes of all household members
15 years old and over related to the householder. Although the family income statistics from each census
cover the preceding calendar year, the characteristics of individuals and the composition of families refer
to the time of enumeration (April 1 of the respective census years). Thus, the income of the family does
not include amounts received by individuals who were members of the family during all or part of the
calendar year prior to the census if these individuals no longer resided with the family at the time of
census enumeration. Similarly, income amounts reported by individuals who did not reside with the
family during the calendar year prior to the census but who were members of the family at the time of
enumeration are included. However, the composition of most families was the same during the preceding
calendar year as at the time of enumeration.
Fannie Mae: Established in 1938 by the Federal government and becoming a private company in 1968,
Fannie Mae operates under a congressional charter that directs it to channel their efforts into increasing
the availability and affordability of homeownership for low-, moderate-, and middle-income Americans.
Yet Fannie Mae receives no government funding or backing, and they are one of the nation's largest
taxpayers. They do not lend money directly to home buyers. Instead, they work with lenders to make
sure they don't run out of mortgage funds, so more people can achieve their goal of homeownership.

moderate-income persons. Commissioners are appointed by the local governing body of the jurisdiction
in which they operate. Many housing authorities own their own housing or operate public housing
funded by HUD.
Housing Choice Voucher Program: Housing Choice Voucher Program (formerly known as Section 8) is a
subsidy program funded by the federal government and overseen by the Crescent City Housing Authority
to provide low rents and/or housing payment contributions for very low and low-income households.
HUD: The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development is cabinet level department of
the federal government that oversees program and funding for affordable housing laws, development,
and federally funded financial assistance.
HUD Area Median Family Income: HUD is required by law to set income limits that determine the
eligibility of applicants for HUD's assisted housing programs. Income limits are calculated annually for
                                                                                                  Page C-4

and/or housing payment contributions for very low and low-income households.
Service Needs: The particular services required by special populations, typically including needs such as
transportation, personal care, housekeeping, counseling, meals, case management, personal emergency
response, and other services preventing premature institutionalization and assisting individuals to
continue living independently.
Single-Room Occupancy Dwelling (SRO): The SRO Program provides rental assistance for homeless

Substandard Housing: This refers to housing where major repair or replacement may be needed to make
it structurally sound, weatherproofed and habitable.
Subsidized Housing: Typically refers to housing that rents for less than the market rate due to a direct
financial contribution from the government. There are two general types of housing subsidies. The first
is most commonly referred to as “project-based” where the subsidy is linked with a particular unit or
development and the other is known as “tenant-based” where the subsidy is linked to the low income
individual or family. The terms “assisted” and “subsidized” are often used interchangeably.

Transitional Housing: Housing for people recovering from substance abuse issues or transitioning form
homelessness. Transitional housing provides longer term accommodations to homeless families and
individuals than emergency shelter housing. Transitional Housing provides a stable living environment
for the period of time necessary to learn new skills, find employment, and/or develop a financial base
with which to re-enter the housing market.
VA-Guaranteed: VA guaranteed loans are made by private lenders to eligible veterans for the purchase
of a home which must be for their own personal occupancy. To get a loan, a veteran must apply to a
lender. If the loan is approved, VA will guarantee a portion of it to the lender. This guaranty protects the
lender against loss up to the amount guaranteed and allows a veteran to obtain favorable financing
terms.
Very Low-Income Limit: Very low-income households are defined as households with incomes less than
50 percent of the area median household income.
Veteran: Anyone who has been discharged from the military generally after at least two years of service
whether they served on active duty in a conflict or not. (U.S. House Bill 2163).
Workforce Housing: Refers to housing that is meant for residents making low, moderate to above
moderate area median income. Some programs focus on employers providing assistance to their
employees; some are instituting inclusionary programs, while others give preference to this group in their
homeownership programs. Some jurisdictions have programs for specific segments of the workforce
t h a t are vital for the everyday function of the community such as teachers, policeman and other public
employees.
Zoning: Zoning is an activity under taken by local jurisdictions to direct and shape land development
activities. The intent of zoning is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by ensuring that
incompatible land uses (e.g. residential vs. heavy industrial) are not located next to each other. Zoning
also impacts land values, creating and taking away "capitol" for and from property owners. For example,
a lot that is zoned for commercial development is more valuable (in financial terms) than a lot that is
zoned for open space. Typically, lots that are zoned for higher densities have greater value on the
m a r k e t than lots that are zoned for lower densities. Zoning is one of the most important regulatory
functions performed by local jurisdictions.

Children: The term “children,” as used in tables on living arrangements of children under 18, are all
persons under 18 years, excluding people who maintain households, families, or subfamilies as a
reference person or spouse.
Own Children: Sons and daughters, including stepchildren and adopted children, of the householder.
Similarly, “own” children in a subfamily are sons and daughters of the married couple or parent in the
subfamily. (All children shown as members of related subfamilies are own children of the person(s)
maintaining the subfamily>) For each type of family unit identifies in the CPS, the count of “own children
under 18 year old” is limited to never-married children; however, “own children under 25”and “own
children of any age,” as the terms are used here, include all children regardless of marital status. The
counts include never-married children living away from home in college dormitories.
Related children: Includes all people in a household under the age of 18, regardless of marital status,
who are related to the householder. It does not include householder's spouse or foster children,
regardless of age.
Ethnic Origin: People of Hispanic origin were identified by a question that asked for self-identification of
the persons’ origin or descent. Respondents were asked to select their origin (and the origin of other
household members) from a “flash card” listing ethnic origins. People of Hispanic origin in particular,
were those who indicated that their origin was Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American,
or some other Hispanic origin. It should be noted that people of Hispanic origin may be of any race.
Family: A group of two or more people who reside together and who are related by birth, marriage, or
adoption.
Family household (Family): A family includes a householder and one or more people living in the same
household who are related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption. All people in a household
who are related to the householder are regarded as members of his or her family. A family household
may contain people not related to the householder, but those people are not included as part of the
householder's family in census tabulations. Thus, the number of family households is equal to the number
of families, but family households may include more members than do families. A household c a n contain
only one family for purposes of census tabulations. Not all households contain families since a household
may comprise a group of unrelated people or one person living alone.
Family size: Refers to the number of people in a family.
Family type: Refers to how the members of a family are related to one another and the householder.
Families may be a "Married Couple Family," "Single Parent Family," "Stepfamily," or "Subfamily."
Household: A household includes all the people who occupy a housing unit as their usual place of
residence.
Household Income: The total income of all the persons living in a household. A household is usually
described as very low income, low income, moderate income, and above moderate income based on
household size and income, relative to regional median income.
Household size: The total number of people living in a housing unit.

Household type and relationship: Households are classified by type according to the sex of the
householder and the presence of relatives. Examples include: married-couple family; male householder,
no wife present; female householder, no husband present; spouse (husband/wife); child; and other
relatives.
Householder: The person, or one of the people, in whose name the home is owned, being bought, or
rented. If there is no such person present, any household member 15 years old and over can serve as
t h e householder for the purposes of the census. Two types of householders are distinguished: a family
householder and a non-family householder. A family householder is a householder living with one or more
people related to him or her by birth, marriage, or adoption. The householder and all people in the
household related to him are family members. A non-family householder is a householder living alone or
with non-relatives only.
Housing unit: A house, an apartment, a mobile home or trailer, a group of rooms, or a single room
occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters.
Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in the
building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant
units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to the intended occupants whenever
possible.
Median: This measure represents the middle value (if n is odd) or the average of the two middle values
(if n is even) in an ordered list of data values. The median divides the total frequency distribution into two
equal parts: one-half of the cases fall below the median and one-half of the cases exceed the median.
Median age: This measure divides the age distribution in a stated area into two equal parts: one-half of
the population falling below the median value and one-half above the median value.
Median income: The median income divides the income distribution into two equal groups; one has
incomes above the median and the other having incomes below the median.
Occupied housing unit: A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the usual place of residence of the
person or group of people living in it at the time of enumeration, or if the occupants are only temporarily
absent; that is, away on vacation or a business trip. The occupants may be a single family, one person
living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who
share living quarters.
Overcrowded units: Overcrowded units are occupied housing units that have more than 1 person per
room.
Per capita income: Average obtained by dividing aggregate income by total population of an area.
Population estimate (Population Estimates Program): The Census Bureau's Population Estimates
Program (PEP) produces July 1 estimates for years after the last published decennial census (2000), as
well as for past decades. Existing data series such as births, deaths, Federal tax returns, Medicare
enrollment, and immigration, are used to update the decennial census base counts. POP estimates are
used in Federal funding allocations, in setting the levels of national surveys, and in monitoring recent
demographic changes.
                                                                                                     Page C-10
                                                                        City of Crescent City Housing Element
Population projections: Estimates of the population for future dates. They illustrate plausible courses of
future population change based on assumptions about future births, deaths, international migration, and
domestic migration. Projections are based on an estimated population consistent with the most recent
decennial census as enumerated. While projections and estimates may appear similar, there are some
distinct differences between the two measures. Estimates usually are for the past, while projections
typically are for future dates. Estimates generally use existing data, while projections must assume what
demographic trends will be in the future.
Poverty: Following the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Directive 14, the Census Bureau uses
a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to detect who is poor. If the
total income for a family or unrelated individual falls below the relevant poverty threshold, then the
family or unrelated individual is classified as being "below the poverty level."
Poverty rate: The percentage of people (or families) who are below poverty.
Race: The race of individuals was identified by a question that asked for self-identification of the person’s
race. Respondents were asked to select their race from a “flashcard” listing racial groups.
Severely Overcrowded: Are occupied housing units with 1.51 or more persons per room.
Single family detached homes: This is a one-unit residential structure detached from any other house
(i.e., with open space on all four sides). A house is considered detached even if it has an adjoining shed
or garage.
Single family attached housing: This is a one-unit residential structure that has one or more walls
extending from ground to roof separating it from adjoining structures. This category includes row houses,
townhouses, and houses attached to non-residential structures.
Tenure: Refers to the distinction between owner-occupied and renter-occupied housing units. A housing
unit is “owned” if the owner or co-owner lives in the unit, even if it is mortgaged or not fully paid for. A
cooperative or condominium unit is “owned only if the owner or co-owner lives in it. All other occupied
units are classified as “rented, “ including units rented for cash rent and those occupied without payment
of cash rent.
Transitional Housing (per Health and Safety Code 50675.2(h)): buildings configured as rental housing
developments, but operated under program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and
recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point
in time, which shall be no less than six months.
Two-family buildings: These dwellings may also be referred to as single family attached because a duplex
with a shared wall would qualify in both categories. Other two family buildings would include older single
family homes that have been converted into two separate living spaces or “flats” that do not share walls,
but a floor/ceiling.
Units in structure: A structure is a separate building that either has open spaces on all sides or is separated
from other structures by dividing walls that extend from ground to roof. In determining the number of
units in a structure, all housing units, both occupied and vacant, are counted.

Unemployed: All civilians 16 years old and over are classified as unemployed if they (1) were neither "at
work" nor "with a job but not at work" during the reference week, and (2) were actively looking for work
during the last 4 weeks, and (3) were available to accept a job. Also included as unemployed are civilians
who did not work at all during the reference week, were waiting to be called back to a job from which
they had been laid off, and were available for work except for temporary illness.
Unemployment Rate: The proportion of the civilian labor force that is unemployed, expressed as a
percent.
Vacant Housing Unit: A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of enumeration, unless
its occupants are only temporarily absent. Units temporarily occupied at the time of enumeration entirely
by people who have a usual residence elsewhere are also classified as vacant. New units not yet occupied
are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and
doors are installed and final usable floors are in place. Vacant units are excluded from the housing
inventory if they are open to the elements; that is, the roof, walls, windows, and/or doors no longer
protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are
condemned or they are to be demolished.
Vacancy Rate: The housing vacancy rate is the proportion of the housing inventory that is available ‘‘for
sale’’ or ‘‘for rent.’’ It is computed by dividing the number of available units by the sum of occupied units
and available units, and then multiplying by 100.
Year Structure (housing unit) Built: Year structure built refers to when the building was first constructed,
not when it was remodeled, added to, or converted. For housing units under construction that met the
housing unit definition—that is, all exterior windows, doors, and final usable floors were in place—the
category ‘‘1999 or 2000’’ was used for tabulations. For mobile homes, houseboats, recreational vehicles,
etc, the manufacturer’s model year was assumed to be the year built. The data relate to the number of
units built during the specified periods that were still in existence at the time of enumeration.
White: In decennial census data, the White category includes persons having origins in any of the original
peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as ‘‘White’’
or report entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish. The "alone"
designation, as used with decennial census data, indicates that the person reported only one race.
