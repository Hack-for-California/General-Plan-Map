TOC-2                                                    Sebastopol General Plan
                                        1. I NTRODUCTION
Overview
The City of Sebastopol General Plan (General Plan) identifies the community’s vision for the
future and provides a framework that will guide decisions on growth, development, and
conservation of open space and resources in a manner that is consistent with the quality of life
desired by the city's residents and businesses. The General Plan supersedes and replaces the 1994
General Plan. The General Plan carries forward some of the major goal and policy framework of
the 1994 General Plan, but has been substantially updated to address current local conditions,
community priorities, and goals, and has been reorganized to make the document more user-
friendly and straightforward.
Scope and Content of the General Plan
State law requires the City to adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical
development of its planning area. The general plan must include land use, circulation, housing,
conservation, open space, noise, and safety elements, as specified in Government Code Section
65302, to the extent that the issues identified by State law exist in the City’s planning area.
Additional elements that relate to the physical development of the city may also be addressed in
the general plan. The degree of specificity and level of detail of the discussion of each general
plan element need only reflect local conditions and circumstances. The General Plan has been
prepared consistent with the requirements of State law and addresses the relevant items
addressed in Government Code Section 65300 et seq.
The General Plan includes the following elements:
    •   Land Use                                              Two important documents support
    •   Circulation                                               the General Plan. The Existing
                                                                Conditions Report and the General
    •   Community Services and Facilities                    Plan Environmental Impact Report (EIR)
    •   Conservation and Open Space                              are both intended to be used in
                                                               conjunction with this General Plan
    •   Noise
                                                               and to serve as companions to this
    •   Community Design                                                 policy document.
    •   Safety
    •   Economic Vitality
    •   Community Health and Wellness
    •   Housing Element (Adopted March 2015)
The General Plan also includes an Implementation chapter that prioritizes the timing for each
separate action that is identified in the various elements.

 1. I NTRODUCTION
                                    Guiding Principles
    Through the General Plan Update process, the following set of distinct guiding
    principles was identified:
        • Protect Sebastopol's small-town charm, unique character, and strong sense
           of community
        • Sustain and encourage a vibrant Downtown core and strong community
           identity through supporting and enhancing local businesses and creating
           higher density housing opportunities in the Downtown
        • Improve traffic conditions in Downtown through reduced congestion,
           reduced speeds, and expanded facilities for bicycles and pedestrians
        • Emphasize sustainability and environmental stewardship in future planning
           decisions
        •  Provide opportunities for extensive community input and participation in the
           General Plan Update process
Public Participation
The General Plan was developed with extensive opportunities for participation from residents,
businesses, local agencies, and other stakeholders. In 2012-13 Sonoma State University (SSU)
Environmental Studies and Planning students used Sebastopol for their annual planning class
exercise, preparing an existing conditions report and a policy report in collaboration with the
City. Surveys and numerous community meetings were conducted in collaboration with the City.
Following the efforts completed by the SSU students, a professional planning consulting firm was
retained by the City to complete a comprehensive update to the General Plan.
Another series of public Visioning Workshops and a Housing Workshop were held in April and
May 2014 in order to identify the community’s vision for the future, and to develop principles to
guide the General Plan Update. Additionally, City staff and the consultant team developed an
online survey to gather additional information from the public related to the General Plan
Update. The online survey was available through the General Plan Update website, and was
developed to pose similar questions to those posed at the visioning workshops, and to gather
additional details regarding City service levels, residential homeownership, employment
locations, and economic development priorities.
The City Council appointed a 16-member General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC), which
consisted of members from the Planning Commission, local business owners, residents, and the
community at-large. The GPAC collaborated with City staff and the General Plan Update
consultant team throughout the development of the General Plan. The GPAC met 12 times
between July 2014 and December 2015, to identify key issues and challenges that Sebastopol faces
over the next 20-30 years, and to develop the comprehensive set of goals, policies, and actions
contained in the General Plan. Each GPAC meeting was open to the public, and numerous
members of the public and other local interested agencies attended the meetings and provided
detailed input to the GPAC.

The City Council and Planning Commission held approximately six public workshops and
hearings to consider the goals and policies of the 1994 General Plan, review input from the
Visioning Workshops, receive information relevant to the specific topics addressed at the GPAC
meetings, and provide specific direction and guidance to staff and the consultant team regarding
how goals should be achieved and how to address current issues.
Addressing Public Input
The following table summarizes the goals that support the Guiding Principles identified during
the Visioning process and addressed as part of the GPAC’s direction regarding the update to the
General Plan. Each chapter of the General Plan referenced in the following table includes policies
and actions to implement and realize each stated goal.

 1. I NTRODUCTION
Applying the General Plan
The General Plan is intended for use by a broad range of persons, including:
    •   The City Council, Planning Commission, and Design Review Board in decision-making
        activities;
    •   City staff in developing and implementing programs and projects;
    •   The development community in preparing development proposals; and
    •   Residents and businesses interested in the future development of Sebastopol and
        understanding the community’s vision, goals, and priorities.
The General Plan applies to lands in the incorporated area of the City, to the extent allowed by
Federal and State law. Under State law, many actions, such as development projects, specific
plans, master plans, community plans, zoning, subdivisions, public agency projects, and other
decisions must be consistent with the General Plan. State law requires that the City's ordinances
regulating land use be consistent with the General Plan. The Zoning Ordinance, individual
project proposals, and other related plans and ordinances must be consistent with the goals and
policies in the General Plan.
Interpreting the General Plan
In reading the General Plan, one should infer that the goals, policies, and actions are limited to
the extent that it is financially feasible and appropriate for the City to carry them out and to the
extent legally permitted by Federal and State law. For example, policies and actions which
indicate that the City will “provide,” “support,” “ensure,” or otherwise require or carry them out
do not indicate an irreversible commitment of City funds or staff resources to those activities, but
rather, that the City will support them when the City deems that it is financially feasible and
appropriate to do so. In some cases, the City will carry out various policies and actions by
requiring development, infrastructure, and other projects to be consistent with the policies and
actions of the General Plan. In other cases, the City may include General Plan items in the Capital
Improvement Program, annual budget, or other implementation mechanisms, as the City deems
appropriate.
Organization of the General Plan Elements
Each element (i.e., chapter) of the General Plan is organized into a set of goals, policies, and
actions. Each goal is supported by a particular set of policies and actions to implement and
achieve that goal. Chapter 12 of the General Plan (Implementation) includes a complete summary
of each action that is identified in the various elements, accompanied by the City department
responsible for implementing the action and the timing of implementation.
Amending the General Plan
Since goals and policies in the General Plan reflect a range of competing interests, the decision-
makers have broad discretion in interpreting the General Plan and its purposes, and are allowed
to weigh and balance the various goals and policies when applying them. Recognizing the need
for the General Plan to remain current and reflective of local issues and policies, State law allows
the City to periodically amend the General Plan to ensure that it is consistent with the conditions,
values, expectations, and needs of its residents, businesses, and other stakeholders. The General
Plan may be amended in accordance with State law and only by action of the City Council, upon
recommendation by the Planning Commission, or by voter-approved initiative. While specific

findings may be applied on a project-by-project basis, at a minimum the following standard findings
shall be made for each proposed General Plan amendment:
     1. The amendment is deemed to be in the public interest;
     2. The amendment is consistent and/or compatible with the rest of the General Plan;
     3. The potential impacts of the amendment have been assessed and have been determined not
        to be detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare; and
     4. The amendment has been processed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
        California Government Code and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
City-initiated amendments, as well as amendments requested by other public agencies, are
subject to the same basic process described above to ensure consistency and compatibility with
the General Plan. This includes appropriate environmental review, public notice, and public
hearings, leading to an official action by the City Council.
Annual Reporting
Given the long-term nature of the General Plan, it is critical to periodically evaluate its
effectiveness and to document the implementation status of the various policies and actions that
it contains. State law provides direction on how cities and counties can maintain the General Plan
as a useful policy guide. State law also requires the City to annually report "the status of the plan
and progress in its implementation" (California Government Code Section 65400(b)) to the City
Council.
                                                Key Terms
       Goal:         A description of the general desired result that the community seeks to create.
       Policy:       A specific statement that guides decision-making as the City works to achieve the
                     various goals and objectives. Once adopted, policies represent statements of City
                     regulations.
       Action:       An implementation measure, procedure, technique, or specific program to be
                     undertaken by the City to help achieve a specified goal or implement an adopted
                     policy. The City must take additional steps to implement each action in the
                     General Plan. An action is something that can and will be completed.

Overview
The Land Use Element provides for a development and resource conservation pattern that
preserves and protects Sebastopol’s unique character, small-town feel, family-oriented
neighborhoods, and distinctive downtown, while promoting opportunities for economic
development, high-quality local job growth, and robust natural resources protection. The Land
Use Map (Figure 2.1) depicts the City’s vision for how open space, commercial, industrial,
agricultural, residential, and other uses will occur in the city limits and the surrounding areas.
State law requires the Land Use Element to address:
        •  Proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the land for
           housing, business, industry, open space, including agriculture, natural resources,
           recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public buildings and grounds,
           solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other categories of public and private uses
           of land;
        •  Population density and building intensity;
        •  Areas subject to flooding; and
        •  Areas subject to flooding are addressed in the Safety Element.
The Land Use Map (Figure 2.1) identifies the location of land uses by land use designation for
lands in the city limits as well as the overall Planning Area. The Planning Area consists of the
City, Sphere of Influence (SOI), and Urban Growth Boundary (UGB). Uses allowed in each
designation are described below under Policy LU 1-4.

 2. L AND U SE
The Land Use Element demonstrates the City’s commitment to protecting and enhancing
Sebastopol’s unique character and small-town feel, while providing for economic development
opportunities. The Land Use Element includes provisions aimed at providing a range of housing
types that promote a safe and family-oriented living environment. Residential and commercial
growth is focused within the city limits, with higher density uses focused within the Central Core.
The vast majority of lands outside of the city limits are intended to remain as agricultural and
open space lands in order to protect natural resources, including watersheds, groundwater
recharge areas, riparian habitat, the Laguna de Santa Rosa, Atascadero Creek, and local
agricultural resources.
Background information regarding land use is presented in Chapter 1.1 of the General Plan
Update Existing Conditions Report.
Planning Boundaries
                                                              There are three key boundary lines

                                                              considered for development after
                                                              annexation.
Until that time, the area within the SOI is under the jurisdiction of Sonoma County and its General
Plan; however, City policies will influence the County’s considerations of development proposals
for lands within the SOI.
Urban Growth Boundary: The UGB is a line beyond which development will not be allowed,
with limited exceptions. In 2016, the City Council adopted Ordinance 1090 establishing the UGB,
which reaffirmed, with minor modifications, the UGB that was established by Measure O,
approved by Sebastopol voters in November 1996. Ordinance 1090 defines the UGB and
establishes standards for the administration of the UGB, which are included as policies under
Goal LU 2. The UGB is shown on Figure 2.1.

Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal LU 1:           Maintain Sebastopol as a Unique, Charming, and
                     Environmentally Sensitive Small Town that Provides
                     Residents, Businesses, and Visitors with Opportunities to
                     Enjoy a High Quality of Life
Policy LU 1-1: Through appropriate land use practices, maintain a supply of developable mixed-
use, commercial, industrial, and residential lands sufficient to meet desired growth and economic
needs over the planning period.
Policy LU 1-2: Avoid urban sprawl by concentrating development within the City limits; favor
infill development over annexation.
Policy LU 1-3: Require new development to occur in a logical and orderly manner, focusing
growth on infill locations and areas designated for urbanization on the Land Use Map (see Figure
2.1), and be subject to the ability to provide urban services, including paying for any needed
extension of services.
Policy LU 1-4: Assign the following range of land use designations throughout the City and to
parcels within the UGB, as shown in the Land Use Map (Figure 2.1):
         Very Low Density Single Family Residential: Designates areas suitable for single family
         dwellings at a density up to one unit per acre. Smaller existing parcels within this designation would
         not be precluded from developing one housing unit.
         Low Density Single Family Residential: Designates areas suitable for single family dwellings at
         a density of 1.1 to 2.5 units per acre. Smaller existing parcels within this designation would not be
         precluded from developing one housing unit.
         Medium Density Residential: Designates areas suitable for residential dwellings at a density of
         2.6 to 12.0 units per acre. Smaller existing parcels within this designation would not be precluded
         from developing one housing unit.
         High Density Residential: Designates areas suitable for multifamily dwellings at a density of 12.1
         to 25 units per acre. This designation is suitable for duplexes, apartments, townhouses, and other
         attached dwelling units.
         Commercial/Office: This designation provides areas for commercial and office uses with off-street
         parking and/or clusters of street-front stores. This designation allows primarily local-serving retail
         establishments, specialty shops, banks, professional offices, motels, professional, administrative,
         medical, dental, and business offices, bed and breakfast users, and business and personal services,
         along with ancillary commercial and service uses. This designation is typically assigned to parcels,
         located on a major arterial street, that can provide sufficient land for commercial establishments that
         do not benefit from high-volume pedestrian concentrations found Downtown. The following types of
         retail uses are discouraged in this land use designation: factory outlets; large regional-serving
         shopping centers; and other similar retail uses generating high traffic volumes. Maximum floor area
         ratio (FAR) shall not exceed 1.5. Residential uses are permitted as a secondary use to the primary
         commercial uses permitted in this land use designation if generally located above the ground floor at
         the High Density Residential density of 12.1 to 25 units per acre. The residential space will not be
         counted in calculating the FAR for a development.

Policy LU 1-5: The Land Use Map shall be amended from time to time to ensure that there is an
adequate supply of commercial, industrial, public facility, parks, residential, and other lands to
serve the City’s needs.
Policy LU 1-6: Where appropriate, encourage clustered development and the clustering of
housing so that larger areas of open space may be permanently preserved. Clustered development
may provide flexibility in site design and layout to allow for smaller lot sizes, but shall not allow a
project to exceed the gross density ranges established under Policy LU 1-4.
Policy LU 1-7:     Encourage new development to be contiguous to existing development, whenever
possible.
Policy LU 1-8:     Do not allow development in areas not served by municipal utilities.
Policy LU 1-9: Work collaboratively with Sonoma County and other public agencies in the region
to preserve and maintain greenbelts and areas of open space surrounding the City’s SOI.
Policy LU 1-10: Encourage development and planning that is consistent with this General Plan
and furthers the implementation of the Sebastopol Priority Development Area (see Figure 2.3).
Actions in Support of Goal LU 1
Action LU 1a: Review and update the Zoning Code to: 1) implement the policies and actions of this
General Plan, including implementation of land use designations and Figure 2.1, Land Use Map, 2) clarify
and streamline Zoning Code implementation, and 3) revise parking requirements, setbacks, and lot
coverage standards within the Central Core to facilitate and allow higher residential development densities,
as established by Policy LU 1-4.
Action LU 1b: Direct new development to locations within the city limits through prioritizing processing
of applications within the City limits and encouraging developers interested in Sebastopol to focus on in-
fill development.
Action LU 1c: Revise the Zoning Code to establish a minimum height of two stories for new major
development projects within the Central Core. This requirement shall not apply to rehabilitation or
improvements to existing uses.
Action LU 1d: Review and update the Zoning Code to add definitions and descriptions for the following:
         •   Update definition of what constitutes a ‘permanent dwelling’;
         •   Clarify whether hotels are treated as residential or commercial uses;
         •   Define ‘retail use’;
         •   Revise definition of restaurant, and consider separate definitions for ice cream shops and coffee
             shops;
         •   Define ‘secondary use’;
         •   Review definitions for child care uses to ensure consistency with State law;
         •   Generally review all definitions in relation to consistency with list of allowed uses and to
             provide increased clarity (e.g., all uses identified in the Zoning Code shall be defined in the
             Zoning Code).

 2. L AND U SE
                                     Sebastopol Priority Development Area
  A Priority Development Area (PDA) is a designation given to a place identified by a local Bay Area community
  and the regional Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and Metropolitan Transportation Commission
  (MTC) as an area for investment, new homes, job growth, and transit connections. PDAs are the foundation for
  sustainable regional growth and are documented in Plan Bay Area, which provides the regional vision for long-
  term growth through 2040. To become a PDA, an area must be: 1) within an existing community, 2) within
  walking distance of frequent transit service, 3) designated for more housing in a locally adopted plan or identified
  by a local government for future planning and potential growth, and 4) nominated through a resolution adopted
  by the local City Council or Board of Supervisors.
  The “Sebastopol Priority Development Area” has been proposed for PDA designation. The PDA designation
  provides opportunities for the City to receive funding and planning support through regional grants, funding
  programs, and placemaking and transportation initiatives. The General Plan establishes goals, policies, and actions
  that support the PDA designation and provide for reinvestment, transit connections, housing growth, and
  employment growth. The General Plan establishes a strong framework for economic development and vitality in
  the City’s business districts and would increase job growth throughout the PDA. The General Plan provides for
  increased densities throughout the Downtown and along the primary proposed Sebastopol PDA corridors,
  provides for transit connections. The General Plan supports increased transit services and regional transit
  connections. See the policies and actions provided in support of the Goals LU 1, LU 6, LU 8, LU 9, CIR 1, CIR
  2, CIR 3, CIR 4, CIR 5, EV 1, EV 3, EV 4, and EV 5.

         •  Develop standards that guide allowed uses in the Light Industrial area located west of Morris
            Street, between Bodega Avenue and Laguna Park Way;
         •  Consider defined standards and an administrative approval process for small wine tasting
            establishments;
         •  Modify the Mobile Home Park zoning overlay district to include provisions that would prohibit
            the conversion of mobile home parks to high density residential uses;
         •  Review and update standards and provisions for community gardens;
         •  Provide authority to require deed restrictions regarding accessory buildings regarding
            potential use as a dwelling;
         •  Review home occupation regulations regarding the number of clients allowed on the premises,
            and consider establishing provisions to allow for small classes to occur as part of a home
            occupation use;
         •  Establish Use Permit requirements and standards for smoke shops;
         •  Update gas station and car wash standards;
         •  Provide standards for mobile food trucks;
         •  Establish appropriate standards and regulations for medical and, if made legal, non-medical
            cannabis dispensaries and related operations and activities;
         •  Review and update Temporary Use regulations;

         acres may be brought within the UGB for this purpose during the term of this initiative.
         Such amendment may be adopted only if the City Council makes all of the following
         findings in an affirmative manner:
             1. That the land to be included within the UGB is not designated as Land Intensive
                 Agriculture, Land Extensive Agriculture, Diverse Agriculture, Community

               defined by the General Plan; and
           5. That the proposed development will provide safe access for pedestrians, bicyclists
               and vehicles to local schools, parks, and the downtown; and
           6. That there is no existing vacant or underdeveloped residentially designated land
               within the UGB to accommodate the proposed development and it is not reasonably
               feasible to accommodate the proposed development by redesignating lands within
               the UGB for low- and very-low income housing; and
           7. That the proposed development is necessary to comply with state law requirements
               for provision of low- and very-low income housing and the area of land within the
               proposed development will not exceed the minimum necessary to comply with state
               law; and
           8. That substantial evidence demonstrates that the proposed development will not
               cause the Levels of Service specified in the Land Use Element or the Circulation
               Element of the City of Sebastopol General Plan to be exceeded with respect to water,
               wastewater, parks, fire services, police services, storm drainage, schools, and traffic;

       any recommendations by the Planning Commission, it makes both of the following
       findings:
           1. That the application of any aspect of UGB policies would constitute an
               unconstitutional taking of a landowner’s property, and
           2. That the amendment and associated land use designation will allow additional land
               uses only to the minimum extent necessary to avoid said unconstitutional taking of
               the landowner’s property.
   d. Following consideration of any recommendations by the Planning Commission, the City
       Council may amend the UGB and allow annexation in the following additional
       circumstances:
           1. For open space or lands used for agriculture, provided the land is restricted in
               perpetuity by a permanent covenant maintaining the open space or agricultural use,
               as may be applicable, and is consistent with the purposes set forth in Government
               Code section 65560 as of January 1, 2016, and is not in conflict with any provision of
               the Sebastopol General Plan; and

Actions in Support of Goal LU 2
Action LU 2a: Reserve a specific amount of wastewater capacity and potable water supply to be used for
existing development outside the city limits, particularly older subdivisions in the SOI which may require
connection to the City's wastewater and/or water system when septic system or water supply delivery
failures occur.
Action LU 2b: Limit the amount of land designated for urban uses to those areas that can be reasonably
predicted to be developed over the 20-year life of the General Plan. Areas not projected for urban
development within the life of the General Plan will be kept outside the UGB.

                                           discourage densification and intensification in areas in the
                                           vicinity of Sebastopol that would exceed City and local
resources, including transportation, water supply, sewer, groundwater recharge, and public
services.
Actions in Support of Goal LU 3
Action LU 3a: Maintain Level of Service (LOS) standards and guidelines for City services.
          •    Water Flow: The standard for water volume and flow is established by Title 24 of the California

             General Plan growth and to address the housing needs of economic segments of the community
             as identified in the Housing Element;
         •   When residential development activity is lower than the maximum established, any unused
             residential allocations under the maximum, or cap, will carry over to be used in future years,
             but not longer than two years;
         •   Limit total residential allocations to 750 residential units through 2035.
         •   Residential units approved within the Central Core shall be exempt from the annual allocation
             cap, but shall count towards the total allowed residential unit allocation;
         •   Update the findings regarding utility capacity to reflect current conditions;
         •   Simplify the allocation procedures; and
         •   Include provisions for very small houses and mixed use units to count as a reduced allocation
             (e.g., one mixed use unit or very small house unit is counted as 0.5 of an allocation).
Action LU 3c: Continue to monitor development in the City and SOI and the capacities of wastewater
treatment facilities, water distribution, roads, including road maintenance, public schools, and parks and
recreation facilities. City staff will provide annual reports on growth and changes in infrastructure capacity

Introduction
The Circulation Element provides the
framework for decisions concerning
the city’s multi-modal transportation
system, which includes roadway,
transit, bicycle, and pedestrian modes
of travel. The Circulation Element
provides for coordination with the
Sonoma       County       Transportation
Authority (SCTA), which serves as the
coordinating agency for transportation
funding for Sonoma County.
State law (California Government
Code Section 65302(b)) mandates that
the Circulation Element contain the
general location and extent of existing
and proposed major thoroughfares,
transportation      routes,    terminals,
military airports and ports, and other
public utilities and facilities, to the
extent these items exist in the planning area. As required by California Government Code Section
65302(b), the Circulation Element is correlated closely with the Land Use Element and is related
to the Housing, Conservation & Open Space, Noise, and Safety elements.
                                                 The Circulation Element reflects the City’s desire
                                                 to provide for complete street, bicycle, and
                                                 pedestrian facilities. This element considers
                                                 overall mobility, existing and desired land uses,
                                                 future street conditions, and mobility for non-
                                                 automobile users, including safe routes to schools.
                                                 This element establishes standards that guide
                                                 development of the transportation system
                                                 through goals, policies, and actions.
                                                 Background information regarding circulation
                                                 conditions in Sebastopol is presented in Chapter 2

 3. C IRCULATION
Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal CIR 1:          Provide a Transportation System that Promotes the Use
                     of Alternatives to the Single-Occupant Vehicle and
                     Facilitates the Efficient and Environmentally Responsible
                     Movement of People and Goods Within and Through the
                     City of Sebastopol
Policy CIR 1-1: Ensure that the City’s circulation network is maintained and improved over time
to support buildout of the General Plan in a manner that is consistent with the General Plan
Circulation Map. (Figure 3.1)
Policy CIR 1-2: Ensure that the City’s circulation network is a well-connected system of streets,
roads, sidewalks, multi-use trails, routes, and paths that effectively accommodates vehicular and
non-vehicular traffic in a manner that considers the context of surrounding land uses and the needs
of all roadway users.
Policy CIR 1-3: Regard the quality of life in Sebastopol, maintaining its special small-town
character, and providing a safety network of pedestrian and bicycle facilities as more important
than accommodating vehicle circulation.
Policy CIR 1-4: Promote public education and participation in transportation issues and decision-
making.
Policy CIR 1-5: When analyzing impacts to the circulation network created by new development
or roadway improvements, consider the needs of all users, including those with disabilities,
ensuring that pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit riders are considered preeminent to automobile
drivers.
Policy CIR 1-6: In evaluating circulation improvement needs, and in reviewing major
development proposals, consider impacts for all modes of transportation, including pedestrians,
bicyclists, transit, and vehicles.
Policy CIR 1-7: Projects that would substantially impact circulation conditions shall provide a
circulation impact report. This report will serve as a decision-making tool for the City, recognizing
that maintaining and improving the community’s social fabric and economic vitality includes
consideration of a project’s effects on pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit as well as the overall effect
of improvements associated with achieving appropriate Level of Service. LOS is not intended to be
used as the primary method to limit the size or density of a project, but rather to provide decision-
makers with a picture of the impacts associated with a project and allow decision-makers to
determine appropriate improvements to alleviate traffic impacts, to the extent appropriate and
feasible. The Planning Department will determine whether a circulation impact report is required
as part of the initial project application review process.
Circulation impact reports shall evaluate:
    -    Project effects on all modes of travel, including pedestrians, bicycles, transit, and vehicles;
    -    Improvements to accommodate the project with a focus on access and safety; and
    -    Impacts to vehicle travel, as determined by the Transportation Research Board’s Highway
         Capacity Manual. This analysis is intended to provide a menu of potential improvements
         but should not mitigate LOS by reducing project size, either by intensity or density.

                                                                                              3. C IRCULATION
Decision-makers shall evaluate projects based on the merits of a project, including contribution to
City character, and shall determine whether the City is best served by either implementing
improvements to address potential circulation impacts or, if improvements are determined to not
be appropriate or feasible, ensuring that a project provides a certain level of density and intensity,
as envisioned by Figure 2-2 (Land Use Map) to contribute to the social fabric of the community and
meet the City’s goals for economic development, economic vitality, and adequate housing.
Multimodal improvements, traffic calming improvements, or other system-wide transportation
network improvements may be required in lieu of requiring mitigations to the impacted road or
intersection in order to reduce the overall impacts to mobility. This approach could apply to the
use of traffic impact fees collected from developments as well.
Policy CIR 1-8: Establish multi-modal LOS objectives that would facilitate review of transit, bicycle
and pedestrian impacts, in addition to motor vehicles when these methods are more available and
useful.
Policy CIR 1-9: Through the development review process, CEQA process, and through long-range
infrastructure planning efforts, identify circulation network improvements and mitigation
measures necessary to maintain the City’s vehicle, transit, bicycle and pedestrian objectives.

Actions in Support of Goal CIR 1
Action CIR 1a: The City shall cooperate with other jurisdictions in Sonoma County to reduce
transportation congestion through the following actions:
          •   Staff should participate in the SCTA's technical advisory groups in pursuing funding
              opportunities.
          •   Encourage public input into SCTA’s congestion management planning process
          •   Participate in future updates to the Comprehensive Transportation Plan
          •   Coordinate with the County of Sonoma including the Parks & Recreation Department in
              efforts to expand regional bicycle and pedestrian networks to meet anticipated demands
Action CIR 1b: Coordinate with the County of Sonoma, Caltrans, and the City of Santa Rosa to
investigate, and as appropriate, determine feasible alternative routes, bypasses or “beltway connector”
routes, including both north-south and east-west routes, (e.g. Llano Road extension from SR 12 to
Occidental Road, or measures to divert some Hwy. 116 traffic at the southern terminus of Llano Road, or
diversion of some Hwy. 12 traffic to Occidental Road at Fulton Road, or improving Ragle Road) and
evaluate benefits provided by these routes. If appropriate, work collaboratively with the County of Sonoma
and Caltrans to determine the extent of roadway improvements needed to support these bypass routes, add
the project to the City’s Capital Improvement Plans (CIP) and/or seek County or other agencies plan
improvements, encourage proactive participation and coordination by the SCTA and support funding
through the SCTA or other sources, and as appropriate, update both City and County General Plan
Circulation Elements to include these routes.
Action CIR 1c: In collaboration with Caltrans, complete a comprehensive 2-way street analysis for SR
116 (South Main Street, Petaluma Avenue and McKinley Street) including traffic operational analysis,
concept designs, urban design/landscaping improvements, economic benefits and identification of potential
funding sources. As appropriate, work with SCTA, Caltrans, and other affected agencies to update policy
objectives based on the results of the analysis. As interim roadway improvements to the SR 116 corridor
are proposed, they shall be evaluated by City staff for compatibility with a future conversion to 2-way
streets, in order to foster informed decision making.
Action CIR 1d: Consider the following roadway improvements and projects included in the CIP to
maintain the safety and efficiency of the current circulation system, and to support buildout of the General
Plan.
          •   Healdsburg Avenue (SR 116)/Covert Lane intersection - install a traffic signal or roundabout

                                                                                              3. C IRCULATION
         •   Healdsburg Avenue (SR 116)/Murphy Avenue intersection - install a traffic signal or
             roundabout
         •   Gravenstein Highway South (SR 116)/Fircrest Avenue intersection - install a traffic signal or
             roundabout
         •   McKinley Street/Laguna Park Way/Petaluma Avenue intersection - install a beacon or
             appropriate pedestrian crossing improvements on the southern leg pedestrian crossing
         •   Willow Street - extend the street through the City parking lot from Main Street to Petaluma
             Avenue to enhance grid connectivity
         •   Abbott Avenue - change route to parallel Sebastopol Avenue, with a potential connection to
             Morris Street
Action CIR 1e: The Public Works Department shall maintain a systematic pavement management
program and identify and prioritize maintenance projects in the CIP.
         •   Street maintenance should include upkeep and regular cleaning of bicycle routes to remove
             debris and repair poor pavement conditions that discourage bicycle riding.
         •   The pavement management program data system should address signage and pavement quality
             throughout the city.
Action CIR 1f: As part of the development review process, the Planning Department, Public Works
Department, Police Department, and Fire Department shall review development projects to ensure that
developers:
         •   Construct transportation improvements along property frontages when appropriate
         •   Address the project’s proportional-share of impacts to the City’s circulation network through
             payment of traffic mitigation fees
         •   Provide for complete streets to the extent feasible; facilitating walking, biking, and transit
             modes
         •   Provide appropriate on-site pedestrian and bicycle features
         •   Fund traffic impact studies that identify on-site and off-site project effects and mitigation
             measures

Natural and historical resources form an important part of the City’s character, provide a
resource base for the City, and enhance the quality of life of the City’s residents.
Natural resources, including waterways, hillsides, and wildlife habitat, and historical resources
form an important part of the City's unique character. These assets provide a natural resource
base for agricultural industries, tourism and recreation, wildlife habitat, watershed storage, and
water quality protection, and contribute to the quality of life for the City’s residents.
State law requires the General Plan to include a
Conservation       Element,     which     addresses      the
conservation and utilization of natural resources,
including natural habitats, riparian corridors, special-
status species, and soils/hillsides. This element also
addresses the topics of energy conservation, air quality,
water quality, and the preservation of cultural and
historical resources.
State law also requires a General Plan to address open
space issues, including the recognition of open space as
a valuable resource for its own sake, the coordination of
local policies with state and regional policies, and the use
of open space to preserve environmentally sensitive
natural areas and habitat. State Government Code
Section 65560 defines open space lands as being
essentially unimproved and devoted to the preservation
of natural resources, managed production of resources,
outdoor recreation, or public health and safety.
The Sebastopol General Plan combines Conservation and
Open Space into a single element.
The Conservation and Open Space Element provides the framework to protect, maintain, and
enhance the City’s natural and open space resources. This element balances the overall vision of
the General Plan for preserving the City’s character and natural resources while providing for
economic development and balanced growth.
Background information on the topics addressed in this element is contained in the General Plan
Background Report.

                                                 6. N OISE
The Noise Element is a mandatory component of the General Plan. The overall purpose of the
Noise Element is to address major noise sources and to promote safe and comfortable noise levels
throughout Sebastopol. The Noise Element contains goals, policies, and actions that seek to
reduce community exposure to excessive noise levels through the establishment of noise level
standards for a variety of land uses.
Noise is typically defined as unwanted sound that interferes with an individual’s ability to
perform a task or enjoy an activity. From a planning perspective, noise control focuses on two
primary concerns: (1) preventing the introduction of new noise-producing uses in noise-sensitive
areas; and (2) preventing the encroachment of noise-sensitive uses into existing noise-producing
areas. Noise in Sebastopol is generated by a variety of sources, including, but not limited to:
vehicle traffic, including automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles; restaurants/bars; commercial
operations; and other businesses.
Background information regarding noise sources and noise conditions in Sebastopol is presented
in Chapter 7 of the General Plan Update Existing Conditions Report.
Goals, Policies, and Actions
Goal N 1:           Preserve an Appropriate Noise Environment and
                    Enhance the Quality of Existing and Future Land Uses by
                    Minimizing Exposure to Harmful and Excessive Noise
Policy N 1-1:      Ensure the noise compatibility of existing and future development when making
land use planning decisions.
Policy N 1-2:      Require development and infrastructure projects to be consistent with the Land
Use Compatibility for Community Noise Environments standards indicated in Table N-1 to ensure
acceptable noise levels for existing and future development.
Policy N 1-3:      Require new development to mitigate excessive noise through best practices,
including building location and orientation, building design features, placement of noise-
generating equipment away from sensitive receptors, shielding of noise-generating equipment,
placement of noise-tolerant features between noise sources and sensitive receptors, and use of
noise-reducing materials.
Policy N 1-4:      Require mixed-use projects to minimize noise exposure for indoor areas of nearby
residential areas through the use of noise attenuating building materials, engineering techniques,
and site design practices. Site design practices may include locating mechanical equipment, loading
bays, parking lots, driveways, and trash enclosures away from residential uses, and providing
noise-attenuating screening features on-site.
Policy N 1-5:      Periodically review and update, as necessary, Chapter 8.25 (Noise Control
Ordinance) of the Sebastopol Municipal Code in order to address issues such as excessive noise
from commercial, industrial, and other noise generating land uses, as well as vehicle noise, to the
extent allowed by State law.
Policy N 1-6:      Require acoustical studies for new developments, projects seeking use permits
related to activities that would increase noise levels, and transportation improvements that affect
noise-sensitive uses such as schools, hospitals, libraries, group care facilities, convalescent homes,
and residential areas.

    6. N OISE
   Policy N 1-7:       For projects that are required by the California Environmental Quality Act
   (CEQA) to analyze noise impacts, the following criteria shall be used to determine the significance
   of those impacts:
   Stationary and Non-Transportation Noise Sources	
             •   A significant impact will occur if the project results in an exceedance of the noise level
                 standards contained in this element, or the project will result in an increase in ambient
                 noise levels by more than 3 dB, whichever is greater. This does not apply to construction
                 activities which are conducted according to the best practices outlined in Action N-1f.
                 Compliance with the requirements outlined in Action N 1f shall be sufficient to reduce
                 construction-related noise impacts to a less than significant level.
   Transportation Noise Sources
             •   Where existing traffic noise levels are less than 60 dB Ldn at the outdoor activity areas
                 of noise-sensitive uses, a +5 dB Ldn increase in roadway noise levels will be considered
                 significant; and
             •   Where existing traffic noise levels range between 60 and 65 dB Ldn at the outdoor
                 activity areas of noise-sensitive uses, a +3 dB Ldn increase in roadway noise levels
                                           will be considered significant; and
       Acoustic Terminology
                                           • Where existing traffic noise levels are greater than 65 dB Ldn
   A-weighted decibels, abbreviated          at the outdoor activity areas of noise-sensitive uses, a + 1.5 dB
dBA, are an expression of the relative       Ldn increase in roadway noise levels will be considered
loudness of sounds in air as perceived       significant.
by the human ear. Sample dBA sound
     levels are shown in Table N-3.        Policy N 1-8:     Support noise-compatible land uses along
                                           existing and future roadways, including County, State, and
  Average noise exposure over a 24-        Federal routes.
  hour period is presented as a day-
   night average sound level, or Ldn.      Policy N 1-9:     Local truck traffic, including loading and
                                           unloading, shall be limited to specific routes, times, and speeds
                                           appropriate to each zoning district.
                                           Policy N 1-10: Work with Caltrans to ensure that adequate
   noise studies are prepared and locally-appropriate noise mitigation measures are implemented in
   State transportation projects that may result in increased noise levels in Sebastopol.
   Policy N 1-11: Ensure that existing development is protected, to the greatest extent feasible, from
   noise impacts due to construction on adjacent or nearby properties through implementation of best
   practices, as outlined in Action N 1f.
   Policy N 1-12: Work cooperatively with the Sonoma County Airport Land Use Commission to
   minimize noise impacts from airspace activities in Sebastopol and continue to monitor any future
   airport expansion plans that may result in increased noise levels in Sebastopol.
   Non-Transportation Noise
   Policy N 1-13: Control non-transportation related noise from site specific noise sources to the
   standards shown in Table N-2.
   6-2                                                                               Sebastopol General Plan

                                                                                                        6. N OISE
Policy N 1-14: Ensure that new development does not result in indoor noise levels exceeding 45
dBA Ldn for residential uses.
Policy N 1-15:      Require construction activities to comply with standard best practices (see Action
N 1f).
Policy N 1-16: Require new development to minimize vibration impacts to adjacent uses during
demolition and construction. For sensitive historic structures, a vibration limit of 0.08 in/sec PPV
(peak particle velocity) will be used to minimize the potential for cosmetic damage to the building.
A vibration limit of 0.30 in/sec PPV will be used to minimize the potential for cosmetic damage at
buildings of normal conventional construction.
Policy N 1-17: Temporary special events including, but not limited to, festivals, concerts,
carnivals, rodeos, and other similar activities may be allowed to exceed the noise standards
established in this General Plan and the standards established by Chapter 8.25 of the Sebastopol
Municipal Code through issuance of a temporary use permit (see Section 8.25.120 of the Sebastopol
Municipal Code).
Policy N 1-18: Ensure that an acceptable noise environment is maintained in residential areas
and areas with sensitive uses by ensuring that uses, operations, and fixed equipment maintain
compliance with City standards and by providing for the regulation of short-term increases in non-
transportation noise levels through the Municipal Code.
Policy N 1-19: Ensure that indoor noise levels at public and community buildings do not reach
harmful levels, generally considered to be 100dB or higher.
Actions in Support of Goal N 1
Action N 1a:      Update Chapter 8.25 and Title 17 of the Sebastopol Municipal Code to:
         •   Ensure that the noise standards are consistent with this element, including Tables N-1 and N-
             2;
         •   Require new residential, mixed-use with a residential component, and other noise-sensitive
             development to be designed to minimize noise exposure to noise sensitive uses through
             incorporation of site planning and architectural techniques;
         •   Include regulations to reduce exposure to exterior periodic nuisance noise, including trash
             collection, street sweeping, and other noise-generating activities.
         •   Establish maximum interior noise levels for activities held at public and community buildings.
Action N 1b: Continue to implement and enforce the requirements of Chapter 8.25 of the Sebastopol
Municipal Code in order to reduce nuisance noise from stationary sources near residential areas. During
future updates to Chapter 8.25 of the Municipal Code, the City should develop standards and procedures
to verify ongoing compliance with applicable noise standards by stationary sources, and develop more
rigorous enforcement procedures to respond to and correct verified noise violations.
Action N 1c: Review new development projects for compliance with the noise requirements established
in this element, including the standards established in Tables N-1 and N-2. Where necessary, require
mitigation measures to achieve the noise standards.
Action N 1d:      Require acoustical studies for all new discretionary projects, including those related to
development and transportation, which have the potential to generate noise impacts which exceed the
standards identified in this element. The studies shall include representative noise measurements, estimates
of existing and projected noise levels, and mitigation measures necessary to ensure compliance with this
element and relevant noise standards in the Sebastopol Municipal Code.
Sebastopol General Plan                                                                                  6-3

  6. N OISE
Action N 1e: Coordinate with Caltrans and Sonoma County, when necessary, to ensure that these
agencies obtain City concurrence prior to initiating any noise mitigation or other project affecting the noise
environment in Sebastopol.
Action N 1f:      Require construction projects that may generate excessive noise impacts to implement the
following types of standard best practices, as applicable, to reduce construction noise impacts to the extent
feasible:
          •  Noise-generating construction activities, including truck traffic coming to and from the
             construction site for any purpose, shall be limited as specified in the Noise Ordinance.
          •  All equipment driven by internal combustion engines shall be equipped with mufflers, which
             are in good condition and appropriate for the equipment.
          •  The construction contractor shall utilize “quiet” models of air compressors and other stationary
             noise sources where technology exists.
          •  At all times during project grading and construction, stationary noise-generating equipment
             shall be located as far as practicable from sensitive receptors and placed so that emitted noise is
             directed away from residences.
          •  Unnecessary idling of internal combustion engines shall be prohibited.
          •  Construction staging areas shall be established at locations that will create the greatest distance
             between the construction-related noise sources and noise-sensitive receptors nearest the project
             site during all project construction activities, to the extent feasible.
          •  Neighbors located adjacent to the construction site shall be notified of the construction schedule
             in writing.
          •  The construction contractor shall designate a “noise disturbance coordinator” who will be
             responsible for responding to any local complaints about construction noise. The disturbance
             coordinator shall be responsible for determining the cause of the noise complaint (e.g., starting
             too early, poor muffler, etc.) and instituting reasonable measures as warranted to correct the
             problem. A telephone number for the disturbance coordinator shall be conspicuously posted at
             the construction site.
Goal N 2:            Encourage a Vibrant Downtown while also Protecting
                     Existing or Planned Noise-Sensitive Uses from Annoying
                     or Harmful Levels of Noise
Policy N 2-1:       Through the use permit process, consider establishing a mechanism that provides
flexibility for Downtown businesses to occasionally exceed the Table N-1 exterior noise standards
on weekend nights (Friday and Saturday).
Policy N 2-2:       Consider the potential for traffic noise reduction when exploring opportunities to
improve traffic conditions in the Downtown. Circulation improvements that reduce vehicle speeds,
incorporate quiet pavement technology, and enhance the pedestrian environment should be
explored.
Policy N 2-3:       Ensure that maintenance activities in the Downtown area do not pose a noise
nuisance.
Policy N 2-4:       The City may elect to allow new noise-sensitive land uses on a case by case basis
in proximity to transportation and stationary sources in the Downtown that exceed the Land Use
Compatibility Standards in Table N-1. Noise mitigation, including an acoustical analysis, shall be
6-4                                                                                    Sebastopol General Plan

                                                                                                      6. N OISE
required to reduce interior space noise levels to 45 dB Ldn, or less, for sensitive receptors. Exterior
noise levels shall be reduced to the extent feasible using building orientation, construction and
design features; however ultimately, noise levels may exceed the noise standards identified in Table
N-1.
Actions in Support of Goal N 2
Action N 2a: Review and consider updates to the Municipal Code that would allow businesses within
the Downtown to apply for a special use permit that allows for periodic exceedances of the exterior noise
standards contained in Table N-1. The Municipal Code updates should consider the following:
     •  Establishment of a special use permit process and standards for periodic noise level exceedances;
     •  Limitations on the days of the week and hours of the day when elevated noise generating activities
        may be permissible;
     •  Requirements for verifiable self-monitoring and reporting of noise levels generated by special use
        permit holders;
     •  Procedures for processing and responding to noise complaints received against a special use permit
        holder; and
     •  Criteria for the revocation of a special use permit in the event that violations of the permissible
        noise levels occur.
Action N 2b: Review Chapter 8.25 of the Municipal Code to ensure that maintenance activities in the
Downtown area, such as street sweeping, sidewalk blowing, trash collection, etc., occur during times that
minimize noise impacts.

  Notes:
  a)    The residential standards apply to all properties that are zoned for residential use. The
        exterior noise level standard is to be applied at the property line of the receiving land use
        or at a designated outdoor activity area (at the discretion of the Planning Director) of the
        new development. For mixed-use projects, the exterior noise level standard may be waived
        (at the discretion of the Planning Director) if the project does not include a designated
        activity area and mitigation of property line noise for on-site uses is not practical. These
        noise level standards do not apply to residential units established in conjunction with
        industrial or commercial uses (e.g., caretaker dwellings). The City can impose standards
        that are more restrictive than specified above based upon determination of existing low
        ambient noise levels.
  b)     Each of the noise levels specified above shall be lowered by 5 dBA for tonal noises
         characterized by a whine, screech, or hum, noises consisting primarily of speech or
         music, or recurring impulsive noises. In no case shall mitigation be required to a level
         that is less than existing ambient noise levels, as determined through measurements
         conducted during the same operational period as the subject noise source.
  c)     In situations where the existing noise level exceeds the noise levels indicated in the
         above table, any new noise source must include mitigation that reduces the noise level of
         the noise source to the existing level plus 3 dB.

Community design supports Sebastopol’s community identity and sense of place, and is
important to achieve Sebastopol’s vision for its future.
Community design refers to the natural and built features that shape a city’s identity. In
Sebastopol, that character is varied and diverse, reflecting the City’s geography, history,
architecture, and natural setting. The purpose of this Element is to provide an overall policy
framework for the continued design improvement and evolution of the City. The Community
Design Element focuses on the ways in which Sebastopol’s buildings, streets, and open spaces
work together to define the City’s sense of place. The presence—or absence—of a sense of place
affects the lives of those who live and work here on many levels. A strong community identity
can build civic pride, make the City more economically competitive, help attain sustainability
goals, and ultimately improve the quality of life.
Community Design is not a State-required element of the General Plan. However, policies on this
topic are particularly important to achieve Sebastopol’s vision for its future. The Element
addresses six key topics:
    •   City Character and Identity
    •   A Vibrant Downtown
    •   Building Design and Site Planning
    •   Public Space
    •   Public Art and Community Gathering
    •   Historic and Cultural Resources

                      10. C OMMUNITY H EALTH AND W ELLNESS
Land use and planning decisions play a role in determining community members’ behavioral and
lifestyle choices that ultimately impact their physical health and mental wellbeing. The quality,
safety, location, and convenience of the pedestrian or bicycle environment, such as sidewalks,
bicycle lanes, signals, and crosswalks, can impact a resident’s decision to use them, which in turn
influences physical activity levels. Similarly, neighborhood parks and open space provide an
avenue for increased physical activity. Infrastructure and zoning to support local food processing
and distribution enables local food to be used in the community where it was grown. Access to
full-service grocery stores and farmers’ markets is also correlated with increased consumption of
fruits and vegetables. The physical presence and distribution of health care providers and
facilities influence how easily people can access health care. A strong local economy can provide
economic security for residents, which can greatly improve the quality of life and reduce
psychological stress. Successful local schools help develop responsible and self-sufficient young
men and women who can make greater contributions to their community.
Furthermore, urban design and maintenance can contribute to or decrease levels of crime and
perceptions of comfort and safety. Poor mental health is associated, in part, with a number of
factors related to planning, including long commute times, exposure to crime, lack of
transportation choice, driving related stress, lack of access to public spaces, lack of opportunities
for recreation and physical activity, and inadequate income. Emissions from fossil fuel
transportation sources are strongly linked with respiratory diseases, and various toxic
contaminants are known or suspected to cause asthma and cancer. Driving carries with it the risk
of accidents that are fatal and or cause injuries for drivers, cyclists, or pedestrians.
Addressing public health and wellness in the Sebastopol General Plan acknowledges the
profound effects of the built environment on travel choices, access to food, levels of physical
activity, and exposure to risk from accidents or pollution. Each of these has a health impact, and
the General Plan provides an opportunity to prevent further disease and injury and sustain
healthy lifestyle choices for Sebastopol residents. Through the creation of a healthy general plan,
Sebastopol can focus on opportunities to affect changes in the overall health and wellbeing of the
community.

The Community Services and Facilities Element provides support for the local school system.
This Community Health and Wellness Element addresses public health at a broad level in order
to support a healthy community through increasing access to necessary services, considering
public health in all policy decisions, and encouraging provision of healthy foods. This element
establishes a framework of goals, objectives, policies, and actions for developing conditions that
will improve the health and well-being of Sebastopol residents, and addresses community health
topics that have not been specifically addressed in other General Plan elements.
The Community Health and Wellness Element is an optional element of the General Plan.

Goal	G-2:	Remove	Government	Constraints	to	the	Production	of	Special	Needs	Housing		
Sebastopol	 supports	 the	 development	 of	 special	 needs	 housing.	 The	 City	 will	 take	 necessary	 steps	 to	
remove	 government	 constraints	 to	 the	 development	 of	 affordable	 housing	 serving	 special	 needs	
populations.	
Goal	G-3:	Remove	Government	Constraints	that	Affect	the	Amount	of	Land	Required	for	New	
Housing	
The	regulatory	process	is	one	of	the	principal	ways	in	which	a	small	city	can	reduce	housing	costs.	 The	
City	will	review	its	land	use	regulations	for	new	units	to	determine	if	it	is	possible	to	make	revisions	that	
will	result	in	reducing	land	required	for	new	developments,	consequently	reducing	land	costs	for	market	
rate	and	affordable	housing	developments.	
IMPLEMENTING	POLICIES	AND	 PROGRAMS	
Policy	G-1:	 The	City	will	modify	its	Zoning	Ordinance	to	provide	provisions	for	a	greater	range	of	housing	
types,	such	as	tiny	houses	to	encourage	opportunities	for	special	needs	and	affordable	housing.	
Policy	G-2:	 The	City	will	modify	the	Zoning	Ordinance	to	reduce	parking	requirements	in	senior	housing,	
single	room	occupancy	housing,	small	lot	housing	and	for	small	units.	
The	City	has	previously	reduced	parking	standards	for	the	housing	identified	above.		Residential	parking	
requirements	were	reduced	in	the	Downtown	by	20%.	 These	changes	were	added	to	the	Zoning	Ordinance	
in	May	2009.	 	 Further	 modifications	 to	 these	 standards	 will	 be	 implemented;	 in	 addition,	 the	 City	 will	
increase	allowances	for	compact	parking	and	tandem	parking.	
Policy	G-3:	 The	City	will	consider	modifying	its	Subdivision	Ordinance	Standards	to	reduce	street	widths,	
cul-de-sac,	and	driveway	requirements	and	widths	to	use	land	more	efficiently.	
Policy	G-4:	 The	 City	shall	 review	 its	 current	 development	impact	 fee	 program	to	 determine	 whether	
appropriate	levels	of	fees	are	charged	for	multifamily	units	and	second	units	based	on	demand	they	create	
for	public	facilities	and	infrastructure.	 The	City	will	also	consider	a	revised	fee	schedule	for	market	rate	
housing	based	on	unit	size	or	valuation.	
Policy	G-5:	 The	City	will	encourage	second	units.

                                      12. I MPLEMENTATION
For the General Plan to serve as an effective guide to achieving the City’s vision for its future, it
must be implemented and administered. The General Plan includes a number of "Action” items
that provide direction for how the City will implement the goals and policies within the body of
the General Plan. In general, actions are spread throughout each of the elements, appearing
immediately after the corresponding goals and policies.
Government Code Section 65400(a)(1) requires the City’s planning agency (Sebastopol Planning
Department) to make recommendations to the City Council that identify reasonable and practical
means for implementation of the General Plan. The Sebastopol Planning Department is also
required to provide an annual report to the City Council, the State Office of Planning and
Research (State Clearinghouse), and the State Department of Housing and Community
Development that includes the status of the General Plan, the City’s progress in the
implementation of the General Plan, and the City’s progress in meeting its allocation of regional
housing needs and removing governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and
development of housing. Table 12-1, General Plan Implementation, is intended to serve as a tool
for tracking implementation of the General Plan and preparing the annual report,
Table 12-1 identifies the general timing for the implementation of each action, the Department
responsible for the action’s implementation, and the status of the action.
For each of the actions listed below, the letters “A”, “B”, or “C”, refer to a relative priority for
implementation. More specifically:
    •   The letter A implies that the action will be implemented in the relatively short-term
        (most likely, 1 to 5 years).
    •   The letter B similarly implies a somewhat longer-term implementation, approximately 5
        to 10 years.
    •   The letter C indicates a longer-term implementation schedule, keeping in mind that the
        planning horizon for this document is the year 2035.
In other cases, the reader may notice the use of the term "ongoing" which refers to actions already
being undertaken by the City or those that are expected to continue on either a periodic or
perpetual basis. The party or parties that are primarily responsible for implementing each action,
whether a specific City department or, in some cases, an outside agency, are also indicated where
applicable.
The reader should keep some caveats in mind regarding the implementation schedule. One is
that many of these actions will require both staff and financial resources to implement, thus
making them difficult to definitively schedule, given the annual nature of the budgetary process
and changing priorities and resources over the years. A second caveat to keep in mind is that it is
often difficult to clearly state the duration of tasks; therefore, estimated starting dates (priority
levels) are presented for actions rather than completion dates. A third caveat is that, in some
instances, the selection of priority level (A, B, or C) reflects the level of complexity and the level
of effort required to implement an action rather than the importance of the Action itself.

           footage, etc.).

      • Housing impacts- assess the project’s impact on the need for both
           affordable and market-rate housing units, and whether the project will
           create additional units or eliminate existing units.
      • Neighborhood needs impacts- assess whether the project will increase or
           meet demand for services and how the surrounding neighborhood might
           benefit from the project.
      • Smart growth impacts- assess whether the project will make the
           surrounding neighborhood more livable and how the project will affect
           public transit and the pedestrian and bicycle network.

            determined based on the specifics of the species' needs.
       •    Project design measures, such as clustering of structures or locating
            project features to avoid known locations of special-status species and/or
            sensitive habitats.
       •    Provision of supplemental planting and maintenance of grasses, shrubs, and
            trees of similar quality and quantity to provide adequate vegetation cover
            to enhance water quality, minimize sedimentation and soil transport, and
            provide adequate shelter and food for wildlife.
       •    Protection for habitat and the known locations of special-status species
            through adequate buffering or other means to protect habitat functions.
       •    Provision of replacement habitat of like quantity and quality on- or off-site
            for special-status species. Preference shall be given to the preservation of
            habitat on-site or as close to the area of impact as feasible, so long as that
            habitat is of comparable quality.
       •    Enhancement of existing special-status species habitat values through
            restoration and replanting of native plant species.
       •    Provision of temporary or permanent buffers of adequate size (based on
            the specifics of the special-status species) to avoid nest abandonment by
            nesting migratory birds and raptors associated with construction and site
            development activities.
       •    Incorporation of the provisions or demonstration of compliance with
            applicable recovery plans for federally listed species.

 Action COS 10e: Develop a Historic Sebastopol program to identify and protect
 historic resources, encourage landowners to voluntarily preserve and rehabilitate
 historical structures, and to provide a coordinated approach to draw visitors and
 tourists to these areas. The program may include:
      •    Coordinated signage and identifying placards of historic areas, including
           downtown, specific buildings, and businesses.
      •    Maps available on-line, at the Chamber of Commerce, and key locations of
           the City that direct visitors and history aficionados to key historic and
           cultural resources in the City.

           buildings and sites. Consider the following incentives: Interest-free or
           reduced interest loans for rehabilitation work consistent with the original
           character of the building; tax incentives for the preservation of historic
           structures, including the use of Mills Act preservation contracts; reduced

           of the State Historic Building Code where applicable; a brochure that
