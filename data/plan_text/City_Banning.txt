COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
LAND USE ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Land Use Element represents the long-term vision of the community for development. Of all
the General Plan elements, it receives the greatest attention. The Land Use Element establishes
the types and quantities of land available within the City, its sphere of influence, and the
planning area. In conjunction with the Circulation Element, it guides the physical development
of the City. The Land Use Element defines land use designations, provides statistics regarding
vacant and developed lands within these designations, and discusses strategies for the future
development of the City. Finally, goals, policies and programs set parameters for decision-
makers, staff and the development community.
BACKGROUND
Government Code Section 65300 et. seq. is the guiding law for the Land Use Element. This
section of the law requires that all cities establish land use plans which assign residential,
commercial, industrial and other land use designations to properties within the jurisdiction. The
Land Use Element addresses the broadest issues in the General Plan, and is the most inter-related
with other General Plan elements.
This element is most closely associated with the Circulation Element, whose streets and trails
must be designed to accommodate the mix of land uses established in the General Plan. The
generation of traffic by the various land uses has a direct impact on the sizing and location of
roadways, as well as affecting related General Plan issues, such as noise and air quality.
Land use is also critical to the Economic Development Element, insofar as the potential for
commercial and industrial development is tied to the appropriate and sufficient supply of land for
these developments. This Land Use Element has been developed to support the Economic
Development Element by assigning a wide range of land uses in a logical manner throughout the
community.
Ultimately, the Land Use Element’s most important task is to maintain and improve the
residents’ quality of life. In developing the land use map and the goals, policies and programs
included in this Element, great care has been taken to assure compatibility between land uses, to
provide for future jobs and commercial opportunities, and to preserve open spaces for the
enjoyment of the entire community.
The City, its Sphere of Influence, and its Planning Area
In developing this General Plan, the City has analyzed issues and assigned land uses to lands
within its corporate boundary, its legal sphere of influence (sphere), and a planning area which is
outside the City and sphere, but which represents a logical extension of the City in the long term.
Lands within each of these categories are shown on the General Plan Study Area Boundaries
                                                                              Community Development
                                                                                                 III-1

                                                                                     City of Banning
                                                                                        General Plan
Map, Exhibit III-1. The City comprises a total of 14,823 acres, extending easterly from Highland
Springs Avenue to Fields Road, and from the San Bernardino County line on the north to Bobcat
Road on the south. The City’s Sphere of Influence includes eight separate areas on the north and
south ends of the City, totaling 5,436 acres. Lands included in the Planning Area occur adjacent
to the north, northwest and southern portions of the City, and total 3,296 acres.
The analysis leading to this Land Use Element included review of the City’s previous General
Plan, and the current General Plans of the County of Riverside and the Morongo Band of
Mission Indians (for lands outside the City’s limits). The influence of development in Beaumont
has also been considered. The General Plan Advisory Committee has considered existing land
use, visions for the future, and physical constraints, in developing the land use map and goals,
policies and programs included in this Element. The goals, policies and programs address both
general land use principles applicable throughout the planning area, and specific issues
associated with each land use type in the City.
                                                                              Community Development
                                                                                                III-2

guidelines, infrastructure plans and implementation measures to ensure the coordinated, orderly
development of a project. Government Code provides the standards and guidelines for the
content of Specific Plans. Specific Plans can also be combined with environmental
documentation, and result in a Specific Plan/Environmental Impact Report.
In Banning, Specific Plans have previously been considered a land use designation. With
adoption of this General Plan, this is no longer the case. Existing approved Specific Plans are
shown on the land use map with their approved land use plan, and the Specific Plan overlay.
With adoption of this General Plan, Specific Plans are required for projects which propose more
than one type of residential land use, commercial land uses and/or industrial land uses, or a
combination of these, within one project site. Specific Plans are also required when a project is
                                                                            Community Development

                                                                                   City of Banning
                                                                                      General Plan
proposed within an area previously undeveloped, where infrastructure master planning will be
required (water, sewer, flood control or roadways), and when the project will be phased. Once a
new Specific Plan is approved by the City Council, the Land Use Map will be amended to place
the Specific Plan overlay on that area.
Buildout Statistical Analysis
The General Plan area consists of 14,823.1 acres within the City limits, 5,436.2 acres within the
Sphere of Influence, and 3,295.7 acres within the planning area, for a total land area of 23,555
acres. This acreage has been assigned land use designations which result in the land use
statistical summary depicted in Table III-1, below.

Existing Residential Development
Existing residential development in the City can be characterized geographically. Traditionally,
larger lots, often including animal keeping, have been developed south of the Interstate
10/Railroad corridor. In recent years, the Sun Lakes Country Club project, located south of the
Interstate and east of Highland Springs Avenue, was developed to include a golf course and a
variety of lot sizes. Sun Lakes has developed at a greater density than had previously been
experienced on the south side of the City.
On the north side of the Interstate, single family residential land uses have developed northerly
of the Ramsey Street commercial corridor, in lot sizes ranging from 7,000 to 15,000 or more
square feet. Multi-family residential development has occurred, both in apartments and in mobile
                                                                                       Community Development
                                                                                                            III-10

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
home parks, along Wilson Street, immediately north of Ramsey Street, and between San
Gorgonio and Hathaway, north and south of the Interstate corridor.
The divergent neighborhoods in the City require special attention in the planning of the City’s
buildout. The development opportunities of the various areas of the City available for residential
units are discussed further below.
Existing Commercial Development
Commercial development in the City has focused entirely on the Ramsey Street corridor in the
past. Extensions of the corridor have occurred on the east side of Highland Springs Avenue, from
Sun Lakes Boulevard to Wilson Street, and in the Downtown area, between 4th Street and
Alessandro. The development of commercial land in the City has been smaller in scale, due
primarily to lot configuration (which is shallow in a north-south direction in many areas),
existing parking requirements, and multiple small lot ownerships, which have made consolidated
projects more difficult.
The Downtown area has developed with its own character, and represents a special development
type in the City. Many of the buildings in this area are the oldest commercial structures in the
City, and the scale of the area makes it conducive to pedestrian circulation. The development
potential of the Downtown area is discussed further below.
Existing Industrial Development
Industrial development in the City has historically been divided into airport-related uses, and
traditional industrial land uses. The airport-related land uses are primarily centered on the City’s
airport property, and on lands immediately adjacent to it. Industrial land uses, ranging from
storage to heavy manufacturing, occur on both sides of Lincoln Street, generally east of 16th
Street.
The City has attracted a number of manufacturing businesses, and has thus created a core of job-
generating land uses which continue to be an important part of the community. Future industrial
development opportunities are discussed further below.
Redevelopment Project Area
The City’s Redevelopment Project Area encompasses approximately 3,000 acres, and includes
all of the Ramsey Street corridor (please see Exhibit III-3, in the Economic Development
Element). Lands within the Redevelopment Project Area include all land use designations, and a
full range of existing land uses. The tax increment revenue received by the City, as well as bond
issuance and other funding mechanisms available to the Redevelopment Agency, enable the
financing of a number of projects to promote and enhance economic development and affordable
housing. The City has developed a number of programs in this regard, enumerated and described
in the Economic Development Element.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Land use in the future will consist of two distinct types of development. The City is currently
seeing the preparation of Specific Plans for large tracts of land, which will result in the
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                 III-11

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
development of master planned communities in the western half of the City. Areas in the south
eastern portion of the City will likely also develop through master planning. In the northern
portion of the City, where larger land holdings are fewer and the majority of development has
occurred, infill development (the development of existing lots or the assemblage of several
existing lots to create a project area) will continue.
The City has an opportunity for development and redevelopment of the Ramsey Street corridor
for mixed-use/commercial development in conjunction with programs available through the
Redevelopment Agency. Commercial and industrial development will also be focused on the
north side of Lincoln Street, adjacent to the Interstate 10 and railroad rights of way.
This General Plan also includes areas designated for open spaces, to ensure the preservation and
enhancement of hillsides, ridgelines, resource areas and park lands, particularly on the north and
south boundaries of the planning area.
The following pages provide goals, policies and programs on a categorical basis. First, City-wide
land use principles are listed. These are followed by individual analysis and goals, policies and

ranging from 7,000 to 15,000 square feet, particularly on the north side of the City. South of
Interstate 10, and with the exception of the Sun Lakes Specific Plan, lot sizes are considerably
larger, and often have included either animal keeping or farming activities.
                                                                             Community Development

Lands available for residential development generally fall into two types: infill development on
the north side of the City, and larger holdings, most of which will require coordinated
development efforts, on the south side of the City. Table-2, below, provides information on
vacant and developed residential lands in the City, the Sphere of Influence, and the planning
area.

Buildout Population
Based on the table above, the City’s buildout population is estimated to total 67,697, the Sphere
of Influence’s will total 7,622, and the planning area’s will total 4,9071. Total population at
buildout for the entire General Plan area is therefore estimated to be 80,226.
Neighborhood Identity
Through the development of this General Plan, the variety and diversity of neighborhoods in the
City has been clearly identified. These areas are bound together by tangible and intangible
similarities, including age of housing, lifestyle and geographic isolation. The City wishes to
support and enhance these neighborhoods, and preserve the quality of life they represent to their
residents.

  Assumes 2003 populations of 25,600, 784, and 430 for the City, Sphere of Influence and planning area,
respectively; and a household size of 2.6 persons. Does not include potential residential population in the Downtown
Commercial land use designation.
                                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                                       III-14

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
Master Planned Communities
Existing and proposed Specific Plans in the City, including the Sun Lakes project, the Loma
Linda property Specific Plan, the Deutsch Specific Plan, and the Sunset Crossroads Specific Plan
create their own internal neighborhood identities, and are likely to evolve as such as they are
developed. New projects which may be proposed through the Specific Plan process are likely to
also develop into neighborhoods with their own identities.
Development Opportunities for the Future
The General Plan process has resulted in a strong sense in the City of high quality, livable
community. The quality of life of all residents, and their ability to find the type of housing which
fits their lifestyle is important and must be preserved and enhanced. Four areas of focus are
described below.
Downtown Commercial
The area bounded by 8th Street to the west, Hargrave to the east, the Interstate 10 corridor to the
south, and Nicolet on the north has been designated as the Downtown Commercial area. This is
the traditional “center of town,” and included City Hall, small scale retail shops, the City’s movie
theatre, and older residential areas. In May 2004, the City conducted a design charette to develop
ideas on the character of this area. The resulting document provides the City with ideas on how
this area can be enhanced and redeveloped. Of particular interest in this process is the concept of
intensifying the land uses in this area. This may include live-work buildings, where residential
units are located either above or behind a retail studio or shop; downstairs commercial businesses
with upstairs apartments or condominiums; high density residential development within easy
walking distance of the commercial shops on Ramsey; and the enhancement of pedestrian and
non-motorized travel, including enhanced sidewalks, shaded sitting areas and community plazas.
Neighborhood Plans
As described above, there are a number of existing and distinct neighborhoods in the City. In
order to preserve and enhance their character, policy and programs have been developed below
which allow for the preparation of neighborhood plans which will establish design standards and
guidelines for each of these neighborhoods. In developing the General Plan, several of the City-
wide standards discussed, including the need for sidewalks and trails, the preservation of street
trees, and the character of local streetscapes, have been discussed. As these discussions
developed, it has become clear that each of these neighborhoods should have the opportunity to
develop a community-driven neighborhood plan which sets design parameters. These parameters
may be implemented by new development, or may require retrofitting by the neighborhood or
City, depending on whether the improvements are proposed in areas currently vacant or on
developed property.
A Livable City
Land subdivisions in the City have been traditional in their design. The City’s requirements have
provided for standard lots, 60 foot wide local streets, and minimal site design. As the remainder
of the City develops, it is important to the residents of this community that proposed subdivisions
provide high quality, creative design which will lead to a livable City. The Circulation Element
includes provisions for local street design which allows for creativity and variety, as well as
traffic calming tools. The Zoning Ordinance includes design standards and guidelines which

encourage clustered housing, interior trails and parks in residential tracts, and other design tools
which will encourage creative site design. The General Plan includes policies for the
preservation of street trees and the development of a trail system, and the provision of sidewalks
for safe pedestrian travel. All these concepts, when implemented, should lead the City to a more
livable, and ultimately higher quality of life.
Density Transfers to Preserve Hillsides
In order to assure that the City’s hillsides are preserved to the greatest extent possible, hillside
designations have been provided in the General Plan (please see land use designation definitions,
above) for the Ranch/Agriculture and Rural Residential designations. The intent of these
designations is to allow the development of flat areas within a property at a greater density, if
hillside areas are preserved. In the case of the Ranch/Agriculture designation, maximum density
can be increased from 1 unit per 10 acres to 1 unit per 5 acres with a density transfer. In the case
of the Rural Residential designation, the density transfer can result in an increase from 1 unit per
acre to 2 units per acre.

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LAND USES
The City’s commercial development has traditionally been focused on the Ramsey Street
corridor. In more recent times, commercial development has also occurred on the east side of
Highland Springs Avenue. The General Plan does not change this development pattern, but does
add to it, by providing additional commercial opportunities along the north side of Lincoln
Street, between Sunset Avenue and 8th Street. The General Plan provides four land use
designations appropriate for commercial development: General Commercial, Highway Serving
Commercial, Downtown Commercial and Professional Office.
The General Commercial and Highway Serving Commercial designations allow the broadest
range of commercial retail opportunities. The Highway Serving Commercial designation is
geared more toward the Interstate 10 traveler, with a focus on restaurants, tourist uses, and auto
service uses. The Professional Office designation is designed to provide space for professional
and social service land uses, and providing a convenient and accessible location for businesses
which do not generate sales tax. As discussed above, the Downtown Commercial designation is
the City’s specialty retail and mixed use area, and is envisioned to redevelop to encourage
tourism, pedestrian access and a sense of community.
Commercial lands designated in the General Plan have the potential to generate 6,757,082 square
feet of retail and office space in the City, as shown in Table III-3, below.

Industrial development in the City has traditionally occurred on the north side of Lincoln, and
surrounding the City’s airport. The area of industrially designated land has been reduced in this
General Plan, particularly west of 8th Street on the north side of Lincoln. There are four land use
categories which allow industrial development, including Business Park, Industrial, Industrial –
Mineral Resources, and Airport Industrial. The Business Park designation allows a mix of
commercial and light industrial land uses, and provides a transitional designation from
                                                                                     Community Development
                                                                                                         III-18

                                                                                          General Plan
commercial to industrial land uses. The Industrial designation allows the broadest range of users,
and preserves the existing industrial businesses in the City. The Industrial – Mineral Resources
designation is assigned to the existing Robertson sand and gravel facility, and is intended to
specifically regulate mining operations. The Airport Industrial category acknowledges the
importance of the City’s airport, and provides for land uses related to and compatible with that
facility.
Industrial development has been an important source of jobs in the City, and the City continues
to attract industrial land uses, primarily due to the limited industrial lands available in the Pass
region. As development pressures continue to intensify in the Inland Empire to the west of the
City, industrial development will continue to seek locations in Banning.
The industrial designations have the potential to generate 10,239,326 square feet of industrial
space at buildout of the General Plan.

PUBLIC FACILITIES LAND USES
Land uses for public facilities include such governmental functions as City offices and facilities
and fire stations, and the airport. Others include schools, the hospital, and libraries. The land use
plan identifies public facilities if they are currently owned by a public entity, or proposed for
dedication to a public entity in a Specific Plan. In the future, as additional facilities are acquired,
the General Plan land use map will be amended to reflect these acquisitions.

As the City grows, it is essential that the need for public facilities be identified and planned.
Many of these facilities are not under the control of the City (schools and fire stations, for
example). However, the maintenance of the City’s existing relationships with the school districts,
the County fire department and other agencies is critical in assuring that sufficient land is made
available for the future development of public facilities in the City, the Sphere of Influence and
the planning area.

OPEN SPACE LAND USES
The land use map includes four types of Open Space designations, which total 4,005.1 acres in
the City, 1,646.1 acres in the Sphere of Influence, and 924.1 acres in the planning area.
Altogether, this General Plan provides 6,575.3 acres of open space, including lands preserved for
natural resources, such as water and geological hazard; lands preserved for hillside preservation;
and lands preserved for recreation. Under the Open Space – Parks category, the lands include
City parks, both existing and proposed, and golf courses, also both existing and proposed.

As with the Public Facilities land use designations, lands designated under this category are
those owned by private or public entities for that purpose. As additional lands are secured for
Open Space, whether private or public, the General Plan land use map will require amendment to
reflect these acquisitions. The continued expansion of Open Space lands will continue to provide
the City’s residents and visitors with valuable enhancements to quality of life. Please also refer to
the Open Space and Conservation Element for policies and programs relating to these land uses.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Economic and Fiscal Element is to describe the economic foundations,
characteristics and trends of the City of Banning. The element explores the health of the local
economy and the relationship between City government and its responsibilities, such as
establishing and enforcing land use policies and regulating new development. The element is
also intended to examine the City’s potential economic opportunities and constraints, and set
forth a series of goals, policies, and programs that will help create a viable, well-balanced
economy.
BACKGROUND
The overall health of the City’s economy is a product of the complex interrelationships between
the City’s and region’s physical and economic environment. In this regard, the Economic and
Fiscal Element is related, to some degree, to all other General Plan elements. The issues
addressed in other General Plan elements are largely centered around the protection of human
life and property from environmental hazards, the provision of adequate public services and
facilities, and the enhancement of natural and cultural resources, all of which directly impact the
City’s ability to retain and attract businesses and residents, who support the local economy. The
Economic and Fiscal Element has the strongest relationship with the Land Use Element, which
determines the distribution of land uses by type, location, intensity, and extent of use, and
therefore impacts the City’s long-term economic prosperity.
This element has an especially strong and direct relationship with the Land Use Element.
Government Code Section 65030.2, which provides the statutory reference for this relationships,
states that “land use decisions shall be made with the full knowledge of their economic and fiscal
implications, giving consideration to short-term costs and benefits, and their relationship to long-
term environmental impacts as well as long-term costs and benefits.” This Element also
examines issues set forth in Government Code Sections 65863.6 and 66412.3, which requires
cities and counties to balance the available fiscal and environmental resources against local
housing and public service needs.
Banning as Part of the Pass
In formulating appropriate fiscal and economic development goals, policies and programs, it is
essential to understand the City’s role in the regional economy. Growth in the Pass, not only in
Banning, will continue to have a strong influence on the City’s economy. The Pass region has
experienced consistent population growth over the past decade. Total population in the region
has grown by approximately 27.3 percent, from 75,255 in 1990 to 103,551 in 2003. Assessed
valuation among incorporated cities in the region has also grown consistently since 1993, even
                                                                              Community Development
                                                                                                 III-25

                                                                                     City of Banning
                                                                                        General Plan
during periods when assessed valuation in Riverside County has decreased or remained the same.
In 2003, assessed valuation in Pass cities grew 11 percent, as compared with 10 percent in
Riverside County.
DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS
In order to understand the City’s future needs, it is important to first understand the City’s
demographic composition, and the changes that have occurred in that composition in the last
several years. The following section provides statistical data regarding the residents of Banning.
Unless otherwise indicated, estimates of data for year 2003 are for the entire planning area,
including City limits, SOI and all planning areas. For U.S. Census years 1980, 1990 and 2000,
data is only for Banning City limits and does not include SOI or planning area lands.
Population
Riverside County experienced rapid growth during the 1980s, like much of southern California.
During the economic recession of the early 1990s, population growth slowed somewhat.
However, it has continued to grow rapidly since then. U.S. Census data indicates that the County
population increased from 663,166 residents in 1980, to 1,170,413 residents in 1990, to
1,545,387 residents in 2000. The San Gorgonio Pass area has also experienced relatively rapid
growth. Based on data prepared for the City by Economics and Politics, Inc, the combined
population of the four incorporated Pass cities of Banning, Beaumont, Calimesa and Yucaipa,
and unincorporated areas of Cherry Valley and Cabazon was 75,255 residents in 1990. By 2000,
total population was 103,551, representing a 37.6 percent increase over ten years.
Population growth in the City of Banning was less than that of the Pass Region during this
period. Based on U.S. Census data, the City’s population grew from 20,574 residents in 1990 to
23,487 residents in 2000, an increase of approximately 14.2 percent. The City’s 2003 population
(City limits only) is estimated by the California Department of Finance at 25,600 residents. This
represents a 9.0 percent increase over the four-year period.
Sphere of Influence: Lands in the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) include portions of the San
Bernardino National Forest, as well as an approximately one-quarter section of land owned by
the Morongo Band of Mission Indians. SOI lands are shown on Exhibit III-1, (Banning General
Plan Study Area Boundaries). Year 2000 Census data indicates that the population within the
City’s SOI was 762 residents. Year 2003 estimates show population in the City’s SOI at 784
residents, and projects population growth to 824 residents in Year 2008.
Planning Area: Lands within the City’s planning area, separate from the City’s SOI and
occurring outside the City limits, are also shown on Exhibit III-1. Year 2000 Census data
indicates there were 360 residents in the Planning Area. Year 2003 estimates for this area is 430
residents, and 454 residents in Year 2008.
Based on these data, therefore, Year 2000 population for the entire General Plan study area was
estimated at 24,609 residents. Population estimates for Year 2003 indicate 26,814 residents, with
projected population in Year 2008 of 28,640 residents. This represents an approximately 16.3
percent rate of growth over the eight-year period. Given short-term growth in the City (2004
                                                                             Community Development
                                                                                               III-26

                                                                                                City of Banning
                                                                                                   General Plan
DOF data indicates that the City’s population is already approaching the estimated 2008
projection), these estimates are expected to be conservative. The Southern California Association
of Governments estimates that the City’s population will reach 34,658 in 2010, and 42,027 in
2020.
Age Distribution
According to the 1990 Census, the median age of Banning residents was 36.8. By 2000, it had
increased to 39.9. Year 2003 estimates prepared by Claritas, Inc. indicate that the median age for
Banning residents within the City limits is 40.9. This is older than the median age for Riverside
County residents, which based on Year 2000 Census data, was 33.1 years
For residents in the SOI, for Year 2003, the median age is 40.6. The Year 2003 median age for
the Planning Area is 52.5 years.
Table III-6, below, shows the estimated City age distribution for year 2003. These distributions
reflect an average derived from these data for the City limits, SOI and planning areas. They
indicate that adults ages 65-74 comprise the largest segment (14.07 percent) of the City’s
population, and that the second largest segment is comprised of adults ages 35-44. It is
important to note that 35.5 percent of the City’s population is 55 or older, while 25.3 percent is
under 18.

Household Size
A “household” includes all people who occupy a housing unit. The City’s average household
size does not account for those living in group housing, such as convalescent care or nursing
homes. Residents living in group housing account for only approximately 3.63 percent of the
total population. Household size represents an average number of persons living in a dwelling
                                                                                         Community Development

unit. In 2000 there were a total of 8,707 households within Banning’s corporate limits. Based on
Year 2003 population estimates, the number of households increased to 10,404. The City’s
average household size in 2003 was estimated at 2.23.

Housing Market
The City offers a variety of affordable residential products, at competitive prices that are
typically lower than those found in Riverside County overall. According to the Inland Empire
Quarterly Economic Report, the median home price in the City during the first quarter of 2001
was $87,300 for existing homes, and $153,500 for new homes. During the second quarter of
2003, the median sales price for existing homes in Banning was $145,000, and $201,500 for new
homes. This compares with $232,727 and $285,000 for existing and new homes in Riverside
County for the same period. The City’s median price for existing homes is lower than those of
the neighboring Pass cities of Beaumont and Calimesa. For new homes, the City’s median home
price exceeds the median new home price in Beaumont, but remains lower than for new home
prices in Calimesa.
The City’s housing stock increased from 8,194 units in 1990 to 9,724 units in 2000. This
represents a 10-year increase of approximately 22.6 percent. As shown in the following table, the
majority of new structures are single-family, which is typical of a low-density, suburban
community. As shown below, single family development continues to be the primary housing
unit type in the City.

CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
Commercial Development
Commercial development is a critical component in most communities, as the sale of goods and
services can generate significant sales tax revenue and employment opportunities. Much of the
City’s commercial development is located immediately north and south I-10, and includes
freeway-oriented commercial development. It also includes the City’s core Downtown area,
which is primarily located along Ramsey Street east of 8th Street and west of Hargrave. A cluster
of fast-food restaurants located along Ramsey Street near 22nd Street have formed the core of
freeway-oriented commercial development. General commercial land uses occur west of this
area, with a focus on vehicle sales and service, while neighborhood commercial development
occurs along the City’s western border, on the east side of Highland Springs.
Revitalization efforts in the City’s downtown have also afforded the City with opportunities to
further capitalize on potential development opportunities. In addition to the City’s
Redevelopment Agency efforts, local business owners formed the Core Area Businesses and
Merchants (CABAM) association in 2004, as a subcommittee of the Chamber of Commerce.
Monthly meetings focus on topics of interest to local businesses and are designed to spur growth
and development. Several local businesses are collaborating in a “business incubator,” comprised
primarily of home improvement/home fashion businesses located in rehabilitated buildings along
Ramsey Street east of Hargrave Street.
While the City’s proximity to the Railroad represents a potential resource for future business
development, discussed under Industrial Development, below, it also constitutes a constraint to
commercial activities, primarily in the Downtown core area. As noted in the Circulation
Element, there are currently six railroad crossings in the City, of which four are at grade and two
are grade separated. Local facilities carry approximately 60 trains a day, which average
approximately 7,000 feet in length. Travelers accessing commercial development south of I-10 at
the intersections with at-grade crossings may experience delays that have the potential to
discourage utilization of those commercial areas.
An Economic Development Strategy prepared for the City in 1999 (see further discussion,
below) presented several findings based on research conducted during its preparation. Among
the findings were that the City’s tax revenues have not kept pace with its need for services. It
also found that the City owns several significant but under-utilized assets, including the Banning
Municipal Airport, the Banning Water Canyon, and undeveloped Smith Creek Park lands. Along
with the significant vehicle traffic along I-10 through the City, the City’s proximity to the Outlet
mall and the Morongo Band of Mission Indians gaming facility provide the City with unique
economic development opportunities. These will be further discussed below.
Industrial Development
Industrial development can bring stable and generally higher paying jobs to a community and
can induce development in a variety of secondary or supporting industries. Several factors may
determine the success of industrial development. These include site accessibility, the availability
of utilities, labor force quality, and the public policy environment as it pertains to industrial
                                                                              Community Development
                                                                                                 III-30

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
growth. In the Pass region, industrial development has benefited from proximity to U.S.
Interstate 10 and the railroad. The City of Beaumont has successfully developed a 6,000 foot
railroad siding for use by Lowes’ Home Improvement as a regional distribution center. The
siding is located on an approximately 40-acre site near the junction of I-10 and State Route 60.
The improved siding can accommodate loading and unloading of center beam and flat rail cars
on each side.
An analysis of land use designations indicates that Banning has allocated sufficient acreage to
accommodate future industrial development. Within the General Plan planning area, lands
designated for industrial uses are located east of Hathaway on the north side of Ramsey; around
the Airport; and south of the railroad right of way, between Hathaway and 8th Street. Future
industrial users at these locations may benefit from potential access to lines of the Railroad.
Taxable Sales and Sales Tax Revenues
The table below describes taxable sales trends in the City from 1998 through 2002, as recorded
by the California Board of Equalization. Data shown are for taxable sales in the City’s corporate
limits. As shown in the table, taxable sales in the City have generally increased over the five-year
period, with the exception of year 2001. Retail sales for service stations and auto dealers/supplies
during the fourth quarter of that year may reflect some repercussions from the events of
September 11. Sales rebounded in 2002. Over the five-year period, taxable sales increased
approximately 17.3 percent. Strongest markets included Eating/Drinking Places, which
increased sales 83.2 percent over the period; Food Stores, with a 42.2 percent increase; Home
Furnishings/Appliances, which increased 38.8 percent, and Building Materials/Farm Implements,
which increased 31.2 percent. Service Stations decreased 6.8 percent over the five-year period.
This is consistent with the number of retail sales generators in this segment, which decreased
from 12 in 1998 to 7 in 2002. Other Retail Stores and All Other Outlets showed modest
decreases of less than 2 percent. The number of retail sales generators in the All Other Retail
Outlets segment decreased from 243 to 213 from 2001 to 2002. Total retail generators in the
City increased from 401 in 1998 to 426 in 2002.
                                                                               Community Development

The latest sales tax data, provided by the City, indicate that sales tax revenues to the City during
2003 were $1,871,593, which would indicate that total taxable sales in the City rose to about
$187,160,000 in 2003.
Retail Sales Potential
The following table describes the spending potential of Banning residents and is intended to help
identify which retail market niches would best serve the City population. The analysis takes into
account such factors as City population, number of households, median income, annual
population growth, and annual household growth. The data indicate that the largest existing
expenditure categories are Grocery/Drug, Transportation Expenses, Food/Alcohol Away from
Home, and Apparel/Footwear. The table also provides 5-year expenditure projections. These data
are for the entire planning area.

The table above indicates that for 2003 total sales potential of City residents was estimated at
$315,702,000. However, according to the City, actual taxable sales in Banning in 2003 were
about $187,160,000. The difference ($128,542,000) represents the approximate retail sales
potential of City residents that is not being spent within the City limits. Although it is unlikely
that in any community all the retail sales needs of the entire population can be met, the data
suggest a significant retail leakage from Banning to other communities. When this table is
compared to the previous table, “Taxable Sales in Banning,” categories where significant leakage
are clear, and include food stores, apparel and general merchandise stores.
Tourism and Traveler Revenues
The City is located along U.S. I-10 and in proximity to the desert resorts of the Coachella Valley.
Completion of the freeway in 1963 substantially reduced the City’s ability to attract business
from traffic en route to the Coachella Valley. The City offers limited accommodations for
overnight travelers. There are fewer than 10 hotels/motels in Banning, all of which are small,
locally-owned motels or national motel chains such as Motel 6, Super 8 Motel, and Travelodge.
There are no high end or destination-type resort hotels in the City.
The following provides five-year historical data showing transient occupancy tax revenues the
City has received since 1999, and includes revenue projects for the current (2004/05) fiscal year.
As shown in the table, the City’s revenues from this source increased significantly from FY
2000/01 to FY 2001/02, approximately 21.9 percent, but decreased by nearly the same
percentage in FY 2002/03. The City’s 2004 budgeted TOT revenues represent an increase of
approximately 14.8 percent from FY 2003/04. Annually, TOT revenues have represented less
than 1.5 percent of total revenues to the City during this period.

In addition to the direct revenue generated by transient occupancy taxes, tourists may also be
expected to patronize local restaurants, shops, and recreational/cultural attractions. These
expenditures translate into increased sales tax revenues for the City and increased earnings for
the local labor force, much of which is ultimately funneled back into the local economy.
As noted below, a 23-story, 310-room resort hotel structure was constructed on the Morongo
Band of Mission Indians reservation within 5 miles of the City, and opened in 2004. The hotel is
part of the Morongo Casino, Resort & Spa complex being developed by the Morongo Indians.
The destination-style resort will include, in addition to the existing casino, a nightclub, spa,
ballrooms, convention facilities, and retail space. The Tribe estimates that this development will
generate in excess of $2.8 billion in new jobs and economic benefits to the Inland Empire region
over five years.
This complex may be expected to benefit the City, along with other jurisdictions in the region,
given its proximity, and potential for travelers to the resort to patronize local businesses.
However, it is unclear whether the construction of the Morongo resort hotel will saturate the
local hotel market, or whether development of this regional tourist destination will create a
synergistic opportunity for the City to attract mid-level hotel chains. The City should consider
conducting market research to explore this latter possibility and increase TOT as a potential
revenue source, as well as identifying other opportunities to capitalize on its proximity to this
regional revenue generator.
New Construction Trends
New construction data provided by the City for 2004 indicates that through April 2004, 172 new
single-family residential permits have been issued, with total valuation of $19,306,450. A total
of 5 commercial and industrial permits have been issued during this same period, with a total
valuation of $1,811,741. Single-family building permit valuations have increased nearly 200
percent, from about $21,188,118 in 2000, to $63,477,032 in 2003. Multi-family residential has
been limited, resulting in only 166 new units over the period.
The “Commercial” category described in the table below includes both commercial and
industrial development. New industrial development has been relatively limited, with a total of 4
permits issued through 2003. Total valuation of these industrial permits is $439,808. However,
                                                                             Community Development

as shown below, for the first four months of 2004, 2 industrial permits have been issued, with a
total valuation of $1,374,822.
Commercial development through 2003 was an important contributor to the City economy,
resulting in 125 permits with total valuation of $20,092,533. For the first four months of 2004, 9
commercial permits have been issued. Total valuation of commercial permits to date in 2004 is
$1,915,591.

Redevelopment Project Area and Planning
In 2002 the City adopted an amendment to the Redevelopment Plan that combined the Midway
and Downtown Project Areas, extended all time limits for the Redevelopment Agency and
doubled the size of the redevelopment areas from approximately 1,500 acres to approximately
3,000 acres. In 2003 the City restructured the redevelopment agency debt and issued new bonds,
which netted the City approximately $8 million for economic development projects and $2.2
million for housing. The City has identified approximately $28 million in redevelopment
projects. Exhibit III-3 identifies the City of Banning redevelopment areas.
                                                                              Community Development
                                                                                               III-35


                                                                                     City of Banning
                                                                                        General Plan
Through its Redevelopment Agency, the City has adopted a five-year implementation plan for
the redevelopment project area, in accordance with AB 1290 (CCRL Section 33490). This
legislation required that redevelopment activities include an implementation plan to address the
blight that justified adoption of the redevelopment plan. The plan addresses low and moderate
income housing requirements, and establishes goals and objectives to eliminate blight remaining
in the project areas.
The Agency has sought community participation in the development of its implementation plan,
and will continue to do so. The 2004-2009 plan includes community-driven programs associated
with incentive programs for business attraction and retention; property acquisition and
consolidation; eminent domain; grade separations at railroad crossings; infrastructure
improvements and parking lot improvements in the commercial areas of the City. The
implementation plan will continue to be used by the Redevelopment Agency in implementing
economic development projects in the City.
Economic Development Strategy
In 1999, and subsequent to the adoption of the Initial Implementation Plan, the City adopted the
City of Banning Economic Development Strategy. The Strategy focused on establishing
stakeholders to function both independently and collaboratively to accomplish the nine identified
economic development strategies. Redevelopment project areas shown in the Redevelopment
implementation plan included most of the land upon which formed the basis for City
implementation of the economic development strategies. Strategies included:
•   enhancing the City as a team leader of a broad community-based implementation team;
    improving the fiscal position of the City redevelopment agency;
•   improving municipal code, regulatory practices and business assistance processes;
•   capitalizing on City owned assets;
•   cooperating with business and property owners, working with outside agencies;
•   coordinating with the Morongo Band of Mission Indians and the Cabazon community;
•   attracting visitors and tourists;
•   marketing Banning to local businesses and residents.
As previously noted, the Economic Development Strategy prepared for the City in 1999 provided
findings regarding the City’s overall economic development based on review of applicable
documents and data, and interviews with City staff, key business leaders, elected officials, and
others with knowledge regarding Banning’s economic picture. It also reviewed information
regarding 6, 10 and 20-mile trade area demographics, housing statistics, and consumer spending
patterns.
Among the findings of the Strategy report were that the City’s tax revenues have not kept pace
with its need for services. It indicated that the City owns several significant but under-utilized
assets, including the Banning Municipal Airport, the Banning Water Canyon, and undeveloped
Smith Creek Park lands. Additionally, it found that the City is located in a trade area with
unique economic development opportunities. These included not only residents and businesses
within the Pass Area, but also included three “non-typical” trade areas that increase the City’s
potentially reachable market. These were the substantial traffic traveling through the community
                                                                             Community Development
                                                                                               III-37

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
on U.S. I-10, which ranges from 98,000 trips to 110,000 trips per day along various segments of
I-10 in the planning area; the visitors to the Morongo Mission Indian Band Gaming facility; and
visitors to the Outlet mall.
Economic Development Opportunities in the City
As noted in the Economic Development Strategy, the City owns assets with economic
development potential. These included the Banning Municipal Airport’s Banning Water Canyon
and undeveloped Smith Creek Park lands.
Banning Municipal Airport
The city owned Banning Municipal Airport is a General Aviation Airport located on
approximately 295 acres of land at 200 South Hathaway, on the eastern border to the City,
adjacent to the Railroad and US Interstate 10. It currently (2004) has 65 T-hangars, four full
hangars, and 32 parking tie-downs owned by the City, located primarily on the south side of the
runway. Construction of additional hangars is current under investigation. There are 11 privately
owned hangars on the northwest section of the field. The City recently completed an
approximately $750,000 resurfacing of the runway and taxiway with the help of Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) funding. The runway is 5,200 feet long by 150 feet wide, one of the
longer and wider General Aviation runways in the Inland Empire. To satisfy the FAA required
Runway Protection Zone of 1,000 feet beyond each end of the runway, the City has ownership of
about 1,800 feet on the west end of the runway, and the Morongo Band of Mission Indians has,
on several occasions, assured the City of protecting this area that extends into their property on
the east. They have also expressed an interest in the future development of the airport and
supporting infrastructure.
The airport can handle single engine and any twin engine aircraft up to 12,500 pounds landing
weight. Current operation is as an uncontrolled airport, with advisory UNICOM, CTAF radio
communications from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Fueling service is also available during those hours,
currently only 100LL gasoline. The runway has pilot controlled (PCL) Medium Intensity
Runway Lights (MRL) and, on runway 26 (approach from the east), Vertical Angle Slope
Indicator (VASI) lights.
Lands surrounding the airport have potential for industrial development. These lands are owned
by private parties, the City, Riverside County and the Morongo Band of Mission Indians. The
City has also conferred with the Tribe regarding potential joint venture opportunities for
commercial/industrial development on these lands. The pending Mopar Drag City development
has the potential to limit future airport and airport related industrial development.
Railroad
Rail service facilities through the Pass area, and the City of Banning, can carry approximately 60
trains per day, most of which are freight. Trains average approximately 7,000 feet in length and
generally travel up to 60 miles per hour (mph) in the planning area. Currently there are four at-
grade railroad crossings in the City. These occur at Hargrave Street, San Gorgonio Avenue, 22nd
Street, and Sunset Avenue. Grade separated crossings occur at 8th Street and Highland Springs
Avenue.
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                 III-38

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
The railroad facilities represent both a constraint and an opportunity for the City. As previously
stated, the lack of grade separation at four of the City’s six rail crossings physically divides the
community, and has likely lowered development potential for lands in the south side of the City
in the past. Management of this constraint will continue to be a challenge as the City builds out.
Conversely, the location of the railroad can provide important benefits to industrial and quasi-
industrial development. Construction of drill spurs is possible to provide rail access to adjoining
passenger or industrial uses. Sidings, switches, and additional track linkage would also be
required to provide this access.
Smith Creek Park
The City owns an approximately 150-acre undeveloped park site located at the eastern terminus
of Porter Road, north and south of Smith Creek. While currently (2004) there is no timetable set
for development of this site, a master plan has been designed that will include both passive and
active space. The master plan provides for equestrian facilities, including trails, stables, trailer
parking, grandstand, a riding ring, storage pen, and locker facilities. The master plan also
proposes a fishing lake, dock, swimming lagoon with water slides, a community center, and
picnic and RV camping facilities. Other facilities shown on the plan include an amphitheater,
tennis courts, clubhouse, driving range and swimming pool, as well as a commercial retail center
including restaurants and a hotel. Physical constraints to development of this park site include
Smith Creek, which runs generally easterly through the property. Development of the park would
require construction of all-weather crossings on Smith Creek. Funding for development of this
facility has not yet been identified.
Development of the Park has potential to increase events and attendance of the annual
Stagecoach Days festival, which is held each fall. Currently this event, which features a rodeo, is
held at Dysart Park, an approximately 20-acre facility. Average annual attendance is
approximately 7,000-10,000, of which approximately 70 percent are residents of the Pass region.
Annual net revenues average approximately $30,000. Should Smith Creek Park be developed as
planned, the additional space and facilities have potential to result in up to a tripling of
Stagecoach Days revenues. Development of the Park also has potential to attract equestrian
events throughout the year, as well as providing facilities for other revenue-generating equestrian
and other activities.
Other Opportunities
Mount San Jacinto College
Currently Mount San Jacinto College offers classes in rented facilities in the City. The College
has purchased a 48-acre site located south of I-10 at Sunset Avenue and Westward Avenue in
Banning. While construction of the new campus is not expected to begin for five to seven years,
the College’s expanded presence in the City may provide increased potential for economic
development partnerships geared towards labor market development and job training. In
addition, the College’s facilities may, when constructed, provide opportunities for joint uses that
can attract and host revenue-generating activities such as conferences and special events.

Mopar Drag City
Mopar Drag City is a privately-owned drag racing facility currently being developed on an
approximately 60-acres site located on Barbour Street near the Banning Municipal Airport.
These facilities will feature a quarter-mile track and will be sanctioned by the National Hot Rod
Association. The project developer has estimated that local economic impact from the course
could be as much as $35 million, based on an approximately 100-mile radius multiplier.
Therefore, local impacts are likely to be less. Nonetheless, the project has potential to attract
related high-performance industries as well as event visitors.
Economic Benefits from Development Outside the City
The Morongo Band of Mission Indians reservation is located east of the City. The Morongo
Casino is located on the reservation north of I-10 near Cabazon. The Tribe is currently (2004)
constructing a 23-story hotel on lands adjacent to the Casino, which will include approximately
310 rooms. A second hotel tower is also proposed.
The Outlet mall is located east of the City in unincorporated Cabazon. There are 130 stores in the
mall. The city receives a portion of sales tax collected by Riverside County from outlet mall
sales. The City’s 2003-2004 budget estimates revenues of approximately $260,000, or
approximately 2.57 percent of the General Fund, from this source.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The City has initiated a number of efforts in the past several years aimed at increasing its
economic viability in the region. It has implemented and expanded its revitalization plan for
areas identified as blighted. Through its Economic Development Strategy, it has identified key
economic trends and issues and has implemented strategies to address these issues and plan for
future economic growth. The redevelopment agency is actively seeking to leverage available
bond monies to attract business and industry that will increase property values and generate
property and sales tax revenues for the City.
The information presented above leads to several potential areas where opportunities may be
realized:
    1.      Increases in commercial development to eliminate some of the retail sales leakage
            currently occurring in the City.
    2.      Capitalizing on the Municipal Airport to attract tourism and business to the City.
    3.      Improving Smith Creek Park to increase tourism and sales tax generation in the City.
    4.      Developing synergistic relationships with the Morongo Hotel/Casino complex.
    5.      Developing synergies with Mount San Jacinto College.
The City should continue to work with citizen-initiated organizations such as CABAM, and to
invite input and involvement from business and civic leaders to envision and facilitate the City’s
growth and attract new businesses to the community.
                                                                             Community Development
                                                                                                III-40

                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
Competition among cities for state and federal funding for economic development and
redevelopment projects is likely to continue for some time, given existing and projected budget
shortfalls and depending on the overall economic climate. Nonetheless, the City must continue
to identify and leverage these funding sources. It should also seek out potential partnerships with
public, quasi-public and private entities for joint funding opportunities, to improve its economic
stability and improve the quality of life in the community.
The City should continue to expand and enhance its relationship with the Morongo Band of
Mission Indians, to identify opportunities for economic partnerships with the Tribe. This may
include, but should not be limited to, potential expansion and enhancement of airport facilities as
a means of attracting tourism and business to the community. It should also explore possibilities
of joint funding to finance rail separation at existing at-grade crossings, as well as investigating
development of rail access to benefit existing and future industrial development. Finally, it
should capitalize on its existing strengths, which include natural and scenic resources and
parklands, and identify public and private funding sources to develop and maintain Smith Creek
Park for potential revenue-generating activities.

CIRCULATION ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Circulation Element is to provide goals, policies, programs and standards that
correlate the City’s transportation system with the types, intensities and locations of land uses
within the City. It addresses those segments of the local transportation system that interface with
and serve as extensions of the regional system connecting the City of Banning with the broader
Pass Region and other communities in Southern California. The Circulation Element also serves
as the blueprint for future land use policy decisions and social and economic development
efforts.
BACKGROUND
Due to its close interrelatedness, the Circulation Element is an outgrowth of City and regional
land use planning. In addition to its effects on the physical, social and economic environment of
the City, the Circulation Element also has a direct relationship with the Housing, Open Space,
Noise and Air Quality elements. Being integrally tied to the Land Use Element, the Circulation
Element is predictably influenced by the types, intensities and distribution of land uses within the
community and surrounding area.
Local and regional air quality issues are closely related to the efficiency of the local and regional
transportation system. As the City of Banning and the Pass Region continue to grow, vehicle
miles will increase, and travel speeds will be reduced, resulting in higher emissions per mile
traveled. The policies and programs established by the Circulation Element can play an
important role in maintaining and enhancing the flow of traffic and preserving air quality in the
community.
The Circulation Element has been developed to serve as a comprehensive transportation
management strategy, incorporating analysis of existing conditions within the City, as well as
projected future development based on the buildout of the General Plan Land Use Map (see Land
Use Element). It sets forth specific goals, policies and programs, which are based upon an
engineering and computer modeling analysis of existing and projected future traffic conditions.
Future traffic conditions have been forecasted utilizing the Pass Area Model (PAM), anticipated
buildout land use patterns and intensities, projected regional growth expected to impact City
streets and roadways, and a wide range of socioeconomic data and assumptions.
In addition to vehicular traffic, other modes of transportation important to the City are included
in the Circulation Element: air traffic and the Banning Municipal Airport; rail traffic; public
transportation; and alternative transportation.
California Government Code sets forth the information and data analysis requirements of the
Circulation Element. Government Code Section 65302(b) requires that the element describe
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                  III-46

                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
major thoroughfares and that their planned development be closely coordinated with the Land
Use Element of the General Plan.
It is also required that the Circulation Element include development or improvement standards
that are responsive to changes in demand for capacity created by implementation of the Plan.
Government Code Sections 65103 (f) and 65080, et seq., require that the City coordinate
Circulation Element provisions with applicable regional and state transportation plans. In the
Banning General Plan Planning Area, the following agencies are responsible for preparing these
transportation plans: County of Riverside, Morongo Band of Mission Indians, Southern
California Association of Governments (SCAG) and California Department of Transportation
(CalTrans). The state is also required to coordinate its planning efforts with those of local
jurisdictions (§65080(a)), with the federal government being under a similar mandate (§134,
Title 23 of the U.S. Code).
Indicators Of Roadway Efficiency
The efficient movement of vehicular and non-vehicular traffic on local and regional roadways is
critical to the normal day-to-day functioning of a community. Consequences resulting from
obstructions in traffic flow may include economic loss due to delays in transporting goods,
increased psychological stress for the traveling public, and increased risk for motor vehicle
accidents. The efficiency of a particular roadway can be determined by assessing the roadway’s
capacity, level-of-service, and average daily traffic volume, each of which is described below.
Level-of-Service
Roadway capacity is defined as the number of vehicles that may pass over a section of roadway
in a given time period under prevailing conditions. Roadway capacity is most restricted by
intersection design and operation. The capacity of a roadway and the degree to which that
capacity is being utilized is typically described as the roadway’s “Level-of-Service” (LOS).
Level-of-Service is a qualitative measure of the efficiency of traffic flow and is defined by
alphabetical connotations, ranging from “A” through “F,” that characterize roadway operating
conditions.
LOS A represents an optimum or free-flowing condition, and LOS F indicates extremely slow
speeds and system failure. Levels-of-Service are represented as volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratios,
or vehicle demand divided by roadway capacity. V/C ratios smaller than 1.00 imply better
operational characteristics and levels-of-service. V/C ratios that exceed 1.00 imply worse
operating conditions and LOS F, where traffic demand exceeds roadway capacity. The table
below defines the various LOS classifications.
                                                                             Community Development
                                                                                                III-47

                                                                                                City of Banning
                                                                                                   General Plan
                                               Table III-14
                                Roadway Level Of Service Description
Level of
Service                                 Quality of Traffic Flow
A            Primarily free-flow operations at average travel speeds usually about 90 percent of
             the free-flow speed for the arterial classification. Vehicles are completely unimpeded
             in their ability to maneuver within the traffic stream. Stopped delay at signalised
             intersections is minimal.
B            Reasonably unimpeded operations at average travel speeds usually about 70% of the
             free-flow speed of the arterial classification. Ability to maneuver within the traffic
             stream is only slightly restricted. Stopped delays are not bothersome, and drivers
             generally are not subject to appreciable tension.
C            Traffic operations are stable. However, mid-block maneuverability may be more
             restricted than in LOS B. Longer queues, adverse signal coordination, or both may
             contribute to lower average travel speeds of about 50% of the average free-flow speed
             for the arterial classification. Motorists will experience some appreciable tension
             while driving.
D            Borders on a range where small increases in flow may cause substantial increases in
             approach delay and decreases in arterial speed. LOS D may be due to adverse signal
             progression, inappropriate signal timing, high volumes, or some combination of these

Traffic engineers and transportation planners are involved in on-going efforts to strike a balance
between providing ideal roadway operating conditions and controlling the costs of infrastructure
and right-of-way needed to assure those conditions. For General Plan purposes, LOS C is
assumed to be the “acceptable” level-of-service for all General Plan roadways within the City,
and LOS D at Freeway interchanges. CalTrans’ policy for State Highway 243 and Interstate 10 is
that LOS D will be maintained.
Typically, capacity can be increased by adding travel or turning lanes, constructing raised
medians, alternative means of transportation, and/or restricting vehicle access to a roadway. By
reducing the number of vehicle conflict points, traffic flow on a roadway can be substantially
improved, avoiding the loss of capacity caused by disruptions to traffic flow resulting from
vehicles entering or leaving the roadway (see Section III-B-3, Draft General Plan EIR for more
information about mitigating traffic impacts).
Average Daily Traffic Volumes
Average Daily Trips (ADT) is the total number of vehicles that travel a defined segment of
roadway over a twenty-four hour period. ADT is a useful benchmark number for determining
various roadway configurations and design aspects. The peak hour ADT, which is the highest
volume of traffic to pass over a segment of roadway during an hour period, is also a useful
means of determining a roadway's capacity and level-of-service. Traffic counts at intersections
can provide an even more detailed picture of existing and future operating conditions at
intersections.
Roadways are generally classified in a hierarchical manner, according to the number of vehicle
lanes provided. Table III-15, below, lists the various roadway types/cross-sections found in the
planning area and the maximum daily traffic volumes each type of roadway can accommodate at
various levels-of-service. For example, for a Major Highway to operate at LOS C, it should
accommodate no more than 30,400 vehicle trips per day, with a design capacity of 24,000
vehicle trips per day. These roadway capacities are “rule-of-thumb” estimates, which may vary
depending upon site-specific factors, such as the number and configurations of intersections,
roadway grades, sight distance, percentage of truck and bus traffic, and degree of access control.

CURRENT CONDITIONS
The City of Banning and other communities in the Pass Region form a continuous and
interconnected suburban development pattern, tied together by U.S. Interstate-10 and a network
of arterial roadways. A variety of physical influences and constraints, including the geography of
the City and the region, and the existing roadway network, affect traffic flows and the impacts of
development on local roadways. The existing roadway network is further described in the
General Plan EIR and its traffic study.
Major Regional Roadways
Two major regional roadways provide primary access to the City: State Highway 243 and U.S.
Interstate-10. U.S. Interstate-10 connects the Los Angeles region with Arizona and other cities
and states to the east. State Highway 243 connects Banning and U.S. I-10 to the mountain
community of Idyllwild, State Route 79, and the San Bernardino National Forest.
U.S. Interstate-10
U.S. Interstate-10 is the major transportation route through the City of Banning. It is a critical
part of the local road network, moving people and goods into and through the Pass region.
Where it passes through the City, it is an eight-lane divided freeway. U.S. I-10 disrupts the
internal circulation of the City as it bisects the City into distinct north and south communities.
Currently, there are six access points to the City from I-10, via interchanges at the following
streets (from east to west):
                                                                                 Community Development
                                                                                                    III-50
                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
    •   Fields Road
    •   Ramsey Street
    •   Hargrave Street
    •   8th Street
    •   22nd Street
    •   Sunset Avenue
    •   Highland Springs Avenue
The eastern portion of the Highland Springs Avenue interchange is in the City limits; the western
portion is in the City of Beaumont.
Although CalTrans is responsible for development and maintenance of this facility, I-10 has been
designated as a component of the Riverside County Congestion Management Plan (CMP)
System.
State Highway 243
The designated State Highway begins on 8th Street south of I-10 and runs south to Lincoln
Street. It continues east on Lincoln Street to San Gorgonio Avenue to the City limits, where it
becomes the Banning-Idyllwild Panoramic Highway. State Highway 243 is designated a State
Scenic Highway from the Banning City limits to State Route 74, 28.2 miles south, near the
community of Idyllwild.
Major Local Roadways
The City has facilitated the construction and maintenance of a variety of major roadways of local
importance. These roadways have been built along a north-south grid that interconnects with
major arterials, some of which also pass through adjacent jurisdictions, primarily to the west.
A variety of traffic data was collected to evaluate existing traffic conditions in the planning area,
including traffic counts and estimations from studies conducted for the cities of Banning and
Beaumont, CalTrans, and special site-specific traffic studies conducted for development projects
in the planning area.
As defined in the City’s existing (1994) Circulation Element, the street system is projected to
include the following roadways. It is important to note that the 1994 Circulation Element did not
use the street classification system used in much of Riverside County today.
Major Highways
The General Plan defines Major Highways, or arterial streets, as those primarily for through
traffic with limited access. These roadways are planned for 4 to 6 lanes in width at buildout.
Arterials should connect residential, shopping, employment and recreational activities, but
should not encroach upon neighborhoods. Roadways designated as arterial streets in the adopted
General Plan include:
      • Highland Springs Avenue - North and South of U.S. Interstate-10
      • Highland Home Road -Cherry Valley Boulevard to southerly City limits
      • Sunset Avenue - Gilman Avenue to Interstate 10
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                  III-51

                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
    •   8th Street – Ramsey Street to State Route 243
    •   San Gorgonio – Lincoln to State Route 243
    •   Hathaway Street – Ramsey Street to Morongo Road
    •   18th Street – Highland Springs Avenue to Highland Home Road
    •   Wilson Street – Highland Springs Avenue to Hathaway
    •   Ramsey Street – Highland Springs Avenue to Hathaway
    •   Sun lakes Boulevard – Highland Springs Avenue to Highland Home Road
    •   Lincoln Street – Highland Home Road to Hathaway
Secondary Highways
Secondary Highways are those that primarily receive traffic from arterials and distribute the
movement within residential, commercial and industrial land use designations. These streets are
planned for 4 lanes. The 1994 General Plan designates the following roadways as Secondary
Highways:
    •     Sunset Avenue – Interstate 10 to Porter
    •     8th Street - Wilson Street to Ramsey Street
    •     4th Street – Wilson Street to Ramsey Street
    •     San Gorgonio Avenue - Wilson Street to Lincoln Street
    •     Hargrave Street – Wilson Street to Porter Road
    •     Cottonwood Road (North - South) – North of Ramsey to Porter Road
    •     Fields Road
    •     Porter Road – Sunset Avenue to Cottonwood Road (North - South)
Collector Streets
Finally, the General Plan identifies Collector streets. Collectors are planned as 2 lane roads. The
1994 General Plan Collector streets are:
    •     Highland Home Road – Westward Avenue to southern City limits
    •     Sunset Avenue – Wilson Street to Bluff Street
    •     Bluff Street – Northern City limits to San Gorgonio Avenue
    •     22nd Street – Lincoln Street to Bobcat Road
    •     8th Street – Bluff Street to Wilson Street
    •     San Gorgonio Avenue – Morongo Road to Wilson Street
    •     George Street – Sunset Avenue to Hathaway Street
    •     Nicolet Street - Sunset Avenue to Hathaway Street
    •     Williams Street - Sunset Avenue to Hathaway Street
    •     Westward Avenue - Sunset Avenue to Cottonwood Road (North - South)
    •     Barbour Street – 8th Street to Airport
    •     Wesley Street – 8th Street to Cottonwood Road (North - South)
    •     Porter Road – Highland Home Road to Sunset Avenue
    •     Bobcat Road – Highland Home Road to 22nd Street
The existing General Plan arterials are shown on Exhibit III-4, Existing General Plan Street
System.

                                                                                         General Plan
TRAFFIC AND CIRCULATION PLANNING FOR GENERAL PLAN BUILDOUT
In integral part of the General Plan is the City’s roadway system. In order to assure that traffic is
efficiently transported through the City in the future, a traffic study and associated model were
prepared to analyze the impacts of the land use map on the City’s street system. This traffic
model identified deficiencies in the City’s network of roadways, and led the City’s traffic
consultant to a series of recommendations for future improvements to assure the smooth flow of
traffic. The traffic analysis summarized below is described fully in the General Plan EIR, and
included in is entirety as an appendix to that document.
The traffic model utilized for this General Plan was a TRANPLAN model, which is utilized
throughout the County for transportation planning. Since Banning is part of the Pass region, it
was important to standardize the traffic analysis to conform to regional standards.
The traffic model divided the City into Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs), which contained data on
the land use in that zone, and the traffic which that land use would generate. It is important to
note that some land uses are producers of traffic, while others are attractors for traffic. For
example, residential land uses produce traffic, while retail commercial land uses attract traffic.
Once the traffic model TAZs were assigned and their land use trip generation calculated, the trips
were distributed on the roadway system.
The traffic modeling considered two issues: street segment impacts, and intersection impacts.
Street segments were analyzed for average daily trips (ADT), while intersection impacts were
analyzed for morning and evening peak hours (the hour in the morning or evening when the
highest concentration of trips occurs, primarily controlled by commuter trips). A total of 23
intersections were analyzed.
This led to conclusions on the needed size of streets, the areas where the street system would not
function properly, and the types of improvements that would be necessary to make the street
system work properly.
Street Cross Sections
As previously stated, the 1994 Circulation Element street classification system is not consistent
with the street classification system used in Riverside County. Because of the inter-
connectedness of roadways, and the City’s location as one of a chain of cities in the County, the
street cross sections described in this Circulation Element have been made consistent with
County standards (see Exhibit III-5). In this way, the City can better integrate into regional
transportation programs and plans, including the Transportation Uniform Mitigation Fee
program and state and federal programs in the future. The new street classifications result in the
following standards:
                                                                              Community Development

Intersection Analysis
Intersections are the most impacted component of the traffic system. If there are delays, they will
occur at intersections, rather than in roadway segments, simply because traffic signals and stop
signs increase delays, whereas roadway segments are always “green lights.” The City has strived
for a level of service (LOS) of C at intersections. This standard, although desirable, is generally
unattainable in most of southern California, especially during peak hours.
A total of 23 intersections in the City were analyzed to determine whether they would operate at
LOS C during peak hours. The analysis found that all street intersections would operate at LOS
C, except Highland Springs at Ramsey, Sunset at Ramsey and 8th Street at Ramsey, which would
each operate at LOS D. At freeway ramp intersections, a LOS D condition would occur at
General Plan buildout, except at 8th Street at I-10 westbound, which would operate at LOS E;
and 8th Street at I-10 eastbound, Hargrave at I-10 westbound, and Hargrave at I-10 eastbound,
which will operate at LOS F. In order to improve the level of service at these locations,
additional interchanges with Interstate 10 are required, as discussed under “Special Issues,”
below.
Traffic Signals
An analysis of the needed traffic signals for General Plan buildout was also conducted. The
locations of traffic signal warrants at buildout are depicted on Exhibit III-7.
                                                                                Community Development

All Weather Crossings
All weather crossings include bridges and culverted streets that allow natural drainages to flow
under the roadway during major storms. All weather crossings in the City are described in the
following Table.

These facilities are needed both to allow the smooth flow of traffic in these areas, and to assure
public safety in emergency situations. Construction of these facilities is particularly critical to the
development of the south side of the City.
Transportation Demand Management
The continued urbanization and growth of the Pass Region will necessitate transportation
demand and systems management to preserve and increase available roadway capacity.
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) requires the development and implementation of
policies, plans and programs that result in the use of a wider range of transportation alternatives,
including public transit and bicycles.
TDM can include alternative travel modes, such as carpooling, van pooling and mass transit. In
addition, employee flex-time work schedules that reduce peak hour travel and associated traffic
congestion may also be considered. The Riverside County Transportation Commission (RCTC),
in response to state mandates, has prepared a regional Congestion Management Program. This
program required the City of Banning and other cities to prepared TDM ordinances or risk the
loss of federal transportation funds. The City has adopted a TDM ordinance.
Traffic Calming
Traffic calming is a useful tool available to the City to slow traffic in residential neighborhoods,
and discourage shortcuts through these neighborhoods. The advantages of traffic calming must
always be balanced, however, with the requirements of emergency vehicles.
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                  III-64
                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
Traffic calming can include such design features as curvilinear streets, speed humps and raised
intersections, traffic circles or roundabouts, stop signs on through streets, and narrowed
intersections. Using these design features improves safety by slowing traffic to 30 miles per hour
or less. The restriction or blocking of turning movements can also be used effectively in traffic
calming, particularly to reduce cut-through, or short cut traffic in neighborhoods.
ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION
Pedestrian, Equestrian, Bicycle and Golf Cart Circulation
The General Plan and associated documents support planning that allows and enhances access to
commercial services and places of employment and recreation without the essential use of
motorized vehicles. In this regard, master planning sidewalks, bike lanes, off-street trails and
golf cart routes is especially important along major roadways in the community.
Pedestrian and Equestrian Trails and Bike Paths
The City’s adopted Parks and Recreation Master Plan includes a proposed trails system that
would provide access from parks, city streets, and the surrounding community via urban, foothill
and wash/hill trails. Two short, minimally developed urban trail segments currently exist in the
City and are associated with the proposed trail system. The City has also approved, or is
currently reviewing, several equestrian trails within and adjacent to private subdivisions.
There are currently no bikeways within the planning area. Several Class II and III bikeways
have been proposed along City streets. However, development of a network of bikeways is
constrained by the existing condition of street right-of-ways. Future bike routes should be
planned to provide safe routes for intra-City bicycle traffic and should be clearly marked and
striped. Where possible, they should be designed as one-way bike routes, which flow in the
same direction as adjacent automobile traffic. Combination sidewalks/bikeways require an
eight-foot width. These multi-use lanes will also serve as links to recreational facilities
throughout the community. Policies and programs specifically addressing the need for trails and
bicycle lanes are included in the Parks and Recreation Element.
Sidewalks
Within some portions of the City, sidewalks are non-existent or discontinuous, limiting their
usefulness as safe alternatives to vehicle travel. As previously noted, rights-of-way along City
roadways are inconsistent, limiting the potential for bikeway development. When considering
future development, pedestrian and bicycle accommodation and safety should be given emphasis
equal to that currently given to automobile access. This is particular true of collector and arterial
roadways, where more traffic increases the hazards to pedestrians.
Another area where sidewalks are an important asset is in the historic Downtown of the City
(between the I-10 right of way and Williams, and between 8th Street and Alessandro). Pedestrian
access in this area is a function of economic development for this area, and should be considered
in all future development and redevelopment plans.
Conversely, sidewalks on local, neighborhood roadways may not be necessary, particularly in
established neighborhoods where roadways have been developed to their ultimate right-of-way,
                                                                              Community Development
                                                                                                 III-65

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
and the addition of sidewalks would impact front yards and affect the character of the
neighborhood.
Finally, sidewalks in proximity to schools provide children with a safe route to school. They are
not currently available at all City schools.
Golf Cart Facilities
Golf cart use on public rights of way is controlled by state regulations, and provides a
convenient, low impact alternative to access convenient commercial development, as well as
parks and public services. Golf carts to be used on the public golf cart routes must meet specific
physical requirements set forth in the City golf cart plan, must be certified as “road ready” by the
City and carry an appropriate permit sticker. Golf cart operators must carry a valid California
Driver’s license, have proof of insurance, be equipped with seatbelts and appropriate child safety
equipment, and be properly maintained. In order to implement a golf cart route system, the City
is required to prepare and adopt a Golf Cart Plan and associated implementing ordinances.
Currently there are no existing golf cart facilities in the planning area, outside of private golf
development in the Sun Lakes Country Club. Issues related to development of golf cart facilities
are similar to those for trail and bikeway development, in that existing facilities that would
accommodate development of cart paths do not exist or are discontinuous in some areas.
Public Transportation
Banning Transit Services
Currently (2004) the Banning Municipal Transit System provides fixed route bus service along
three routes, two of which are in Banning and one east to Cabazon. There are five City-owned
vehicles, three of which are in revenue service and two of which are in reserve. All are powered
by compressed natural gas (CNG), and are equipped with bicycle racks. All are ADA compliant,
with wheelchair lifts and tie-down stations.
The transit system also operates a Dial-A-Ride service that provides elderly and disabled persons
in Banning with curb-to-curb transit services. In addition, Dial-A-Ride is the ADA
complementary para-transit provider for the City's fixed route bus service. The Dial-A-Ride
program operates two vehicles in revenue service, and one in reserve, all gasoline powered. All
Dial-A-Ride vehicles are ADA compliant, with wheelchair lifts and tie-down stations.
In May 2002, the Banning City Council approved the final Pass Area Transit Plan. The Transit
Plan establishes the Pass Transit System, which consists of two independent transit systems, the
Banning Municipal Transit System and the Beaumont Municipal Transit System. The Plan
provides for a coordinated service area including the cities of Banning and Beaumont, the
unincorporated areas of Cabazon and Cherry Valley, and the commercial area of the Morongo
Band of Mission Indians Reservation. The Plan provides fixed route and dial-a-ride services.
The transit-needs study conducted for the Plan identified service related issues associated with
the existing transit systems. It also identified areas not addressed in the Transit Plan requiring
additional study or resources. These needs will be addressed in future transit plans, and include
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                 III-66

                                                                                         City of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
service for non-traditional work shifts in the region, students, elimination of one-way loops to
reduce ride time on local routes, adjusting route schedules to provide timed transfers between
routes, relocation of transfer points and development of a transit center.
Regional bus service is provided by the Riverside Transit Agency (RTA), which provides
services to Hemet/San Jacinto (Route 31), Moreno Valley (Route 35), and Calimesa/Redlands
(Route 36), from the bus stop at Kmart on Highland Springs.
Railroad
Rail service facilities through the Pass area, and the City of Banning, can carry approximately 60
trains per day, most of which are freight. Regional freight transfer facilities are located in West
Colton. Local facilities carry approximately 60 trains per day, most of which are freight. Trains
average approximately 7,000 feet in length and generally travel up to 60 miles per hour (mph) in
the planning area. UPRR is expanding rail facilities between Los Angeles and Houston, Texas to
facilitate increases in rail traffic. Rail lines in the planning area are designated Centralized Track
Control (CTC).
There are currently no passenger services available in Banning, although a passenger rail station
did operate in the past.
There are currently (2004) four at-grade railroad crossings in the City. These occur at Hargrave
Street, San Gorgonio Avenue, 22nd Street, and Sunset Avenue. Grade separated crossings occur
at 8th Street and Highland Springs Avenue. The City should explore federal, state, City and
UPRR cost sharing arrangements for grade separation of at-grade crossings in conjunction with
the California Public Utilities Commission.
Construction of drill spurs is possible to provide rail access to adjoining passenger or industrial
uses. Sidings, switches, and additional track linkage would also be required to provide this
access. Additional costs would also be associated with any special engineering requirements and
potential engineering constraints.
Banning Municipal Airport
The Banning Municipal Airport is classified by the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems
(NPIAS) as a General Aviation airport. The airport includes 65 hangars and 32 tie downs, with a
5,200 foot runway.
The airport is capable of accommodating most private single-engine and corporate jet aircraft, as
well as helicopters. It averages approximately 10 to 15 takeoffs and landings daily and about
12,000 operations per year. Air traffic is primarily comprised of private, two-engine fixed-wing
aircraft. There is no control tower at the airport, so all operations operate under Visual Flight
Rules (VFR). Unicom service is provided from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., every day. Fueling service is
also available.
An approximately $750,000 improvement asphalt overlay project is planned, and will be funded
from Federal Aviation Administration grant monies.
                                                                                 Community Development
                                                                                                   III-67
                                                                                     City of Banning
                                                                                        General Plan
Major Utility Corridors
Major corridors and easements for the transport of natural gas, electricity, communications,
domestic water and sewage, and storm drainage are also important components of the Circulation
Element. Generally, the need for utility corridors is met through the provision of easements in or
adjacent to City streets and along common lot lines.
A major electric corridor occurs immediately south of the Banning Bench. The right of way for
the two 220 kV transmission lines in this area is approximately 500 feet in width. Additional 115
kV transmission lines occur in the southern end of the City, and along the San Bernardino
Mountains.
Two major high-pressure natural gas pipelines traverse the City, and transport natural gas far
beyond the City’s boundaries. A 30 inch line occurs under Lincoln Street through the City.
Another 30-inch pipeline transects the City in a northwesterly direction from Hargrave and
Wilson to Highland Springs Avenue. Two crude oil (16”) or petroleum (12”) lines occur on the
south side of the City, from the airport southwesterly to Wesley, then westerly to the western
City limits. Please see Exhibit V-11, Natural Gas and Fuel Lines.
Future land use planning, including the development of subdivisions and the processing of
development applications, will require coordination between the City, developers, utility
companies, and other service providers to assure the availability and provision of easements and
rights of way for the extension of roads, utility lines, and public services.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Special Issues
In the development of the traffic study for this General Plan, six issues were identified which
required particular attention. These are individually described below.
State Route 243
The City’s 1994 Circulation Element included a connection from 8th Street to State Route (SR)
243. This connection does not currently (2004) exist, but was proposed as a future roadway. 8th
Street from Interstate 10 to SR 243 was required to be a Major Highway. The current connection
between I-10 and SR 243 is south on 8th Street from I-10 to Lincoln, east on Lincoln to San
Gorgonio, and south on San Gorgonio to SR 243. Current volumes on SR 243 are approximately
4,000 vehicles per day. At buildout, it is expected that SR 243 will carry approximately 8,000
trips per day. The buildout trips, although double the current trips generated by SR 243, will not
impact the City’s street system, and can be absorbed on the streets currently used to make this
connection, as described above. It was therefore determined that 8th Street south of I-10 was
required to be a Secondary Highway, not a Major Highway, at buildout of the General Plan, and
that the connection to SR 243 was not required for traffic flow.
A direct connection from a State Highway to an Interstate Highway is always preferred by
CalTrans. In consultation with CalTrans (California Department of Transportation), the City has
considered alternative alignments for SR 243, which are included in the General Plan traffic
                                                                              Community Development
                                                                                               III-68

                                                                                    City of Banning
                                                                                       General Plan
study. Should CalTrans or the City wish to change the current on-street connection to a direct
connection, a potential alignment has been depicted on Exhibit III-6, Proposed General Plan
Street System. However, since the impacts to the City’s streets from SR 243 traffic is not
considered to significantly impact City roadways, realignment should be considered a low
priority.
Additional Freeway Interchange Capacity
The traffic analysis for this General Plan showed unacceptable levels of service during the peak
hour at several I-10 ramp intersections, as discussed above. Exhibit III-8 shows the estimated
volumes of traffic at interchanges at buildout of this General Plan. The study considered the
potential of expanding existing interchange capacity, however, right of way is severely
constrained, the under-crossings existing at 8th Street and Hargrave are undersized and would be
extremely costly to widen.
As a result, the City will require two additional freeway interchanges: one at Highland Home
Road on the west end of the City, and one at Cottonwood Road (North - South) on the east end
of the City. The Highland Home interchange, which has been shown as a future interchange in
the 1994 Circulation Element, will alleviate congestion at Highland Springs and Sunset
interchanges. The added interchange at Cottonwood will alleviate congestion at 8th Street and
Hargrave interchanges.
CalTrans plans to widen I-10 in the future, by adding one lane in each direction. Given the costs
associated with this widening, and the cost of the interchanges, a coordinated construction
program of widening and interchange additions would likely be most cost effective.
                                                                            Community Development
                                                                                              III-69


                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
Highland Home Road/Cherry Valley Boulevard/Brookside/18th Street/Highland Springs
The General Plan roadway system has shown Highland Home connecting to Cherry Valley
Boulevard in the City of Beaumont. The extension of Highland Home however, could connect to
the west at Brookside Avenue in Beaumont. Further, Highland Springs is planned to extend to
the northeast to Bluff Street, to provide access to the Black Bench area, and a second connection
from the Banning Bench to the City. This connection could also be made through the extension
of 18th Street to the northeast.
In all cases, traffic flow will not be significantly affected, insofar as traffic volumes on these
streets in this area are not expected to be high. The Recommended General Plan Street System
shows these streets in their currently envisioned configuration. However, as development occurs
and the feasibility of the extensions is considered, flexibility is included in this General Plan to
allow changes to the street system in the future.
At Grade Railroad Crossings
The City has two grade separated railroad crossings at streets with I-10 interchanges. The other
four existing or planned interchanges must also be improved to include grade separations, in
order to maintain acceptable levels of service. A grade separation is included in the
Transportation Uniform Mitigation Fee (TUMF) program for the Sunset Avenue interchange.
The others are not in the TUMF program.
The City will need to aggressively pursue grade separations for the railroad tracks at all
interchanges. This should include the preparation of feasibility studies, the securing of all
available funding, and the cooperation of the development community. Although construction of
these facilities may not occur in the near term, the planning must be initiated immediately, in
order for the City to be able to implement the construction in the future.
Lincoln Street and Westward avenue west of Sunset Avenue
The 1994 Circulation Element included the extension of both Lincoln and Westward from
Highland Home to Sunset. Both these roadways occur currently east of Sunset. West of Highland
Home, only one roadway, Sun Lakes Boulevard, currently occurs. The traffic study for this
General Plan considered the traffic volumes generated south of I-10 on Sunset, and the potential
volumes for Lincoln and Westward east of Sunset. The study found that Westward will have
sufficiently low volumes so as to require a 2 lane collector east of Sunset. Lincoln is projected as
a Major Highway from Highland Home easterly, as is Sun Lakes Boulevard. Traffic volumes
will result in LOS C or better for both Lincoln and Westward in this area. Therefore, the
elimination of Westward west of Sunset will not have a negative effect on east-west traffic south
of I-10.
Level of Service Policy
The City has in the past enforced a LOS C policy for City streets, except at freeway
interchanges, where a LOS D is considered acceptable. The traffic study for this General Plan
found that the City will be able to maintain LOS C on most City streets, except Ramsey. In order
to maintain LOS C on Ramsey Street, additional travel lanes would be required at its intersection
with Highland Springs, Sunset, 8th Street and Hargrave. Some of these lanes would need to be on
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                 III-71
                                                                                     City of Banning
                                                                                        General Plan
Ramsey, some on the cross street. Without the additional lanes, intersections along Ramsey will
operate at LOS D at General Plan buildout. As described at the beginning of this Element, LOS
D does not represent a significant degradation in traffic flow. When balancing the need for an
efficient traffic system and the widening of streets to accommodate peak hour traffic, it appears
that a lowering of the City’s requirement for Ramsey Street from LOS C to LOS D will not result
in a significant negative effect.
Alternative Transportation
As cited above, existing rights-of-way on City streets are not adequate to allow for development
of non-motorized transportation. The City has generally been able to secure right-of-way from
new development as it occurs to provide full-width mid-block roadway improvements, but the
process can be time consuming and costly.
New development should be required to provide separate paths for bicycles and/or equestrians,
pedestrians and golf carts to assure safety and avoid conflicts. Equestrian trails should be
included in projects developed south of the railroad right-of-way, as well as a connection to the
San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountains.
Bicycle and golf cart parking facilities should be integrated into the design of commercial office
and public land uses. Connectivity should also be a primary goal of residential design and
should emphasize easy accessibility within and between neighborhood and commercial services
to maximize the opportunities for pedestrian, bicycle, equestrian and golf cart access by short
and direct trips. This planning focus will also help to shorten vehicle trips for residents who
must use their automobiles.
Public transport out of the City is limited, particularly into the Inland Empire communities to the
west. As development occurs in the City, and increased pressure is brought to provide service

PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Parks and Recreation Element is intended to plan and provide for a diverse and integrated
parks and recreation system, which creates important and passive recreational amenities that
reflect and are responsive to the needs and standards of the City. It includes an inventory of
existing parks, trails and recreational amenities, as well as an assessment of other suitable lands
to be incorporated into the system.
This Element also includes a section on bikeways and trails, which have the potential to serve as
an essential component of the park and recreation system within the City, and an additional
amenity for its residents. The development of a cohesive system of bikeways and trails can
enhance the quality of life and add to recreational opportunities.
Further, this Element provides implementation strategies and describes potential funding sources
for constructing future parks and trails facilities. The goals, policies and programs set forth in
this Element help to plan for and provide sufficient parkland and recreational space that reflects
and is responsive to the needs of the City.
BACKGROUND
The Parks and Recreation Element is directly related to the Land Use Element of the General
Plan. It also has connections to the Open Space and Conservation Element with regard to trail
usage in open space corridors and mountain environments, and the benefits of natural areas as
viable components of open space lands.
Parks and recreational facilities also play an important role in attracting new residents and
tourists, a key to economic growth, and provide a direct link to the Economic Development
Element. It is also related to the Noise and Circulation Elements in its use of natural buffers,
trails and open space to enhance the natural resources of the community.
Government Code 65560 requires that the General Plan include discussion of areas particularly
suited for parks and recreational purposes, including areas with links between major recreation
and open space reservations, trails, and scenic highways. Section 65561 states that the
preservation of park land is necessary not only for the maintenance of the economy of the state,
but also for the assurance of the continued availability of land for the enjoyment of scenic beauty
and recreation. Government Code Sections 66477 and 66479 enable local governments to require
park site dedications, or fees in lieu of dedication, based upon existing and projected local
population and General Plans land use designations. Recreation uses are included in the

PARKS
Parks and recreational facilities serve many important functions within a community. Parklands
primarily provide recreational opportunities, and also transcend simple recreational uses. They
contribute to the community’s quality of life by transforming and enhancing urban areas.
Through appropriate use of landscaping and structural design, parks create a soothing contrast to
high-density development. They provide active and passive recreational opportunities, with
access to planned and maintained open space, recreational facilities and organized sports areas.
These functions allow people to have direct contact with the natural and man-made
environments. Parks also provide a community gathering place for social activities, thus
contributing to the community’s sense of place.
Park design should incorporate elements such as diverse activities and uses, access and linkage,
comfort and image, and sociability. As a public place, a good park should be connected to the
community with the right combination of physical amenities that attract people and make it a
central place in the neighborhood. A park should also be visible within the community, and
easily accessible, linked to main areas within a community, so that it will be used more
frequently. The details within the park should welcome people and include design amenities that
offer shade, a comfortable place to sit, and a pleasant and attractive environment. These
attributes of a good park should serve as the foundation for the City’s parks planning.
Open space lands in the community differ to some degree from parklands in improvements and
use, but are important enhancements to City recreation facilities. These are also discussed in the
Open Space and Conservation Element.
Parks Classifications
Tot Lots, Mini Parks, Pocket Parks and Plazas
Mini parks or pocket parks are 0.5 to three acres in size, and are typically used for limited,
isolated or unique purposes. They are generally very popular in new housing developments and
are sometimes called “tot lots” or “sitting parks.” Facilities vary depending on the location and
function of the park, but generally they are not designed for structured or organized play. In
addition to the traditional residential setting, mini parks may be situated in office, business or
commercial centers, and utilized as a space for rest, relaxation and socializing. They may also be
located inside a neighborhood, within or in close proximity to apartment complexes, townhouse
developments, senior housing or other development that requires recreational space. Currently
(2004) there is one mini-park within the planning area. The needs assessment prepared for the
Parks Master Plan identified the need for acquisition of parkland for development of additional
pocket parks in the City.
Neighborhood Parks
Neighborhood parks remain the basic unit of the park system. They are intended to provide for
the active and passive recreation needs of nearby residents, serving as a social focus of the
neighborhood. Neighborhood parks are generally located within walking and bicycle distance of
residences. Park facilities are usually oriented toward the recreational needs of children, but may
                                                                              Community Development
                                                                                                III-83

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
also include volleyball courts, half-size basketball courts, and picnic and play areas that serve all
age groups. Restrooms or off-street parking are also usually available.
The typical size of neighborhood parks ranges from about five to ten acres, and is dependent on
available land and the size and relationship of the neighborhood to be served. Neighborhood
parks are an important feature within a community, and should be designed to provide for a wide
range of leisure and recreational activities. The design of neighborhood parks must carefully
consider their physical proximity to adjacent homes, while avoiding adverse impacts to
surrounding lands from noise, traffic or lights. They should be located on public streets to
facilitate convenient access, and designed to address the full range of safety and security issues.
In particular, they should serve as a focal point within a neighborhood, attracting nearby
residents and visitors for social activity, special events and to help develop a sense of
community.
School Parks
This classification consists of parks or playgrounds built adjacent to but separate from
educational facilities that may serve either a neighborhood or a larger area. Parks on school
grounds are usually equivalent to neighborhood parks (as described above), but may also include
sports fields for soccer or baseball. Establishing a joint-use agreement with the school district
will help the City meet its demand for parklands.
Community Parks
Community parks provide active and passive recreation opportunities on a larger scale than
neighborhood parks. The desirable size for community parks ranges from 20 to 50 acres, and
they are designed to serve an area within a three to five-mile radius. Community parks serve all
ages. Facilities may include low-intensity or passive recreational opportunities, lighted fields,
tennis and sports courts, swimming pools and areas or buildings for community festivals ad civic
events, as well as for organized indoor sport and athletic competitions. Generally, restrooms and
off-street parking are provided. While community parks serve larger areas of the City than do
neighborhood parks, they often also fulfill a neighborhood function.
Regional Parks
Regional parks are usually at least 50 acres in size and serve the entire City or region. While
regional parks can provide for varying intensities of recreational activity, a portion of the park is
generally maintained in a natural setting for passive recreation use or preservation of the
environment. Facilities within regional parks are similar to those in community parks, often on a
larger scale, or including active or organized recreational activities that would not fit in a
community park. Regional parks may also include natural resource areas that provide passive
recreational opportunities in a more natural environment. This distinguishes natural resource
areas that are essentially open space conservation areas, where “use” is incidental to their
conservation and protection.
Special Use Park Lands
Special use lands are most often linked to special events or types of activities, and can vary
greatly in size and amenities. These lands can include fair grounds, public riding stables and
                                                                              Community Development
                                                                                                 III-84

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
facilities, skate parks or similar recreational facilities whose function is very specific. These
types of parks can also be combined with other parks, and occupy a portion of a larger park area.
Park and Recreational Service Providers
Parks and recreation services within the City of Banning are provided by the City Community
Services Department. The Community Services Department provides guidance for recreational
facilities and programs. The Department operates a variety of programs, including activities for
children and youth, adult sports, and classes geared towards the general public, many of which
are offered at the Banning Community Center and City parks (see further discussion, below).
Aquatic activities and facilities are offered at the Banning Municipal pool. The Department also
provides services and programs to senior citizens through the Banning Senior Center.
The Riverside County Regional Park and Open Space District also provides recreational facilities
and services at County owned parks facilities in the planning area. These are discussed further,
below.
While schools are not recreational providers, they can help to provide park facilities for public
uses in a community. Joint-use facilities enable the public to utilize a school’s existing space and
equipment for passive and active recreation.
Existing Park Facilities
There are currently eleven parks within the City and it’s planning area. The following table lists
each park, its classification, size and ownership status, and the amenities it offers.

areas, such as playground and swings, two half-court basketball courts, picnic and barbecue
areas, and turfed open space areas. It is expected to be complete before the end of 2004.
Neighborhood Park
This unnamed neighborhood park site is located along the south side of Lincoln Street west of
22nd Street, and will be adjacent to a future Banning Unified School District school. No timetable
has been set for development of this 7.5± acre site, however, it is expected to include both active
and passive recreational facilities.
Smith Creek Park
The 150± acre Smith Creek Park site is located at the eastern terminus of Porter Road, north and
south of Smith Creek. Currently (2004) there is no timetable set for development of this site.
However, a master plan has been designed that will include both passive and active space. If
developed according to the existing plan, the park will include equestrian facilities, including
trails, stables, trailer parking, grandstand, a riding ring, storage pen, and locker facilities. Other
areas of the site will feature a fishing lake, dock, swimming lagoon with water slides, a
community center, and picnic and RV camping facilities. An amphitheater, tennis courts,
clubhouse, driving range and swimming pool will also be constructed, according to the plan, as
well as a commercial retail center including restaurants and a hotel. A community park complex
will feature playgrounds, basketball and tennis courts, picnic areas, shade structures, and
pathways.

                                                                                                 III-89

                                                                                          City of Banning
                                                                                             General Plan
Additional Facilities
The San Bernardino National Forest includes lands in the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains
in and near the planning area. A biologically diverse resource, the Forest provides for
recreational opportunities such as hiking, horseback riding, hunting, fishing, and mountain
biking. Visitors to the Forest during winter months may also snow ski, snowboard and
snowmobile during winter months.
In addition to the facilities listed above, there are other public and private recreation
opportunities in the planning area. These include:
Public Facilities
The County of Riverside Regional Park & Open Space District operates an interpretive historical
museum in Banning. The Gilman Ranch and Museum is located at Wilson and 16th Street, and
consists of 126 acres encompassing a wagon museum, blacksmith shop and other historical
buildings. The County provides educational and interpretive programs of life in the time period
that the Gilman Ranch operated.
Private Facilities
Deutch Park is privately owned and administered by the Deutch Company. The approximately 5-
acre park is located on Barbour Street east of Hathaway Street. It includes picnic areas, a softball
field, and turf/open space. It is open to Deutch Company employees. While it is made available
to outside parties for private functions on a limited basis, it is generally not open to the public.
Mopar Drag City is a quarter-mile drag racing facility under construction near the Banning
Municipal Airport on Barbour Street. Privately owned, the approximately 60-acre Mopar Drag
City racing facilities will be sanctioned by the National Hot Rod Association. It will feature
state-of-the-art timing systems.
Morongo Band of Mission Indians Community Center
The Morongo Band of Mission Indians Community Center opened in February 2004 and is
located at 13000 Fields Road. The Tribe offers after school programs to tribal children five days
a week, with additional programs on Saturdays. Recreational facilities on-site include basketball
courts, weightlifting, indoor soccer, tether balls, pool tables, games and a playroom. The Center
plans to provide arts and crafts and cooking and baking classes, and will sponsor a drum and drill
team. Programs and services are available only to members of the Tribe or their descendents.
Parks Planning and the Parks Master Plan
A fundamental component to parks planning is to assess the needs of the community. A local
needs analysis should take into account the particular demographic characteristics of the City’s
residents and visitors, and should be adjusted for any opportunities or limitations that exist or
may occur in the future. The main objective is to identify areas where parks are needed and to
develop definitive standards and policies for meeting the desired conditions.
The City of Banning’s Parks and Recreation Master Plan was prepared in 1990. It included needs
assessment based on the City’s 1990 population and demographics, and projected growth over a
five-year period. Recreation service areas were identified. In addition to the park unit
                                                                                 Community Development
                                                                                                    III-90

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
classifications described above, the Master Plan identified a need for one additional category,
Special Events facilities. Dysart Park, described above, provides special events facilities for
equestrian events.
The Quimby Act (Government Code Section 66477) allows local governments to adopt an
ordinance to require the dedication of land or payment of fees for park and recreational purposes.
The dedication of lands and payments of in-lieu fees are specifically directed toward the
provision of park and recreation areas, and are applied as a condition of approval of a tentative
tract or parcel map. In addition to single-family home subdivisions, the City can also consider in-
lieu fees for additional parks in non-subdivision related development such as apartment
complexes. The Quimby Act further states that the amount of land dedicated, or fees paid, is to
be based on residential densities resulting from approval of a tentative subdivision map or
residential development plan. Quimby Act fees can be used for the purchase of land, but may not
be used for improvements or maintenance of parks. Although the City had a Quimby Ordinance
in place at one time, it has since been repealed. A Parkland Development Fee is currently
imposed on development projects in the City. However, the Quimby Act allows only for the
purchase of lands to be used for parks, and can be implemented separately from a Parkland
Development Fee.
The City’s Parks Master Plan establishes a population/acreage ratio standard for parkland within
the planning area of 5 acres per thousand. The City’s population, based on California Department
of Finance 2003 estimates, is 25,500. Using the City’s standard of 5 acres of parkland per
thousand population, the City currently needs a total of 128+ acres of parks. It currently owns
approximately 64 acres of developed parks, and approximately 161 acres of undeveloped
parklands. At buildout utilizing this recommended standard, with a total population of 70,101,
the City will need 351 acres of parkland in the current City limits, 35 acres in the current sphere
of influence, and 25 acres in the current planning area, for a total of 411 acres.
The Plan provides standards for recreation service areas for distribution, size and service radii for
neighborhood, community, mini and special parks, and for play fields. These standards are
adapted from sources that include the Urban Land Institute, NRPA Standards, and American
Society of Landscape Architects for facility and space standards.

Land Acquisition and Funding Mechanisms
In addition to the Quimby Act, there is legislation to help cities acquire and preserve areas for
recreational use. Although funding for the acquisition of additional parkland can be difficult for
many cities, there are statewide programs to help facilitate parkland financing. The following
discussion provides a summary of these options.
Development Impact Fees – apply only to new development and may only be assessed for new
capital costs related to the new development where a defined beneficiary relationship to cost can
be established. Within these limitations, Park Facility fees may be established for all land uses
under the premise that residents, workers, shoppers and tourists use City Parks.
Development Agreements – are contracts between the City and a developer that outline in detail
the responsibilities of each party, resulting in a commitment to the developer of vested rights to
subdivide and develop. With development agreements, the developer is assured the right to
develop in exchange for negotiated exactions, which can include parks or park fees.
The above funding mechanisms are private development project-specific and stem directly from
project development. Other funding sources stem from individual proposed projects. They
include:
•   Mello Roos Districts
•   Benefit Assessment Districts
•   General Obligation Bonds
•   Adopt-A-Park
•   Special Tax Revenues & Redevelopment Agency Funding
Park Development and Funding Mechanisms
Funding for development of parklands the City has already acquired is also available through
federal and state programs and legislation. Following is a brief discussion of some these
programs.
Land and Water Conservation Fund Grants is a federal program to provide assistance to states
and local jurisdictions in preparation of Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plans
(SCORPs) and acquisition and development of outdoor recreation areas and facilities for the
general public. Grant funds may be used for development of outdoor recreation projects and
support facilities. Funds are allocated to states and may be used for statewide planning. Funds
allocated to California are administered by the State Liaison Officer (SLO), who is the Director
of the State Department of Parks and Recreation. Application for these grants is made through
the California Department of Parks and Recreation, Office of Grants and Local Services.
Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) is a federal program for the development of
viable urban communities. Cities develop their own programs and funding priorities. Projects for
which funds may be used include, but are not limited to, acquisition, rehabilitation or
construction of certain public works facilities and improvements, economic development, and
certain public services, with some restrictions
                                                                            Community Development
                                                                                              III-92

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Program matching grant funds (50 percent federal/50
percent local) are for the development of local park and recreation system recovery plans.
Rehabilitation grant funds (70 percent federal/30 percent local) are for the purpose of rebuilding,
remodeling, or expanding existing facilities. Innovation grants are matching grants (70 percent
federal/30 percent local) to cover costs of personnel, facilities, equipment, supplies or services
designed to demonstrate innovative and cost effective ways to enhance park and recreation
opportunities at the neighborhood level.
In addition to these federal programs, the State of California has also enacted legislation to assist
local jurisdictions with acquisition and development of parklands. These include:
The Urban Park Act of 2001 – to finance the acquisition and development of parks, recreation
areas, and facilities in neighborhoods currently least served by park and recreation providers.
California Clean Water, Clean Air, Safe Neighborhood Parks, and Coastal Protection Act
(Proposition 40) – this legislation funds the following Resources Bonds to fund park
improvements and enhance recreational programs:
•    State Urban Parks and Healthy Communities Program
•    Youth Soccer and Recreation Development Program
TRAILS, PATHS & BIKEWAYS
Bikeways, trails and pathways are an important recreational and community resource. A
complete network of bikeways and pathways within an urban environment helps to reduce the
reliance on cars, and contribute to a healthier city. By situating bikeways and pedestrian
pathways in central locations, communities can create an entire network of alternative
transportation, enabling residents and visitors to walk or bike to any destination. Biking and
pedestrian access helps to promote a sense of community by encouraging people to interact and
enjoy the amenities within the City.
Hiking trails provide access to areas within a natural setting, and an escape from the noise and
stress of the urban environment. Hiking allows people to take pleasure in, and gain appreciation
for, an area’s natural resources and open space lands. It also provides a rejuvenating and
energizing experience that is mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually rewarding. A local
trails system creates a recreational setting that offers many benefits to the community.
Bikeways
Bicycle facilities are identified in I, II, or III classifications.
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                 III-93

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
The Class I bikeway is a bicycle path that is completely separated from a roadway or highway,
and is often in the form of a combined pedestrian and bicycle pathway.
Class II bikeways are signed and striped bicycle lanes within the paved section of the street.
Class II bicycle ways provide a restricted right-of-way, with through travel by motorists or
pedestrians prohibited, but with cross flows of pedestrian and motor traffic permitted.
Class III bikeways are designated but unmarked bike routes that are located on the street amidst
vehicular traffic.
There are currently no bikeways within the planning area. Several Class II and III bikeways have
been proposed along City streets. However, development of a network of bikeways is
constrained by the existing condition of street right-of-ways. This issue is further addressed in
the Traffic and Circulation Element.
Hiking Trails
Hiking trails are another valuable recreational resource that offers many benefits to the
community. A trails system creates a recreational setting that offers opportunities to explore open
space, learn about wildlife habitats and other natural systems, and to escape the regular routine of
urban life. In the planning area, the most hiking trails are located in the outlying areas in the hills
and mountains that surround the region. The beauty of these open spaces entices residents and
visitors to experience their scenery on foot. Outside of parklands, trails and associated open
space are not to be counted as community park acreage.
The open space areas within the planning area that maintain hiking trails and facilities include
the San Bernardino National Forest and the San Jacinto Mountains. Other than trails that occur in
the San Bernardino National Forest, there are limited hiking trails in the planning area. A short
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                  III-94
                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
urban trail segment occurs in the City’s southern area near Sunset Avenue and Westward
Avenue. Another section occurs between Aspen and Mountain Avenues north of US-Interstate
10. These segments constitute minimally developed portions of a proposed trail system shown in
the City’s Parks and Recreation Master Plan. The system as proposed would provide access from
parks, city streets, and the surrounding community via urban, foothill and wash/hill trails.
Several unmapped equestrian trails occur in the vicinity of the Smith Creek park site. Further,
several equestrian trails are proposed within private subdivisions that have been approved for
development, or are currently being reviewed.
Two regional trails are also planned or proposed through portions of the northern and eastern
planning area, in conjunction with the Western Riverside County Multiple-Species Habitat
Conservation Plan (MSHCP). The MSHCP is further discussed below.
Trail System Costs
The costs to develop a trail system can be significant when considering land or right-of-way
acquisition, trail construction and continuing operation and maintenance. Therefore, it is
important to secure the use of appropriate and cost-free easements from public and private
landowners whenever possible. Taking into consideration construction costs alone, the average
costs, based on the estimations of open space agencies in California and the United States are
$50,000 to $80,000 for a paved trail, and $6,000 to $15,000 per mile for an unpaved trail. These
costs include the construction of directly related facilities that may be required for a given trail,
including signage, parking lots, bridges and wash crossings, landscaping, fencing and rest
stations. Costs of land acquisition can vary significantly depending on the value of lands for
other uses.
Funding Programs and Mechanisms
A variety of funding mechanisms and other methods are available to secure rights of way, and to
construct and maintain these facilities. These include but are not limited to developer impact
fees, dedication of easements and rights-of-way, monies from the Local Transportation Fund,
Adopt-A-Trail programs, donated labor and materials, and granted conservation easements.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Currently the City of Banning has approximately 64 acres of developed parklands, and 160 acres
of lands that are undeveloped or are currently being developed for parks. The total 224 acres of
parklands currently owned by the City is sufficient to satisfy its current standard of 5 acres of
parkland per 1,000 population. The City should focus on identifying and pursuing funding
sources for the development of parklands it currently owns. Development of Smith Creek Park
should be a priority, as it would provide the City and region enhanced recreational facilities, but
also provide for economic development opportunities.
The City’s park system has largely developed around the core of residential and commercial
development, which has primarily occurred along US Interstate-10. As the City’s northern
planning area continues to develop, the City should explore the acquisition of lands, or joint use
                                                                              Community Development
                                                                                                III-95

                                                                                     City of Banning
                                                                                        General Plan
of existing facilities, to promote the development of parks in areas of the City where parklands
do not currently exist.
The City should also focus on creating bikeways and pedestrian pathways along the City’s
arterial streets. An extensive biking and pedestrian network will provide a much-needed
recreational facility for the City and the region. The network should be linked to important
locations within the community to decrease the dependence on vehicles and to create a more
healthy and livable City.

HOUSING ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The Housing Element of the General Plan is a comprehensive statement by the City of Banning of its
current and future housing needs and proposed actions to facilitate the provision of housing to meet
those needs at all income levels. The policies contained in this Element are an expression of the
statewide housing goal of "attaining decent housing and a suitable living environment for every
California family," as well as a reflection of the unique concerns of the community. The purpose of
the Housing Element is to establish specific goals, policies and objectives relative to the provision of
housing, and to adopt an action plan toward this end. In addition, the Element identifies and
analyzes housing needs, and resources and constraints to meeting these needs.
The Banning Housing Element is based on four strategic goals: 1) creating housing opportunities for
current and future residents, 2) neighborhood preservation and improvement of the housing stock, 3)
environmental sensitivity and compatibility of new development, and 4) equal housing opportunity.
One of the City’s highest priorities is to improve the large number of older housing units in the
City’s that are substandard. Much of the City’s available housing funding will be directed to
programs that address this need. At the same time, Banning recognizes the need for additional
housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households as the population grows and to
accommodate existing residents who do not have suitable, affordable housing.
In accordance with State law, the Housing Element is to be consistent and compatible with other
General Plan Elements. Additionally, Housing Elements are to provide clear policy and direction for
making decisions pertaining to zoning, subdivision approval, housing allocations, and capital
improvements. State law (Government Code Sections 65580 through 65589) mandates the contents
of the housing element. By law, the Housing Element must contain:
•    An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to
    meeting those needs;
•    A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies relevant to the
    maintenance, improvement and development of housing; and
•    A program that sets forth a five-year schedule of actions that the local government is
    undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the goals and
    objectives of the Housing Element.
•    The housing program must also identify adequate residential sites available for a variety of
    housing types for all income levels; assist in developing adequate housing to meet the needs of
    low- and moderate-income households; address governmental constraints to housing
    maintenance, improvement, and development; conserve and improve the condition of the
    existing affordable housing stock; and promote housing opportunities for all persons.
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                 III-1 0 2

                                                                                         City Of Banning
                                                                                             General Plan
EVALUATION OF PRIOR HOUSING ELEMENT
The City of Banning has had many difficulties in implementing its housing program goals
throughout the last ten years. These difficulties can be greatly attributed to staffing shortages. The
community development department was lacking the staff needed to realize the housing program
goals and the Redevelopment Agency did not have a specific person assigned until January 2000.
The City has been catching up in the last year and has made strong head way in starting to
implement several programs as noted below. The Redevelopment Agency has implemented several
programs and is diligently working within the community. Unfortunately, the Redevelopment
Agency relied heavily on the Banning Partners for a Revitalized Community (BPRC) to implement
many of the programs listed in the Housing Element. Since the BPRC has been inactive for the last
year, many programs have been discontinued. The Agency is looking to other non-profit
organizations to implement the programs.
For each program, the program text is reproduced below, along with the text of the program goal.
The evaluation of each program follows that statement of program goals.
1. Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation/Banning Partners for a Revitalized Community:
 The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC) is a nonprofit corporation authorized by
congress to encourage neighborhood revitalization for the benefit of current residents. The NRC
assists residents of neighborhoods in which the housing stock is deteriorating, and where there is a
substantial degree of homeownership, to form Neighborhood Housing Services Programs (NHS).
Each NHS is a locally initiated and funded private non-profit corporation governed by a working
partnership of residents, business leaders, and government representatives. The NRC provides a
$30,000 grant to each NHS developing and maintaining the NHS. A small NHS staff operates from
an office located in the neighborhood and provides a variety of housing services including
rehabilitation counseling; construction monitoring; financial counseling; community involvement.
     Program Goals: The goals of the BPRC in relation to housing will be two fold: to facilitate
the rehabilitation of substandard structures, and to provide financial and technical assistance in the
development of affordable housing. Based on the magnitude of deteriorated housing in the
central/eastern portion of the City, the BPRC has indicated that housing rehabilitation is a high
priority (new construction goals are discussed under program 14-NON Profit Construction). Low
interest deferred loans will be offered to low and moderate income households, with a maximum
loan amount of $30,000. The specific terms of the loans will be based on the property owner’s
ability to pay. Low income overcrowded households, and households with a handicapped resident(s)
will be specifically targeted for rehabilitation assistance. In addition, the BPRC helps tenants with
their first month’s rent. While the organization had not yet adopted a specific work program, for
purposes of the Housing Element, the goal will be to rehabilitate 10 dwelling units on an annual
basis, beginning in 1991. To the extent additional monies become available, a greater number of
units will be able to be rehabilitated.
     Program Evaluation: In 1995, a Roof Loan Program was established. It was primarily funded
by BPRC and partially supplemented with a $500 grant from the Redevelopment Agency. Eligible
participants had to live within the City limits and have low or moderate incomes. In 1996 the
                                                                                 Community Development
                                                                                                 III-1 0 3

                                                                                        City Of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
Redevelopment Agency did not have available funds for the program and it was discontinued.
There are no accurate records of the number of homes assisted under this program.
     There is not a need to reestablish this program because it is included in the newly created
Exterior Rehabilitation Assistance Program. This program is more encompassing and is explained
more completely in Program Evaluation number two.
2. Home Improvement Program: The Riverside County Community Development Department
administers a Home Improvement Program to provide loans to eligible lower income families for
necessary home repair and rehabilitation work, including room additions to alleviate overcrowding.
The Program provides low interest loans, deferred payment loans, and loans for mobile-home repair.
 Cooperating cities transfer Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, and any other
targeted funding, to the County for implementation of home Improvement Programs in their
jurisdiction. The County will tailor rehabilitation programs to meet the specific needs of cooperating
cities.
     Program Goals: The City of Banning receives approximately $400,000 in CDBG funding on
an annual basis. Based on the extent of housing deterioration present in Banning, the Housing
Element recommends the City enter into a cooperative agreement with the County for
implementation of the Home Improvement Program by the end of 1991. Banning should then
commit to directing a portion of its CDBG monies toward the Home Improvement Program, with an
annual assistance goal of 10 households.
     Program Evaluation: The Redevelopment Agency established a Housing Exterior
Rehabilitation Assistance Program (ERA) to assist low and moderate-income households in
upgrading the exterior of their homes. Eligible applicants have household incomes 80% or less of the
Riverside County median. The Program provides up to $7,500 per property for improvements, such
as new roofs, paint and yard clean up. Under this program, the homeowner is required to reside in
the home for seven years. Should the homeowner not occupy the property for a contiguous thirty-
day period in one calendar year, the funds originally granted shall be returned to the Redevelopment
Agency. During the last year, one house has been completed, twelve are in process, and twelve more
are on the waiting list. The Agency will continue the ERA Program through its Five-Year
Implementation Plan for the Downtown and Midway Redevelopment Project Areas.
3. Senior Home Repair Program: In addition to the Home Improvement Program, the County of
Riverside also administers a senior home repair program. This program provides grants of up to
$500 to low-income senior citizens for minor home maintenance needs. The grant covers the cost of
materials; labor is provided free of charge.
     Program Goals: The City of Banning will continue to cooperate with the County of Riverside
for programs implementation, and contribute financially to the program. Based on the significant
number of senior citizen households.
     Program Evaluation: Currently it provides up to $500 to low/moderate income seniors for
repair of identified health and safety concerns in their residence. In 1995 the program committed
and expended $63,107. Those funds assisted 212 very-low income and 16 low-income seniors. In
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                III-1 0 4
                                                                                       City Of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
1996 the Program was discontinued due to lack of available funds. Senior home repair needs can be
accommodated under the ERA program, but the overall funding level may exceed the demand.
4. Rental Rehabilitation Program: In addition to the CDBG funded rehabilitation programs for
single-family homes, the County also operates a separately funded Rental Rehabilitation Program to
encourage rehabilitation of substandard apartment buildings or single-family homes used as rental
Through the Rental Rehab Program, the County offers up to 50% deferred loan to pay towards the
total cost of a rehabilitation project, with the balance financed through a 6% interest rate loan. To
qualify for a Rental Rehab subsidy, more than 70% of the building’s tenants must be low or
moderate income.
     Program Goals: This program can provide needed rehabilitation assistance to rental properties
in Banning’s older neighborhoods. In order to expand its usage, the City should contribute CDBG
and/or redevelopment set aside funds as needed to assist property owners in obtaining funding for 50
percent matching fund requirement. The goal of this program is to achieve rehabilitation of five
units annually.
     Program Evaluation: The availability of funding to Banning under the County’s Rental Rehab
Program (now called the “Multi-Family Rehab Program”) was discontinued for an unknown reason.
 Attempts to contact the Riverside County Economic Development Agency to determine the reasons
for discontinuing funding under this program have not been successful. Because the rehabilitation of
substandard multi-family housing will be an on-going need in Banning, the City will include the
Multi-Family Rehab Program among the menu of funding options that it will seek to implement the
updated Housing Element if the City determines that it can qualify for this source of County funding.
5. Code Enforcement: The objective of the City’s code enforcement program is to bring
substandard housing units into compliance with City codes. Potential code violations are identified
based on complaints reported to the City, and often through property maintenance inspections. If the
structure appears unsound, a City building official will schedule a meeting to inspect the residence
and prepare a written notice as to any existing deficiencies. The property owner is given a
reasonable time frame in which to respond, and is given extra time if progress is demonstrated.
     Program Goals: The City will continue its sensitive enforcement of residential Building codes,
and will expand the program to inform property owners in violation of City codes of any
rehabilitation assistance he/she may be eligible for in correcting code violations.
     Program Evaluation: While the City notifies residents of non-compliance with the Building
codes, they have not expanded the program to include information of possible rehabilitation
assistance. The City has been understaffed and unable to train available staff to know the County
assistance programs. If residents specifically ask about assistance, they are referred directly to the
County.
6. Purchase of Abandoned Homes: In order to upgrade and revitalize blighted neighborhoods
and deteriorated residential units, the City of Banning Redevelopment Agency will purchase
abandoned homes and provide necessary rehabilitation.
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                               III-1 0 5

                                                                                       City Of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
     Program Goals: Assist in the rehabilitation of 3-5 units per year.
     Program Evaluation: In 1995, the Redevelopment Agency worked with Banning Partners for
a Revitalized Community (BPRC) and Apollo Construction in developing a HOME Grant
Application. The application proposed to purchase, rehabilitate and then sell abandoned and/or
troubled single family properties to first time homebuyers. The concept of the Program was to
purchase homes using HOME Program funds and then rehabilitate them using a portion of Agency
dollars. The Program application was approved and was active for a two-year period. In 1995, the
Program committed $61,866 and expended $10,110. During that year, they purchased two homes,
rehabilitated one home and sold it to a family with children, and was in the process of completing
another. Unfortunately, however, the Program was not as busy in 1997 because of a restructuring of
BPRC and change in the partnership involving Apollo Construction. No new units were rehabilitated
in that year. Because of the currently dormant BPRC, this program has been discontinued.
     Although this particular program is no longer available, the Redevelopment Agency purchased
four homes in 2000 through a HUD program. This is a key program that has great potential for
saving and rehabilitating existing housing stock for affordable housing needs. The Agency is
attempting to partner with either the local chapter of National Habitat for Humanity or another non-
profit organization to work together in restoring these homes.
7. Land Use Element/Zoning Ordinance: Planning and Regulatory actions to achieve adequate
housing sites offering a range of housing types and styles include the Land Use Element of the
General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance. A variety of residential types is provided for in Banning
ranging from one to 24 dwelling units per acre, with higher densities achievable through density
bonus provisions. The residential development capacity under the Banning Land Use Plan is
adequate to meet the City’s share of regional housing needs, which have been identified as 3,518
dwelling units though July 1994.
     Program Evaluation: Between 1990 and 2000, 1,573 dwelling units were approved by
building permit in Banning. Of these units:
    •   1,330 (85%) were single-family detached homes at densities between 0.5 and 6 dwelling
        units per acre (typical densities of 4 – 5 units/acre). Typical prices for these homes (high
        $90,000s to mid $100,000s) were affordable to households earning 80% or more of the
        Riverside County median income.
    •   142 were housing units in two-unit structures (primarily duplexes) that are estimated to be
        affordable to households earning 65% or more of the Riverside County median income
        (based on recent rents for these types of units).
    •   92 were housing units in structures of five units or more (rental apartments) that were
        estimated to be affordable to households earning 50% or more of the Riverside County
        median income.
    •   9 dwelling units were mobilehomes that were estimated to be affordable to households
        earning 50% or more of the Riverside County median income.
    •   There are ample opportunities for development of various types of residential housing within
        the City on vacant and unimproved sites.
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                               III-1 0 6

                                                                                        City Of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
8. Site Suitability Criteria: Low and moderate-income housing development should be located
on sites, which are not only physically adequate but also suitable for such development. These aims
 can be facilitated by having a set of “site suitability criteria” by which to judge the merits of
potential project sites. These criteria will provide a yardstick for the City to identify and evaluate
potential sites for low and moderate cost housing. Criteria for affordable housing could be
implemented through the City’s Zoning Ordinance.
     In establishing its own criteria, the City should consider those already set forth by other
jurisdictions, including the State and Federal governments. Criteria for grading the suitability of
sites may include the following:
    •   Services available to the Site (e.g., public transportation essential shopping facilities,
        education facilities, etc.)
    •   Neighborhood Characteristics (e.g., adjacent land uses, proximity to employment
        opportunities, environmental consideration, noise levels, etc.).
    •   Physical Aspects of the Site (e.g., topography, off-site improvements, etc.).
     The City will develop its own criteria for incorporation into the Zoning Ordinance. The City’s
intent in adopting and implementing the criteria is not to be more restrictive than other levels of
government.
     Program Evaluation: While the City did not incorporate specific criteria into the Zoning
Ordinance regarding site suitability of affordable housing projects, there are general procedures
available within the Design Review Article. These general procedures seem to have been sufficient
in aiding the City to evaluate appropriate sites.
9. Sites for Homeless Shelters/Transitional Housing: The City of Banning has an estimated
homeless population of up to ten persons at any given time. Based on Banning’s location astride a
major interstate highway, combined with the railway, which runs through the City, Banning receives
a number of individuals and families who become stranded as a result of transportation difficulties.
While the City contributes to a local coalition of churches (HELP) to assist in providing services to
area homeless persons, including motel vouchers, there remains an unmet need for emergency
shelter in the community.
     Housing Element policy calls for the City to continue to coordinate with local social service
providers, such as local churches, to address the needs of the homeless. In addition, the City will
amend its Zoning Ordinance to permit the development of transitional housing in multi-family
residential zones in locations close to services, and to permit emergency shelters in commercial and
industrial zones, subject to Conditional Use Permit. These Zoning Ordinances revisions will be
made by the close of 1991.
     Program Evaluation: Although the City did not amend its Zoning Ordinance to permit
homeless shelters or transitional housing in multi-family residential zones, the City has continued
with its motel vouchers program. There is insufficient data available to appropriately evaluate the
success of this program. However, it is known that eight individuals and three families used motel
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                III-1 0 7

                                                                                         City Of Banning
                                                                                             General Plan
vouchers between 1994-1995, three individuals used them between 1995-1996, and seven used them
between 1996-1997.
10. Section 8 Rental Assistance Payment/Housing Vouchers: The Section 8 rental assistance
program extends rental subsides to low-income families and elderly which spend more than 30
percent of their income on rent. The subsidy represents the difference between the excess of 30
percent of the monthly income and the actual rent. The vouchers program is similar to Section 8
Program, although participants receive housing. Unlike in the certificate program, participants are
permitted to rent units beyond the federally determined fair market rent in an area, provided the
tenant pays the extra rent increment. Rental assistance not only addresses housing affordability, but
also overcrowding by allowing families, which may be “coupling up” to afford their own housing.
     Program Goals: It is impossible to know how many additional housing vouchers the City will
actually receive from HUD. However, based on previous allocation levels, the City’s goal will be to
secure an additional five rental subsidies annually. The City can facilitate use of Section 8 program
in jurisdiction by encouraging apartment owners to list available rental units with the County
Housing Authority for potential occupancy by tenants receiving Section 8 certificates.
     Program Evaluation: The Redevelopment Agency has continually worked with the Riverside
County Housing Authority in administering Section 8 assistance. The City has no control over the
administration of this program and can only use it as a resource in which to refer residents. It is
unknown how many families the County have supported, however, Westview Terrace, a 75-unit
multi-family complex, currently participates in HUD's Section 8 program. Currently, the Housing
Authority reports 286 families waiting for Section 8 vouchers. There are currently 70 vouchers
issued to the residents of Banning, the Countywide waiting list for people to receive vouchers is
about 22,000, it is unknown how many of them are from the Banning area.
11. Density Bonus: Pursuant to State density bonus law, if a developer allocates at least 20% of
the units in a housing project to lower income households, 10% for very low income households, or
at least 50% for “qualifying residents” (e.g. senior citizens), the City must either a) grant a density
bonus of 25%, along with one additional regulatory concession to ensure that the housing
development will be produced at a reduced cost, or b) provide other incentives of equivalent
financial value based upon the land cost per dwelling unit. Regulatory concessions may include
such items as reduction in fees, modified development standards, e.g. parking or allowances for
mixed use on a residential property. The developer shall agree to, and the City shall ensure, the
continued affordability of all lower income density bonus units for a minimum 30-year period.
     Program Goals: The goal of this program is to adopt and implement the “Density Bonuses and
Other Incentives for Lower Income and Senior Housing” ordinance by the end of 1991.
     Program Evaluation: Although the ordinance was adopted in November 1991, no developer
has taken advantage of this program. Due to the real estate market in the last 10 years, there is not a
demand for dense development. The current low land prices allow ample opportunities for housing
development. The preferred housing type is a large-lot single-family unit, not dense multi-family
homes. In addition to the current market, developers are reluctant to use the program because they
are unwilling to ensure the continued affordability of the bonus units.
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                 III-1 0 8

                                                                                       City Of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
12. Mortgage Revenue Bond Financing: The County of Riverside has established two revenue
bond housing programs to increase the supply of affordable housing in the County- the Multi-Family
Revenue Bond Program and the Single Family Residential Mortgage Revenue Bond Program.
Under these programs, tax-exempt bonds are issued to provide funds for construction and mortgage
loans to encourage developers to provide both rental and for-sale housing which is affordable to
lower income families and individuals.
     The Multi-Family Bond Program is designed to make financing available to Developers for the
construction of multi-family residential rental units in the County. In order to receive financing
through the bond program, developers must reserve for 10 years, 20 percent of the units for rental by
families income in Riverside County. In addition, for recent projects, half of the lower income units
must be reserved for occupancy on a priority basis for tenants who generally earn 50 percent or less
of the median income. Projects financed after the passage of the 1986 Tax Reform Act must commit
their 20% designated units for a period of 15 years.
     The Single Family Residential Mortgage Revenue Bond Program is designed to provide
mortgage loans to first-time homebuyers whose incomes do not exceed maximum Federal limits.
Buyers must also intend to live in the homes as their principal residence. Mortgage loans offered
under the bond program generally have lower interest rates than conventional loans. Loans are made
available for attached and detached single-family residences primarily in eligible developments at
various locations throughout the County.
     Programs Goals: Bonds provide a cost-effective mechanism the City can utilize to promote
affordable ownership and/or rental opportunities. The City’s participation in bond financing can be
limited to sponsoring programs and funding administrative costs. A future goal of one bond-funded
housing projects has been established for the five-year period of this Housing Element.
     Program Evaluation: The Redevelopment Agency authorized Mortgage Revenue Bonds to
provide low-interest mortgages for homebuyers in the City’s Sun Lakes Development located in The
Highland Springs Redevelopment Project Area in 1997. The mortgage program was terminated
shortly thereafter because of the inactivity of the Highland Springs Redevelopment Project Area.
13. Mortgage Credit Certificate Program: The County of Riverside has initiated a mortgage
credit certificate program for first time homebuyers. Through the program, qualifying households
receive a 20% credit on their annual home mortgage interest payments over the life of the mortgage.
     Program Goals: The City of Banning should maintain its cooperative agreement with the
County for the mortgage credit certificate program and should assist the County in advertising the
program through distribution of program brochures to local realtors and residential sales offices.
Program Evaluation: The City has maintained its cooperative agreement with the County and has
advertised the program by distributing pamphlets in appropriate sites throughout the city. The
County has not issued any certificates within the last two years, but continues to initiate yearly
public meetings within the City to inform residents of available programs.
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                               III-1 0 9

                                                                                        City Of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
14. Shared Housing: Many seniors who would prefer to live independently resort to
institutionalized living arrangements because of security problems, loneliness, or an inability to live
entirely independently. The shared housing programs operated by the County assists low income
individuals 18 years of age and older in locating roommates to share existing housing in the
community; the majority of the program’s applicants are senior citizens. Services offered include
information and referral, outreach, client counseling, placement and follow-up.
      Program Goals: The City of Banning should assist the County in advertising the shared
housing program through placement of program brochures in key locales throughout the community.
 The quantified objective of this program is to achieve 10 roommate matches on an annual basis in
Banning.
      Program Evaluation: The Redevelopment Agency does not have any brochures regarding the
County’s services and needs to acquire some for distribution. The City has not maintained records
regarding the number of matches achieved under this program. Because this program requires a
relatively modest effort to address an important need in the community, the City has decided to
continue this program. A higher level of achievement could result with increasing marketing and
public awareness of the program.
15. Nonprofit Construction: A non-profit housing corporation works to develop, conserve and
promote affordable housing, either owner or renter-occupied. Particularly in relation to senior
citizens housing (such as HUD Section 202 projects), the non-profit is often a local religious
organization interested in developing affordable housing. The non-profit is often involved with what
is called “assisted housing”, where some type of government assistance (such as Section 8) is
provided to the individual household to keep rents affordable.
      Program Goals: The BPRC will help meet the City’s goals for additional affordable housing
by implementing or assisting with the implementation of new construction projects. The City will
facilitate the creation of affordable housing in two regards: a) through continued financial support of
the BPRC; and b) through development standards, and density increases. Given this City assistance,
the BPRC has established an annual new construction goal of six units affordable to low income
households, and ten units affordable to moderate income households.
Program Evaluation: The BPRC is not currently active and this program has not been utilized. No
other non-profit or for-profit developers have expressed interest in constructing affordable housing
units. In place of constructing new housing, the Redevelopment Agency has looked to other means
to create affordable housing units. HUD repossessed four dilapidated homes in 2000 that had not
sold on the market and sold them to the City. The homes need major improvements and the City is
looking to partner with a non-profit organization to make the necessary repairs. Once rehabilitated,
the homes will be available to low-income families.
16. Assisted Affordable Housing Development: The City’s Redevelopment Agency will work
with non-profit and for profit developers to assist in the construction of low and moderate income
housing.
      Program Goals: To assist in the construction of 10-20 low to moderate income housing units
per year.
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                III-1 1 0

                                                                                       City Of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
      Program Evaluation: The Homebuyers Assistance Program was eliminated in 1995 because
of reductions in funds in the agency tax increment allocations and the priority of other Programs.
Although the Program was eliminated, a Five-Year Implementation Plan (1999-2004) for the
Downtown and Midway Redevelopment Project Areas has been adopted. A portion of the Plan calls
for a cooperative effort between the Redevelopment Agency and a local chapter of Habitat for
Humanity. The Redevelopment Agency will explore opportunities to construct affordable housing
with the non-profit housing developer.
17. Zoning Ordinance: The City of Banning had developed a comprehensive Zoning Ordinance to
implement its General Plan. The following regulations in the City’s Municipal Code facilitate the
conservation and development of affordable housing:
     •   Provisions for specific plans which provide for flexibility in density and mix of land uses
     •   Provisions for manufactured housing and mobile home development in single-family zones
     •   Provisions for second units on single-family lots
     •   Provisions for reduced parking requirements for senior citizens housing projects
     •   Provisions for residential uses in the downtown commercial district.
      Program Goals: While many development regulations have a positive effect on affordable
housing, some regulations do add to the cost of development. The goal of this program is to amend
the Banning Municipal Code as necessary to consolidate and simplify, and ensure City standards are
not excessive.
      Program Evaluation: Ordinance 811, An Ordinance of The City of Banning establishing a
Specific Plan Development Zone for Implementing Approved Specific Plans was adopted on
November 8, 1982.
      Provisions for manufactured housing and mobile home development in single-family zones
have been in place since 1983.
      Secondary Units were included in the Zoning Ordinance in 1993. They are allowed, pursuant to
a conditional use permit, in the R-1, R-1-70, R-2, and R-3 zones. These units are zoned for use only
by the family members of the property owners, and are not available for rent by the general public.
It is important to note that although these units are not intended to address the affordable rental
housing needs, they actually have a potential to do so. Family members may utilize the additional
unit for a living space when they otherwise would have been forced to look for housing elsewhere,
increasing the demand for affordable housing. Although secondary units have been conditionally
permitted since 1993, there have been no requests to build them.
      In 1998, the Zoning Ordinance was amended to include subsidized senior housing parking
provisions. The parking provisions apply to any rental housing development constructed with
assistance from federal or state housing subsidy programs for lower income senior citizens. The
parking requirements were reduced from 2 to 1.25 covered parking spaces per unit, provided that the
remaining .75 space is landscaped or developed as a recreational area.
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                               III-1 1 1

                                                                                         City Of Banning
                                                                                             General Plan
     The Downtown Commercial Zone District was amended in 1996 to include provisions for two
specific types of residential uses within this area, pursuant to a conditional use permit. The two
types of uses are single-family structures (when attached to a commercial building and used for the
living quarters of the owner, manager, or operator of the adjoining commercial use) and multiple
family dwelling complexes.
18. Efficient Processing: The evaluation and review process required by the City procedures
contributes to the cost of housing costs incurred by developers are ultimately reflected in the unit’s
selling price. In order to minimize project holding costs, jurisdictions should streamline their review
procedures to the greatest extent possible and without compromising adequate review.
     Program Goals: In light of the magnitude of development applications received by the City,
project review times cannot realistically be further reduced. The Housing Element does however
recommend the City establish priority review processing for affordable housing projects.
     Program Evaluation: The City has not adopted specific procedures giving priority review
processing for affordable housing projects. However, the City is considering specific actions in the
updated Housing Element for priority permit processing.
19. Development Fees: Various fees and assessments are charged by the City to cover the costs of
processing permits and providing services and facilities. While almost all these fees are assessed on
a pro rata share system, they often contribute to the cost of housing and constrain the development of
lower priced units. Certain fees could be waived or subsidized by the City for the provision of lower
income and senior citizens housing.
     Program Goals: The goal of this program is to review City fees to see if waiver or subsidy by
the City may be beneficial for the provision of affordable and senior citizens housing. Based on the
outcome of this review, the City may adopt an ordinance establishing a modified fee schedule for
affordable and senior citizen projects.
     Program Evaluation: The City has reviewed its fees and although they have not adopted an
ordinance modifying the fee schedule for affordable and senior citizen projects, opportunities to
lessen fees are available through the Redevelopment Agency. The City’s fees are considerably
lower than other comparable cities within the County. One option available to the City is to
potentially utilize Redevelopment Agency set-aside fees to help pay for development fees.
20. Equal Housing Opportunity Services: The County of Riverside established the New
Horizons’ Fair Housing Program which provides a broad range of services such as: education on
fair housing laws, referrals to public agencies on discrimination matters, coordination of training
work shops, and publishing a newsletter on fair housing activities. The activities also include news
and rental agencies. The Fair Housing Division provides assistance to the housing industry in
voluntary affirmative marketing programs, shows, and conventions. The establishment of a Fair
Housing Program with goals, and objectives and the participation of other responsible agencies of
the County, attains implementation of various strategies, to increase availability of housing to low
and moderate-income families and individuals through advocacy and non-discriminatory policies.
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                 III-1 1 2

                                                                                         City Of Banning
                                                                                             General Plan
     Program Goals: The County’s Fair Housing Program will expand its present structure to
incorporate the Community Housing Resource Board (CHRB) program component. The CHRB is
designed to work with the real estate and building industry to implement and monitor the activities
of the National Voluntary Affirmative Marketing Agreement (VAMA), in the areas of rental, sales,
advertising, training and recruitment. The qualification of program achievement can only be
measured through the settlement of disputes and the prevention of resident dislocation, loss of
occupied units, and stabilized vacancy factors as a result of the efforts of the Fair Housing Program.
     Program Evaluation: The Redevelopment Agency incorporates equal opportunities for
housing into their services within the city. If there are complaints or legal owner-tenant questions,
residents are referred to The Fair Housing Council of Riverside County. The Council is a non-profit
organization who provides comprehensive services addressing and promoting fair housing, including
those services formerly provided by the CHRB. According the Riverside Housing Authority during
the 1999-2000 fiscal year, residents of Banning filed three Housing Discrimination Complains and
an estimated 120 Landlord Tenant complaints. The City believes that the Council is the most

Quantified Objectives
One of the requirements of state law (California Government Code, Section 65583[b]) is that the
Housing Element contains quantified objectives for the maintenance, preservation, improvement,
and development of housing. State law recognizes that the total housing needs identified by a
community may exceed available resources and the community's ability to satisfy this need. Under
these circumstances, the quantified objectives need not be identical to the total housing needs. The
quantified objectives shall establish the maximum number of housing units by income category that
can be constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved over a five-year time period, however. Because the
SCAG Regional Housing Needs Assessment Plan covers a 7½-year period, the objectives for
designating sites new construction cover the period January 1, 1998 to June 30, 2005. The
objectives for preservation and conservation cover the period July 1, 2000 to June 30, 2005.

Consistency with other General Plan Elements
State law requires the Housing Element contain a statement of “the means by which consistency will
be achieved with other general plan elements and community goals” (California Government Code,
Section 65583[c][6][B]). There are two aspects of this analysis: 1) an identification of other
General Plan goals, policies, and programs that could affect implementation of the Housing Element
or that could be affected by the implementation of the Housing Element, and 2) an identification of
actions to ensure consistency between the Housing Element and affected parts of other General Plan
elements.
The City will ensure consistency between the Housing Element and other General Plan policies
through the following actions in the Housing Element:
•        Maintain the current pattern of residential development, primarily single-family, with an
    emphasis on protecting single-family neighborhoods.
•        Accommodate other housing types in appropriate areas through multifamily zoning,
    allowance of manufactured housing in single-family zones (including mobilehome parks),
    multifamily housing in transitional zones (between commercial and single-family) and along
    arterial streets, second units, and mixed-use structures in downtown commercial areas.
•        Implement minimum standards for lot size and residential design that permit flexibility but
    ensure compatibility with surrounding residential uses.
•        Preserve the existing housing stock by permitting and assisting rehabilitation and
    reconstruction of dwelling units.
Public Participation
As part of the Housing Element update process, the Banning Planning Department and
Redevelopment Agency conducted a public outreach process that consisted of public notices posted
in accessible locations, published notices in the local press, information distributed to individuals
and organizations community wide, a public workshop, and public hearings. The City made efforts
to include all segments of the community in the public outreach process by contacting known
organizations with an interest in housing issues, notifying individuals in the community who have
expressed an interest in housing issues, broadcasting public proceedings on the local cable access
television station, and distributing notices and documents to public institutions that are accessible
throughout the City. All public proceedings were conducted at City Hall, which is accessible to
individuals with handicaps.
Specific public events related to the Housing Element included:
•        A citywide public workshop to discuss findings, key issues, and proposed policies,
    conducted at Banning City Hall on September 28, 2000.
•        A Planning Commission public hearing on the draft Housing Element, conducted at Banning
    City Hall on November 7, 2000.

HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Population Characteristics
Population Trends
Banning’s population increased by nearly half (47 percent) between 1980 and 1990, from 14,020 to
20,570. Between 1990 and January 1, 2000, the City’s population grew by just over two percent
annually (26 percent total), to 26,000. Although rapid by southern California standards, Banning’s
population growth was still below the Riverside Countywide rate of 67 percent during the 1980s.
Banning’s population is still growing, but only two percent annually. Annual population growth
should remain at this more modest level through build-out. Table III-22 compares the City’s
population in 1980, 1990, and 2000.
                                                Table III-22
                                     Banning Population Growth
    1980                              1990                                2000
    14,020                            20,570                              26,000
   Sources: 1990 U.S. Census Bureau; California Department of Finance, Reports E-4 and E-5.
Since 1990, the number of households in Banning has increased more slowly than the population—
about 19 percent from 7,431 to 8,845,compared to the 26 percent population growth; this suggests
that the average household size has increased over the past decade. By 2005, the number of
households is expected to increase by another 14 percent, to 11,097 (Southern California
Association of Governments [SCAG] Regional Growth Forecast 2000). According to the U.S.
Census Bureau, the average household size in 1990 was 2.72, compared to 2.90 estimated by the
California Department of Finance in 2000.
Ethnicity
The City's population in 1990 was primarily non-Hispanic White (60 percent), with comparatively
small percentages of other races and ethnicities, except for persons of Hispanic origin (22%). The
City's ethnic composition in 1990 was representative of the countywide population distribution.
However, 2000 estimates by National Decision Systems (Claritas) suggest that the percentage of
non-Hispanic Whites and persons of Hispanic origin have increased slightly in Banning since 1990,
while other racial/ethnic categories have decreased (Table III-23 below). If accurate, this estimate
suggests that demographic trends, such as predominantly non-Hispanic White seniors and working
families moving to Banning, combined with population growth among Hispanic families, have
changed the composition of the City over the past ten years. However, complete information on the
City’s racial and ethnic characteristics from the 2000 U.S. Census will probably not be available
until 2002.

Substantial racial and ethnic differences between the city, county, and state populations are outlined
below.
The percentage of persons of Hispanic origin countywide is over twice that in the City. Over one-
third of county residents described themselves as being of Hispanic origin at the time of the 1990
U.S. Census.
The percentage of persons describing themselves, as “Black” countywide was nearly three times the
citywide percentage. Statewide, the percentage of Blacks in 1990 was over four times the citywide
percentage.
A much higher percentage of residents both countywide and statewide described their racial
background as “Other” than did those in the City.
Age of Population
No one age group dominated the local Banning population after reviewing the 1990 U.S. Census and
the Claritas 1999 estimates, but children ages 5 through 19 and those age 65 and older comprised the
most significant population groups. By comparison, the County had higher percentages of young
adults between the ages of 20 and 39 and lower percentages of adults over age 65.
The 1999 estimate shows that the population distribution is about the same as in 1990, with some
gains made by the 30-39 and 40-54 age groups, and small declines for the 5-19 and 65 and older age
groups. If accurate, the 1999 age group estimate suggests that population growth and turnover
(births, deaths, and net migration) have kept the City’s age distribution relatively stable, with slightly
fewer children and a slightly higher percentage of households with middle-aged adults. (Note: The
1999 Claritas age estimate appears to conflict with the Department of Finance estimate showing an
increase in the average household size.)

Gender
With the exception of elderly single women, the City of Banning has a roughly equal distribution of
males (49 percent) and females (51 percent). U.S. Census Data (1990) revealed that there were
nearly twice as many elderly females over age 75 (1043) as elderly males (668). Fifty-seven percent
of the population age 65 and older were women and 61 percent of the population age 75 and older
were women. There were higher numbers of boys and young male adults than there were girls and
young female adults, but not to a significant degree. The substantially higher percentage of older
women than men is typical of most communities due to the longer average life span of women. A
relatively even gender mix is expected in a community where there are no large, single-gender
institutions that could skew population characteristics. Banning has a relatively low group quarters
population representing less than two percent of the population.
Household Type and Composition
Household composition is typically evaluated by comparing such factors as household size, the
percentage of family households (two or more related persons), the percentage of families with
children, the number of single parent households, and the age of householders.
Of the 7,431 households in 1990, Table III-25 shows that the highest percentage of households in
the City of Banning were two-person households (37 percent), similar to that of the County at 34
percent. Banning has a higher percentage of one- and two-person households, but a smaller
percentage of households in every other category (except seven or more persons). A larger
percentage of households countywide consist of families with children than in Banning. Since 1990,
Banning’s demographics have been significantly influenced by the development of Sun Lakes, a
senior community. This development explains, in part, the larger percentage of older adults and the
smaller number of households in the three- to six-person range than is found countywide.

In the majority of communities, most households consist of families (related individuals). To obtain
further insight about community characteristics, it is important to understand the composition of
these families (presence of children marital status, etc.). Nearly three-fourths of households in
Banning and Riverside County were family households in 1990 (72 percent and 74 percent
respectively). The 1990 U.S. Census reported that nearly one-quarter (22 percent) of all households
in the City were married-couple households, a lower percentage than countywide (Tables III- &
III- ). Family households in the County had a slightly higher percentage of stepchildren than in the
City. About 23 percent of households with children were female-headed households with no spouse,
while six percent were male-headed households with no spouse. The high percentage of single
mothers is of concern, because this population group tends to have significantly lower incomes,
higher poverty rates, and more supportive services needs than the population at-large.

Among the other differences between the City and countywide populations in 1990 were:
•        a lower percentage of married couple families with children in the City (about one-fourth of
    all households compared to about one-third countywide);
•        a higher percentage of family households without children in the City (42 percent in the City

Household Income
Households can also be characterized by their levels of income. Four income categories are
typically used for comparative purposes that are based on a percentage of the county median income
and adjusted for household size. These categories are referred to as “very low-income,” “low-
income,” “moderate-income,” and “above moderate-income.” The median income on which these
four categories are based represents the mid-point at which half of the households earn more and half
earn less. In a normally distributed population (that is, one not skewed to either end of the income
scale), approximately 40 percent of the population will have incomes within the very low- and low-
income ranges, about 20 percent within the moderate-income range, and about 40 percent in the
above moderate-income range.
Households in the very low-income category earn 50 percent or less of the Riverside County median
income. Low-income households earn between 50 percent and 80 percent of the county median
income. Moderate-income households earn between 80 percent and 120 percent of the county
median income. Above moderate-income households earn more than 120 percent of the county
median income.
Historically, Banning has been home to a high concentration of very low- and low-income
households. A comparison of incomes in Banning versus countywide in 1990 and 2000 shows that
this historical trend has continued to the present day. An analysis of households by income level
reveals that over half (57 percent) of households in the City were in the very-low and low-income
categories in 1990. This is a substantially higher percentage than the countywide level of 41 percent.
Conversely, only 43 percent of Banning households had moderate or above-moderate incomes in
1990 (less than 10 percent earned between $60,000 and $100,000). City and County income in 1989
is shown in Table III-28.
The median household income in the County in 1989 for all households was $33,081, compared to
$22,514 in the City of Banning, a 47 percent difference (1990 U.S. Census Bureau). The U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) lists the 1999 median county income for
Riverside as $47,200, while Claritas estimates the 1999 City median income at $25,811.

HUD’s countywide median income estimate for 2000 is $47,400, a slight increase from its 1999
estimate. No comparable income estimate is available for the City of Banning.
Although the presence of senior homeowners in Sun Lakes has had a influence on city incomes
(most tend to fall in the moderate-income range), their presence, by itself, has not been sufficient to
overcome the more rapid growth in incomes countywide. Many communities in Riverside County
have experienced an influx of working families with moderate- to high-paying jobs in Orange and
Los Angeles counties. Banning has been influenced primarily by the availability of lower-paying
jobs in the resort, service, retail, and gaming industries of the Coachella valley.

Poverty
According to the 1990 U.S. Census, approximately 20 percent of Banning’s population was below
the poverty level. The City has a higher percentage of people below the poverty level than either the
County (12 percent) or State (13 percent). Groups most likely to have poverty level incomes in
substantially higher proportions than the population as a whole are families with children
(particularly single mothers) and the elderly. The poverty level is defined each year by the federal
government as a dollar amount representing a subsistence level of income. The poverty level is
adjusted for household size and composition.
Approximately 45 percent of people below the poverty level in the City were age 18 to 64, and 46
percent were children age 17 and younger. The majority of these children were school age (between
                                                                                   Community Development

ages five and 17). Female householders represent 62 percent of all families below the poverty level.
 Female householders with children age 17 and younger represent 58 percent of all families below
the poverty level. Eight percent of all impoverished persons were age 65 or older, and most (77
percent) were White. The poverty rates for each age group do not correlate with the percent of each
age group within the total population. Compared to the total population, a higher percentage of
families with children (especially single mothers) and elderly were below the poverty level, while a
lower percentage of adults are below the poverty level.
The poverty rates in Table III-30 show disparities between specific groups within the community.
The elderly, single mothers, and children all had higher poverty rates than the comparative
population and overall poverty rates for the City as a whole. Comparison by race also shows
disparities among some minority groups, specifically Blacks, Native Americans, and Hispanics who
had higher poverty rates than Whites, Asians, or Others, and the City as a whole.

Area Employment Profile
The local economy is based largely on agriculture, food processing, retail trade, and miscellaneous
manufacturing. Banning is part of a larger regional employment market that includes resorts and
gaming casinos in the Coachella Valley. A substantial amount of the population in Banning
commutes to jobs in nearby cities within this larger regional market, such as Redlands, Hemet and
the Palm Springs desert area.
Employment in the local area, and jobs held by the majority of Banning residents, skew heavily to
lower-paid retail, services, and semi-skilled manufacturing jobs. The three largest employers in the
                                                                                              Community Development

     Area consists of Banning, Beaumont, Calimesa, Cherry Valley, and Cabazon (the San Gorgonio Pass Census
    Division)
While job growth and employment opportunities will continue to expand in the region, most local
public agencies involved in economic development do no expect a significant change in the type of
employment between 2000 and 2005. For the period covered by this Housing Element, therefore,
the majority of jobs available locally and in the region will continue to be in moderate- to lower-
paying industries.
Unemployment
According to the California Employment Development Department (EDD), the City of Banning has
an 11.1 percent unemployment rate as of August 2000, (1,140 persons of a total labor force of 9,930
people). The unemployment rate for the City is higher than the countywide rate of 7.2 percent. In
                                                                                      Community Development

1990, the City had a slightly lower unemployment rate of 10.8 percent, compared to the County's
unemployment rate of 7.0 percent the same year. Therefore, employment rates have remained fairly
stable in the City and County over the past decade, and will likely continue to do so in the future.
SPECIAL NEEDS
Special housing needs arise due to physical, economic, social, or cultural characteristics or
conditions that are present in a substantial percentage of the local population. These characteristics
or conditions distinguish individuals from the general population and lead to housing or supportive
services need that are not (or cannot) be met by the private market acting alone. Examples of special
housing needs include accessibility for the mobility impaired, transitional housing for those leaving a
homeless environment, and housing specifically designed for the physical and social needs of older
adults.
Characteristics such as age or physical limitations may be present in a large portion of the
population. It is important for the community to accommodate a variety of housing types to serve
such special needs groups. For example, handicap accessible housing or units that are designed to
aid the physical limitations of the elderly may be needed in a community with a large populations of
this age group. Conversely, a community may have a large population of, low-income families that
need adequately sized housing at a low cost. Affordability issues are also important to groups such
as female-headed households, college students, farm workers, or military personnel. The types of
special needs groups will be evaluate in order to address the special housing needs.
Elderly
As is the case in many well-established suburbs, the numbers and percentages of the elderly
population is growing. Table III-32 lists the population figures by age of those residents over the
age of 55 and over the age of 65 during a 10-year period. Table III-33 shows that the percentage of
elderly in the overall population of Banning is increasing. According to the 1990 Census, 21 percent
of the 1990 population was over 65 (4,363) and 11 percent were over 55 (2,063).

Seven hundred and sixty-six persons over the age of 65 were receiving public assistance in 1989.
Older adults tend to have a lower poverty rate in most communities (young families with children,
especially single mothers, usually have the highest poverty rate). In 1990, the incidence of poverty
was lower among the population over 65 years of age (7 percent) than it was for the population
between the ages of 18 and 64 (19 percent).
Tenure is important when analyzing the needs of seniors. Senior householders occupy 2,178 owner
occupied houses and 504 renter occupied houses. The percentage of seniors 65 and over living in
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                 III-1 2 6
                                                                                         City Of Banning
                                                                                             General Plan
owner-occupied housing was 81 percent according to the 1990 U.S. Census, compared to 65 percent
of the owner population at large. Since many seniors live on fixed incomes and inhabit aged housing
stock that may need rehabilitation, the City should provide rehabilitation programs for existing units,
as well as the creation of affordable senior housing units.
One common special need among the “frail” elderly is for care facilities that combine meal, medical,
and daily living assistance in a residential environment. There are five State Department of Social
Services licensed elderly care facilities and one facility that currently has a pending license (CA
Department of Social Services Community Care Licensing.). Banning Villa (capacity 45), Golden
Meadows (capacity 49), Golden View Guest Home, which specializes in Alzheimer and Dementia
patients (capacity 30), Shepherd Watch Elderly Care Home (capacity 4), Villa La Roe (capacity 22)
and Mountainside Home for Elders (pending license) (capacity 6).
Most of the other care facilities available to the elderly of Banning are located in the near by city of
Beaumont. Sunset Haven Health Center is a skilled nursing facility in Beaumont with a capacity of
58 people they (currently have 45 people). Beaumont Care and Palm Grove are both security gated
care facility for Alzheimer and Dementia patients. The capacity for Beaumont Care is 86, they
currently have 71 patients in residence, and the capacity for Palm Grove is 57, they currently have 53
patients.
Sun Lakes is a senior living community in Banning. The community is comprised of condominiums
townhomes, duplexes and single-family homes. There is one 18-hole PGA golf course, and one 9-
hole executive course that is currently being expanded into another 18-hole golf course, swimming
pools, tennis courts, and other amenities associated within the community. They are developing the
2nd 9 hole golf course. Currently the Sun Lakes Community has a very low vacancy rate and there
are currently no rentals available. The going prices for single family homes in Sun Lakes
community is between $125,000-$300,000, with most homes selling in the mid- to high-$100,000s.
The price for a condominium, townhome, or duplex ranges between $80,000-$174,000. All of the
housing in close proximity to the golf course is relatively more expensive. There are currently 2,700
housing units completed with 700 more units projected over the next five years.
Large Families
Low- and moderate-income large families can have difficulty securing adequate housing because
they cannot afford houses with enough bedrooms to meet their space needs. In Banning, few large
families earning less than 80 percent of the median income would be able to find houses of three or
more bedrooms affordable to purchase. Most very low-income, large families may have difficulty
renting three or more bedroom affordable homes. According to the 1990 Census there were 1,091
households of five or more persons. Of the large household, 1,082 are large families and the
remaining 9 are non-family households. Large households occupied approximately ten percent of
owner-occupied units and twenty-four percent of renter-occupied units.
The median household size is currently 2.9 people per household as of January 1, 2000. At the time
of the 1990 Census the number of persons per family was 3.19 and median household size was 2.7
people, with the largest number of households having only two persons (2,696 out of 7,431). The
next largest group was one-person households (1,764 out of 7,431).

The City contains more housing units with two bedrooms (46 percent) than any other number of
units. The large family percentage rate of renters (56 percent) is higher than that of owners, (44
percent). This might be an indication that there may not be enough lower cost owner housing units
affordable to low-income large families.

Individuals with Disabilities
Approximately 7 percent of the City’s non-institutionalized residents have physical conditions that
affect their ability to live independently in conventional residential settings. These individuals have
mobility impairments, self-care limitations, or other conditions that may require special housing
accommodations or financial assistance. Individuals with such disabilities can have a number of
special needs that distinguish them from the population at large.
•        Individuals with mobility difficulties (such as those confined to wheelchairs) may require
    special accommodations or modifications to their homes to allow for continued independent
    living. Such modifications are often called “handicapped access.”
•        Individuals with self-care limitations (which can include persons with mobility difficulties)
    may require residential environments that include in-home or on-site support services, ranging
    from congregate to convalescent care. Support services can include medical therapy, daily living
    assistance, congregate dining, and related services.
•        Individuals with developmental disabilities and other physical and mental conditions that
    prevent them from functioning independently may require assisted care or group home
    environments.
•        Individuals with disabilities may require financial assistance to meet their housing needs
    because a high percentage are low-income due to their often-limited earning potential. In
    addition, their special housing and supportive service needs place additional financial burdens on
    individuals with disabilities, making daily living more costly than non-disabled persons living in
    conventional housing.
Some people with mobility and/or self-care limitations are able to live with their families to assist in
meeting housing and daily living needs. A segment of the disabled population, particularly low-
income and retired individuals, may not have the financial capacity to pay for needed
accommodations or modifications to their homes. Even those able to pay for special housing
accommodations may find them unavailable in the City.
Disabled persons often require special housing features to accommodate physical limitations. Some
disabled persons may have financial difficulty due to the cost of having their special needs met or
                                                                                 Community Development

                                                                                            General Plan
because of difficulty in finding appropriate employment. Although the California Administrative
Code Title 24 requires all public buildings be accessible to the public through architectural standards
such as ramps, large doors, and restroom modifications to enable handicap access, not all available
housing units have these features. According to 1990 Census data, there were approximately 1,345
non-institutionalized disabled persons over age 16 in Banning.
According to the 1990 U.S. Census, Table III-35 shows that 664, or 6 percent, of persons between
the ages of 16 and 64 had mobility and/or self-care limitations.
Many persons with disabilities can benefit from a residential environment that provides supportive
services in a group setting. The State Department of Social Services provides a program called
Community Access. This program provides disabled residents of Banning training for jobs and
transportation to and from support groups and to social and economic services throughout the
community.

                            Families with Female Heads of Household
Most female-headed households are either single elderly women or single mothers. Traditionally,
these two groups have been considered special needs groups because their incomes tend to be lower,
making it difficult to obtain affordable housing, or because they have specific physical needs related
to housing (such as child care or assisted living support). Single mothers in particular tend to have
difficulty in obtaining suitable affordable housing. Such households also have a greater need for
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                 III-1 2 9
                                                                                          City Of Banning
                                                                                              General Plan
housing with convenient access to child-care facilities, public transportation, and other public
facilities and services. In addition, single mothers, often face discrimination in obtaining rental
housing due to their income levels, sources of incomes (often public assistance and/or child support),
and the presence of children—even though such discrimination is illegal.
Of the 7,431 households in the City, 2,177 are female-headed households of which 930 (17 percent)
are female-headed family households. In addition, 1,247 people living in female-headed, non-family
households, of which, 1,132 were women living alone.
According to the 1990 U.S. Census, 356 (6 percent) of the City's female-headed households are
classified as living below the poverty level. It may be assumed that most of these households are
overpaying for housing (i.e. more than 30 percent of their income), or are experiencing other unmet
housing needs. As a result of poverty, female heads of households often spend more on immediate
needs such as food, clothing, transportation, and medical care, than on home maintenance, which
results in living units falling into disrepair.
Farm Workers
According to the 1990 Census, 170 persons (3 percent) were employed in farming, forestry, and
fishing occupations out of a total labor force of 6,501 in Banning. These individuals are permanent
resident of the community. The EDD includes farm workers, nursery workers; delivery truck drivers
for produce and flower, horticulturists, landscapers, tree trimmers, and lawn gardeners in this
category. Generally housing programs geared to low-income large families can address the needs of
the farm worker population. There are no migrant farm labor camps in or near Banning, nor is there
significant agricultural activity in the City’s planning area of the type that would attract a substantial
number of migrant farm workers.
Homeless
Homelessness is caused by a number of social and economic factors, including a breakdown of
traditional social relationships, unemployment, shortage of low-income housing, and the
deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill. A homeless person lacks consistent and adequate shelter.
Homeless persons can be considered resident (those remaining in an area year-round), or transient.
Emergency and transitional shelters can help to address the needs of the homeless. Emergency
shelters provide a short-term solution to homelessness and involve limited supplemental services. In
contrast, transitional shelters are directed towards removing the basis for homelessness. Shelter is
provided for an extended period, and is combined with other social services and counseling to assist
in the transition to self-sufficiency.
The nature of the homeless population makes exact counting difficult. The 1990 U.S. Census found
no "visible" persons living on the streets and no people in homeless shelters. However, Census
counts are not generally accepted as an accurate reflection of homelessness. Because the homeless
move around and are not always visible on the street it is difficult to get an accurate count of
homeless persons in a community. There is no one agency that comprehensively tracks
homelessness and homeless individuals. Even the Banning Police Department can provide only
anecdotal evidence about homelessness in the City.
                                                                                 Community Development
                                                                                                   III-1 3 0

                                                                                         City Of Banning
                                                                                             General Plan
None of the groups contacted could provide a reliable region-wide estimate of homelessness beyond
a general description of the clients each serves. However, discussions with social service
organizations, the Police Department, and others dealing with emergency housing and the homeless
on a daily basis believe that there might be a need for additional homeless and supportive services
for the entire region (based on present capacity and funding of these organizations in relation to
current and projected demand). Banning’s location astride a major transcontinental interstate
highway means that travelers without financial means sometimes become temporarily stranded and
need assistance. The City’s large number of lower-income residents also increases the likelihood
that some of these individuals will become temporarily homeless at some point in their lives.
Banning also has a large number of social service agencies with local clients who have a higher
potential for homelessness than the population at large.
Agencies Offering Public Assistance to Homeless and Other Special Needs Groups
Family Connection is a program funded by the State Department of Social Services; this nonprofit
organization operates most of the special needs programs in the city. Family Connection is in charge
of The Salvation Army Family Services, TEMPO, (a teen mentoring program), Red Cross, training
people for disaster assistance and Mental Health Programs such as Community Access. The
Salvation Army also has a Healthy Families Program to provide medical insurance for families who
qualify for it. Through Family Connection, people can get a list of Shelters available throughout
Riverside County.
Many of the programs that provide, food, health care, training, and supportive social services are
available to all individuals who lack financial resources. A large percentage of the clientele for these
programs are homeless or threatened with homelessness, so representatives of these programs can
often provide the most accurate information about homelessness in the area.
The Salvation Army Family Services in Banning offers a Food Program for people who do not have
enough money to buy food. The program offers people and families food for three days. Flyers are
posted throughout the City to advertise this program, but many individuals find out about the
programs “walk-ins” to the Salvation Army inquiring about assistance. The Salvation Army also has
a housing program that is currently under- funded (and non-operational) and the organization is
currently low on donations. Salvation Army is waiting for a FEMA grant to re-start the Housing
program. The Housing Program is for emergency housing purposes. If a person or family can’t pay
its rent due to the loss of a job, then the Salvation Army can assist with the cost of a motel for a
week or two, or provide the first month’s rent until client is financially stable and can move back
into conventional housing.
Set Free Christian Ranch in Cabazon, is a facility for homeless, abused, or lost people. There are
two facilities; a Men’s Ranch and a Women and Children’s Facility. Currently there are 80 men at
the ranch and approximately 20 women and children at the Facility. No one is turned away but there
is a 60-day commitment to stay. The facility provides spiritual healing through daily activities and
work programs.
The County of Riverside provides 2 public service agencies in Banning, Cal Works/Gain and
Temporary Assistance & Medi-Cal the Temporary Assistance and Medical. The Cal Works Gain
Program helps unemployed people back into the work force. The program provides job listings
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                 III-1 3 1

                                                                                        City Of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
education programs for people to learn skills, interview preparation and transportation to the actual
interviews. The Temporary Assistance & Medi-Cal Program gives special facilities to families in
need. Families that qualify can receive cash aid, Medi-Cal, and Food Stamps.
Because homeless services are provided through decentralized, independent organizations that have
their own record-keeping and operating procedures, there is no comprehensive survey of the number
of homeless individuals and families or the number of homeless who cannot be accommodated by
existing shelter programs. Based on contacts with organizations providing homeless services in
Banning, however, the following conclusions were reached:
•       Under normal conditions, existing shelter facilities and programs are adequate to meet the
    needs of Banning residents who become homeless.
•       Periodically, existing homeless services and shelters are stretched to their limits because of
    unexpected demand by individual or families passing through the City or an unexpectedly high
    number of social service clients who temporarily become homeless.
•       Facilities devoted specifically to the needs of homeless youth are in short supply in the
    region, and existing agencies in Banning cannot always meet the needs of such homeless
    individuals.
As a result, there may be a need for periodic or seasonal homeless shelter space and supportive
services to meet unanticipated high demands among single adults, families, and youth. The exact
number of shelter beds or spaces required under these periodic conditions is difficult predict given
the variable nature of homelessness in Banning. The City may need to examine its current zoning
policies to determine if permanent or temporary homeless shelters and supportive service facilities
can be adequately accommodated under existing regulations.
BANNING HOUSING PROFILE
According to the California Department of Finance, approximately 1,007 housing units were vacant
in 2000, a vacancy rate of 10.22 percent. Over two-thirds of the City’s housing units were single
family detached homes (68 percent), followed by mobile homes (12 percent), multiple units of five
or more (7 percent), multiple units of two to four (7 percent) and single-family attached units (6
percent). By comparison, the countywide vacancy rate was 16.97 percent. The proportion of
different types of housing countywide remained constant between 1990 and 2000—61 percent single
detached houses, 14 percent multiples of five or more units, thirteen percent mobile homes, seven
percent single attached houses and five percent multiples of two to four units. Countywide, there are
a substantially higher percentage of housing units in multifamily buildings of five or more units.
Annual changes in the housing stock varied considerably, with some years resulting in a majority of
single-family units and other years resulting in a majority of larger multi-family complexes. Table
III-35 shows the annual changes in the housing stock between January 1990 and January 2000 as
determined by the California Department of Finance.

Annual Growth of Housing Stock
Table III-37 summarizes building permit activity in Banning over the past seven years. The majority
of housing units built in this period are privately owned single dwelling units. Building activity has
remained steady between 1993 and the present, with slight variations from year to year. Limited
data is available for fiscal year 2000, and therefore, totals for that year represent only a portion of the
building activity that occurred.

Housing Occupancy and Tenure
Of the 8,278 year-round dwelling units reported by the Census Bureau in 1990, 7,431 units (90
percent) were occupied and 847 units (10 percent) were vacant. Most of the vacant units were for
sale, as shown in Table III-38 In 1990, more housing units were owner occupied (4,864 or 65
percent) than renter occupied (2,567 or 35 percent). By comparison, the tenure of occupied housing
units in the County are relatively similar, 67 percent owner-occupied units and 33 percent renter
occupied units.

Ownership rates listed in Table III-40 reveal that, with the exception of Whites, rental rates in all
the ethnic groups were higher or equal to the owners. This suggests that there might be some
difficulty becoming homeowners due to the relatively lower income levels in the city.

Age and Condition of Housing Stock
The age and condition of the housing stock provide additional measures of housing adequacy and
availability in many communities. Although age does not always correlate with substandard housing
conditions, neighborhoods with a preponderance of homes more than 40 years old are more likely
than newer neighborhoods to have a concentration of housing problems related to deferred
maintenance, inadequate landscaping care, outdated utilities or interior amenities, and a need for
housing rehabilitation. According to estimates made by the Building Department 15 percent of the
housing stock is in need of repair and 5 percent of the housing stock needs to be demolished and
replaced.
Age of the Housing Stock
The year a structure was built can, be an indicator of the current condition of the housing unit.
Housing units built before 1940 may be old, but may not necessarily be in a rundown condition. In
contrast, newer homes may already be rundown due to abuse or general inadequacies. Table III-42
shows that the highest percentages of housing units in the City were built during the 1980s (1968
represents the median year structures were built). Poor housing conditions do not necessarily
correlate with the age of housing units. Rather, poor housing conditions result from a lack of
maintenance and home repairs, which is a problem that can afflict all housing units regardless of age.

The number of bedrooms within a housing unit can also characterize the housing stock in a
community, as shown in Table III-43. Consistent with the City’s image as primarily a single-family
community, the overwhelming majority of homes in the City (46 percent) had 2 bedrooms. The
second largest group had 3 bedrooms. Two-bedroom dwelling units had the highest number and
highest percentage of vacant units in 1990. Among larger homes one could find vacant units in 1990.

Overcrowding
Overcrowding typically results when either: 1) the housing costs of available housing with a
sufficient number of bedrooms for larger families exceeds the family’s ability to afford such
housing, or 2) unrelated individuals (such as students or low-wage single adult workers) share
dwelling units due to high housing costs. This can lead to overcrowded situations if the housing unit
is not large enough to accommodate all of the people effectively. In general, overcrowding is a
measure of the ability of existing housing to adequately accommodate residents and can result in
deterioration of the quality of life within a community.
Banning had a relatively high incidence of overcrowding in 1990—892 households (12 percent)
were overcrowded. Overcrowding occurred both in owner-occupied and rental housing units. There
were 625 overcrowded rental units (24 percent of all rental units) and 267 overcrowded owner-
occupied units (5 percent of all owner-occupied units). The extent of overcrowding is consistent

The 1990 Census defines overcrowding as 1.01 or more persons per room, and extreme
overcrowding as more than 1.5 persons per room. Since data in relation to overcrowding have not
been broken down into housing type by number of rooms, type of household, or by household
income, overcrowding must be evaluated in terms of other factors such as cultural expectations, size
of rooms, availability and type of common areas or open space, and the age and relationship of
persons in the unit. Table III-45 and III-46 summarize the overcrowding status in the City. Nine
percent of the City’s occupied housing units were overcrowded, compared to 8 percent of the
County’s occupied units.

Income and Affordability
A standard measure of housing affordability is that housing expenses should not exceed 30 percent
of a household’s income, on the average. Those who pay 30 percent or more of their income on
housing may experience difficulty in affording other basic necessities. However, to truly evaluate
housing affordability, individual circumstances and factors must be taken into account. These
circumstances and other factors include other long-term debt, mortgage interest rates, the number of
children in a household, and other large, ongoing expenses (such as medical bills). Since it is
impossible to consider each household’s individual circumstances, the 30 percent rule-of-thumb
provides a general measure of housing affordability for the average household.
Tables III-52 and III-53 show the number of households paying over 30 percent of their income on
housing by income level (the four income groups and by dollar amount as reported by the 1990
Census). Some households choose to pay over 30 percent of their income for various reasons, such
as location, aesthetics, or other features. Other households choose to pay larger percentages of their
income on housing because they may receive tax advantages or are investing with the knowledge
that their income will increase so that they pay a lower percentage of their income on a long-term
basis. In contrast, some households are forced to pay a large percentage of their income either
because they cannot afford anything less, or they are limited to certain costs due to a lack of
available low-cost housing options.
In 1990, 341 homeowners age 65 and older paid 30 percent or more of their income on housing.
This represented 22 percent of all elderly homeowners. However, approximately 59 percent (289
renters) of elderly renters were paying 30 percent or more of their income on housing.

     Note: 1990 Census data uses income ranges that do not correspond exactly to the income categories. Therefore,
     there are people in the lower-income category that actually fall into the moderate-income category and likewise
     between the very low- and lower-income categories. The numbers in the table include more persons than are
     actually in those categories.

Affordability Trends
Table III-53 shows the median gross rent in relation to income in 1990 (such data is not available for
2000). People with very low incomes had few affordable housing options, as only 19 percent of
apartment units in the City had rents below 30 percent of their income. Additionally there were few
owner-occupied homes at prices affordable to a very low income household. People with low
incomes had more options than those with very low incomes, but there were still an insufficient
number of lower-cost units available to these households.
Table III-53 also provides an estimate of the number of affordable rental units at each income level.
It is important to note that the percentage of apartments affordable within the low- and moderate-
income groups is cumulative and includes the percentage from the previous income group. Also,
households of many income levels will often compete for housing in the same price range, so the
existence of lower-cost units does not mean that such units are actually available to lower-income
households.

A household can typically qualify to purchase a home that is 2.5 to 3.0 times the annual income of
that household, depending on the down payment, the level of other long-term obligations (such as a
car loan), and interest rates. In practice, the interaction of these factors allows some households to
qualify for homes priced at more than three times their annual income, while other households may
be limited to purchasing homes no more than two times their annual incomes. Based on the homes
currently for sale within the last years and affordability rates at 3.0 times the annual income of a
four-person household, Table III-54 shows that there were 74 homes affordable to four-person
households in the very low-income category and 163 homes available to four-person households in
the low-income category. . It is important to note that subsidized or assisted housing is not included
in these housing costs as they are not likely to be listed in local papers.

CURRENT HOUSING NEEDS
Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA)
The State Housing Law requires the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) to
identify existing and future housing needs for the region every five years. The 1998 RHNA
identifies each jurisdiction's Existing Housing Need, as of January 1, 1998, and Future Housing
Need for the July 1, 1998 to July 1, 2005 period.
Existing need is evaluated based on overpayment by lower income households (SCAG has used the
figure 30 percent or more of income) and the need to raise vacancy rates in the jurisdiction to a level
at which the market would operate freely.
The methodology used to determine the future need took into consideration the growth in number of
households expected, the need to achieve ideal vacancy rates, and compensation for anticipated
demolition. Then an "avoidance of impaction" adjustment was calculated. This is done to avoid
further concentration of low-income units in jurisdictions that have more than the regional average.
The City must use the numbers allocated under the RHNA to identify measures (policies and
ordinances) that are consistent with meeting these new construction goals. They are not meant to be
a quota for development. In other words, the City must make it possible for units to be built but is
not obligated to build any of the units. Between 1998 and February 2000, the City processed four
demolition permits for single-dwelling units and one building permit to repair the foundation of a
dwelling unit. According to the RHNA, the City of Banning has a total housing construction need of
1,780 units and an annual need of 237 units. The Banning 1998-2005 planning period allocation is:

ASSISTED HOUSING PROJECTS/PROGRAMS
City of Banning
Because Banning is not an entitlement community for the receipt of federal funds, the City has relied
on Riverside County to provide pass-through funding under a number of federal programs. In
addition, Banning has generated a small, but growing, amount of local funding through its
Redevelopment Agency, which must set aside 20 percent of the property tax increment it receives in
a housing fund to benefit low- and moderate-income households.
As of July 1, 2000 the Redevelopment Agency had a balance of $199,500 low- to moderate-income
funds and $158,000 in unspent Bond proceeds committed to future projects. Table III-57 contains
the Agency’s estimate of LMI Fund Receipts and Expenditures for the fiscal year 1999-00 through
fiscal year 2003-04. The Agency anticipates that additional receipts into the L//MI fund between
fiscal years 2000-01 2004-05 will be approximately the same as shown in Table III-57.

The Banning Community Redevelopment Agency proposes to use its L/MI funds in the following
ways over the next five years:
•       Nine units are proposed to be constructed in order to complete the Agency’s replacement
    housing obligation to provide 13 replacement dwelling units.
•       Substantial rehabilitation of twenty (20) units during the balance of the five-year planning
    period.
•       Assist 55 units, 20 Inclusionary, 9 replacements, 26 “other” using the housing assistance
    programs.
The City has several new programs designed to improve housing conditions, increase
homeownership, and provide additional housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income
households. For example, the City just started a program to help improve the exterior for owner
occupied housing units. The program will assist low and very-low homeowners with fixing up their
homes. A grant of up to $7,500 will be given to eligible homeowners. Under this grant the
homeowner will be required to maintain the home for up to 7 years or the money will be taken. The
City has also taken steps in recent years to increase code enforcement activities and remove
dilapidated structures that are infeasible to rehabilitate to improve property conditions in the City.
Finally, the City plans to implement a local program to assist low-income households in purchasing
a home.

County Housing Programs
According to the County Housing Authority there is limited funding for housing assistance programs
and a very large number of families requesting assistance (there are approximately 23,000 families
waiting for assistance), the wait for assistance can be less than one to seven years. In Banning, there
are currently 138 families on the waiting list for public housing and there are 286 families waiting
for Section 8 vouchers, some of which may be on both lists. Descriptions of the programs provided
by the Riverside County Housing Authority are outlined below.
In the tenant-based Section 8 programs, the Public Housing Authority (PHA) verifies a family's
eligibility (including income eligibility) and then issues the family a voucher. The family generally
has 60 days to locate a rental unit where the landlord agrees to participate in the program. The PHA
determines whether the unit meets housing quality standards (HQS). If the PHA approves a family's
unit and lease, the PHA contracts with the owner to make Housing Assistants Payment (HAP) on
behalf of the family. The PHA may not approve a lease unless the rent is reasonable.
Under the rental certificate program, the initial rent and utility costs normally may not exceed a
HUD established fair market rent (FMR) for the unit size in the area, and the tenant is generally
required to pay 30 percent of adjusted monthly income toward rent and utilities (the total tenant
payment). The Housing Assistants Payment (HAP) made by the Public Housing Authority (PHA) to
the owner makes up the difference between the rent the owner charges for the unit and the amount of
the total tenant payment.
The Homeownership Empowerment Lease Purchase (HELP) Program is funded by the U. S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and administered by the Housing Authority
of the County of Riverside. The HELP Program provides eligible families the opportunity to lease a
single family home from the Housing Authority and obtain down payment assistance to help them
purchase the home. Program participants lease the home from the Housing Authority until they
accumulate enough money for a down payment and qualify for a loan to purchase the home.
There is one multi-family complex in Banning that currently participates in HUD's Section 8
program, Westview Terrace. This complex contains 75 units and the expiration date is January 10,
2013, therefore it is not at risk. The Housing Authority owns several bond financed multi-family
rental housing developments in various cities throughout the County of Riverside there is one
apartment complex is Beaumont, Noble Creek Apartments. These attractive multi-family rental
housing developments were constructed or purchased under contracts with, and funding provided by
HUD. These rental-housing units are owned and managed by the Housing Authority. Housing
Authority owned affordable housing consists of 491 units scattered over twenty-two sites through
the Riverside County area. Upon being determined eligible, a family is given the choice of sites
available at the time their name is drawn from the waiting list. The family must choose from
available sites in order to receive housing assistance. This program is sometimes called the
"conventional housing program".

Individual initiative and the use of Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) have helped. In
previous years the CDBG program has been used to assist with home improvement for applicants
that meet the income guidelines.
UNITS ELIGIBLE FOR CONVERSION
In 1989, the California Government Code was amended to include a requirement that localities
identify and develop a program in their housing elements for the preservation of assisted, affordable
multi-family units. Subsequent amendments have clarified the scope of the analysis to also include
units developed pursuant to inclusionary housing and density bonus programs. In the preservation
analysis, localities are required to provide an inventory of assisted, affordable units that are eligible
to convert within ten years. As part of the analysis, an estimation of the cost of preserving versus
replacing the units is to be included, as well as programs designed to preserve the affordable units.
The California Housing Partnership Corporation provides an inventory of federally subsidized rental
units at risk of conversion. Currently no HUD-assisted multi-family housing developments with
Section 8 contracts in the City of Banning are at risk of conversion over the next ten years. One
assisted rental housing development, Westview Terrance, has a federal Section 8 contract does not
expire until January 1, 2013.

CONSTRAINTS
The City of Banning recognizes the need for sound, affordable housing for all of its residents, this
goal is not easy to achieve. The City itself does not produce housing and its resources to encourage
others to do so are limited. In addition, there are market constraints in the operation of the
construction industry, laws and regulations (Subdivision Map Act and Uniform Building Code), and
physical constraints, which impact the cost and amount of housing produced and over which the City
had no control.
NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Price of Housing/Land
According to the California Association of Realtors, housing prices have been rising in the area, with
gains of 17.7 percent between August 1999 and August 2000. Based on recent sales, the average
three-bedroom unit is $119,599.
Construction Costs
The major components of housing costs are construction costs, labor costs, land costs and market
financing. The single largest cost associated with building a new house is the cost of building
materials, comprising between 40 to 50 percent of the sales price of a home. According to a local
developer, construction costs in Banning are moderate. Highland Estates is a new single-family
development with 45 homes, their prices range from $120,000 to $150,000. Construction and labor
costs for a wood framed, single-family house are about $46 per square foot or $69,000 a unit. The
cost of raw land is running between $8,000-$12,000 a unit. Development cost including sewer and
other underground utilities is between $17,000 and $22,000 a unit. The current permitting cost is
about $9,000 a unit. Marketing costs is running about 8 percent or $10,800 of the sales price. Local
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                               III-1 4 9

                                                                                        City Of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
realtors and developers indicate land costs in Banning are comparable to nearby areas, and are lower
than in metropolitan areas to the west (e.g. Riverside and San Bernardino). The average sales price
for all homes sold in Banning between 1999 and June 2000 was $42,500 for a one bedroom up
$110,666 for 5 or more bedrooms.
Availability of Financing
The City has not uncovered any local constraints to the availability or cost of financing for home
purchases or rehabilitation that differ significantly from the availability and cost of financing
generally in California. Even in older neighborhoods of the City, there are no barriers to obtaining
financing for home purchase, improvement, or construction (other than customary underwriting
considerations by lenders).
The primary factor related to home finance affecting housing affordability and availability is the cost
of borrowing money (interest rates). Historically, substantial changes in interest rates have
correlated with swings in home sales. When interest rates decline, sales increase. The reverse has
been true when interest rates increase. Over the past two decades, there has been a dramatic growth
in alternative mortgage products, such as graduated mortgages and variable rate mortgages. These
types of loans allow homeowners to take advantage of lower initial interest rates and qualify for
larger home loans. Even during periods of high interest rates, these alternative products allow more
buyers to qualify for homeownership, thus dampening the swings in home sales that accompany
changes in interest rates.
Nevertheless, the fixed interest rate mortgage remains the preferred type of loan, especially during
periods of low, stable interest rates. Most governmental programs that seek to increase
homeownership among low- and moderate-income households rely on loan products that provide
fixed interest rates below prevailing market rates, either for the principal loan or for a second loan
that provides part of the down payment for home purchase. Many programs offer deferred second
loans to facilitate homeownership. Table III-60 shows various monthly payments necessary to
service mortgages at various interest rates. Financing is currently at 10 percent in the area.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Infrastructure
Another factor adding to the cost of new construction is the cost of providing adequate
infrastructure. Major and local streets; curbs, gutters, and sidewalks; water and sewer lines; and
street lighting are required to be built or installed in new developments. These infrastructure
improvements are, in most cases, dedicated to the City, which is then responsible for their
maintenance. The cost of these facilities is borne by developers, is added to the cost of new housing
units, and is eventually paid for by the homebuyers or property owners.
Since the City and most of its developments are quite old, infrastructure, including streets, sewers,
storm drains, and water lines, are quickly aging and in need of repair. To offset the cost of
installation and repair, new developments are required to provide on-site infrastructure and pay an
impact fee for these facilities. There are no infrastructure limitations on the City's ability to
accommodate affordable housing, nor are there infrastructure or public service constraints on
remaining sites potentially suitable for affordable housing. One potential problem commented by a
local developer was the several open channels and underground drains that have been constructed
within the planning area there has been slight difficulty to build housing around them.
Maintaining Public Open Space
Open space is a valuable resource as it discourages noncontiguous development patterns that result
in sprawl and inefficient use of community service funds. Open space also maintains the natural
character of the area so that urbanization does not become out of control and cities do not lose their
natural resources. Open spaces are beneficial to the responsible growth of cities and offer many
environmental, recreational, and psychological benefits to the community. The City does not require
common open space in any of its residential zones. However, if a developer chooses to construct a
planned unit development, which the City permits, a minimum of 30% of the gross site area must be
designated for common open space.
GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Zoning of Available Land
The City has approximately 10,797 acres of residential land, less than five percent of which are
underdeveloped and feasible redevelopment options. Most of the land in the City is zoned low
density residential or where multi-family units are not permitted, locating available land where
higher density dwellings are permitted can become difficult, particularly as build out occurs.
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                III-1 5 1
                                                                                      City Of Banning

Land Use Controls
Banning encourages residential development in its jurisdiction, and as of 1989 did not anticipate any
measures to limit residential growth. Residential uses are only permitted in residential zones as
shown in the table. However, conversions of commercial uses in commercial zones to residential
uses are permitted with the approval of a conditional use permit.
The zoning ordinance provides for a full range of residential types and densities dispersed
throughout the community. Densities range from 0-1du/acre in Rural Residential areas to 12-24
du/acre in the areas designated for High Density Residential development.
                                                                             Community Development

       Banning Zoning Code Requirements
       Table III-61 summarizes the City’s zoning requirements for housing. Although these requirements
       apply to new development, their practical impact in affecting the construction of housing for low-
       income households is minor in comparison to non-governmental constraints. Nevertheless this table
       describes the key development regulations and policies that potentially affect the City’s ability to
       accommodate low-income housing.

Local Processing and Permit Procedures
The evaluation and review process required by the City procedures contributes to the cost of housing
in that holding costs incurred by developers are ultimately manifested in the selling price of the
home. The review process in Banning is governed by the City Council and Planning Commission,
or depending on the project, it might be reviewed by The Planning Department.
City staff seeks in all cases to streamline approval processes wherever possible. Conditional use
permits, rezones, tentative maps, and plan checks are all processed within approximately two
months, if an environmental impact report isn’t necessary, and assuming that there are no significant
issues affecting the project. If environmental processing is necessary, or if it is necessary to resolve
special issues, processing times are streamlined to the extent possible within statutory limits
governing review periods.
Due to the extent of development applications received by Staff in recent years and desire the
minimize project review time, the City has implemented an Alternative Permit Processing system
which provides project applicants the opportunity to hire a City-approved consultant to conduct
project review.
Permit and Development Impact Fees
The City of Banning charges a number of permit, development, and engineering fees to cover the
cost of processing development requests, providing public facilities and services to new
development, and mitigating the environmental impacts of new development. Although these fees
are necessary to meet City service and environmental standards, they can have a substantial impact
on the cost of housing, particularly affordable housing. Table III-62 summarizes the various permit
fees charged by the City. Table III-63 summarizes the City’s development impact fees. Table III-
64 summarizes the City’s Engineering Department fees.

Normally, permit fees would have a minimal impact on housing costs because most the fees are flat
rate charges, not per unit charges, and can be spread over the entire development. For a modest-
sized development proposal, permit fees would typically amount to a few hundred dollars per
dwelling unit. Permit fees could have a more substantial impact on small, infill projects that would
be typical of most remaining vacant land.
Development impact fees have a much larger effect than permit fees on the final cost of a home.
Such fees include water and sewer impact and hook-up costs, park fees (in lieu of land dedication),
traffic impact fees, and similar charges. Based on the schedule of fees shown in Table III-64, these
impact fees average about $9,000 for a typical 1,500 square foot single-family dwelling.
These fees represent between approximately 7 percent of the total cost of a dwelling unit, depending
on the dwelling unit type, square footage, number of bedrooms, and land development cost. The
cost-impact of these fees is not significant for a typical single family home. Local developers are
still able to offer such homes in the low- to mid-$100,000 range. The City’s development impact
fees could be significant for an affordable multifamily housing project, however, fees would require
additional project funding to make the affordable project “pencil out.” A savings of several
thousand dollars in impact fees for an affordable single-family development could also help
additional low-income households achieve homeownership, saving these households up to $50 per
month in housing costs.
Much of the Banning jurisdiction is undeveloped land without most of its necessary infrastructure,
such as streets, sewers, electrical, and water facilities, yet in place. As such, the cost of land
improvements can be expected to be more than in highly urbanized areas. Under the City’s “Density
Bonus and Other Incentives for Lower Income and Senior Housing” provisions, a variety of
development concessions such as reduced street widths, allowances for the provision of rolled curbs,
reduced parking requirements, and alternative building materials, are offered as incentive for the
provision of affordable units.
ENERGY CONSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES
There are many opportunities for conserving energy in new and existing homes. Construction of
energy efficient buildings does not lower the price of housing. However, housing with energy
conservation features should result in reduced monthly occupancy costs as consumption of fuel and
                                                                              Community Development
                                                                                              III-1 6 0

                                                                                         City Of Banning
                                                                                             General Plan
energy is decreased. Similarly, retrofitting existing structures with energy-conserving features can
result in a reduction in utility costs. Examples of energy conservation opportunities include
weatherization programs and home energy audits; installation of insulation; installation or
retrofitting of more efficient appliances, and mechanical or solar energy systems; and building
design and orientation which incorporates energy conservation considerations.
Many modern design methods used to reduce residential energy consumption are based on proven
techniques that have been known to humans since the earliest days of collective settlement. These
methods can be categorized in three ways:
1. Building design that keeps natural heat in during the winter and keeps natural heat out during the
    summer. Such design reduces air conditioning and heating demands. Proven building
    techniques in this category include:
    •    location of windows and openings in relation to the path of the sun to minimize solar gain in
         the summer and maximize solar gain in the winter;
    •    use of “thermal mass,” earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete, and tiles that absorb
         heat during the day and release heat at night;
    •    “burying” part of the home in a hillside or berm to reduce solar exposure or to insulate the
         home against extremes of temperature;
    •    use of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to reduce heat exchange between
         the interior of a home and the exterior;
    •    location of openings and the use of ventilating devices that take advantage of natural air flow
         (particularly cool evening breezes); and
    •    use of eaves and overhangs that block direct solar gain through window openings during the
         summer but allow solar gain during the winter.
2. Building orientation that uses natural forces to maintain a comfortable interior temperature.
Examples include:
     • north-south orientation of the long axis of a dwelling;
     • minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces; and
     • location of dwellings to take advantage of natural air circulation and evening breezes.
3.   Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures. Such techniques include:
     • use of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home;
     • use of natural or artificial flowing water; and
     • use of trees and hedges as windbreaks.
In addition to natural techniques that have been used for millennia, a number of modern methods of
energy conservation have been developed or advanced during the present century. These include:
    •    use of solar energy to heat water;
    •    use of solar panels and other devices to generate electricity;
    •    window glazing to repel summer heat and trap winter warmth;
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                 III-1 6 1

                                                                                           General Plan
    •    weather-stripping and other insulation to reduce heat gain and loss; and
    •    use of energy efficient home appliances.

Resources Conservation and Development Act (Public Resources Code 25000 et seq.). Among the
requirements of the new law was a directive for the Commission to adopt energy conservation
standards for new construction. The first residential energy conservation standards were developed
in the late 1970s (Title 24, Part 6 of the California Code of Regulations) and have been periodically
revised and refined since that time.
Residential site design and construction techniques that can reduce the amount of energy used for
space cooling would significantly reduce overall energy demand. As discussed above, a number of
traditional and modern techniques can decrease energy used for space cooling, including:
•        the orientation of buildings and windows with respect to the path of the sun;
•        landscaping to shade insulated buildings;
•        insulation in walls and ceilings;
•        thermal mass to absorb solar energy during the day and release it at night; and
•        window treatments to reduce solar gain during the day.
The City of Banning operates under the Banning Municipality, a private utilities company. They are
currently using an energy program called HEAP, which provides up to a $311 reduction of a
person’s yearly utility bill. A person can qualify by meeting the low-income guidelines or are a
senior citizen. Banning Municipality is currently looking to add an Energy Service Representative to
their staff; this person will be in charge of rebates and energy efficient programs.

GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
This section of the Housing Element contains the City’s overall goals for housing, policies to
implement those goals, specific programs, and a five-year schedule of quantified objectives. The
policies and programs adopted by the City relate to four strategic goals:
    •    Provide housing opportunities for all segments of the community to meet current and future
         needs.
    •    Maintain and improve the quality of the existing housing stock and preserve existing
         residential neighborhoods.
    •    Ensure that new housing is compatible with existing development and the natural
         environment.
    •    Promote equal housing opportunity for all Banning residents.
Goal 1: Housing Opportunities
Provide a wide range of housing types to meet the existing and future needs of planning area
residents.
The City wants to encourage the construction of new housing units that offer a wide range of
housing types to ensure that an adequate supply is available to meet existing and future needs. The
provision of a balanced inventory of housing in terms of unit type (e.g. single-family, multi-family,
etc.), cost, and style will allow the city to fulfill a variety of housing needs.
Policies
Policy 1
Provide a variety of residential development opportunities in Banning, ranging from very low
density to high density development as described in the Community Development Element and Plan
Map in accordance with the Regional Housing Needs Assessment.
Program 1.A Land Use Element/Zoning Ordinance:
The City, through planning and regulatory actions will designate adequate housing sites to meet its
RHNA allocation for each income level. A variety of residential types will be provided, ranging
from one to 24 dwelling units per acre, with higher densities achievable through density bonus
provisions. The residential development capacity under the Banning Land Use Plan is adequate to
meet the City’s share of regional housing needs, which have been identified as 1,780 dwelling units
though June 2005.
The program objective relates only to sites for accommodate housing. The objective does not insure
that the RHNA allocation will be constructed, as the City does not directly build housing units.
Timeframe: January 1, 1998 – June 30, 2005
Funding: General Funds, development permit fees.
                                                                                  Community Development
                                                                                                III-1 6 3

                                                                                         City Of Banning
                                                                                             General Plan
Objective: 1,780 dwelling units through June 30, 2005, distributed as follows: 481 very low
income, 289 low-income, 405 moderate-income, and 605 above moderate-income
Program 1.B Shared Housing:
Many seniors who would prefer to live independently must resort to institutionalized living
arrangements because of security problems, loneliness, or an inability to live entirely independently.
The shared housing programs operated by the County assists low-income individuals 18 years of age
and older in locating roommates to share existing housing in the community; the majority of the
program’s applicants are senior citizens. Services offered include information and referral, outreach,
client counseling, placement and follow-up. Shared housing provides an affordable housing
alternative for many single-person households.
The City of Banning should assist the County in advertising the shared housing program through
placement of program brochures in key locales throughout the community and contacting of
agencies serving seniors to ensure that they make their clients aware of this program.
Timeframe: Current and ongoing
Funding: Low/Moderate-Income Housing Set-Aside Fund
Objective: 10 roommate matches per year.
Policy 2
Encourage both the private and public sectors to produce or assist in the production of high quality
housing to meet the needs of the handicapped, the elderly, large families, female-headed households
and homeless.
Policy 3
Promote the development of low- and moderate-income, and senior citizen housing by allowing
developers density bonuses or other financial incentives for providing units for low- and moderate-
income residents. Provide rental assistance vouchers, as available, for some or all of the affordable
units provided.
Program 3.A Density Bonus:
Pursuant to State density bonus law, if a developer allocates at least 20% of the units in a housing
project to lower income households, 10% for very low-income households, or at least 50% for
“qualifying residents” (e.g. senior citizens), the City must either a) grant a density bonus of 25%,
along with one additional regulatory concession to ensure that the housing development will be
produced at a reduced cost, or b) provide other incentives of equivalent financial value based upon
the land cost per dwelling unit. Regulatory concessions may include such items as reduction in fees,
modified development standards, e.g. parking or allowances for mixed use on a residential property
(see Program 1.12). The developer shall agree to, and the City shall ensure, the continued
affordability of all lower income density bonus units for a minimum 30-year period.
Responsible Agency: Planning Department, Redevelopment Agency
Timeframe: Adopted in 1991; current and ongoing
Funding: General Fund, development fees, Low/Moderate-Income Housing Set-Aside Fund
Objective: Continue implementing “Density Bonuses and Other Incentives for Lower Income and
Senior Housing”, and to annually evaluate the program to ensure the Density Bonuses and Other
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                 III-1 6 4

                                                                                       City Of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
Incentives are effective in encouraging developers to include projects containing housing affordable
to low- or moderate-income households.
Program 3.B Mortgage Revenue Bond Financing:
The County of Riverside has established two revenue bond housing programs to increase the supply
of affordable housing in the County- the Multi-Family Revenue Bond Program and the Single
Family Residential Mortgage Revenue Bond Program. Under these programs, tax-exempt bonds are
issued to provide funds for construction and mortgage loans to encourage developers to provide both
rental and for-sale housing which is affordable to lower income families and individuals.
The Multi-Family Bond Program is designed to make financing available to Developers for the
construction of multi-family residential rental units in the County. In order to receive financing
through the bond program, developers must reserve for 10 years, 20 percent of the units for rental by
families income in Riverside County. In addition, for recent projects, half of the lower income units
must be reserved for occupancy on a priority basis for tenants who generally earn 50 percent or less
of the median income. Projects financed after the passage of the 1986 Tax Reform Act must commit
their 20% designated units for a period of 15 years.
The Single Family Residential Mortgage Revenue Bond Program is designed to provide mortgage
loans to first-time homebuyers whose incomes do not exceed maximum Federal limits. Buyers must
also intend to live in the homes as their principal residence. Mortgage loans offered under the bond
program generally have lower interest rates than conventional loans. Loans are made available for
attached and detached single-family residences primarily in eligible developments at various
locations throughout the County.
Bonds provide a cost-effective mechanism the City can utilize to promote affordable ownership
and/or rental opportunities. The City’s participation in bond financing is limited to: identifying
interested developers of ownership housing (either single family or multifamily) who can inform
purchasers of their homes of this funding source; identifying interested multifamily developers of the
financing opportunity for a rental housing development; and contributing to the administrative costs
of obtaining bonding authority and issuing bonds.
Responsible Agency: Redevelopment Agency
Timeframe: One project each in 2003 and 2004.
Funding: Mortgage Revenue Bonds
Objective: Participate in one bond-funded housing project for ownership housing and one for rental
housing during the five-year period of this Housing Element. To achieve these objectives, Agency
staff will do the following during 2001: meet with representatives of Riverside County to determine
interest in, and feasibility of issuing bonds; reach an agreement on the City/Agency’s financial
participation if a bond issuance is determined to be feasible; promote the availability of the bond
financing within the local development community to generate interest in using this resource to
develop affordable housing units meeting bond program requirements; and refer interested
developers to Riverside County for participation in the program.
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                               III-1 6 5

                                                                                       City Of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
Program 3.C Mortgage Credit Certificate Program:
The County of Riverside has initiated a mortgage credit certificate program for first time
homebuyers. Through the program, qualifying households receive a 20% credit on their annual
home mortgage interest payments over the life of the mortgage.
Responsible Agency: Redevelopment Agency
Timeframe: Current and ongoing
Funding: Mortgage Credit Certificate Program
Objective: The City of Banning will maintain its cooperative agreement with the County for the
mortgage credit certificate program and should assist the County in advertising the program through
distribution of program brochures to local realtors and residential sales offices.
Programs 3.D Affordable Housing Development with a Nonprofit Partner:
A non-profit housing corporation works to develop, conserve and promote affordable housing, either
owner or renter-occupied. Particularly in relation to senior citizens housing (such as HUD Section
202 projects), the non-profit is often a local religious organization interested in developing
affordable housing. The non-profit is often involved with what is called “assisted housing”, where
some type of government assistance (such as Section 8) is provided to the individual household to
keep rents affordable. Prior nonprofit agency activities were administered in conjunction with the
Banning Partners for a Revitalized Community, which is no longer active. One Program, the
Homebuyers Assistance Program, was eliminated in 1995 because of reductions in tax increment
funds to the Agency and the priority of other programs that emphasized housing rehabilitation and
neighborhood preservation.
The Redevelopment Agency will solicit participation by one or more new nonprofit housing
organizations interested in developing affordable housing in Banning. A Draft Five-Year
Implementation Plan (1999-2004) for the Downtown and Midway Redevelopment Project Areas has
been adopted. A portion of the Plan calls for a cooperative effort between the Redevelopment
Agency and a local chapter of the Habitat for Humanity. The Redevelopment Agency will explore
opportunities to construct affordable housing with non-profit housing developer.
Responsible Agency: Redevelopment Agency
Timeframe: Identify and meet with nonprofit organization representatives by June 2001; establish
partnering arrangement by December 2001.
Funding: Depends on nonprofit program activities/projects, but could include federal Section 8
Program, Section 202 Program, Mortgage Bonds, Redevelopment Agency Low/Moderate-Income
Housing Set-Aside funds, HOME Program funds
Objective: Establish ongoing working relationship with at least one nonprofit organization to
administer housing programs and/or affordable housing developments
Program 3.E Section 8 Rental Assistance Payment/Housing Vouchers:
The Section 8 rental assistance program extends rental subsides to low-income families and elderly
which spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent. The subsidy represents the difference
between the excess of 30 percent of the monthly income and the actual rent. The vouchers program
is similar to Section 8 Program, although participants receive housing. Unlike in the certificate
program, participants are permitted to rent units beyond the federally determined fair market rent in
an area, provided the tenant pays the extra rent increment. Rental assistance not only addresses
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                               III-1 6 6

                                                                                          City Of Banning
                                                                                              General Plan
housing affordability, but also overcrowding by allowing families, which may be “coupling up” to
afford their own housing.
It is impossible to predict the number of additional housing vouchers or certificates that will become
available to residents of Banning, as the Section 8 Programs is administered by the Riverside County
Housing Authority and federal funding levels are determined on an annual basis. The City can
facilitate use of Section 8 program by encouraging apartment owners to list available rental units
with the County Housing Authority for potential occupancy by tenants receiving Section 8
certificates.
Responsible Agency: Redevelopment Agency
Timeframe: Current and ongoing
Funding: Federal Section 8 Programs
Objective: N/A
Policy 4
Require that housing constructed expressly for low- and moderate-income households not be
concentrated in any single portion of the City.
Policy 5
Continue to coordinate with local social service providers, such as HELP, to address the needs of the
City's homeless population. Permit the development of emergency shelters in commercial and
industrial zones, and transitional housing in residential zones in locations close to services, subject to
a Conditional Use Permit.
Program 5.A Sites for Homeless Shelters/Transitional Housing:
The City of Banning has, in years past, estimated the homeless population at up to ten persons at any
given time. There is no current and reliable estimate of the number of homeless individuals from
Banning, however. Based on Banning’s location astride a major interstate highway, combined with
the railway, which runs through the City, Banning receives a number of individuals and families who
become stranded as a result of transportation difficulties. While the City contributes to a local motel
vouchers, there remains an unmet need for emergency shelter in the community.
Housing Element policy calls for the City to continue to coordinate with local social service
providers, such as local churches, to address the needs of the homeless. In addition, the City will
amend its Zoning Ordinance to permit the development of transitional housing in multi-family
residential zones in locations close to services, and to permit emergency shelters in commercial and
industrial zones, subject to Conditional Use Permit.
Under the City’s conditional use permit process, the City examines the location, design,
configuration, and potential impact of the proposed use by comparing the use the established
development standards for the zone in which the use will be located. To approve a conditional use,
the Planning Commission must make the following findings that the proposed use:
     •   will not impair the integrity and character of the zone
     •   is appropriate based on the physical characteristics of the site
     •   is consistent with the General Plan
                                                                                 Community Development
                                                                                                  III-1 6 7

                                                                                         City Of Banning
                                                                                             General Plan
    •   is compatible with the scale, mass, coverage, and density of adjacent land uses
    •   will not be detrimental to public health with respect to water, sanitation, and public utilities
    •   includes adequate public access to the site
    •   will not harm desirable neighborhood characteristics
    •   will not cause significant harm to environmental quality or natural resources
    •   includes appropriate mitigations to address potentially adverse impacts
    •   will not be detrimental to the public interest, health, or safety based on size, design, or
        operating characteristics
To assist potential homeless and transitional housing and service providers, the City will undertake
an analysis of potential locations meetings these CUP criteria that may be suitable for such uses.
Responsible Agency: Planning Department
Timeframe: City staff to conduct analysis of potential locations and prepare Zoning Ordinance
amendments by September 2001; City Council to adopt by December 2001
Funding: General Fund
Objective: Designation of specific zones in which emergency and transitional facilities will be
permitted
Policy 6
Encourage the development of residential units which are accessible to handicapped persons or are
adaptable for conversion to residential use by handicapped persons.
Policy 7
Locate higher density residential development in close proximity to public transportation, services
and recreation.
Policy 8
Permit the development of childcare facilities concurrent with new housing development.
Policy 9
Monitor all regulations, ordinances, departmental processing procedures and fees related to the
rehabilitation and/or construction of dwelling units to assess their impact on housing costs.
Program 9.A Efficient Processing:
The evaluation and review process required by the City procedures contributes to the cost of housing
costs incurred by developers are ultimately reflected in the unit’s selling price. In order to minimize
project holding costs, The City should streamline its review procedures to the greatest extent
possible and without compromising adequate review.
The City will provide a one-stop process for a developer with an affordable housing project. An
interagency approval process system will be established to include the City Planning, Building,
Public Works and Fire Departments. A designated individual within the Planning Department will
act as the project manager, or liaison, for the participating City departments and the applicant. A
timeframe with milestones for development approval will be established for each project to ensure
processing in a timely manner. The City will also prepare a permit handbook that explains the
permits process and application requirements.
                                                                                 Community Development
                                                                                                 III-1 6 8

                                                                                         City Of Banning
                                                                                             General Plan
Timeframe: Establish interdepartmental coordination, revised permit application forms, and permit
handbook by December 2001
Funding: Permit fees
Objective: Improve permit processing efficiency and reduce permit processing time.
Program 9.B Development Fees:
Various fees and assessments are charged by the City to cover the costs of processing permits and
providing services and facilities. While almost all these fees are assessed on a pro rata share system,
they often contribute to the cost of housing and constrain the development of lower priced units.
Program 9.A, “Efficient Processing” addresses fee schedules for affordable housing and senior
citizen projects. Program 9.B “ Development Fees” addresses development and processing fees.”
The City intends to keep fees low to provide for infrastructure development. The City will do so by
annually reviewing its fees to make sure they are affordable compared to other communities.
Responsible Agency: Planning Department
Timeframe: Current and ongoing
Funding: Development fees
Objective: Maintain development fees at a level commensurate with the services and facilities
needed to meet community standards
Program 9.C Zoning Ordinance:
The City of Banning had developed a comprehensive Zoning Ordinance to implement its General
Plan. The following regulations in the City’s Municipal Code facilitate the conservation and
development of affordable housing:
     •  Provisions for specific plans, which provide for flexibility in density and mix of land uses
        was added to the Zoning Ordinance in 1982.
     •  Provisions for manufactured housing and mobile home development in single-family zones
        have been in place since 1983.
     •  Provisions for second units on single-family lots were included in the Zoning Ordinance in
        2005.
The City will continue implementing these Zoning Ordinance provisions, with the following
changes:
     •  Amend the Zoning Ordinance to eliminate occupancy restrictions relating to family status as
        long as the secondary unit meets minimum development standards set forth in the Zoning
        Ordinance.
     •  Amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow for reduced parking for any affordable housing
        development which can demonstrate that (a) the modified standards will meet the objectives
        of the City’s parking requirements; (b) are necessary for the financial feasibility of the
        project; (c), parking standards for affordable housing will be modified, based on the number
        of bedrooms, to reflect actual parking demand in the proposed project location. The City
        will permit, as appropriate on a case-by-case basis, parking alternatives that meet
        development guidelines for screening of parking from public view.
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                 III-1 6 9

                                                                                          City Of Banning
                                                                                              General Plan
    •   Amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow mixed-use residential/commercial structures without
        limiting housing to one unit occupied by an owner or operator of the business to which the
        housing unit is attached. The amendment should also include parking standards to ensure
        that the presence of housing in a mixed-use structure does not result in on-street parking
        during regular business hours by residents of the housing portion of the structure.
Responsible Agency: Planning Department
Timeframe: Staff to prepare Zoning Ordinance amendments by August 2001; to adopt by
December 2001.
Funding: General Fund
Objective: Improve permit processing efficiency and reduce permit processing time.
Policy 10
Encourage the use of energy conservation devices and passive design concepts which make use of
the natural climate to increase energy efficiency and reduce housing costs.
Policy 11
Provide opportunities for move-up housing in Banning.
Goal 2: Maintenance and Preservation
Enhance the quality of existing residential neighborhoods in Banning.
The goal of housing preservation is to protect the existing and investment in housing and to avoid a
degree of physical decline that will require a larger rehabilitation effort to restore quality and value.
The housing conditions survey identified a concentrated area of deferred housing maintenance in the
City’s central core and East Banning in particular. Housing rehabilitation efforts will continue to be
focused in this area to facilitate unit upgrading.
Policies
Policy 1
Correct housing deficiencies through the development of a residential rehabilitation program.
Program 1.1 Home Improvement Program:
The Riverside County Community Development Department administers a Home Improvement
Program to provide loans to eligible lower income families for necessary home repair and
rehabilitation work, including room additions to alleviate overcrowding. The Program provides low
interest loans, deferred payment loans, and loans for mobile-home repair. Cooperating cities transfer
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, and any other targeted funding, to the County
for implementation of home Improvement Programs in their jurisdiction. The County tailors
rehabilitation programs to meet the specific needs of cooperating cities. This program was formerly
administered in conjunction with the Banning Partners for a Revitalized Community, which is no
longer active.
A new program, along the same lines, has been established and administered by the Banning
Redevelopment Agency and works in conjunction with the Riverside County program. The Housing
Exterior Rehabilitation Assistance Program (ERA) assists low- and moderately low-income
                                                                                  Community Development
                                                                                                  III-1 7 0

                                                                                       City Of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
households in upgrading the exterior of their home. The Program provides funds up to $7,500 per
property for the improvements such as new roofs, paint and yard clean up.
Responsible Agency: Redevelopment Agency
Timeframe: Current and ongoing
Funding: Low/Moderate-Income Housing Set-Aside funds.
Objective: Rehabilitate 15 dwelling units per year (75 over 5 years)
Policy 2
Continue to utilize the City's code enforcement program to bring substandard units into compliance
with City codes and to improve overall housing conditions in Banning.
Program 2.A Code Enforcement:
The objective of the City’s code enforcement program is to bring substandard housing units into
compliance with City codes. Potential code violations are identified based on complaints reported to
the City, and often through property maintenance inspections. If the structure appears unsound, a
City building official will schedule a meeting to inspect the residence and prepare a written notice as
to any existing deficiencies. The property owner is given a reasonable time frame in which to
respond, and is given extra time if progress is demonstrated. The City will continue its sensitive
enforcement of residential Building codes, and will inform property owners in violation of City
codes of any rehabilitation assistance he/she may be eligible for in correcting code violations.
To implement this Program, the City will fund a half-time position for a Neighborhood Code
Enforcement Officer. This individual will identify problems throughout the City and work with
property owners to resolve code and property maintenance issues. The Neighborhood Code
Enforcement Officer will have training in the Uniform Building Code and other applicable model
codes as well as knowledge of housing rehabilitation standards.
Timeframe: Establish pilot program for a two-year period, beginning fiscal year 2001/2002.
Report to the City Council July 1, 2003 on the usefulness of the program in reducing substandard
properties
Funding: Low/Moderate-Income Housing Set-Aside funds
Objective: Depends on demand for the program and the number of complaints
Policy 3
Minimize the displacement impacts occurring as a result of residential demolition.
Policy 4
Promote increased awareness among property owners and residents of the importance of property
maintenance to long-term housing quality.
Program 4.A Purchase of Abandoned Homes:
To upgrade and revitalize blighted neighborhoods and deteriorated residential units, the City of
Banning Redevelopment Agency will purchase abandoned homes and provide necessary
rehabilitation. This program was formerly administered in conjunction with the Banning Partners
for a Revitalized Community, which is no longer active. A new program, along the same lines, had
been administered by the Banning Redevelopment Agency. The Redevelopment Agency and HUD
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                III-1 7 1

                                                                                        City Of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan

Timeframe: Current and ongoing
Funding: Low/Moderate-Income Housing Set-Aside funds; CDBG funds
Objective: Rehabilitate 5 units per year (25 units over 5 years)
Policy 5
Encourage the use of rehabilitation funds for room additions to alleviate overcrowding, and for
accessibility improvements to address the needs of the handicapped.
Policy 6
Educate property owners on the benefits of home repair and remodeling using design and materials
consistent with the historic character of the residence.
Goal 3: Environmental Sensitivity
Ensure that new housing is sensitive to existing development as well as the natural environment.
It is an on-going concern in the City to ensure that residential growth is sensitive to environmental
and social needs of the community. Development will be accommodated which is coordinated with
available community resources and infrastructure, and which is designed to minimize impacts on the
natural environment.
Policies
Policy 1
Ensure that multi-family development is compatible in design with single-family residential areas.
Policy 2.
Regularly examine new residential construction methods and materials, and upgrade the City's
residential building standards as appropriate.
Policy 3
Prohibit new residential development to front on major arterial highways without adequate setbacks
and buffering.
Policy 4
Prohibit housing development in areas subject to significant geologic, flooding, blowsand, noise and
fire hazards.
Policy 5
Accommodate new residential development which is coordinated with the provision of infrastructure
and public services.
                                                                               Community Development
                                                                                                III-1 7 2
                                                                                        City Of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
Program 5.A Site Suitability Criteria:
The City will continue to use the Design Review Process (Article 16E of the Zoning Ordinance) to
evaluate site suitability. Under design review criteria, housing should be located on sites that are
physically adequate and environmentally suitable for such development and compatible with existing
nearby development. These criteria will provide a yardstick for the City to identify and evaluate
potential sites for environmentally sound housings. Criteria for this housing will be implemented
through the City’s Zoning Ordinance. Criteria for grading the suitability of sites may include the
following:
    •   services available to the site (e.g., public transportation essential shopping facilities,
        education facilities, etc.);
    • neighborhood characteristics (e.g., adjacent land uses, proximity to employment
        opportunities, environmental consideration, noise levels, etc.); and
    • physical aspects of the Site (e.g., topography, off-site improvements, etc.).
Responsible Agency: Planning Department
Timeframe: Current and ongoing
Funding: Development fees
Objective: Ensure that all new development comply with site suitability criteria
Policy 6
Encourage the use of energy conservation devices and passive design concepts which make use of
the natural climate to increase energy efficiency and reduce housing
Goal 4: Fair Housing
Promote equal opportunity for all residents to reside in the housing of their choice. In order to make
adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community, the City must
ensure equal and fair housing opportunities are available to all residents.
Policies
Policy 1
Affirm a positive action posture which will assure that unrestricted access is available to the
community.
Policy 2
Prohibit practices which restrict housing choice by arbitrarily directing prospective buyers and
renters to certain neighborhoods or types of housing.
Policy 3
Continue support and participation in the Riverside County New Horizons' Fair Housing Program to
further spatial deconcentration and fair housing practices.
Program 3.A Equal Housing Opportunity Services:
The County of Riverside established the New Horizons’ Fair Housing Program which provides a
broad range of services such as: education on fair housing laws, referrals to public agencies on
discrimination matters, coordination of training work shops, and publishing a newsletter on fair
                                                                                Community Development
                                                                                                III-1 7 3

                                                                                      City Of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
housing activities. The activities also include news releases to the media, and distribution of
information to the housing industry, apartment managers, and rental agencies. The Fair Housing
Division provides assistance to the housing industry in voluntary affirmative marketing programs,
shows, and conventions. The establishment of a Fair Housing Program with goals, and objectives
and the participation of other responsible agencies of the County, attains implementation of various
strategies, to increase availability of housing to low- and moderate-income families and individuals
through advocacy and non-discriminatory policies.
The County’s Fair Housing Program also incorporates the Community Housing Resource Board
(CHRB) program component. The CHRB is designed to work with the real estate and building
industry to implement and monitor the activities of the National Voluntary Affirmative Marketing
Agreement (VAMA), in the areas of rental, sales, advertising, training and recruitment. The
qualification of program achievement can only be measured through the settlement of disputes and
the prevention of resident dislocation, loss of occupied units, and stabilized vacancy factors as a
result of the efforts of the Fair Housing Program.
The City’s role in supporting the County’s Fair Housing Program is to provide information on the
program to interested individuals, host fair housing events, and refer individuals with fair housing
complaints to a program representative.
Responsible Agency: Redevelopment Agency
Timeframe: Current and ongoing
Funding: CDBG, County funds
Objective: Promote equal housing opportunity; educate the public, real estate industry
representatives, lenders, and property owners on fair housing requirements; promptly refer and
resolve fair housing disputes.
                                                                               Community Development

WATER RESOURCES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Water Resources Element addresses water quality, availability and conservation for the
City’s current and future needs. The Element also discusses the importance of on-going
coordination and cooperation between the City, Banning Heights Mutual Water Company, High
Valley Water District, San Gorgonio Pass Water Agency and other agencies responsible for
supplying water to the region. Topics include the ground water replenishment program,
consumptive demand of City residents, and wastewater management and its increasingly
important role in the protection of ground water resources. The goals, policies and programs set
forth in this element direct staff and other City officials in the management of this essential
resource.
BACKGROUND
The Water Resources Element is directly related to the Land Use Element, in considering the
availability of water resources to meet the land use plan; and has a direct relationship to the
Flooding and Hydrology Element, in its effort to protect and enhance groundwater recharge.
Water issues are also integral components of the following elements: Police and Fire Protection,
Economic Development, Emergency Preparedness, and Water, Wastewater and Utilities.
The Water Resources Element addresses topics set forth in California Government Code Section
65302(d). Also, in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Section
21083.2(g), the City is empowered to require that adequate research and documentation be
conducted when the potential for significant impacts to water and other important resources
exists.
Watersheds
The westernmost part of the planning area is located at the summit of the San Gorgonio Pass,
which divides two major watersheds: the San Jacinto River Watershed to the west and the Salton
Sea watershed to the east. The majority of the City drains east into the Salton Sea Watershed.
The drainage divide generally runs north-south near Highland Springs Avenue, ending in the San
Bernardino Mountains to the north and the San Jacinto Mountains to the south. Elevations within
the planning area rise to approximately 5,560 feet to the north and 2,880 feet to the south. East of
the divide, in the southeast portion of the planning area, elevations fall to approximately 1940
feet. The southern portions of the planning area are located on the floor of the San Gorgonio
Pass, with the northern portions extending into the San Bernardino Mountains. The San
Gorgonio River has cut through this area, forming the Banning Canyon. Adjoining the Banning
Canyon to the west is a plateau referred to as the Banning Bench.
                                                                             Environmental Resources
                                                                                                 IV-1

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
History of Water Claims
The first recorded claims to waters of Banning Canyon date back to 1875. The Banning Water
Company was incorporated in 1884 to provide for delivery of domestic and irrigation water to
various customers in the City. In 1913 the Banning Water Company began to operate as a public
utility under the rules of the Railroad Commission (now Public Utilities Commission). In 1957,
an order was issued establishing rates for both general metered services and measured irrigation
services. The City of Banning acquired the Banning Water Company in 1967. In 1997 the City of
Banning purchased the Mountain Water Company. The City of Banning provides water services
to all areas of the City except for the northern portion, which is serviced by the Banning Heights
Mutual Water Company.
The Banning Heights Mutual Water Company serves the Banning Bench extending through
Banning Canyon. The source of water for this agency is a concrete flume that starts high in the
San Bernardino Mountains at the northern most end of the Banning Canyon, diverting water
from the source of the Whitewater River to the Banning Heights Mutual Water Company
treatment plant. This company diverts water from the Whitewater River by a pipe/reservoir
system to their service area on the Banning Bench. Their largest user of water is crop irrigation.
WATER RESOURCES
The City of Banning is within the boundary of the Coachella Valley Hydrologic Unit. The
Coachella Valley Groundwater Basin is underlain by several large subsurface aquifers, known as
subbasins, with boundaries that are generally defined by faults that restrict the lateral movement
of water. The Basin extends from Banning easterly to the Salton Sea. The City of Banning is
underlain by the San Gorgonio Pass Subbasin. Within the City boundary, the San Gorgonio Pass
Subbasin is divided into a series of storage units: the Banning Canyon Storage Unit, the Banning
Bench Storage Unit, the East and West Banning Storage Units, the Beaumont Storage Unit, and
the Cabazon Storage Unit. To the west of the San Gorgonio Pass Subbasin is the Beaumont
Groundwater Basin.
Groundwater basins are naturally recharged through the percolation of runoff, direct
precipitation, subsurface inflow, and artificial recharge. The Banning Canyon area receives water
from percolation of canyon flows through the gravelly soils of the canyon bottom. In addition, a
stone ditch running southerly though the Banning Canyon provides intake areas to distribute
water to spreading ditches, which interconnect with spreading ponds to enhance percolation. The
San Gorgonio Subbasin is also recharged naturally with runoff from the adjacent San Jacinto and
San Bernardino Mountains.
San Gorgonio Pass Subbasin
The San Gorgonio Pass Subbasin is the westerly most subbasin of the Coachella Valley
Hydrologic Unit. Approximately 15 miles long, this subbasin is located in an east-west trending
narrow valley between the San Jacinto and San Bernardino Mountains. Beaumont is at the
western end of the subbasin, just outside the summit of the drainage area. From the summit, the
basin drains most of the pass area tributary to the Coachella Valley. A prominent bedrock ridge
projecting from the flank of the San Jacinto Peak creates a constriction in the basin, defining the
subbasin boundary at the east end of the San Gorgonio Pass.
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                  IV-2
                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
The floor of the pass contains coarse sandy alluvial fill throughout most of its area. West of the
City, the pass is underlain by deeply weathered, coarse, alluvial soil that is being eroded by
streams. The San Gorgonio Pass Subbasin occurs as an unconfined groundwater body, with
depth to groundwater ranging from 100 to 500 feet.
Historically, the City’s main water source for groundwater has been wells in the Banning
Canyon, which includes the Upper and Middle Banning Canyon Basins. According to the City of
Banning 2002 Water System Hydraulic Modeling Report, groundwater wells in Banning Canyon
were producing 2,000 gallons per minute (gpm) in 2002, with a capacity to produce as much as
10,000 gpm, and had experienced flows of 4,500 gpm as recently as 2001. The depth to
groundwater in the Banning Canyon Storage unit ranges between 8 and 160 feet below the
ground surface (fbgs). The City currently operates 8 wells with a combined capacity of 4,000
gpm in this storage unit. The total possible extraction from this storage unit is 5.8 million gallons
per day (mgd).
Upper Banning Canyon Basin
The Upper Banning Canyon Basin is located in the northern most portion of the City and is
partially located in the County of San Bernardino. Static water levels in this basin range from 8
to 75 fbgs. The City currently operates 4 wells with a combined capacity of 2,000 gpm in this
area. The total possible extraction from this storage unit is 2.88 million mgd.
Middle Banning Canyon Basin
The Middle Banning Canyon Basin is located south of the Upper Banning Canyon Basin.
Groundwater levels throughout the Middle Banning Canyon Basin typically respond rapidly to
precipitation and recharge because of the high permeability and limited groundwater storage in
this basin. Bedrock in this portion of the canyon is located approximately 200 feet below the
ground surface, with groundwater depths ranging from 25 feet to 160 feet below the surface. The
City currently operates 4 wells with a combined capacity of 2,000 gpm in this area. The total
possible extraction from this storage unit is 2.88 million mgd.
Banning Bench Storage Unit
The Banning Bench Storage Unit (also known as the Lower Banning Canyon Basin) is the
southern most storage unit in the Banning Canyon. This storage unit is located north of the City
in an area of alluvial fill distinctly higher than that of the San Gorgonio Pass area, against the
rugged foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains. The Banning Bench is 160 feet high and
approximately 1.5 miles wide above the stream channel at the mouth of the San Gorgonio River
Canyon. Groundwater from this storage unit tends to flow south into the Banning and Beaumont
Storage Units. Depth to groundwater within this storage unit ranges from 50 feet to 100 feet. The
City operates 3 wells in the Banning Bench Storage Unit, with a combined capacity of 1,800
gpm. Total possible extraction from this storage unit is 2.6 mgd.
East Banning Storage Unit
The Banning Storage Unit is located south of the Banning Bench Storage Unit, immediately
north and south of I-10, near the City’s downtown and East of the McMullen Fault. This storage
unit encompasses approximately 7.6 square miles and serves the area at the base of the Banning
                                                                               Environmental Resources
                                                                                                  IV-3

                                                                                                City of Banning

Bench and the southern portion of the City. Depth to groundwater within this storage unit ranges
from 398 feet to 530 feet. The City operates 1 well in the East Banning Storage Unit with a
capacity of 1,000 gpm. Total possible extraction from this storage unit is 1.4 mgd.
West Banning Storage Unit
The West Banning Storage Unit is located west of the East Banning Storage Unit, south of the
Banning Bench Storage Unit, immediately north and south of I-10, west of the City’s downtown
and the McMullen Fault. This storage unit encompasses approximately 4.4 square miles and
serves the area at the base of the Banning Bench and the southwestern portion of the City. Depth
to groundwater within this storage unit ranges from 310 feet to 350 feet. The City operates 5
wells in the West Banning Storage Unit with a combined capacity of 4,500 gpm. Total possible
extraction from this storage unit is 6.5 mgd.
Beaumont Storage Unit
The Beaumont Storage Unit covers approximately 28.0 square miles, bounded on the north by
Cherry Valley and on the south, east and west by postulated faults of the Banning Fault System.
A portion of the Beaumont Storage Unit is located in the Banning City limits, though this storage
unit is primarily located within the City of Beaumont. Both the Beaumont-Cherry Valley Water
District and the City of Banning pump water from this storage unit. Depth to groundwater within
this storage unit ranges from 373 feet to 395 feet. The City operates 5 wells in the Beaumont
Storage Unit with a combined capacity of 6,000 gpm. The City is adjudicated to withdraw
approximately 4,000 acre-feet annually from this storage unit1. Total possible extraction from
this storage unit is 8.6 mgd.
Cabazon Storage Unit
The Cabazon Storage Unit encompasses approximately 11 square miles. The Cabazon Storage
Unit is located in the Hathaway and Potrero Sub Units near the eastern boundary of the City,
southeast of the Banning Bench Storage Unit and northeast of the Banning Storage Unit. The
City does not currently operate any wells in the Cabazon Storage Unit.

The City provides water to its customers with water produced from local groundwater wells, as
there is no current source of imported water available to the City. However, facilities have
recently been constructed to convey State Water Program (SWP) water to the Beaumont-
Banning area for groundwater recharge, agriculture or processed for potable use. Groundwater
recharge in the region is possible with the SWP facilities, in addition to the continued recharge
from natural runoff and percolation.
Areas of low permeability, fault barriers and constrictions in basin profiles limit the movement
of groundwater. To assure a continuous supply of domestic water to meet demand, ground water
replenishment programs have been proposed and wastewater reclamation strategies have been
implemented.
As demonstrated above, City of Banning currently operates and maintains 22 potable
groundwater production wells. Most of these wells are located in the Banning Canyon, with the
remaining wells in the East and West Banning Storage Units and the Beaumont Storage Unit.
The City also has 6 unequipped wells located in the East and West Banning Storage Units and
the Beaumont Storage Unit.
The Banning Heights Mutual Water Company provides water services to the northern half of the
planning area. Water delivered to its service area is primarily utilized for irrigation, and
originates from the Whitewater River.

WATER DEMAND
The City of Banning currently relies on groundwater that is recharged by precipitation and runoff
from the adjacent mountains. Hydrographs dating back to 1964 indicate the historic steady
decline of the water table and the apparent lack of seasonal fluctuations in the San Gorgonio
Subbasin. Records of average water use for the past 13 years (1991 through 2003) are shown in
the following table.

Depletion of the groundwater in storage has continued with the expansion of development of the
City of Banning. Groundwater pumped by the City is used primarily for domestic purposes and
golf course irrigation. Water pumped by the Banning Heights Mutual Water Agency is used
primarily for domestic purposes and irrigation.
The total amount of groundwater in storage within the City of Banning area, including the
Beaumont Storage Unit, is estimated between 1.4 and 2.6 million acre feet.3 Groundwater
production by the City of Banning is increasing at a rate of approximately 180 af/yr.4 The
increase production, combined with the below average rainfall from 1999 through 2003 has led
to declines in the groundwater levels in the Banning subunits. This depletion of groundwater in
the Banning area has led to a condition known as overdraft, in which the demand for
groundwater exceeds the amount of recharge into the groundwater basin over a period of time.

Overdraft conditions can result in significant adverse social, environmental and economic
impacts, including an increased potential for land subsidence, which can result in ground
fissuring and damage to buildings, sidewalks, and subsurface pipelines. Other adverse impacts
resulting from overdraft include increased infrastructure and energy costs associated with drilling
deeper wells and installing larger pumps, and the threat of a diminishing long-term water supply.
In order to avoid an overdraft condition, a maximum perennial yield that ranges from 6,500 to
10,400 acre-feet per year was calculated for the existing water sources in the planning area.5 The
maximum perennial yield is defined as the maximum amount of ground water that can be
extracted on an average annual basis without causing environmental damage or adverse impacts.
Table IV-3 below lists the maximum perennial yield for the planning area by subunit.

In order to determine the total capacity of the City’s existing water sources, the current annual
demand and the City’s existing land use mix were determined, divided between residential and
other uses. The resulting percentage was then applied to the 2003 demand for water of 10,053, to
establish the water usage by land use type. The Table below describes the number of residential
units and the amount of commercial acreage which can be built in the City within both the low
and the high range of the perennial yield shown in Table IV-3, above.

Table IV-4 shows that without the use of the Beaumont Storage unit, an additional 239 to 1,997
residential units and 130 to 353 acres of commercial/industrial land may be built in the City
within the maximum perennial yield for its water resources. In addition, the Beaumont Storage
Unit can accommodate an additional 2,484 residential units and 191 acres of
commercial/industrial land. In total, therefore, 2,723 to 4,481 residential units and 322 to 544
acres of commercial/industrial land can be constructed in the City without the use of additional
water sources.
ADDITIONAL WATER SOURCES
Imported Water
The San Gorgonio Pass Water Agency (SGPWA) is currently working in cooperation with the
San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District and the California Department of Water
Resources Division of Engineering to construct the East Branch Extension Project of the State
Water Project (SWP). The East Branch Extension Phase I has been completed and may bring up
to 8,650 acre-feet per year (af/y) of water to the San Gorgonio Pass Subbasin. A Phase II is
planned, and would bring an additional 8,650 af/y of water to the subbasin. SGPWA plans to use
                                                                                      Environmental Resources

                                                                                          General Plan
the imported water to recharge the Beaumont Storage Unit, via the Noble Creek spreading
grounds in Cherry Valley. The City is entitled to 3,287 af/y per phase, for a total of 6,574 af/y.
The SWP water may be used for any combination of uses, including aquifer recharge, irrigation,
or, with treatment, potable uses.
Reclaimed Water
The City of Banning Wastewater Reclamation Plant is located at 2242 East Charles Street. The
City contracts with United Water Services for the operation and maintenance of the water
reclamation plant. Recent upgrades of the plant resulted in an increase in secondary treatment
capacity to 3.6 mgd, including the addition of several plant parts that could accommodate future
capacity to approximately 5.8 mgd. On a daily basis, the plant receives an average flow of
approximately 2.3–2.4 mgd.
The City has considered the use of recycled water sources to provide additional supplies to those
customers that could use reclaimed water for irrigation. These users include golf courses and
landscaped areas of new homes, and could also include Caltrans and Banning Unified School
District irrigation. A design has been completed on an irrigation pipeline that would allow the
City to deliver reclaimed water to irrigation customers. Phase I of the City’s proposed recycled
water system would make 3.6 mgd (4,033 af/y) available for irrigation purposes. In addition,
Phase II of the City’s proposed recycled water system would make an additional 3.0 mgd (3,361
af/y) available for irrigation. Reclaimed water from the City’s wastewater treatment plant and
untreated SWP water from SGPWA constitute the potential supplies of non-potable water
currently available to the City. The use of non-potable water could reduce the demand for
potable supplies and help maintain supply reliability.
New technologies are also becoming available which allow individual property owners to reuse
water for irrigation and other non-potable uses. This reuse includes gray water reclamation
systems, which includes the reuse of water from sources such as sink drains, dishwashers and
washing machines for irrigation purposes. These technologies can also be implemented,
independent of City facilities, to augment the City’s reuse of water, thereby increasing overall
conservation. When recycled water from City facilities is made available, those users who have
implemented on-site systems should be encouraged to connect to the City’s facilities.
Total Additional Resources Available
The Table below illustrates the potential additional residential units and commercial/industrial
acreage that could be supported by the SWP and recycled water programs, when implemented.

WATER QUALITY
Groundwater quality is dependent upon a number of factors, including the water source, type of
water-bearing materials in which the water occurs, water depth, proximity to faults, presence of
surface contaminants, and quality of well maintenance. Drillers’ logs indicate very coarse and
poorly sorted materials more than 1,000 feet thick in the San Gorgonio Pass Subbasin. However,
west and south of Banning, reddish-brown clayey sands and gravels are present. No wells that
reached bedrock were located within the basin. Water quality in the City of Banning is
considered excellent.
Total Dissolved Solids
Water wells within the Banning Canyon contain a total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration
ranging from 185 to 360 milligrams per liter (mg/L). Studies of these wells indicated that water
quality is within State limits for all chemical constituents, with the exceptions of calcium and
bicarbonate. High bicarbonate levels are typical of runoff from the San Bernardino Mountains. In
general, the TDS concentrations are lowest at the head of Banning Canyon at 185 to 200 mg/L.
At the Canyon’s base and at the valley floor TDS concentrations increase slightly to 185 to 360
mg/L.6
Nitrates
Another impact on area groundwater is contamination associated with long-term discharge from
on-lot septic systems. The Riverside County Health Department and California Regional Water
Quality Control Board have also acknowledged that septic tanks have the potential to adversely
impact groundwater supplies. The greatest impacts to groundwater quality are expected to occur
where septic systems serve large populations in high densities. Well-maintained community
sewer systems provide excellent protection of groundwater resources, as they provide for the
prompt removal of sewage materials.

While much of the development in the City of Banning is connected to the community sewer
system, development in outlying areas continues to utilize individual septic systems. Scattered
residential sites in the northern parts of the City continue to rely on private septic systems for the
disposal of wastewater. Many of these systems will be abandoned over time, as future
development occurs and infrastructure is expanded.
WATER QUALITY REGULATION
A variety of federal and state legislation has been enacted to assure adequate planning,
implementation and enforcement of water quality control efforts. Federal water quality
legislation includes the Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
State statutes and administrative laws applicable to water quality include the California Water
Code, California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), California Code of Regulations, and other
codes such as the Health and Safety Code, Fish and Game Code and Public Resources Code.
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB) implements federal and state
laws pertaining to water quality. In the San Gorgonio Pass area, the CRWQCB primarily
addresses issues regarding agricultural drainage, impacts of geothermal power, and concerns
about the Salton Sea, Tahquitz Creek and other sources of surface water. The CRWQCB also
monitors leaking fuel storage tanks, illegal discharges of human or animal waste, and sites on
which hazardous and toxic materials have been inappropriately disposed.
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) implements the federal Clean
Water Act and was adopted in 1990. The NPDES mandates that plans and programs for storm
water management be developed, adopted and implemented to assure that municipalities
“effectively prohibit non-storm water discharge into the storm drain and require controls to
reduce the discharge of pollutants from storm water systems to waters of the United States to the
maximum extent possible.” Pollutant control measures are exempt from CEQA analysis. The
City of Banning Public Works Department manages the city’s NPDES program.
WATER CONSERVATION EFFORTS
With increasing demands on water supplies in the City of Banning, efforts to reduce per capita
consumption are a priority. One of the best opportunities for water conservation is the
implementation of water-efficient landscaping design and management. The City has adopted a
Water-Efficient Landscape Ordinance, as required by the California Water Conservation in
Landscaping Act of 1990. The ordinance establishes minimum water-efficient landscape
requirements for all new and rehabilitated public and private landscape projects. It requires that
project proponents submit landscape palettes to the Planning Department for approval. It also
requires that construction plans, grading plans, irrigation design plans and landscape
maintenance schedules be submitted for review and approval by the Public Works Department.
In some cases, landscape irrigation audits and soils analyses are required. The City also complies
with State law, which since 1992 has mandated the installation of low-flush toilets and low-flow
showerheads and faucets in new construction.
                                                                                Environmental Resources
                                                                                                   IV-13

                                                                                    City of Banning
                                                                                       General Plan
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The conservation and wise use of water resources will continue to be a central theme of
community development planning in southern California. The City of Banning has developed
programs that encourage and/or require water-efficient landscaping and irrigation design, as well
as water-conserving home appliances and fixtures. The City can also implement new
technologies as they become available and improve existing facilities in order to improve water
conservation efforts. Finally, the continued education of residents and business people in water
conservation will also aid in preserving the resource for future generations. The City is
committed to assuring that development occurs only at levels which assure that water resources
are sustained, and will not allow development to exceed the water resource’s capacity.
Groundwater subbasins do not respect jurisdictional boundaries, and the threat of groundwater
pollution or contamination must be viewed from both a regional and local perspective. Effective
storm water management will help protect groundwater quality, and protection of the region’s
major mountain watersheds will help assure long-term natural recharge to the San Gorgonio Pass
Subbasin and the respective groundwater storage units.
Additional long-term sources for ground water will need to be secured for the future
development of the City. These sources may include additional water diversion from the
Whitewater River, additional wells located in the Hathaway and Potrero subunits, and the as
much as 6,574 acre-feet per year from the State Water Project. In addition, the construction of
the City’s recycled water system may contribute a total of 7,394 acre-feet per year for irrigation
purposes, which would allow additional existing ground water resources to be used for potable
uses. Since the need for additional water capacity will be generated by new development, it
should be new development’s responsibility to provide additional water for their projects.

OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Open Space and Conservation Element is to provide for the comprehensive
and long-term preservation and conservation of natural resources and open space lands located
within the General Plan study area. The Element addresses protection and conservation of
natural resources, including water, mineral and scenic resources. Conservation of natural
resources and the provision and preservation of open space are important and necessary to
maintaining a balanced and healthy community. As the City and the Pass region continue to
grow and develop, thoughtful planning and resource management become increasingly important
in helping to conserve natural resources and open space lands. One of the major objectives of
the General Plan is to preserve and enhance the community, and to ensure that long-term growth
within the City and its environs does not adversely affect environmental resources.
The policies and programs set forth in this element will serve as tools to create a productive
harmony between existing and future development and the continued safeguarding of important
natural resources and undisturbed open space areas. They also function to assure the long-term
viability of open space and conservation lands by discouraging the premature or inappropriate
conversion of these lands to urban uses.
Since conservation and open space are closely related, they have been integrated into one
comprehensive element of the General Plan. The requirements of state law result in conservation
elements that are oriented toward the management of natural resources to prevent waste,
destruction or neglect. The Open Space Element emphasizes open space as a land use, and
requires that preservation and management of natural resources be considered in land use
planning and decision-making. This combined Open Space and Conservation Element describes
conservation practices and open space lands, thereby meeting the requirements of both elements
under law.
BACKGROUND
The broad and wide-ranging nature of the issues and subjects within this Element relate directly
and indirectly to many other elements of this General Plan. This Element has direct influence on
policies and programs set forth in the Land Use and Circulation Elements. Other elements
directly related to this Element include the Parks and Recreation, Biological and Cultural
Resources, Water Resources and Geotechnical Elements.
Open space land is generally defined as any parcel or area of land or water that is essentially
unimproved and devoted to an open space use. Open space areas are mainly lands designated for
the preservation of natural resources, including plant and animal species, for passive recreational
uses, and for the production of resources (Government Code 65560(b). The Open Space Lands
                                                                             Environmental Resources
                                                                                               IV-18
                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
Act (Government Code 65566) requires that local governments prepare open space plans before
adopting required open space related ordinances. The Act helps assure consistency between the
open space plan and zoning regulations.
Government Code Section 65563 requires that every city and county prepare and adopt a local
open-space plan to ensure the comprehensive and long-range preservation of open space land
within its jurisdiction. This plan must be submitted to the Secretary of the Resources Agency,
and may consist of the Open Space Element that is adopted by the City Council. It must also
contain specific programs that will implement the open-space plan, which the City is expected to
pursue (Government Code Section 65565). Building permits, subdivision maps, and open-space
zoning ordinances must be consistent with the local open-space plan (Government Code Section
65567).
Relevant to the conservation component of this Element, Government Code Section 65302(d)
requires that General Plans include elements that address issues of resource conservation,
development and utilization, including reclamation, prevention of pollution or resource
degradation, and protection of watersheds. The Energy and Mineral Resources, Air Quality, and
Water Resources elements of this Plan discuss these issues.
OPEN SPACE CATEGORIES
Four categories of open space land are relevant to the General Plan planning area: open space for
the preservation of natural resources, open space for resource management; open space for
recreation; and open space for public health and safety. The following discussion defines each of
these open space categories. These designations are relevant to the City and its planning area, as
well as on a regional level.
Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources
Open space for the preservation of natural resources refers to areas required for the protection of
scenic resources, plant and animal resources and crucial habitat, as well as areas required for
ecologic reserves and scientific study. Habitat and conservation in the planning area has become
increasingly important due to the amount of federally listed species in the region. Most species of
concern are addressed in the Draft Multiple Species Conservation Plan, currently (2004) in the
approval process through the County, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the
United States Fish and Wildlife Service (please also see the Biological Resources Element).
The following includes brief descriptions of open space areas for the preservation of natural
resources.
Portrero Reserve ACEC
The northern boundary of the Portrero Reserve/Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC)
begins approximately 1.5 miles south of US Interstate-10 and approximately 2 to 3 miles east of
Highway 79. A portion of this ACEC occurs within the City’s planning area. The Portrero
Valley contains almost 13,000 acres. Within the Reserve, the Bureau of Land Management
(BLM) administers approximately 1,030 acres, with approximately 12,000 acres of private land
proposed for acquisition. The Reserve is a unit under the South Coast Resource Management
Plan. The BLM also administers another 7,969-acre parcel to the east. This large block of BLM
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                IV-19

                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
public land is located within an area being considered by Riverside County as a multi-species
wildlife corridor, which stretches through the Badlands from the San Bernardino National Forest
to the San Jacinto Wildlife Refuge.
There are approximately 1,900 acres of occupied Stephens’ kangaroo rat habitat within the
Reserve, as well as approximately 88 acres of potential Least Bell’s Vireo habitat. The area
contains 55 acres of suitable habitat for the California Gnatcatcher. Other sensitive, non-listed
plant species have been recorded at the site. The area also supports 95 acres of Southern
Cottonwood-Willow Riparian Forest and a small stand of South Coast Live Oak Riparian Forest.
San Bernardino National Forest
The San Bernardino Forest Reserve was established in 1893, and the San Bernardino National
Forest was established in 1925. The San Bernardino National Forest is located in the San
Gabriel, San Bernardino, San Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains, and encompasses 5 federally
designated wildernesses ranging in size from 12,000 acres to almost 95,000 acres. These lands
are administered by the U.S. Forest Service. The Forest is biologically diverse, providing a home
to 440 wildlife species and thousands of plant species. Of these species, approximately 30 are
federally listed threatened or endangered. Mount San Gorgonio, the tallest peak in Southern
California (11,502 feet), is located within the Forest. The Forest provides for a variety of
recreational opportunities including hiking, horseback riding, hunting, fishing, and mountain
biking, as well as snow skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling during winter months.
San Bernardino National Forest lands are interspersed throughout the north central and
northwesterly portions of the planning area. There are no existing authorized or mapped trails on
Forest lands in the planning area, nor are trails proposed by the US Forest Service. While
potential exists for these lands to be exchanged for other lands contiguous to other portions of the
Forest, environmental and topographical constraints make it unlikely these lands would be
developed for urban uses. It is expected they would remain as open space.
San Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains National Monument
The U.S. Congress and the President established the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains
National Monument in October 2000, creating a monument that extends from the San Gorgonio
Pass southeast into the Imperial Valley. The Monument designates 440 square miles in five
climate zones, ranging from desert to arctic pine. The Monument designation resulted in
prohibition on mining and off-road vehicle use. A management plan is currently being
developed for these lands.
Morongo Band of Mission Indians Conservation Lands
Lands designated for conservation and owned by the Morongo Band of Mission Indians occur
adjacent to and east/northeast of portions of the City’s planning area. Most of these lands are
located within the San Jacinto Mountains and adjacent to the San Bernardino National Forest.
These lands are generally vacant, with some areas fenced for livestock. Due to issues of
accessibility, lack of a potable water system, and environmental constraints, it is unlikely that
these lands will be developed in the next 20 years. Use of these lands is generally restricted to
tribal members only.
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                IV-20

                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP)
The County of Riverside is currently preparing a Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan
(MSHCP) to develop principles, policies and regional proposals to conserve biological diversity
on a regional scale. The Western Riverside County MSHCP is one of several large multi-
jurisdictional habitat planning efforts within Southern California that have been instigated with
the overall goal of maintaining biological diversity within a rapidly urbanizing region. The plan
is intended to provide a coordinated reserve system and implementation program to facilitate the
preservation of biological diversity and maintain the region’s quality of life. The Plan includes
standards for access into protected areas, trail use, and other standards that will be implemented
by the County on unincorporated lands. The MSHCP designates only about 90 acres of land in
the planning area for conservation, generally located in the Black Bench area.
Open Space for Resource Management
Open space for management of natural resources refers to those lands that contain resources that
are utilized and developed, such as agricultural lands, cultural resource lands, areas containing
major mineral deposits, areas of economic importance for the production of food or energy, and
areas required for recharging groundwater or for water storage.
Within the planning area, agricultural uses include a fruit orchard located on the Banning Bench,
and privately owned equestrian estates used for horse grazing, particularly on the south side of
the planning area. These lands are not designated for open space, but rather are ultimately
planned for residential land uses.
An approximately 182-acre site that includes mining and processing of aggregate materials is
located at the north end of Hathaway. The site includes rock and sand mining operations owned
by Robertson’s Ready Mix, and an asphalt processing plant owned by Matich Corporation.
Finally, the San Gorgonio River, and its associated groundwater resource, represent an important
area of Open Space to be preserved. The River can also be classified as Open Space for Public
Health and Safety, as discussed below.
Williamson Act
The California Land Conservation Act of 1965, commonly referred to as the Williamson Act,
allows local governments to enter into contracts with private landowners to restrict specific
parcels of land to agricultural or related open space use. Landowners in return receive lower-
than-normal property tax assessments, based upon farming and open space uses as opposed to
full market value. Local governments receive an annual subsidy of property tax revenues from
the state.
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                IV-21

                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
Based on information provided by Riverside County, there are currently three Williamson Act
contracts in effect over approximately 3,500 acres in the planning area. These include lands
located in the City limits near the Banning Bench, in the northwest portion of the planning area
between Highland Springs Avenue and Highland Home Road, and in the City’s southerly sphere
of influence south of Westward Avenue.
Open Space for Outdoor Recreation
Open space for outdoor recreation includes areas of outstanding scenic, historic and cultural
value, areas that are suitable for park and recreational purposes, and areas that can serve as links
between major recreation and open space reservations, including utility easements, and trails and
scenic highways corridors.
Parklands are an important source of open space for recreation. The City is home to six
developed City-owned parks, including Repplier, Sylvan, Roosevelt Williams, Lions, Carpenter-
Hamilton, Dysart, and three undeveloped park sites, including Mountain Avenue (working title),
Smith Creek, and one unnamed park. One County-owned park, Gilman Ranch & Museum, and
one privately-owned park are also located in the City. (Also please see the Parks and Recreation
Element). In addition to the active and passive recreation opportunities that the City’s parks
provide, there are also trails and facilities that support passive recreation on a regional scale.
These include numerous mountain trails through the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa Mountains.
Open Space for Public Health and Safety
Open space for public health and safety refers to lands that require special management or
regulation because of hazardous or special conditions. These include earthquake fault zones,
floodplains, watersheds, areas required for the protection of water quality and water reservoirs,
unstable soil areas, and high fire areas. (Also see the Geotechnical, Hydrology, Emergency
Preparedness and Water Resources Elements for more detailed information).
Although these lands remain open due to hazardous conditions, they have potential for other
open space uses. Land located along fault lines can remain in its natural condition as a wildlife
corridor, and flood control facilities may be usable for natural open space and recreation. In the
planning area and immediate vicinity, this category of Open Space is primarily associated with
the Banning Water Canyon.
Open Space Land Use Categories
The General Plan provides for approximately 6,460 acres of open space lands, or 27.4 percent of
the total planning area The types of designated open space land uses and the acreages of each are
shown in Table IV-6, below.
                                                                              Environmental Resources

Open Space – Resources and Open Space – Hillside Preservation lands include those lands
which are to be preserved in the long term as open space, while Open Space – Parks lands are
expected to be developed for recreational uses.
LAND ACQUISITION
The thoughtful designation of open space is one way to ensure that the development or
preservation of natural resources is consistent with the goals and policies of the City. Open
space regulation can allow the land to be used and/or preserved for the good of the entire
community while remaining largely undeveloped. To help conserve open space in California,
many conservation programs and legislative enactments have been put into effect. These include
the Conservation Easement Act, Open-Space Easement Act of 1974, less-than-fee real property
interests, and the Scenic Deed Act.
The Conservation Easement Act
The Conservation Easement Act (Civil Code Sections 815-816) was established to encourage the
dedication of open space lands for ongoing conservation. A conservation easement is a
voluntary agreement that allows a landowner to limit the type or amount of development on their
property, while retaining private ownership of the land.
The easement is binding to successive owners of the land. The purpose of a conservation
easement is to retain land predominantly in its natural, scenic, historical, agricultural, forested, or
open space condition. By granting conservation easements, a landowner can assure that the
property will be protected forever, regardless of who owns the land in the future.
Open Space Easement Act
The Open Space Easement Act of 1974 (Government Code Sections 51070-51097) provides
another mechanism for preserving open space land. This gives local governments the authority
to accept easements granted to them or non-profit organizations for the purpose of conserving
open space and agricultural lands.
The Scenic Easement Deed Act
The Scenic Easement Deed Act (Government Code Sections 6950-6954) authorizes local
governments to purchase fee land or scenic easements, but there is no special mechanism for
obtaining them. Land uses are regulated by the Act, and local governments are authorized to
adopt an ordinance, which establishes open space covenants with property owners.

                                                                                         General Plan
Public Land Trusts
A public land conservation trust is another mechanism devoted to protecting open space,
agricultural lands, wildlife habitats and natural resource lands. Land trusts achieve their
objectives primarily through acquiring and managing interests in land.
Land conservation trusts can help to preserve open space and resource lands in a variety of ways.
Trust funds can be used to acquire fee simple interest in real estate to then manage or lease back
holdings, or to purchase conservation easements that protect sensitive land from development.
Since they are less restrained by formalities and regulations, private land trusts are usually able
to respond more quickly than governmental entities to purchasing opportunities. They also have
more experience to help public agencies with the technicalities of acquisition. A public land
trust helps to preserve environmentally sensitive open space and conservation lands, pursues
State and Federal financing with grants and loans, and other assistance methods for the
preservation of open space. There are several land trusts that operate within the region. These
include The Nature Conservancy, the Center for Natural Lands Management, Friends of Desert
Mountains, the San Bernardino Mountains Land Trust, The Wildlands Conservancy, the
California Desert Coalition, and the Arid Lands Community.
Methods of Funding Open Space
Viable funding mechanisms are essential to financing the acquisition and management of open
space lands. These mechanisms may include State obligation bonds, grants and tax increment
financing. In addition to these funding mechanisms, the California Legislature has helped
organizations create grant and loan programs that can aid open space financing. These are
available on a competitive basis for specific projects, and include:
•       Land and Water Conservation Fund/Department of Parks and Recreation
•       Habitat Conservation Program/Department of Parks and Recreation
•       Simms Trail Bill/Department of Parks and Recreation
•       Public Access Program/Department of Fish and Game
•       Wildlife Conservation Board/ Department of Fish and Game
•       Urban Forestry Program/California Department of Forestry
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The City of Banning and its General Plan planning area contain many valuable natural resources
and open space lands. These resources make a significant contribution to the desirability of the
area and to an enhanced quality of life in the community. The preservation of these areas and
resources is an ongoing effort that will need to be continually pursued by the City. While growth
will continue to occur in the region, the implementation of the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance,
and other regulatory mechanisms will help to promote conservation and ensure that development
will not interfere with or interrupt open space and conservation lands in the future. The City
should use these mechanisms, along with the development review process, to encourage and
promote dedication and conservation of open space lands by private developers and landowners.

The City should work with the Morongo Band of Mission Indians and adjacent cities and
communities to establish a network of open space and conservation lands within the Pass region.
The City can also play an important role in encouraging and supporting the preservation efforts
of non-profit and other conservation groups, and assist in acquiring other open space lands.
Assistance may be provided in finding federal and state grants for purchase of conservation
easement and/or fee simple ownership interest.

BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Biological Resource Element is intended to identify the variety of biological resources in the
General Plan planning area and vicinity, and to provide for the preservation and protection of the
integrity of the natural environment and its many biological resources. Biological resources
represent the plants and wildlife species and ecosystems and habitats that contribute to an area’s
natural setting. They also add to the health, identify and image of the natural environment. This
Element provides a basis for understanding biological resource issues, referencing other
information sources that promote protection of biological resources and serve as mechanisms for
long-term development. The Element is intended to guide decision makers in regulating land use
and development, while protecting these critical resources. Goals, policies and programs set forth
in this element are designed to ensure the long-term preservation of biological resources for the
benefit of the entire community.
BACKGROUND
The Biological Resources Element is directly related to major policy issues in the Land Use and
Open Space and Conservation Elements. This Element relates to the Parks and Recreation
Element, wherein is addressed the community’s commitment to and enjoyment of natural
resources. The City is signatory to and is located within the planning area for the Western
Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan and Natural Communities
Conservation Plan (MSHCP), a regional effort designed to protect and plan for the preservation
of the region’s biological resources. The Banning planning area encompasses a portion of the
Portrero Reserve/Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), as well as lands within the
San Bernardino National Forest. The planning area is adjacent to the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa
Mountains National Monument to the south. The Biological Resources Element, which conforms
with and supports the County’s MSHCP, will influence and contribute to the effective
implementation of conservation strategies, goals, policies and programs.
As set forth in Government Code Section 65302(d), the City is required to include an element
that provides for the conservation and preservation of wildlife resources. This Section also
requires that the City provide inventories of natural vegetation, fish and wildlife, including rare
and endangered species and their habitat. In compliance with these requirements, this element
includes goals, policies and programs, and includes plans and resource maps to illustrate areas
important to the preservation of plant and animal life. These include the locations habitat for fish
and wildlife species, and areas required for ecological and scientific study.
There are a number of state and federal regulations established to govern the health and well-
being of biological resources, including habitat and wildlife species. The Endangered Species
Act constitutes one of the most effective laws for protecting species and their habitat, identifying
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                IV-28

                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
endangered species and isolated populations, and preserving the region’s biodiversity for current
and future generations. In addition to the Endangered Species Act, California has several other
laws and regulations that directly and indirectly protect plant and wildlife species. These include
state enforcement of the federal Clean Water Act, the California Fish and Game Code and the
Natural Community Conservation Planning Act.
Regional Setting And The Physical Environment
Climate
The planning area is located within the transition zone between the east edge of the inland
valleys and the west edge of the Colorado Desert. Over an approximately twenty-mile distance,
there are profound changes in flora and fauna caused by the merging of coastal climatic
influences with those of the desert climate. Banning is located in the San Gorgonio Pass, which
is at a higher elevation than either the desert or valleys. The planning area therefore receives
higher rainfall, and milder summer and cooler winter temperatures than surrounding valleys and
desert communities.
Topography
Some of the lower slopes of the San Bernardino Mountains also occur within the study area.
These provide habitat for different plants and animals from those on the floor of the Pass. The
region serves as a connector between vast areas of wildlands in the San Bernardino Mountains.
Thus, wide-ranging animal species, such as deer, bears, and predators such as the golden eagle,
bobcat and mountain lion, may be present. The Western Riverside County MSHCP designates
the mountains up to the southern boundary of San Bernardino County as core habitat reserve.
The foothills of the San Jacinto Mountains occur on the southern boundary of the study area.
This mountainous region where the Badlands merge into the main portion of the range
constitutes a unified block of wildlands where the local ecosystems are largely intact. The
MSHCP designates the southern edge of the study area as a Conservation Area, and it is another
core area for protection of native flora and fauna in Western Riverside County.
There are major drainages below the canyons of the San Bernardino Mountains that support
riparian habitat, and provide wildlife movement corridors. The blowsand ecosystem of the
Coachella Valley is supported by the high sediment load and infrequent flooding in the San
Gorgonio River. Several other watercourses occur in the planning area. These are Smith Creek, a
relatively intact watercourse at the southern edge of the planning area, Montgomery Creek, and
others. Drainage from the southern hillsides flows primarily away from the City into the San
Jacinto Valley.
Regional Habitats And Natural Communities
There are seven separate natural communities represented in the Banning General Plan planning
area. These are:
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                IV-29

                                                                                           City of Banning
                                                                                              General Plan
Riparian Scrub
This habitat, which consists of small areas of water-dependent plants, is supported by the
primary watercourses that flow through the planning area. Many weedy non-native species are
present, and the community is dominated by willows, mulefat, and a variety of annuals.
Although this habitat comprises a smaller proportion of vegetation in the planning area, it is
valuable for the diversity of wildlife, especially birds, that it supports. It is found in the channels
of the San Gorgonio River, Smith Creek, and Mias Canyon.
Coastal Sage Scrub
This natural community is the object of substantial conservation efforts in southern California.
There are several patches of this habitat within the planning area, although it is at the margin of
its range in the San Gorgonio Pass. Largest areas are found in the City’s sphere of influence in
Section 13 and along the City’s southern boundary. It is sometimes an early success ional stage,
developing after wildland fires and then replaced by chaparral over time.
Riversidean Alluvial Fan Sage Scrub
This community is an expression of coastal sage scrub that is restricted to major washes and dry
rivers. It provides habitat for several unique plants and animals, including the San Bernardino
kangaroo rat, slender horned spineflower and Santa Ana woolly-star, all Federal listed
endangered species. The City is out of range of these species. However, given that alluvial fan
sage scrub is found along a two-mile stretch of the San Gorgonio River north of the main urban
area, there is a relatively high potential for detection of rare plant species in this area.
Chaparral
Found at mid-elevations on hillsides throughout California, this common, fire-dependent
community is present in the northern part of the planning area. It occurs in the San Gorgonio
River watershed, and surrounding Mias Canyon in the eastern sphere of influence. Chaparral is
composed of stiff shrubs with woody debris, including chamise, manzanita, black sage, wild
lilac.
Grassland
This comprises most undeveloped lands in the planning area that are not in use for agriculture. It
is composed of weedy species such as red brome, wild oats and ripgut grass and is found in the
southern and western portions of the planning area. No native grasses, such as bunch grasses or
wildflower fields, were detected in the planning area. Although non-native grassland has
relatively low floristic diversity, it provides habitat for wildlife favoring low vegetative cover.
Species utilizing non-native grasslands may include burrowing owls, foraging raptors, some
amphibians and songbirds.
Meadows and Marshes
Although mapping conducted for the MSHCP indicates a plant community designated as
“meadows and marshes” in the uppermost reaches of Banning Canyon, it was not found to be
present during field surveys. It is possible this wetland community existed in the past but has
been dried out by groundwater extraction.
Montane Coniferous Forest
This community is limited to the northern study area. It occurs on watershed slopes bordering the
San Gorgonio River and tributaries near the San Bernardino County line.
                                                                                  Environmental Resources
                                                                                                     IV-30

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
Non-native Communities
The planning area contains lands in urban and rural development in addition to natural plant
communities. Within urbanized areas, ornamental plants support a few native wildlife species
that have adapted to the presence of humans.
A substantial portion of the planning area is or has been previously used for agriculture. Non-
native grassland, which now occupies abandoned farmland, provides open space for a variety of
common species, and foraging habitat for birds of prey.
Wildlife Habitat and Fauna
Wildlife habitat in the planning area generally follows natural communities descriptions. Urban
lands, agricultural fields and the San Gorgonio River channel also provide habitat, albeit to a
more limited extent than do undeveloped lands. The San Gorgonio River channel provides one of
the few possible connectors for wildlife travel between the San Bernardino Mountains and the
San Jacinto Mountains. Although its value as such for larger mammals and predators is not
proven, it is thought to be important.
Habitat for a variety of wildlife, from chuckwalla lizards to bighorn sheep, is present on the
rocky slopes of the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains. Species with large ranges, such
as bighorn sheep, benefit from the contiguous open spaces in these mountains, as do predators
such as golden eagle and mountain lion. Most of these are public lands within the San
Bernardino National Forest. In the City’s southeastern sphere of influence (Section 13) there is
an abundance of reptile species. These include the granite spiny lizard, and habitat suitable for
the granite night lizards. Both these species are covered by the MSHCP. The relationship of the
Banning General Plan with the MSHCP is further discussed below.
Sensitive, Rare, And Endangered Species
The Banning planning area includes a wide range of significant biological resources. Of these,
some have been listed as threatened or endangered by the federal and state governments.
“Endangered” species are those considered in imminent danger of extinction due their limited
numbers. “Threatened” species refers to those likely to become endangered within the
foreseeable future, primarily on a local scale. “Sensitive” species are those that are naturally rare
or have been locally depleted or put at risk by human activities. Although the perpetuation of
these species is not apparently significantly threatened, they are considered vulnerable and may
be candidates for future listing. Tables IV-1 through IV-4 show the listed or sensitive species that
have been reported by federal and state wildlife agencies and quasi-public conservation
organizations as potentially occurring within the planning area. However, given that many of
these species require larger stands of undisturbed habitat than are present in the planning area,
the majority of these species are not likely to be present.

Ecosystem Management and Biodiversity Protection
The natural environment and human life are inextricably linked. Earth’s ecosystems are
composed of interactions between species and the natural environment that represent the
culmination of historic evolutionary processes of long standing. Soil formation, waste disposal,
air and water purification, nutrient cycling, solar energy absorption, and management of
biogeochemical and hydrological cycles are all dependent on biodiversity. These life-sustaining
resources and services are provided by native species. While the complexity o the earth’s
ecosystems are not fully understood, it is clear that each member of an ecosystem fills an
important role.
                                                                                               Environmental Resources
                                                                                                                   IV-44

                                                                                  TN / City of Banning
                                                                           Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
Humans, as the most dominant organism on earth, make use of more than half of the world’s
terrestrial ecosystems. Although human survival depends on utilization of natural resources,
many of our current practices are disruptive and damaging to ecological processes and the
natural environment. The majority of biodiversity losses may be traced to the conversion of
natural habitat to human uses.
Ecosystem management, which attempts to integrate ecological, economic and social goals in a
unified approach, is an important step towards protecting biodiversity. It recognizes that each of
these domains is interrelated, affect, and are affected, by the others. Sustained progress towards
social goals in a deteriorating environment or economy, or vice versa, is not possible. Legislation
that seeks to restore, maintain, and safeguard ecological systems will ensure the well being and
security of future generations.
Public Land Agencies and Ecosystem Management
Regulations and legislations aimed at protecting and managing biological resources are
augmented by the activities of public land agencies and non-profit organizations focused on
thoughtful ecosystem management and biological resource protection. Lands owned and
managed by these agencies and organizations may provide for recreational uses, and therefore
varying degrees of disturbance. Nonetheless, the mandate for most is the safeguarding of
cultural, scenic and biological resources.
In the planning area and vicinity, a number of public land agencies and non-profit organizations
work together to manage the region’s open space lands. Some of these agencies include the
National Park Services, the United States Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management.
On a state level, agencies include the California Department of Fish and Game and the California
Department of Parks and Recreation. Non-profit organizations include the Nature Conservancy.
Endangered Species Act
The U.S. Endangered Act (ESA) of 1973 represents powerful legislation for the protection of
biological resources. The ESA program, unlike earlier regulations that focused primarily on
“game” animals, seeks to identify all endangered species and populations in order to preserve as
much biodiversity as possible. The U.S. Department of the Interior, through the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, is responsible for the protection of most threatened and endangered species,
while the Department of Commerce, through the National Marine Fisheries Service, is
responsible for marine mammals and anadromous fish. The ESA’s structure is comprised of the
following components:
    1.      Listing of species and designation of critical habitat;
    2.      Recovery planning, and
    3.      Prohibitions and exceptions to prohibitions.
The ESA regulates a wide range of activities involving endangered species. These include the
“taking” (harassing, harming, pursuing, hunting, shooting, trapping, killing, capturing or
collecting) either accidentally or intentionally, importing into or exporting out of the United
States; possessing, selling, transporting or shipping; and selling or offering for sale any
endangered species. ESA violators are subject to fines up to $100,000 and one-year
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                  IV-45

                                                                                    TN / City of Banning
                                                                             Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
imprisonment. In 2004, the United States had 1,265 species on its endangered and threatened
species lists, 24 proposed for listing, and about 280 candidate species waiting to be considered.
Since eighty percent of habitat for more than half of all listed species occurs on non-public
property, private land is essential in endangered species protection. In a 1995 decision, the
Supreme Court ruled that destroying habitat is as harmful to endangered species as directly
taking them. Recently, however, the Service has been negotiating Habitat Conservation Plans
(HCPs) with private landowners, wherein the landowners are allowed to disturb a portion of their
land as long as the species benefits overall.
California Endangered Species Act
Fish and Game Code Sections 2050 et. seq embodies the California Endangered Species Act
(CESA). Section 2080 of the code prohibits “take” of any species that the commission
determines to be an endangered species or a threatened species. Take is defined as “hunt, pursue,
catch, capture, or kill, or attempt to hunt, pursue, catch, capture, or kill” a protected species.
CESA allows for take incidental to otherwise lawful development projects. CESA emphasizes
early consultation to avoid potential impacts to rare, endangered, and threatened species and to
develop appropriate mitigation planning to offset losses of listed species populations and their
essential habitats caused by projects.
The CDFG may also authorize individuals, public agencies, universities, zoological gardens, and
scientific or educational institutions, to import, export, take, or possess any endangered species,
threatened species, or candidate species of plants and animals for scientific, educational, or
management purposes. Authorization is provided through permits or memorandums of
understanding.
The CESA largely parallels the federal law, and provides similar requirements and mandates
similar to those described for the ESA. It also prohibits the taking of both endangered species
and those petitioned for listing at the state level. It also includes plant species under its
protection, where the federal ESA only protects plants on federally-owned lands or where there
is a federal nexus. In Banning and other pass cities, local government is responsible for ensuring
that all proposed projects conform to the standards and mandates of both the federal and state
acts. The Western Riverside County MSHCP will conform to the standards of both laws, in order
to receive incidental take permits from both the federal and state governments.
Habitat Protection
Habitat fragmentation is a less obvious, though potent threat to species survival. Habitat
fragmentation results in a decrease in habitat type, and the allotment of remaining habitat into
smaller, more isolated pieces. Problems resulting from habitat fragmentation include smaller
populations due to small amounts of habitat, isolation of populations into fragmented parts with
less genetic diversity, and potential increase in predators, competitors and parasites.
Consequently, habitat fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to species and the ecosystems
upon which they rely for survival.
Habitat protection and the widespread preservation of ecosystems provide support for maximum
biological diversity, ensuring the long-term protection of all species. Deeper understanding of
                                                                               Environmental Resources
                                                                                                    IV-46

                                                                                   TN / City of Banning
                                                                            Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
ecosystems and advances in conservation biology has given rise to a new discipline of restoration
ecology, which seeks to repair or reconstruct ecosystems damaged by human or natural forces.
Portrero Reserve ACEC
A portion of the approximately 13,000 acre Portrero Reserve/Area of Critical Environmental
Concern (ACEC) occurs in the planning area, approximately 1.5 miles south of US Interstate-10
and approximately 2 to 3 miles east of Highway 79. The Portrero Valley contains almost 13,000
acres. Of the total ACEC, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers approximately
1,030 acres, with the remaining approximately 12,000 acres of private land proposed for
acquisition. Along with another 7,969-acre parcel to the east, also administered by BLM, these
lands are located within an area under consideration by Riverside County as a multi-species
wildlife corridor. This corridor stretches through the Badlands from the San Bernardino National
Forest to the San Jacinto Wildlife Refuge. The ACEC includes approximately 1,900 acres of
occupied Stephens’ kangaroo rat habitat, as well as approximately 88 acres of potential Least
Bell’s Vireo habitat. Other sensitive species and habitat have been observed on the site.
San Bernardino National Forest
The San Bernardino National Forest, located in the San Gabriel, San Bernardino, San Jacinto and
Santa Rosa Mountains, occurs within the planning area in the northeasterly portions of the City’s
sphere of influence, as well as adjacent to the northwesterly and northeasterly planning area.
The Forest is biologically diverse and provides a home to 440 wildlife species and thousands of
plant species of which approximately 30 are federally listed threatened or endangered.
Relationship of the General Plan to the Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan
The Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP) is a
regional plan that provides for protection of plant and animal species listed by the federal and
state governments as threatened or endangered. It is also intended to protect species that are
thought to be declining or may be listed in the future. The MSHCP sets forth three primary
objectives. These are: 1) to impose a habitat mitigation fee on discretionary development in
western Riverside County; 2) to designate criteria areas for acquisition or as subject to special
development criteria; and 3) to cooperate with state and federal land management agencies for
conservation and unification of adjacent habitat lands.
The MSHCP describes conservation needs, and sets forth goals and objectives for 146 special
status species. It also imposes specific discretionary permit conditions that the City is to
implement. It provides for incidental take permits for covered species assuming that MSHCP
requirements are met.
There are three features of the MSHCP that apply within the Banning planning area. These are
criteria areas, special linkage areas, and special survey areas. The following discussion describes
these features as they occur in Banning.
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                   IV-47

                                                                                     TN / City of Banning
                                                                              Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
Criteria Areas
There is one criteria area “cell” in the planning area. Cell 227 is located along the City’s western
border with unincorporated Riverside County and just south of the San Bernardino County line,
in the northeast quarter of Section 13, Township 2 South, Range 1 West, San Bernardino Base
and Meridian. (Please see Exhibit IV-2). This cell is approximately 160 acres, a portion of which
occurs in the City limits. As set forth in the MSHCP, conservation in this Cell focuses on
chaparral and woodlands and forests, and will range from 45 percent to 55 percent, focusing on
the eastern portion of the Cell.
Special Linkage Area
A three-square mile MSHCP special linkage area occurs in the easterly planning area, adjacent to
the eastern City limits where the San Gorgonio River exits the City. (Please see Exhibit IV-2).
For special linkage areas, the MSHCP requires local jurisdictions to assure preservation of a
wildlife movement corridor in compliance with guidelines set forth in the South Coast
Wildlands’ Missing Linkages project. However, the South Coast Wildlands’ document makes no
reference to the San Gorgonio River linkage. In the absence of other guidance in the MSHCP,
the City will apply standards set forth in the CEQA Guidelines for projects within the Special
Linkage area. The CEQA Guidelines’ threshold of significance for such areas is as follows:
         “Would the project interfere substantially with the movement of any native
         resident or migratory species of fish or wildlife species or with established
         native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impede the use of native
         wildlife nursery sites?”
Special Survey Areas
The MSHCP provides for special species surveys for covered species that do not fit well into
design of criteria areas and expected locations of habitat reserves. These species’ distribution
will be documented and smaller reserves outside primary conservation lands may be established
as needed. The Banning planning area falls within the special survey areas for three of these
species. They are the Yucaipa onion, the Burrowing owl, and the Los Angeles pocket mouse as
illustrated in Exhibits IV-3, IV-4 and IV-5 respectively. Development in the City is subject to
survey and mitigation requirements as set forth in the MSCHP for each of these species.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The City’s participation in the Western Riverside County MSHCP provides a good opportunity
to work towards long-term protection of important biological resources. The Plan establishes a
regional ecological system that will be able to support important and intact ecosystems and
communities. Through implementation of the General Plan, and the thoughtful adoption of
Zoning, Subdivision and Grading Ordinances, the City can find ways to establish a means to
make the built environment more harmonious with the natural environment.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND
CULTURAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
Cultural resources are an important part of the City and provide residents with a meaningful
sense of history and heritage. The Archaeological and Cultural Resources Element describes the
documented pre-history and history of the City of Banning, including its 20th century
development. It sets forth goals, policies and programs which preserve the City’s cultural
heritage and help perpetuate it for future generations.
BACKGROUND
The Archaeological and Cultural Resources Element is directly related to the Land Use, Open
Space and Conservation, and Arts and Culture Elements of the General Plan. The issues
addressed in the Archaeological and Cultural Resources Element are part of those set forth in
California Government Code Section 65560(b) and Public Resources Code Section 5076.
Furthermore, Section 21083.2(g) of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
empowers the community to require adequate research, documentation and preservation when
the potential for significant cultural resources exists.
The City currently reviews development proposals for their potential impacts to archaeologically
and historically significant resources and may require additional studies if the potential to impact
resources exists. As future development proposals are received, they will be evaluated, and the
need for site-specific cultural resource assessments will be determined. Although Banning is a
relatively “new” community, it is part of a region that has seen human occupation for thousands
of years. The General Plan study area is also one that has been important in the development of
the stagecoach, the trans-continental railroad and national highways system, and has important
resources documenting this progress.
The Prehistoric Period
The “pre-historic” period refers to a time prior to the arrival of non-native peoples, when Native
American society, which was based on traditions resulting from thousands of years of cultural
development, was intact and viable. In the San Gorgonio Pass, the prehistoric period is generally
divided into the Late Prehistoric Period and the Archaic Period.
The Archaic Period is defined as occurring before AD 1000, prior to the introduction of pottery
to the region. Important cultural developments during the Archaic Period include the
introduction of the bow and arrow (about AD 500) and change from burial practices to
cremations. Sometime between 1000 BC and AD 500, it is believed that Takic-speaking peoples,
from the Great Basin region of Nevada, Utah and eastern California migrated into southern
California.
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                   IV-55

                                                                                  TN / City of Banning
                                                                           Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
Around AD 1000, the San Gorgonio Pass region was introduced to pottery by the Colorado River
cultures, marking the transition between the Archaic and Late Prehistoric Periods. Pottery was an
innovation of peoples of the Colorado River, and its distribution across the upper Colorado and
Mojave Deserts indicates that there was contact and trade between local tribes and those of the
Colorado River.
The Late Prehistoric Period is defined as occurring after AD 1000 until around the late 1700s,
when foreign influences brought profound changes to Native American society and ushered in
the “historic period” in the San Gorgonio Pass. Archaeological evidence indicates that a large
number of settlements and rancherias were established in the San Gorgonio Pass region during
the prehistoric period. Such sites included villages, milling sites used on a seasonal basis to
process food materials, lithic workshops for making stone tools and weapons, and rock art sites
used for artistic and/or religious purposes.
Ethnohistory
The most recent identifiable native culture to evolve in the San Gorgonio Pass region is that of
the Pass Cahuilla Indians, as well as the Serrano people, who visited and utilized the area’s
resources. The Cahuilla were a Takic-speaking people consisting of hunters and gatherers who
are generally divided into three groups based on their geographic setting: the Pass Cahuilla of the
San Gorgonio Pass/Palm Springs area; the Mountain Cahuilla of the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa
Mountains; and the Desert Cahuilla of the eastern San Gorgonio Pass, as far south as today’s
Salton Sea.
The Cahuilla were not identified by a single name that referred to an all-inclusive tribal
affiliation. Instead, membership was in terms of lineages or clans. Each lineage had its own food
harvesting areas, ceremonial house and chief. However, a number of lineages are known to have
cooperated with one another for trade, intermarriage, and ceremonies.
The Cahuilla population is estimated to have ranged between 3,600 and 10,000 persons prior to
European contact. A large number of Indian villages, occupied by the Cahuilla, were observed in
the mid-19th century throughout the San Gorgonio Pass. The environment was often harsh, with
extreme variations in rainfall, wind and temperature, and occasional flash flooding and faulting
activity that altered available water resources. However, the mountains, canyons and desert floor
provided important sources of food and fiber, water and supplies.
The first Cahuilla contact with Europeans is believed to have occurred in the early 1770s, when
Spaniards crossed through Cahuilla territory in search of new land routes between Mexico and
northern California. Over time, relations between the Cahuilla and Europeans become strained
due to conflicts over land ownership and exploitation, as well as religious and cultural practices.
The Cahuilla had no immunity to smallpox, and in the early 1860s a smallpox epidemic
decimated the Cahuilla population, which reduced the population to about 2,500 individuals.
Reservations were established beginning in the 1870s and allowed the Cahuilla to preserve their
cultural traditions in relative isolation from Anglo-Americans. Today, Native Americans of the
Pass and Desert Cahuilla heritage are mostly affiliated with the Morongo Band of Mission
Indians reservation in the San Gorgonio Pass, which partially lies within the City of Banning.
The Morongo Band is composed of both Cahuilla and Serrano peoples, the latter’s homeland

                                                                                                  IV-56

occurring in the San Bernardino Mountains, and extending southerly, possibly as far as the cities
of Riverside and Moreno Valley.
Archaeological Resources in the Planning Area
Historical maps, previous cultural resource surveys, aerial photographs, topographic maps and
other cultural records were consulted to determine the presence of known archaeological
resources in the planning area. A total of 20 archaeological sites have been identified and
recorded in the planning area, 12 of which are prehistoric (Native American) sites. Several
isolated artifacts have also been identified. The planning area has not been extensively surveyed
for cultural resources due to the fact that large scale development projects have not been as
widespread in the planning area as other communities in the San Gorgonio Pass/Coachella
Valley region.
Less than one-third of the total acreage within the planning area has been covered by project-
related surveys, leaving most of the planning area yet to be surveyed. The majority of the areas
previously surveyed are located in the southern portion of the City on the Valley floor, and these
surveys encountered relatively few archaeological sites or other cultural resources.
The majority of prehistoric sites in the planning area represent Native American habitation
activities, including ceramic and lithic scatters, bedrock milling features, rock cairns, trails,
roasting pits, and fire hearths. At least 7 of the archaeological sites recorded in the planning area
contained bedrock milling features, all of them located in the foothills on the southern edge of
the planning area. A rock art panel was also found at one of these sites. At least 5 of the sites
were described as Indian villages. Some of these sites may have been associated with the known
Cahuilla village of Pihatapa, which has been identified as being located in Banning Canyon.
Typically, these areas would have offered Native Americans access to water and other important
mountain and desert resources.
Archaeological Resources Sensitivity Assessment
The Gilman Ranch area has been relatively undisturbed by recent development, and as a result
anthropologists and Cahuilla cultural authorities have concluded that the area has a high
sensitivity for archaeological resources, both prehistoric and historic. The foothills of the San
Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains are of moderate sensitivity, as are the terraces along the
San Gorgonio River. The downtown area, meanwhile, demonstrates a moderate sensitivity for
archaeological resources from the historic period. These areas are identified in Exhibit IV-6.

The former site of the village of Pihatapa in Banning Canyon, where the Pisata Wanakik clan of
the Pass Cahuilla resided, has been identified as having potential cultural significance. The
location is also noted as Pisatanavitcem, a village group belonging to the Coyote moiety.7 While
studies state that the village was situated in Banning Canyon, its precise location is uncertain.
However, in light of the results of 19th century U.S. land surveys in the Banning area it is almost
certain that the Indian village noted at the mouth of Banning Canyon was indeed the village of
Pihatapa.
The Historic Period
Historically significant sites are generally more than forty-five to fifty years of age, but range
from the period of the earliest European contact (around the late 1770s in the San Gorgonio Pass)
to about the end of World War II. Potentially significant historic sites range from permanent
trails and highways to living areas and small-scale remains of single activities.
The Bradshaw Trail
The Cocomaricopa Trail passed through the San Gorgonio Pass along the base of the Santa Rosa
Mountains, and connected the coastal region of California with the Colorado River. The trail was
originally an Indian trade route and was revealed by the Maricopa Indians to the Europeans in
1821. In 1862, the trail was “discovered” by William David Bradshaw as the shortest route
between the California coast and gold mines near the Colorado River, and it became known as
the Bradshaw Trail. The trail served as the primary thoroughfare for stagecoaches traveling
between coastal southern California and the gold fields near present-day Ehrenberg, Arizona. It
also became part of the U.S. Mail route between Los Angeles and Santa Fe, New Mexico.
By 1876-77, however, the completion of the transcontinental railroad and the depletion of the La
Paz gold mines brought an end to the heyday of this historic wagon road. Traffic declined to
almost nothing by 1880, but ranchers and miners continued to use it for local transport. Today,
State Highway 111 closely follows the course of the Bradshaw Trail.
Historic Settlement in the San Gorgonio Pass
By the late 18th century, Spanish explorers sought to colonize California before other European
nations and established religious missions and military strongholds along the California coast.
Spanish and Mexican explorers traveled through the San Gorgonio Pass in search of easily
passable supply routes from Mexico to colonies on the northern Monterey Peninsula of
California. In 1822, Mexico secured its independence from Spain under the Treaty of Cordova,
and Spanish forces were driven out of Mexico and California. In 1823-1825, Jose Romero, Jose
Maria Estudillo, and Romualdo Pacheco led an expedition in search of a route to Yuma, Arizona
and became the first noted European explorers to travel through the San Gorgonio Pass.
In about 1824, friars of the San Gabriel Mission established a mission outpost in the Pass named
in honor of St. Gorgonious, and Powell "Paulino" Weaver, a native of Tennessee. During that

                                                                           Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
period, the area was known as Rancho San Gorgonio, one of the 24 principal cattle ranches under
the control of the San Gabriel Mission. In 1845, Weaver and Isaac "Julian" Williams petitioned
the Mexican authorities for a land grant of the 48,400-acre Rancho San Gorgonio, which
stretched from Yucaipa to the eastern edge of the Pass. The grant was never issued, but Weaver
and Williams took possession of the land under assumed ownership.
The United States defeated Mexico in 1848 in the Mexican-American War and gained control of
California. At the same time, the discovery of gold and the appeal of cattle ranching led to an
influx of new settlers to the state. California was admitted to the Union in 1850. The first U.S.
Government surveys were conducted in the San Gorgonio Pass in 1853, and noted a number of
trails and roads crossing the area, as well as an Indian village at the mouth of the Banning
Canyon. These surveys were part of a potential railroad route from Mississippi to the California
coast, although train service would not be available until nearly 25 years later. In the mean time,
Banning was developing as a transportation hub on the Bradshaw Trail, playing host to a
convergence of stagecoach lines, including Alexander and Company of Los Angeles..
In Banning, the earliest European structures were the adobe houses built by Isaac W. Smith and
José Pope in 1854. Pope’s house, at what is now the Gilman Ranch, served as a stage station on
the Bradshaw Trail under the later owners of the property, Newton Noble and James M. Gilman.
Smith’s ranch, also known to have been a stage stop, later became the site of the Highland
Springs Resort.
Non-Indian settlement in the San Gorgonio Pass expanded during the 1870s and 1880s, with the
establishment of railroad stations along the Southern Pacific line and the implementation of the
Homestead Act and Desert Land Act, which opened public land for claims. With the completion
of the Southern Pacific Railway in 1877, the focal point of local growth shifted from the northern
foothills to the present-day downtown area.
After the founding of Banning in 1884, the town became the unmistakable center of population
and community growth in the area. During the 20th century, Banning continued to benefit from
its strategic location at the nexus of the various transportation arteries, including the original
Ocean-to-Ocean Highway (U.S. Route 60, 70, 99, now Ramsey Street) and today’s Interstate 10,
roughly halfway between the Riverside-San Bernardino area and the growing desert resort
communities in the Coachella Valley.
In 1930, as part of the Colorado River Aqueduct project, the Metropolitan Water District
provided a considerable boost to the Banning economy and population when it chose the City as
its headquarters for the tunneling operations through the San Jacinto Mountains. As a result, road
improvements, schools, and parks were completed during this time, including Repplier Park.
Growth in the City slowed considerably during World War II, but rebounded afterward.
Building permits issued in 1945 totaled $13,481,682.50, representing 163 new businesses and
1,350 residences.
By the early 1940s Banning’s downtown area stretched from Eighth Street on the west to
Hathaway Avenue on the east, and the City extended as far north as the mouth of Banning
Canyon. The downtown had been fully urbanized and a suburban neighborhood had emerged on
                                                                             Environmental Resources

the western edge of the town, between Sunrise and Sunset Avenues. Scattered buildings were
also located between these two areas, mostly to the north of present-day Ramsey Street. While
other buildings dotted the outlying areas, with many of them surrounded by orchards, including
those on the Banning Bench. During the next ten years, the undeveloped area between Banning’s
downtown and the westerly neighborhood was essentially filled in amid the post-WWII boom.
In contrast, the areas beyond the core and the Ramsey Street and San Gorgonio Avenue corridors
remained largely rural in character until the most recent decades, when large-scale residential
developments, such as the Sun Lakes subdivision and the accompanying commercial districts,
began to turn vacant land on the western edge of the City into a new population center.
The Founding of the City of Banning
The railroad was built through the San Gorgonio Pass in 1876, inducing population growth and
the need for services and amenities. By 1878, Banning had four houses, a few tents, three
saloons, a boarding house, and a store operated by Andrew J. Worsham (at the current
intersection of San Gorgonio and Livingston Street), which also housed the post office.
Banning’s first school was located at First Street and Livingston Street, and was also built during
that period. The town was called Moore City, after the town’s principal landowner, Ransom B.
Moore.
Around 1877, the City’s name was established through an arrangement between either Randsom
Moore or Welwood Murray and Phineas Banning. At the time Phineas Banning was a widely
known livestock broker, businessman, and political figure. Mr. Banning was also a primary
financial contributor to the construction of the town's Baptist church, first organized in 1883. The
Banning town site was officially established in 1884 at the intersection of the Bradshaw Trail
and the Southern Pacific Railway. The City of Banning was incorporated in 1913.
Historic Sites in the Planning Area
In contrast to the relatively small number of archaeological sites, a total of 110 historic-period
buildings and other built environment features have been recorded within the planning area. The
vast majority of these were identified in 1982-1983, during a countywide historical resources
reconnaissance sponsored by the Riverside County Historical Commission. These include home
sites and commercial sites dating back to 1880s. The list also includes sites ranging from early
homesteads to mid-twentieth century urban development. The historic-period buildings are
concentrated in the central core of the City, particularly in the Ramsey Street and San Gorgonio
Avenue corridors, historically the two main thoroughfares through the heart of downtown
Banning. The construction dates of these properties range from the mid-1880s to the late 1930s,

  Of the previously recorded historical sites in the planning area, seven have been officially
  proclaimed as significant heritage properties by the federal, state, or county government. One of
  these, the Gilman Ranch, is currently listed in the National Register of Historic Places and
  operated by the County of Riverside as a historic park. The other six sites have all been
  designated as California Points of Historical Interest as well as Riverside County Landmarks.
  However, the earliest non-Indian settlement within the planning area are the Isaac W. Smith's
  and Jose Pope’s ranch houses (now the Highland Springs Resort and the Gilman Ranch,
  respectively), were both located along the Bradshaw Trail.
  During the second half of the 19th century, a road extended northerly through the Indian village
  and into Banning Canyon, then known as Cummings Canyon. The Cummings’ house was
  located along this road near the northern edge of the planning area, where large cultivated fields
  lined the western bank of the San Gorgonio River. In addition to the Cummings’ house, several
  other settlers’ homesteads were recorded in or near the planning area during that period. These
  homesteads included White’s cabin, the J. H. Dixon house, and the J. C. Hannon cabin and
  orchard, which were found in the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains.
  Construction near the turn of the century included the Bryant House in 1885, later called the San
  Gorgonio Inn, and St. Boniface Indian School, built in 1889 on 80 acres purchased by the Bureau
  of Catholic Indian Missions. In 1911, two years before the City’s incorporation, the Banning
  Sanitarium opened, marking the beginning of the City’s efforts to market the health benefits of
  the region’s dry climate.

                                                                          Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
Historic Resources Sensitivity Assessment
Historic structures dating from the late 1900s and early 1930s are concentrated around the urban
core of the City. The highest concentration of early 20th century residences is located in an area
bounded by Wilson Street on the north, Sixth Street on the west, Williams and Hays Streets on
the south, and Hargrave Street on the east. The neighborhoods to the north and east of this area
and around Sylvan Park farther to the west feature a relatively high percentage of residences
from the mid-20th century, which are now approaching the age to be considered potentially
historic.
The segment of Ramsey Street between Third and Murray Streets hosts a continuous corridor of
historic-period commercial buildings, forming a business district of a distinctively historical
character. These areas should be considered highly sensitive for historic-period buildings.
However, historic-period buildings can be found throughout the developed portions of the
planning area, with the exception of the recent subdivisions on the western boundary. Potentially
sensitive historic areas are identified in Exhibit IV-7.
                                                                            Environmental Resources
                                                                                                 IV-65

                                                                                     TN / City of Banning
                                                                              Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
HISTORIC PRESERVATION PROGRAMS
Federal Programs Available to the City
The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 mandates that all federal agencies
assume responsibility for the preservation of historic properties owned or controlled by the U.S.
government. Local governments may take the lead in enforcing the NHPA when involved in
federal projects, such as some programs funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
The Certified Local Government (CLG) program, a joint federal-state initiative administered by
the National Park Service and the State Historic Preservation Officers of each state, provides
technical assistance and small grants to local governments for historic preservation purposes that
meet certain requirements. CLGs can benefit from historic preservation expertise, technical
assistance, information exchange, special grants, and statewide preservation programs
coordinated by the State Office of Historic Preservation (OHP).
The National Register of Historic Places, maintained by the Secretary of the Interior, is a
nationwide inventory of sites, buildings, districts, structures, objects or other features with
national, state, or local historical significance. At present, the planning area contains one
property listed on the National Register of Historic Places (Gilman Ranch); in addition, other
previously recorded sites in the planning area may be eligible for listing.
State Programs Available to the City
In 1992 the California Register of Historic Resources was established, which is the State of
California’s counterpart to the National Register of Historic Places. It includes all properties
listed in or officially determined to be eligible for the National Register. The OHP also maintains
a listing of California Historical Landmarks, which designates properties of statewide
importance, and a listing of Points of Historical Interest, which identifies properties of
countywide or regional importance. Properties included in these registers are eligible for a
number of state historic preservation incentives, including property tax reductions, alternative
building regulations under the State Historic Building Code, benefits provided by the California
Heritage Fund, special historic preservation bond measures, and seismic retrofit tax credits.
Through the provisions of the Mills Act, the City can offer private property owners of qualifying
historic properties incentives for the rehabilitation and maintenance of their property for a
minimum of ten years. Currently, six of the Points of Historical Interest are located within the
planning area, all of which are also simultaneously designated as Riverside County Landmarks.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
According to Public Resources Code Section 5020.1, “historical resources” include but are not
limited to an object, building site, area, place, record, or manuscript which is historically or
archaeologically significant. This definition also applies to architectural, engineering scientific,
economic agricultural, educational, social, political, military, or cultural annals of California.
The California Environmental Quality Act identifies the manner in which the City must review
and address issues related to archaeological and historic resources. The CEQA Guidelines state
                                                                                Environmental Resources
                                                                                                     IV-67

                                                                                      TN / City of Banning
                                                                               Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
that the term “historical resources” applies to any such resources listed in or determined to be
eligible for listing in the California Register of Historical Resources. The relevant criteria for
determining significance are briefly described below.
1.      Is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
        of California’s history and cultural heritage.
2.      Is associated with the lives of persons important in our past.
3.      Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of
        construction, or represents the work of an important creative individual, or possesses high
        artistic values.
4.      Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
As the lead agency, the City of Banning is obligated to assure that every reasonable effort is
made to locate, identify, and evaluate archaeological, historical and cultural sites within its
jurisdiction.
As the community continues to develop, opportunities for documenting and preserving
archaeological and historic sites and artifacts will decrease. The City should encourage the
research and registration of appropriate sites and structures within its jurisdiction in order to
maintain its important traditions and heritage for future generations.

AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Air Quality Element is to provide background information on the physical
and regulatory environment affecting air quality in the City and the region. It is also intended to
identify goals, policies, and programs meant to balance the City’s actions regarding land use,
circulation and other regulatory actions and their associated potential effects on local and
regional air quality. This Element, along with local and regional air quality planning efforts, is
intended to address ambient air quality standards set forth by the federal Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB).
BACKGROUND
The Air Quality Element is directly related to the Land Use and Circulation Elements.
Community and regional air quality are directly affected by land use types, patterns and
intensities. They are also affected by the extent and efficiency of the City’s transportation
system, and the number, length and timing of traffic trips, which are discussed in greater detail in
the Circulation Element. The Air Quality Element is also related to the Open Space and
Conservation Element, which discusses the amount of open space planned for preservation. The
Air Quality Element is also related to the Economic Development Element, which addresses the
protection of natural resources, including air quality, that are important to the local economy.
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
Air quality is a major concern with regard to public health and welfare issues. Southern
California and the Pass region continue to experience air pollution problems, despite
improvements over the past two decades. Federal and state government air quality standards and
regulations have been established to monitor and regulate a variety of air pollutants.
Federal Regulation
The U.S. EPA enforces the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), which was last amended in 1990, and
is intended to ensure that all Americans have the same basic health and environmental
protections with regard to air quality. The CAA establishes minimum air pollution standards that
must be met; however, it allows states to enact and enforce more stringent standards, and
delegates much of the responsibility for carrying out the CAA to state air pollution control
agencies. For areas in non-compliance with federal standards, State Implementation Plans (SIPs)
are developed that are designed to meet ambient air quality standards and deadlines specified in
the Clean Air Act, as well as emission reduction targets set forth in the California Clean Air Act
(CCCA), both further discussed below. The severity of the region’s air pollution determines
required emission reductions and attainment deadlines.
                                                                                Environmental Resources
                                                                                                    IV-71

                                                                                     TN / City of Banning
                                                                              Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
California Regulation
The State Legislature enacted Assembly Bill 2595, which became known as the California Clean
Air Act, in 1988, and amended it in 1992. The CCAA was intended to protect the future health
and welfare of the citizens of California; it was also aimed at protecting the State’s environment
and economy, independent of federal government actions or policy directions. Ambient air
quality standards established in the CCAA, as well as deadlines for achieving those standards,
are generally more stringent than those established by the federal CAA. The California Air
Resources Board (CARB) has been assigned oversight of the CCAA. The CARB advises and
evaluates regional air pollution control agencies’ and districts’ efforts regarding compliance with
the CCAA requirements.
Regional Regulation
The City of Banning is located within the South Coast Air Basin (Basin), a geographic area
regulated by the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). The South Coast
Air Basin includes Orange County, and portions of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside
Counties. The Basin is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and on the north and east by
the San Gabriel, San Bernardino, and San Jacinto mountains.
The SCAQMD is responsible for development of the regional Air Quality Management Plan,
which is a multi-tier effort to regulate pollutant emissions from a variety of sources. SCAQMD
prepared the 2003 Revision to the AQMP for the South Coast Air Basin to provide a
comprehensive program for compliance with all federal and state air quality planning
requirements. Once approved by the SCAQMD Board and CARB, the 2003 AQMD will be
submitted to U.S. EPA as a revision to the SIP.
Banning is also involved in regional management of air quality through various actions taken by
the Southern California Association of Governments. The City refers all fugitive dust complaints
to SCAQMD for investigation and enforcement.
CRITERIA POLLUTANTS
Criteria pollutants are those air pollutants for which federal and state air quality standards exist.
They include ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, suspended particulate
matter (PM10) and lead, each of which described briefly below.
Ozone (O3), formed when byproducts of the internal combustion engine react in the presence of
ultraviolet sunlight, is a pungent, colorless, toxic gas commonly referred to as smog. Motor
vehicles are the major source of ozone precursors. In the Pass region, conditions are occasionally
well suited for the formation of photochemical smog. Excessive exposure to ozone can result in
diminished breathing capacity, increased sensitivity to infections, and inflammation of the lung
tissue.
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a reddish-brown gas that results from a combination of nitric oxide
and oxygen. Incomplete combustion in motor vehicle engines, power plants, and other industrial
operations comprise the primary sources of nitrogen dioxide in the Pass region. Short-term
exposure to nitrogen dioxide can result in airway constriction in healthy individuals; individuals
                                                                                Environmental Resources

                                                                            Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may also experience diminished lung
capacity.
Sulfur dioxide results from the combustion of high-sulfur content fuels, such as coal and oil; it is
a colorless, extremely irritating gas. Sources include motor vehicle fuel combustion, chemical
manufacturing plants and sulfur recovery plants. Short-term exposure to sulfur dioxide can result
in airway constriction and severe breathing difficulties in asthmatics, as well as lung tissue
damage and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
Carbon monoxide (CO), which largely results from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels in
motor vehicles, is a colorless, odorless, toxic gas. High concentrations of carbon monoxide can
contribute to the development of heart disease, anemia and impaired psychological behavior.
Suspended Particulate Matter consists of fine suspended particles, such as soil and mineral dust,
soot and smoke, and aerosols, many of which are byproducts of fuel combustion, tire wear and
natural wind erosion. Finely divided solids or liquids that are ten microns (millionths of a meter)
or smaller in diameter are referred to as PM10. Produced by direct particle erosion and
fragmentation, PM10 can also be produced by sand deposited on road surfaces and ground into
finer particles by motor vehicles. Fine particulate matter poses a significant threat to public
health, and elevated PM10 levels are associated with an increase in respiratory infections and
occurrences of asthma attacks. PM10 is currently (2004) one of the most serious air pollutants in
the City and the Pass region.
Lead (Pb) occurs in the atmosphere as particulate matter resulting from leaded gasoline and the
manufacturing of batteries, paint, ink and ammunition. While the elimination of leaded gasoline
in recent years has reduced the hazards associated with airborne lead, excessive exposure to lead
can lead to anemia, kidney disease, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and neuromuscular and
neurological disorders.
AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
Federal and state air quality standards established for the criteria pollutants described above are
designed to protect that segment of the population that is most susceptible to respiratory distress
or infection, including asthmatics, the elderly, children, and those who are weak from disease or
illness. State standards are generally more restrictive than federal standards, particularly as
regards PM10 and sulfur dioxide. The following table provides a comparison of state and federal
ambient air quality standards.

SCAQMD operates and maintains regional air quality monitoring stations throughout its
jurisdiction, to determine whether existing ambient air quality complies with the standards
shown above. The City of Banning is located within Source Receptor Area (SRA) 29, which
includes a monitoring station at the Banning Municipal Airport. This station monitors
contaminant levels and meteorological conditions on a daily basis. For PM10, samples are
collected approximately every seven days over a period of 24-hours, yielding about 54 samples a
year.
SENSITIVE RECEPTORS
Persons or land uses that may be subject to respiratory stress and/or significant adverse impact as
a result of exposure to air contaminants are considered sensitive receptors. The California Air
Resources Board has indicated that children under 14, seniors over 65, athletes, and people with
cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases are sensitive receptors. Hospitals, nursing and
retirement homes, schools, playgrounds, parks, athletic facilities, and residential and transient
lodging facilities are all considered sensitive land uses.
REGIONAL CLIMATE AND METEOROLOGY
The air quality of a particular locale is a function of the amount of pollutants emitted and
dispersed and the climatic, meteorologic, and geophysical conditions that reduce or enhance the
formation of pollutants. The central and northern parts of the City reach into the foothills of the
San Bernardino Mountains. The San Jacinto Mountains occur along the southern margin of the
City. The largest portion of the City occupies the narrow, east-trending valley known as the San
Gorgonio Pass, which extends westward from the Coachella Valley and rises to about 2,600 feet
near Beaumont. It merges with the Beaumont Plain and the San Timoteo Badlands further west.
Elevations in the City of Banning range from 2,080 feet above mean sea level in the eastern part
of the valley to about 5,200 feet in the mountains.
                                                                                    Environmental Resources
                                                                                                        IV-74

                                                                                    TN / City of Banning
                                                                             Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
On the valley floor, temperatures range from lows in the upper 30s during winter months, to
highs in the upper 90’s during summer months. The average annual rainfall in central Banning is
approximately 18 inches. Higher mountain slopes in the San Gorgonio Pass may receive as much
as 30 inches of rainfall per year. Eastward of Banning, these averages decrease, with
approximately 12 inches annually in Cabazon, to only about 8 inches per year at the eastern end
of the Pass.
Natural vegetation is sparse and widely spaced, and therefore surface soils are exposed to wind
activity. In the adjacent mountains, precipitation is often short and intense, which results in
torrential run-off and considerable sediment deposition on the valley floor. The area is
characterized by strong winds, which are funneled through the narrow San Gorgonio Pass,
causing sand to become airborne. This condition, known as blowsand, poses an often destructive
environmental hazard. In addition to health problems associated with the presence of dust
particles in the air, dust storms reduce highway and air traffic visibility.
The planning area is also located in a region subject to strong Santa Ana winds, which
generally occur in the late fall. During Santa Ana conditions, winds in excess of 40 miles
per hour (mph) occur, and gusts can be even higher.
Strong winds transport and deposit large quantities of sand and dust on buildings, fabrics and
automobiles, thereby reducing visibility and damaging property. Extensive wind-borne soil can
dirty streets, pit windshields and obliterate landscaping. Dust on vegetation can interfere with
plant respiration and stunt plant growth. The adverse health effects in humans can be severe, and
include reduced lung capacity and functioning.
REGIONAL POLLUTANTS OF CONCERN
Analysis of the ambient air quality data collected at the Banning Airport monitoring station
indicates that ozone and PM10 are the most prevalent air pollutants in the planning area. These
pollutants are further discussed below. In addition to meeting federal and state air quality
standards for criteria air pollutants, SCAQMD has general responsibility to control emissions of
air contaminants and prevent endangerment to public health. Therefore, SCAQMD also regulates
pollutants other than criteria pollutants, including Toxic Air Contaminants (TACs), and others.
TACs are discussed below.
Ozone
The South Coast Air Basin has a history of exceeding state and federal ozone standards, and is
currently designated as an “extreme” ozone non-attainment area under the federal Clean Air Act.
This designation means that the Basin must comply with federal ozone air quality standards by
November 15, 2010.
The region’s ozone is generated by motor vehicles, both from U.S. Interstate 10 and other
regional and local roadways, as well as other local sources. Further, prevailing daytime breezes
from coastal areas to the west tend to transport ozone and its precursor emissions easterly into
the Basin’s inland valleys, including the Pass region, and thence into neighboring areas of the
SSAB and the Mojave Desert Air Basin to the northeast. The 2003 Air Quality Management Plan
                                                                               Environmental Resources
                                                                                                    IV-75

                                                                                 TN / City of Banning
                                                                          Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
Environmental Impact Report (AQMP EIR) prepared by SCAQMD show that in 2001, the Basin
exceeded federal health 1-hour standards for ozone on a total of 36 days, and the federal 8-hour
standard on 100 days. The more stringent State standard was exceeded on 121 days, and the
health advisory level on 15 days. The 2003 AQMP sets forth strategies and control methods to
attain federal air quality standards for ozone by 2010. SCAQMD projections show that
attainment of State standards is not likely to occur by 2010. At the monitoring station at the
Banning Municipal Airport, federal 1-hour standards for ozone were exceeded 16 days in 2001,
while federal 8-hour standards were exceeded 49 days. State 1-hour standards were exceeded 63
days. Health advisory standards were exceeded 2 days during 2001.
The Pass Region, including Banning, is located in an area subject to substantial exposure to
mobile source emissions, including diesel-fueled locomotives and motor vehicles. Currently
(2004), local rail facilities carry approximately 60 trains per day. Further, several segments of
U.S. Interstate 10 in the planning area average more than 100,000 vehicle trips per day. This
average is projected to increase over the General Plan buildout period. (Also please see the
Circulation Element).
PM10 Emissions
The region also has a history of elevated PM10 emissions, which are the result of both human
activities such as vehicle use and construction activity, and natural occurrences, such as
windstorms. The Basin is currently designated a non-attainment area for PM10. Under the Federal
Clean Air Act, the Basin must comply with federal PM10 air quality standards by December 31,
2001. The SCAQMD has applied for a five-year extension and must demonstrate compliance by
2006. It is expected that compliance with state standards will occur beyond 2010.
In 2001, PM10 emissions measured at the Banning Airport monitoring station exceeded federal
standards one day out of the 54 days sampled over the course of the year. State standards were
exceeded 7 days over the period sampled.
The City does not have its own fugitive dust ordinance, but relies on applicable state code and
AQMD Rules, including Rule 403 (Fugitive Dust), for authority to enforce fugitive dust
compliance as needed. As noted previously, the City coordinates with AQMD by referring
complaints regarding fugitive dust violations directly to AQMD. The City has also established
nuisance abatement ordinances dealing with smoke and soot, including those generated by
internal combustion engines, residential fireplaces or stoves, or industrial smokestacks.
Violations of these nuisance abatement ordinances over the past five years have generally been
small-scale (residential) occurrences, with only one large-scale (industrial) violation during that
period.
Toxic Air Contaminants
Toxic Air Contaminants (TACs) include substances such as asbestos, benzene, beryllium,
inorganic arsenic, mercury, and vinyl chloride. TACs are generated by a variety of sources
including electroplating and anodizing operations, gasoline distribution facilities, petroleum
refineries, and others. TAC generation and emissions are regulated in the SCAQMD through a
variety of federal, state and local programs. The primary health concern associated with TACs is
their carcinogenic potential. Based on studies conducted by SCAQMD in the late 1980’s and
                                                                             Environmental Resources
                                                                                                 IV-76

                                                                                  TN / City of Banning
                                                                           Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
1990’s, cancer risk levels from TACs appeared to be decreasing since 1990. Nonetheless,
mobile source components comprised the dominant risk. Approximately 70 percent of the risk is
attributed to diesel particulate emissions, and about 20 percent to other toxics associated with
mobile sources.
Transportation Demand Management
As required by the Riverside County Congestion Management Program, the City has adopted a
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Ordinance. The TDM Ordinance applies to new or
change-of-use non-residential developments employing 100 or more persons. It requires the
project proponent to demonstrate how the development will reduce the number of project-
generated vehicle trips (Please also see the Circulation Element). Measures may include
carpooling, carpool parking preferences, bicycle storage and showers, and telecommuting. The
implementation of this ordinance can locally help to reduce the impacts of vehicles on air quality
in the City.
City Use of Alternative Fuels
All full-sized Banning Transit System busses are fueled with compressed natural gas (CNG).
The City-owned vehicle fleet includes two CNG fueled vehicles, and plans to replace, through
attrition, existing gasoline and diesel powered fleet vehicles with CNG-fueled vehicles. The
majority of Banning Unified School District (BUSD) busses are CNG fueled.
The City has recently upgraded its existing CNG fueling station, located at the City Corporate
yard at 176 East Lincoln. The upgrade was a City-initiated project jointly funded by the City,
Banning Unified School District, Riverside County Transportation Commission, Riverside
County, and AQMD. The station is currently used by the City, BUSD, and to a limited extent by
Riverside County and the Department of Forestry’s Fire Division. The fueling station is also
available for public use.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The South Coast Air Quality Management District is responsible for monitoring air pollutant
levels and regulating air pollution sources. The issues addressed in the Air Quality Element are
part of those set forth in California Government Code, Section 65302(d), that requires that
existing transportation-related air quality impacts and trends also be addressed. The General Plan
EIR quantifies potential air pollutant emissions associated with buildout of the community,
including emissions associated with community traffic. In addition, the California Clean Air Act
(Assembly Bill 2595) require that air quality policies and programs be developed to protect and
preserve the environment and general public from the harmful effects of air pollutants.
The City works closely with AQMD to ensure compliance with applicable state codes and
AQMD rules dealing with fugitive dust, as well as to ensure compliance for City-owned
electrical generators and other facilities. The City has recently upgraded its compressed natural
gas fueling station, which is available for public use. The City has adopted a Transportation
Demand Ordinance that requires proponents of non-residential developments that employ more
than 100 persons to demonstrate how they will reduce trips generated by their development.
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                  IV-77

                                                                                     TN / City of Banning
                                                                              Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
Nonetheless, rapid population growth of the area and the proximity to major interstate and rail
facilities facilitate the generation of fugitive dust, ozone and other pollutants. Therefore, the City
needs to continue and expand its efforts to effectively control and improve local air quality.

ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Energy and Mineral Resources Element is to guide the City in the long-term
management and thoughtful use of energy and mineral resources. Energy and mineral resources
are an integral part of the community and local economy. They provide the essential framework
that enables development. Their availability influences the pattern of land uses as well as the
direction and intensity of growth in an area.
Minerals and most conventional energy resources are finite and are in increasingly limited
supply. Furthermore, energy shortages and rising utility rates in southern California have become
a serious concern, placing considerable burden on individuals, the community and the region.
This Element addresses the community’s dependence on these limited resources and the need for
local and regional energy policy. Basic policy elements include increased conservation, and
greater energy efficiency. Making the shift toward reliable energy resources, including greater
use of renewable energy resources, is also important policy issue. The Energy and Mineral
Resources Element sets forth goals, policies and programs that provide opportunities for more
local control of energy production and distribution.
This Element also includes the description of conventional and renewable energy resources,
quantifications of energy resource use, as well as the location and identification of mineral
resources. Policies and programs serve as tools that the City can use to help insure the
availability, conservation and management of these resources, while encouraging the
development of balanced, innovative and long-term solutions to energy efficiency, and the
expanded use of renewable resources.
BACKGROUND
The Energy and Mineral Resources Element is related to other elements in the General Plan,
including Land Use, Open Space and Conservation, Circulation, Air Quality, Economic
Development and other elements. A wide range of state and federal legislation and regulation are
applicable to energy and mineral resource issues, including California Government Code Section
65560(b), which directs cities and counties to provide for the preservation of energy and mineral
resource areas, as well as other resources. As discussed below, these requirements have direct
application to the City and its Sphere-of-Influence where important mineral and energy resources
have already been identified and developed. Government Code Section 65302(d) requires that
General Plans include elements that address resource conservation, and set forth the areas that
may be appropriate to address, including reclamation, prevention of resource degradation and
preservation for long-term use.
The regulation of mineral resources is also addressed at length in Sections 2762, 2763 and 2764
of the Public Resources Code. In addition, Government Code Section 65303 allows the local
                                                                             Environmental Resources
                                                                                                  IV-81

                                                                                 TN / City of Banning
                                                                          Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
jurisdiction to add other resource conservation/management subjects that, in its opinion, relate to
the physical development of the City.
The State Solar Rights Act and Solar Shade Control Act, meant to enhance opportunities for the
use of solar energy, and Title 24 building standards, promulgated to reduce unnecessary energy
use in new or substantially remodeled construction, are some of the state regulations affecting
mineral and energy resources.
MINERAL RESOURCES
For the purpose of this element, mineral resources are defined as naturally occurring solid
crystalline substances that consist of chemical elements or compounds. inorganic and organic,
which are considered to be an economically valuable commodity. Mineral resources include iron,
sand and gravel, limestone, and coal, but not natural gas and petroleum, which are generally
considered to be energy resources. The importance of mineral deposits and their consumption is
dependent upon their relative abundance and importance in business and industry. Careful
consideration of rare or valuable mineral deposits is important prior to their exclusion by urban
development.
Mineral deposits are nonrenewable resources, and therefore require careful and efficient
development to prevent unnecessary waste or exploitation. The excavation of mineral resources
can also have significant environmental impacts that may not be entirely mitigated by surface
mining reclamation plans. Evidence of mining, can remain for hundreds of years if not properly
reclaimed through redistribution of materials, re-contouring, fine grading and revegetation. The
Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA) was developed to assure the preservation of
mineral resources while concurrently addressing the need for protecting the environment.
Sand and gravel, collectively referred to as aggregate, is the primary mineral resource that is
actively being developed in the eastern portion of Banning. Weathering, erosion and other
geological processes have deposited materials from the surrounding mountains and hills, forming
an alluvial fan with significant deposits of these mineral resources. Aggregate, and associated
components, is an important component in building and construction materials, generally
providing 80% to 100% of material volume for asphalt, concrete, road base, stucco and plaster.
Many aggregate resources, including concrete, asphalt, and road base, can be recycled as new
base, and new concrete and asphalt products.
Locally Important Mineral Resources
In 1988, the State of California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology,
under direction of the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act, released a report identifying
aggregate materials in the San Bernardino Production Consumption Region, which covers an
area from Fontana on the west to Cabazon on the east, and from Devore on the north to Lake
Elsinore and Hemet on the south. The primary focus of the report was to identify regionally
significant mineral deposits in an effort to conserve and develop them; and to help in anticipating
aggregate production needs of the region.
                                                                             Environmental Resources
                                                                                                 IV-82
                                                                                     TN / City of Banning
                                                                              Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
The Division of Mines and Geology developed four Mineral Resource Zones:
MRZ-1:         Areas where adequate information indicates that no significant mineral deposits
               are present, or where it is judged that little likelihood exists for their presence.
MRZ-2:         Areas where adequate information indicates that significant mineral deposits are
               present, or where it is judged that a high likelihood for their presence exists.
MRZ-3:         Areas containing mineral deposits, the significance of which cannot be evaluated
               from available data.
As shown in Exhibit IV-8, MRZ-3 is identified throughout most of the planning area. An area of
MRZ-2 occurs in the eastern portion of the City. This designation applies to an area of
approximately 6.5 miles of land along the alluvial fan of the San Gorgonio River that lies
southeast of the Banning Bench, north and south of Interstate 10. The balance of the City is
designated as Unstudied, with no portion of the planning area designated as MRZ-1 or MRZ-4.
Currently (2004), the Banning Quarry, operated by Robertson’s Ready Mix, is the only aggregate
producer in the City of Banning. The Banning Quarry is mined for rock, sand and base materials
used for concrete and construction. The quarry is located in the MRZ-2 zone in the eastern
portion of the City.
Energy Resources
Energy resources are essential for all land uses, and in transportation. However, the majority of
energy comes from non-renewable resources, which include oil, coal and natural gas. Not only
are these resources finite and limited, their development and use are typically damaging to the
environment, resulting in a large economic cost. Moreover, energy resources are generally not
under local control or management and therefore are not always readily available or dependable.
Energy shortages, relatively high-energy costs, unpredictable energy supplies, and the
uncertainties of future availability of resources have made energy production and consumption
an important issue.
In the City of Banning, estimates of consumption of electricity and natural gas on a per capita or
per household basis are derived from a variety of sources, including utility providers. A range of
factors can affect rates of energy use, with cost playing the central role. The South Coast Air
Quality Management District (SCAQMD), in cooperation with utilities, has developed a set of
assumptions used to define the general level of energy consumption by use. Residential energy
users, on average utilize approximately 79,000 cubic feet of natural gas, and 6,000-kilowatt
hours (Kwh) per unit per year. Commercial energy consumers use approximately 35 cubic feet of
natural gas per square foot per year and anywhere from 9.95 to 53.3-kilowatt hours (Kwh) per
square foot per year depending on the type of commercial use.
                                                                                 Environmental Resources
                                                                                                     IV-83


                                                                                       TN / City of Banning
                                                                                Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
With the exception of electrical energy generated from nuclear and renewable resources, non-
renewable fossil fuels play a key role in the generation of electricity, the provision of heat, and
for use in cooking and domestic hot water. Non-renewable resources are also at the foundation of
today’s automobile dependent economy. In addition to reducing the long-term availability of
these important resources, the burning of fossil fuels results in the production of air pollutants,
hazardous waste products and global warming.
Conservation methods, increasing energy efficiency, and developing and using alternative and
renewable energy resources offer many benefits to both communities and the environment, and
help promote a stable local economy. These efforts will also help to reduce energy shortages,
provide more options and greater flexibility, and avert future energy crises.
Electric Power Services
The generation and transmission of electric power has been evolving since the early 1950s when
the first commercial nuclear power plants came on-line. Since that time the use of nuclear power
peaked in the 1970s and has since fallen out of favor. Meanwhile, the use of renewable
resources, such as wind and solar, have steadily made progress. However, fossil fuels continue to
carry most of the base-load demand, with natural gas technology helping to meet peak power
demand. Natural gas is being used more widely in large utility-scale turbine systems to address
base-load demand, and is also fueling emerging micro-turbine technology for on-site power
generation.
Electric Power Deregulation
In 1998, Assembly Bill 1890 (AB 1890) deregulated the electricity industry, allowing
Californian residents to choose their electricity provider. In doing so, California consumers were
able to decide what kind of energy to support, including electricity generated from renewable
energy resources. In addition to opening up the energy market, AB 1890 also created a new
statewide renewable energy program. The program collected $540 million from Southern
California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and San Diego Gas and Electric from 1998
to 2001, which is used to fund existing, new and emerging renewable technologies.
Deregulation also resulted in the sale of power generating facilities by the state’s investor-owned
utilities. It was believed that this approach would increase competition among generators and
lower the cost of electric power. However, a number of factors at the beginning of the decade
have resulting in expensive and unreliable sources of electricity, including greater than expected
demand, lower rainfall and less available hydroelectric power, increased cost of natural gas for
power generation, and the uncoordinated shutdown of power plants for maintenance. The new
regulatory environment may also have provided opportunities for the new owners of power
generation capacity to take advantage of circumstances and to reap significantly greater profits
than was typical of integrated utility-owned generators.
Finally, deregulation has put the economic viability of the restructured utilities at risk by
allowing the wholesale power generators to charge what they wish, while capping the rates that
the retail power distributors could charge their customers. The gap between wholesale prices and
retail caps generated billions of dollars in debt for the restructured utilities.
                                                                                  Environmental Resources
                                                                                                       IV-85

                                                                                  TN / City of Banning
                                                                           Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
As deregulation of electric power continues to unfold, the City and its partners in regional
government will have important opportunities to help shape the local electricity market through
conservation initiatives, development and regulation of local power generation, and by
influencing energy policy on a regional and state level. The City of Banning Public Works
Electric Division provides electric services and facilities to the City of Banning, through the
City’s own electric utility.
The City Electric Division contracts with the Southern California Public Power Authority
(SCPPA) for most of the City’s power needs. SCPPA is a joint powers authority consisting of 10
municipal utilities and one irrigation district. Energy supplied by SCPPA is acquired from three
sources, including the San Juan coal plant located in New Mexico, the Palo Verde Nuclear
Generation Station in Arizona, and the Hoover hydroelectric facility on the boarder of Arizona
and Nevada. In addition, the City contracts with both public and private entities for the provision
of specialized services.
Electricity is conveyed to the City through a series of 115 KV transmission lines to a substation
located on East Ramsey Street. From the East Ramsey Street substation, power is transmitted by
one 33 KV transmission line to five distribution stations owned and operated by the City, which
in turn distribute power through 4 KV and 12KV distribution systems. Within the City system,
high voltage transmission lines deliver power to a substation where power is stepped down and
distributed through lower voltage lines. Individual homes and businesses then receive power
through a final transformer, which brings voltages down to more safe and useful levels.
Electric Power: Next Steps
The City is in the position to be the leader in the development, promotion and implementation of
innovative energy strategies and technologies that address electricity generation and use. One of
the most cost-effective strategies is through enhanced efficiencies and conservation. It is
considerably easier to conserve energy than to produce more. Conservation also directly
addresses environmental issues associated with electric energy. The City’s continued efforts
towards the use of alternative fuels, advanced technologies and energy conservation will also be
important to locally mapping out approaches and strategies for a more secure, affordable and
environmentally responsible energy future.
Natural Gas Services
Natural gas is a rapidly growing energy source that has been relatively inexpensive, clean
burning and convenient. It is found in association with petroleum crude oil deposits and is
transported throughout the country through high-pressure transmission lines, including those
found in the City. Gas service is available to commercial, industrial and residential developments
throughout the City, with costs varying with the season and amount of use. Historically, natural
gas has been a versatile and affordably priced fuel. However, a rapidly growing demand is
affecting the availability and cost of natural gas. Although natural gas supplies remain abundant,
it is an important chemical feedstock used in a wide variety of industries and products that
warrants conservation.

                                                                                                  IV-86

                                                                                   TN / City of Banning
                                                                            Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
The Gas Company
The General Plan planning area is located within the service district of the Gas Company. The
Gas Company has by far the most sophisticated and detailed technical assistance and incentive
program of all energy service providers serving the City. Service planners and technical expertise
from the Gas Company’s various service divisions are available to assist in addressing a wide
range of use issues, including land use master planning, service extension and use-specific
technical consulting/problem solving. Brief summaries of the various services available from the
Gas Company are provided below.
The Gas Company has developed a wide range of energy management, conservation and
equipment retrofit programs for its customer base. These programs include core nonresidential
customers equipment rebates up to 20% of the cost of qualifying equipment. Assistance in
facilities planning and analysis is also provided to maximize energy efficiency and cost-effective
equipment purchases and operations.
The Gas Company’s Air Quality Assistance Program provides detailed information on current
and anticipated air quality requirements and helps users through the regulatory compliance maze,
including the permitting process. Business partnerships are also facilitated with an “Export
Hotline” and market research available. The Gas Company also helps in the development of new
technologies and process solutions primarily for industry.
Transit System
The City operates the public transit system, and utilizes a fleet of buses that are powered entirely
by compressed natural gas. These buses provide an important service while helping to reduce
locally generated air pollutants, improve the local environment and promote energy and
environmental awareness.
The Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Fueling station at the City of Banning Corporate Yard was
recently upgraded. The upgraded facility provides expanded capacity and fast fueling ability.
This facility is used for City vehicles, and is also open to the public. With the increased capacity
and redundant compressor units, having adequate and reliable CNG pumping capacity will not be
an issue in the foreseeable future.
Local Renewable Energy Resources
A variety of important renewable energy resources are found in the Banning region, including
the abundant sunshine and high temperatures, and the San Gorgonio Wind Resource Area in the
vicinity of the San Gorgonio Pass. These resources provide practical and cost-effective
alternatives to conventional energy resources.
The development and utilization of local renewable energy resources could significantly reduce
dependence on less environmentally friendly energy sources and may comprise a significant
economic development opportunity for the City and the region.
                                                                               Environmental Resources
                                                                                                   IV-87

                                                                                  TN / City of Banning
                                                                           Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
Wind Energy
Wind energy development in the San Gorgonio Pass area began in the early 1980’s, and was
regulated by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the County of Riverside. The San
Gorgonio Wind Resource Study and substantial subsequent analysis have delineated those
portions of the wind resource area that offers an economically viable (developable) wind
resource. Since winds in the San Gorgonio Pass are intermittent, so too is the generation of
electricity from wind turbines. Nonetheless, wind energy is emerging as an important alternative
to conventional power systems. The cost of wind-generated electricity is now equal to or lower
than electricity generated by coal or natural gas.
Solar Energy
The costs of manufacturing and installing solar photovoltaic systems, which involve the direct
conversion of sunshine to electricity, have been dramatically reduced in recent years, but are still
primarily used for special applications, including powering remote locations. In the past decade,
however, photovoltaic technologies have made significant progress both as stand-alone power
systems and as integrated components of building design and construction. Solar thermal
systems have meanwhile been in use all over the world for many years to provide domestic hot
water and to heat swimming pools. Passive solar designs are also being used to provide natural
lighting and space heating.
Banning is well situated to take advantage of the continued emergence and refinement of solar
technologies, with the use of abundant solar energy for both solar and photovoltaic systems.
Hydrogen Fuel Cells
Hydrogen technology is quickly becoming one of the leading renewable energy sources currently
being developed and utilized. Fuel cell technology uses hydrogen to generate electricity to power
vehicles, homes and businesses. Hydrogen is produced from the splitting of water and its use
generates heat and water vapor but no other wastes.
Fuel cells convert chemical energy directly into electricity with greater efficiency than any other
current power system. When coupled with solar or wind technologies, hydrogen power can be
utilized on large scales, including primary power for commercial and industrial uses. While not
new, fuel cell technologies are being developed and refined at an accelerating pace.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Since the onset of the industrial revolution, energy and mineral resource production and use have
become essential components of infrastructure and technology development, and have greatly
enhanced our quality of life. Retrieving, harnessing and using these resources have also been one
of the major causes of environmental degradation, impacting wildlife habitat, affecting water and
air quality, and being directly and indirectly associated with a wide range of adverse public
health effects.
The economic and environmental costs associated with conventional and frequently
indiscriminate mineral and energy production and use are forcing communities and countries to
develop new policies and programs. The various constraints that have emerged can also be
                                                                              Environmental Resources
                                                                                                  IV-88

                                                                                   TN / City of Banning
                                                                            Draft General Plan / 4/19/06
viewed as opportunities for economic and environmental enhancement. Materials recycling, and
lowering or shifting energy demand will help to control costs and require mineral and energy
providers to operate more efficiently and to price their products more competitively.
The use of small-scale systems that provide local on-site power, while also being connected to
the larger regional power grid, may allow for a more decentralized system of power generation in
the future. Rather than one dominant technology emerging, the future may see a variety of
technologies finding a place in the mix of power generators. New and old technologies are
emerging in the market place, including wind turbines, photovoltaic systems, gas-fired micro-
turbines, and fuel cells which can use a variety of fuels. The resulting system would be based
upon locally available resources and provide a more flexible capacity that is less susceptible to
interruption. However, the larger regional grid will continue to be an essential part of the electric
power system, but sources of power are likely to be more varied and more widely distributed.
Encouraging conservation and the development and use of alternative and renewable energy will
also expand economic opportunity. Issues of local and national economic security will also be
addressed by the development and implementation of enlightened energy policies. Developing
energy policies with an emphasis on conservation, local control, greater use of renewable
resources and community-scale technologies, will help assure a secure and environmentally
friendly energy future.

GEOTECHNICAL ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Geotechnical Element intends to provide information regarding the geological and seismic
conditions and hazards affecting the City of Banning, its Sphere-of-Influence (SOI), and the
expanded General Plan planning area. A series of goals, policies, and programs are set forth in
the Geotechnical Element focused at providing protection for the general health and welfare of
the community and reducing potential impacts, such as loss of life and property damage,
associated with seismic and geologic hazards. The Element, including maps and other supporting
document will serve as a source of foundational information concerning regional geotechnical
hazards, which are significantly essential to establishing future land use policies and decisions.
BACKGROUND
The physical characteristics of the planning area and the safety of the community are examined
in the Geotechnical Element. The Element itself is closely related to a number of other elements
of a General Plan, such as Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Economic/Fiscal, Public Buildings
and Facilities, Emergency Preparedness, Water, Sewer and Utilities. It is also directly related
with the many issues addressed in the Flooding/Hydrology and Police and Fire Protection
Elements.
Under the California Government Code and Public Resources Code, a General Plan must include
an element that addresses seismic safety issues. In compliance to Government Code Section
65302(g), the General Plan must address the need to protect the community from unreasonable
risks that could result from seismically induced hazards, such as surface rupture, groundshaking,
ground failure, seiching, dam failure, subsidence, and other known harmful geologic risks. The
Geotechnical Element meets, in part, Government Code Section 65303, which allows a General
Plan to also address other subjects related to the physical development of the community.
Government Code Section 8876 sets forth a program that mandates the City and all other
jurisdictions located within the most severe seismic shaking zone, designated as Zone 4 (as
established in Chapter 2-23, Part 2, Title 24 of the Administrative Code), to identify all
potentially hazardous or substandard buildings and implement a program for the mitigation of
these structures.
GEOLOGIC CONDITIONS IN THE PLANNING AREA
The City of Banning is bounded to the north by the San Bernardino Mountains and the San
Jacinto Mountains to the south. The majority of the City area is located in a narrow, east-trending
valley known as the San Gorgonio Pass. The pass extends westward from the Coachella Valley
and joins with the Beaumont Plain and the San Timoteo Badlands farther west. Its highest
elevation is approximately 2,600 feet, which occurs near Beaumont. A number of major streams,
and many other smaller streams and tributaries occur along the canyons of the San Bernardino
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                   V-1
                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
Mountains, including the San Gorgonio River that flows through the Banning Canyon. For the
greater part of the year, streams in the Banning area are dry and convey significant flows only
during the wet winter months.
Geologic and climatic processes have influenced the physical features of the Banning area in the
last few million years. The City of Banning is located at the junction of two distinct
geomorphic/geologic boundaries. Banning is located at the boundary of two great tectonic plates,
the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate. The San Andreas Fault forms the boundary for
the said tectonic plates. In addition to this, the City is located within two geomorphic provinces,
each of which has its own unique physical characteristics. The Transverse Ranges Province,
which encompasses the majority of the planning area, and the Peninsular Ranges Province,
which includes the planning area’s southern edge. The San Gorgonio Pass marks the boundary
between them. The San Gorgonio Pass was created by tectonic forces and constitutes a down-
dropped landmass filled with thick deposits of alluvium.
SOIL PROFILE
The following descriptions of soils units in the planning area, including engineering
characteristics, have been compiled from various sources, including published regional geologic
reports and papers.
There are six types of geologic deposits that underlie the Banning planning area. These consist
of: 1) igneous, granitic, and metamorphic rocks associated with the San Bernardino and San
Jacinto Mountains; 2) sedimentary rocks located in the eastern, central and southern portions of
the Banning planning area; 3) bedrock and rubble associated with landslides and occurring to the
north and south of the plan area; 4) older alluvial fan deposits; 5) young or recent alluvium
deposits; and 6) artificial fill. Please refer to Exhibit V-1 for the geologic map of the Banning
area.

                                                                                                   V-2


                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
Igneous, Granitic, and Metamorphic Basement Rock
Geologic deposits in the Banning planning area include the basement rocks of the San
Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains. The San Bernardino Mountains to the north of the
Banning planning area have been formed from a heterogeneous mix of igneous and metamorphic
rock estimated to be from the pre-Cambrian to Paleozoic age. North of the Banning fault, in the
northern part of the City, Mesozoic igneous rocks have intruded with these ancient rocks. The
basement rocks of the San Bernardino Mountains are categorized as ps for Pelona Schist and sgb
for metasedimentary and meta-plutonic rocks. The San Bernardino Mountains basement rocks
are very dense and generally have low potential for expansion, except in clayey shear zones
where soil expansion range from moderate to high. These geologic units are associated with
moderate to poor slope stability and the common occurrence of rockfalls, tallus slopes and
surficial slides. Given the steep slopes and fractured, crushed conditions, the potential for erosion
on these rocks ranges from moderate to high.
The San Jacinto Mountains to the south is composed of granitic and metamorphic rocks from the
pre-Cambrian to Mesozoic age. These rocks can be seen in the hills along the southern margin of
the City. Further, these rocks are commonly very fractured, locally crushed, and sheared because
they are brittle and have been subjected to tectonic activity over millions of years. The San
Jacinto Mountains basement rocks are also very dense and have low potential for expansion.
Granitic rocks have slope stability ranging from moderate to good, however small suspected
landslides exist in the mountains along the southern edge of the Banning area. Erosion potential
is based on the degree of rock weathering, ranging from low to moderate.
Sedimentary Rocks
Bedrock materials underlying the Banning planning area include sedimentary rocks formed
during the Miocene-to Pleistocene Epoch. There are two types of sedimentary rocks that occur in
the Banning planning area. One is the QTst unit that occurs in the southern planning area and in
the central part of the City between the Banning and San Gorgonio Pass faults. The QTst unit is
primarily composed of non-marine siltstone, sandstone and conglomerate of the San Timoteo
Formation. These sediments have been substantially folded, and are overlain by older alluvial
fans. The QTst unit is associated with the Pleistocene and Pliocene Epochs. The Ts unit is
another type of sedimentary rock which can be found in limited portions along the eastern
boundary of the Banning planning area. The Ts unit is associated with the Pliocene and Miocene
Epochs and can be described as undifferentiated gray sedimentary and volcanic rocks.
The sedimentary rock units that occur in the Banning planning area have low expansion potential
for sandstone and conglomerate substrates, while siltstone and clayey siltstone could have
moderate to high expansion potential. Although, these sedimentary rocks demonstrate good slope
stability, weak bedding layers (silt and clays) provide potential slip planes if support is removed.
Sedimentary rocks have moderate erosion potential, but that may increase with water
concentration.
Bedrock and Rubble
The Banning planning area is underlain by bedrock and rubble materials associated with
landslides. Landslides are movements of relative large landmasses, either as nearly intact
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                   V-4
                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
bedrock blocks, or as jumbled mixes of bedrock blocks, fragments, debris, and soils. The
surrounding mountains in the Banning area have experienced numerous large landslides,
including one that occurred in the northern part of the City. As previously noted, other smaller
suspected landslides occur in the mountains situated along the southern portion of the planning
area. Landslides may be very dense, with surface and margins which are often more
compressible. Expansion potential is dependent upon soil and rock types. The potential for
erosion varies with the condition and weathering of the slide debris. Landslide materials have
generally poor slope stability. Therefore, determination of slide stability requires geologic and
engineering analysis.
Pleistocene Alluvial Fan Deposits
Surface deposits in the Banning planning area include alluvial fan deposits dating back to the
Pleistocene Epoch. These deposits are prevalent in the western portion of the Banning planning
area on the valley floor, and in the Banning Bench area to the north. Based upon strategraphic
position, degree of stream dissection, and the extent of surface soil development, two types of
older fan deposits occur within the Banning area. These are: the Qdf, which represents the older
unit, and the Qof. In general, Pleistocene Epoch alluvial fan composition is moderate to well-
consolidated sediments combined with silt, sand, gravel and boulders. Older alluvial fan deposits
have surfaces that are moderately to well dissected and have argillic (clayey) soil horizons.
Movement on the San Gorgonio Pass fault has uplifted and back-tilted older alluvial fan deposits
in the southern part of the Banning Bench.
In comparison to young alluvium, older alluvial fan deposits are more consolidated and
therefore, could provide better structural support. Soil profiles include high variable potential for
expansion due to surface clay materials, and low to moderate erosion potential. Older alluvial
deposits have generally good slope stability except in areas where stream erosion has created
steep-sided banks, such as along Smith Creek and the San Gorgonio River.
Holocene to Latest Pleistocene Young Alluvium
Young alluvium is the predominant surface material in the entire Banning planning area. It
occurs largely in the eastern and central portions of the planning area and is generally found in
channels and washes. Based on age, four types of young alluvium units have been identified
within the Banning planning area. These are Qw, Qow, Qf, and Qyf. The Qw, Qow, and Qf
units represent the most recent deposits in active stream channels and modern flood plains, while
the Qyf unit refers to fan deposits of Holocene and latest Pleistocene age. Young alluvium is
composed of unconsolidated sediments containing a mixture of silt, sand, gravel, and boulders.
Alluvium soil properties are interrelated with location and the manner by which this soil type
was deposited. For instance, alluvium deposits at the base of mountains and hills are coarse
grained, poorly sorted, usually contain organic debris and commonly deposited at a rapid rate.
Engineering issues associated with these alluvium deposit include: 1) compressibility resulting
from additional loads, and 2) collapse or hydroconsolidation which occurs when water is
introduced if the deposit is dry. Further, alluvium is highly subject to erosion and is also
vulnerable to slope failure on slopes with gradients greater than approximately 2:1 (horizontal to
vertical). Boulders could pose a challenge to earthwork and foundation construction.

                                                                                                  V-5
                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
Artificial Fill
Artificial fill refers to deposits of man-made fill widely distributed throughout the City of
Banning. Artificial fill include road and bridge embankments, and man-made fills associated
with graded developments. This type of deposit varies in size, age, composition, area, and depth.
GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
Landslide and Slope Instability
In the City of Banning, as development reaches higher elevations within the hills, landslides and
slope instability are considered a significant risk. Slope failures can occur on the steep slopes of
the foothills and mountains that surround Banning during or after periods of intense rainfall or in
response to strong seismic shaking. Other areas potentially prone to landslides and slope
instability include areas with steep canyon walls and the natural slopes facing the southern edge
of the City, which are likely to be impacted by rockfalls, rockslides, and soil slips. Landslides
could also occur in southern Banning Bench on shallow subsurface sedimentary rock that are
generally massive to thickly bedded. Exhibit V-2 shows the areas in hillside terrain that are
susceptible to slope failure. This exhibit also shows the areas where assessments and engineering
analyses should be conducted prior to development.
Many factors contribute to slope failure, including slope height, slope steepness, shear strength
and orientation of weak layers in the underlying geologic unit, as well as pore water pressures.
While slope failures can occur on natural slopes, man-made slopes could also fail generally due
to poor engineering or poor construction. Slope failures often occur as elements of interrelated
natural hazards in which one event triggers a secondary event, such earthquake-induced
landsliding, fire-flood sequences, or storm-induced mudflows. Mitigating risks associated with
landslides and slope failures involve careful land planning and management in hillside. This
generally includes land use zoning to restrict development in unstable areas, grading codes for
earthwork construction, geologic and soil engineering investigation and review, construction of
drainage structures, and where required, placement of warning systems. Other important factors
are risk assessments (including susceptibility maps), a concerned local government, and an
educated public.

                                                                                                  V-6

                                                                                          City of Banning
                                                                                             General Plan
Compressible Soils
Compressible soils are those soil units that could compress under the weight of proposed fill
embankments and structures. Compressible soils usually involve geologically young (Holocene
age) unconsolidated sediments with low density. However, it can also occur in the upper
weathered part of older alluvium, colluvium/slope wash that collects near the base of natural
slopes, slope failure debris, and in some cases, very weathered bedrock. Soil characteristics such
as texture and grain size, natural moisture and density, thickness of the compressible layer(s), the
weight of the proposed load, the rate at which the load is applied, and drainage are factors that
determine the settlement potential and the rate of settlement in these sediments. Areas of the City
where compressible soils are most likely to occur are the San Gorgonio Pass valley, as well as
active and recently active stream channels. In the hills, compressible soils are commonly found
in canyon bottoms, swales, and at the base of natural slopes. Compression is also associated
with landslide deposits particularly at the head or graben area and along the margins. Deep fill
embankments, generally those greater than 60 feet deep, will also compress under their own
weight. Sound engineering, including a thorough geotechnical soils analysis, could prevent
potential hazards associated with compressible soils.
Collapsible Soils
Soil collapse, or hydroconsolidation, occurs when saturated soil units undergo a rearrangement
of their grains and a loss of cohesion or cementation, resulting in substantial and rapid settlement
under relatively light loads. Soil collapse is generally associated with recently deposited,
Holocene-age soils that have accumulated in an arid or semi-arid environment. Wind-deposited
sands and silts, and alluvial fan and debris flow sediments deposited during flash floods
represent soils that are susceptible to collapse. Irrigation, or a rise in the groundwater table could
increase surface water infiltration, which when combined with the weight of a building or
structure, can start rapid settlement and cause foundations and walls to crack. Differential
settlement of structures generally occurs when landscaping is heavily irrigated in close proximity
to the structure’s foundation.
The Holocene sediments that underlie the Banning area are vulnerable to soil collapse. This is
due to the granular nature of the soils, rapid deposition in the alluvial fan environment, and
generally dry condition of the upper soils. Proper surface drainage design, excavation and
recompaction, or pre-saturation and pre-loading of the susceptible soils in place to induce
collapse prior to construction are some measures that could mitigate hazards associated with
soils collapse. The potential for soils to collapse should be assessed on a site-specific basis as
part of the geotechnical studies for development.
Expansive Soils
Expansive soils are those with significant amount of clay minerals that have the ability to give up
water (shrink) or absorb water (swell). These minerals can undergo significant volumetric
changes as a result of changes in moisture content. The upward pressures induced by the
swelling of expansive soils can have significant harmful effects upon structures and other surface
improvements. In Banning, expansive soils are primarily associated with areas underlain by older
fan deposits containing argillic soil profiles that are typically rich in clay and probably fall in the
moderately expansive range. While granitic and metamorphic basement rocks have low
                                                                                   Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                     V-8

                                                                                     City of Banning
                                                                                        General Plan
expansion characteristics, the faults and shear zones within these rocks commonly contain clays
with expansive minerals. Since, the low-lying areas of the City are underlain by alluvial fan
sediments that are composed primarily of granular soils, the expansion potential for soils ranges
from very low to moderately low. Mitigation of expansive soils includes good surface drainage
control, educating the public regarding moisture levels involving landscaping and avoiding
placement of expansive soils near the surface.
Ground Subsidence
Ground subsidence, the gradual settling or sinking of the ground surface with little or no
horizontal movement, is generally associated with oil, gas or ground water extraction from below
the ground surface in sediment filled valleys and floodplains. Evidence of regional subsidence on
ground surface includes earth fissures, sinkholes or depressions, and disruption of surface
drainage. Ground subsidence could cause damages to canals, levees, underground pipelines,
wells, buildings, roads, railroads and other structures and improvements. Good management of
local water supplies, including the reduction in local wells pumping, importing water and the use
of artificial recharge has mitigated subsidence in affected areas. While subsidence has not been
observed in Banning, the most populated part of the City occurs in an area with geologic
conditions vulnerable to ground subsidence. At present, the City relies on groundwater for its
water supply. The alluvial sediments within the groundwater basins from which the City’s water
is withdrawn are subject to subsidence if rapid groundwater extraction occurs in response to
increased water demands associated with population growth or long periods of drought. The
continued implementation of groundwater conservation and recharge activities in the Banning
area contributes to the management of ground subsidence. Preventive measures include
monitoring groundwater and basin conditions and increasing the use of reclaimed water, storm
water or imported water.
Erosion
The Banning planning area is subject to erosion, runoff, and sedimentation due to the extreme
topographic relief between the valley and the surrounding mountains. Climate, topography, soil
and rock types and vegetation are key factors to erosion, runoff, and sedimentation processes.
Human activities such as agricultural or land development accelerate natural erosion. Grading
which could involve altering natural drainage patterns, soil compaction, and cut and fill slopes
increases the potential for erosion, and sedimentation. Development that creates impermeable
surfaces increases the potential for flooding and sedimentation downstream of the project. The
most developed part of the City of Banning occurs on alluvial fans that are still receiving
sediments from the mountains, while future developments are proposed within the City’s upland
areas. Mitigation measures against erosion are required for graded slopes that are constructed
with the granular soils that occur in the City. Mitigation of erosion and sedimentation includes
structures such as check dams, catchment basins, diversion dikes and swales. Terracing slopes,
berms, v-ditches and other storm drain systems can reduce erosion potentials associated with
manufactured slopes.
Wind Erosion
The Banning area is susceptible to wind erosion due to the strong winds that are funneled
through the narrow San Gorgonio Pass. Wind erosion commonly occurs in relatively flat, bare
areas; dry sandy soils; or in any areas containing loose, dry, and finely granulated soils. Soil
                                                                              Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                V-9

                                                                                         City of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
movement begins when wind forces are exerted against ground surface. Wind velocity, particle
size and the cloddiness of particles determine the amount of soil being moved. Generally, soil
can be blown away at any height, however, the majority (over 93%) of soil movement occurs at
or within 3 feet or one meter of the ground surface. Several physical factors determine the
intensity and distribution of wind-blown sand in the Banning/San Gorgonio Pass. One factor is
the orientation of the long axes of the hill and mountain masses aligns in a northwest-southeast
direction, which provides little resistance to air flow. Another factor is the nature of bedrock,
which in this case involves granitic and metamorphic rock-types that easily weather to grain size
and are transportable by wind. The episodic flooding of the Whitewater River, located at the
eastern end of the San Gorgonio Pass, also influences wind-blown sand given the large amounts
of sand and gravel deposited on the Whitewater River floodplain. Air movement is also generally
unhindered down the long axis of the valley due to valley floor elevations, which slopes from the
summit of the San Gorgonio Pass near Banning approximately 2,600 feet, to below sea level in
the Salton Sea area. Dry climate and sparse and wide spread natural vegetation on the valley
floor are vulnerable to strong wind activity, while short, and intense rainfall in the local
mountains result in torrential run-off that transports large amounts of deposits on the valley floor.
Damage to land and natural vegetation results from strong winds that remove soils from one
location and transport it to another. Further, it causes air pollution, loss of soil, deterioration and
dryness of soil structure, nutrient and productivity losses and sediment transport and deposition.
Wind-blown sand is also associated with environmental hazards when strong winds are funneled
through the San Gorgonio Pass into the Coachella Valley. Major health risk to humans including
respiratory damage, eye infection, skin disorders and other discomforts could result from sand
and dust particles in the air. Dust storms can affect air and highway traffic safety, reduce
visibility, cause damage to buildings, vehicles, crops and vegetation. Removal of blow sand from
streets, driveways and other areas could also become a considerable expense. Current mitigation
measures to wind erosion include wind barriers such as hedges, watering construction sites, and
vegetation cover.
SEISMIC ASSESSMENT
The majority of southern California occurs along the boundary between the North American and
Pacific tectonic plates that could generate strong seismic activities. Relative to the North
American Plate, the Pacific Plate is moving in a northwesterly direction, approximately 50
millimeters per year. As mentioned above, the Banning area is located at the boundary, formed
by the San Andreas Fault, between the North American and Pacific plates. The San Andreas
Fault crosses the Banning General Plan planning area. Furthermore, the San Andreas fault
accommodates approximately 70% of the movement between the North American and Pacific
tectonic plates, while the remaining motion is distributed between the Eastern Mojave Shear
Zone and a number of the sub-parallel faults of the San Andreas fault, including the San Jacinto,
Whittier–Elsinore, Newport-Inglewood, Palos Verdes, and other offshore faults. Given its
physical and geologic location, the Banning area is susceptible to potential intense seismic
ground shaking that could affect the safety and welfare of the general community.

MEASURING SEISMIC EVENTS
Seismic events are classified according to their magnitude and intensity. Several factors
determine the intensity of ground shaking, including the magnitude of the earthquake, the
distance from the epicenter, and the geologic composition of local soils and rocks.
The Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale is most commonly used to measure seismic
intensity. The scale includes twelve levels of damage and is derived from actual observations of
damage to structures and human reactions to earthquakes. A Level I earthquake tremor is
generally not felt and damage potentials are unlikely to occur. However, a Level XII earthquake
results in total destruction. Damage varies with earthquake intensities and may include partial or
complete collapse of masonry structures, severe to complete destruction of underground
pipelines, rock and land slides, massive damage or destruction of bridges, overpasses and other
improvements.
The Richter Scale measures earthquake magnitude based on a scale of one to nine. Each increase
in the level of magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the amplitude of the waves on a
seismogram.
The most notable historic earthquake in the Banning region was the Landers earthquake of 1992.
This earthquake had a magnitude of 7.3 on the Richter Scale and also ruptured five other
separate faults. Its epicenter occurred near the small desert community of Landers.
The Maximum Probable Earthquake (MPE) refers to the largest earthquake likely to occur on a
fault or fault segment, within a specified period of time. The MPE is useful during emergency
and engineering planning to assess the potential seismic risk within a region. It is also referenced
to establish safe construction and design parameters and facilitate the preparation of policies and
programs that are responsive to the potential impacts of an earthquake.
The Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) is the largest earthquake a fault is estimated to be
capable of generating. As with the MPE, Maximum Credible Earthquake (MCE) is also useful in
emergency and engineering planning efforts. In the Banning area, the San Andreas fault (1857
Rupture) is expected to generate a magnitude 7.8 earthquake, which is equivalent to a Level VI –
VII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMI). Table V-1 is a list of faults that could
generate significant impacts in the Banning area.

   MAJOR FAULTS AFFECTING THE PLANNING AREA
   Earthquakes can result in substantial property damage, the loss of public services and facilities,
   and loss of life. Strong ground shaking is the geologic hazard that has the greatest potential to
   severely impact the Banning planning area. Seismic ground shaking can result in landslides,
   ground lurching, structural damage or destruction, and liquefaction. It is also associated with
   other hazards, including fire, disruption of essential facilities (such as water, sewer, gas, electric,
   transportation, communications, drainage), release of hazardous materials, and flood inundation
   resulting from dam or water tank failure. The following discussion describes the faults in the
   Banning planning area. These are shown in Exhibit V-3.
                                                                                        Environmental Hazards

                                                                                         General Plan
San Andreas Fault
The San Andreas Fault zone passes through the northerly portion of the Banning planning area. It
is the longest fault in the state of California, extending approximately 600 miles from the Salton
Sea to Cape Mendocino. The San Andreas is a right-lateral transform fault regarded as a “Master
Fault” that controls the seismic hazard for central and southern California. The last major
earthquake to occur on the southern San Andreas was the magnitude 8.0 Fort Tejon earthquake
in 1857.
The Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities (WGCEP) defines the southern
portion of the San Andreas as divided into three segments. From north to south, they include the
Mojave, San Bernardino Mountains, and Coachella Valley segments. The boundary between the
San Bernardino and Coachella Valley segments occurs in the San Gorgonio Pass area.
The Coachella Valley segment is the southernmost of the San Andreas Fault zone segments, and
the least likely of the segments to fail in the next 30 years (22% likelihood of rupturing).
However, recent studies indicate that the Landers earthquake of 1992 has increased the stress
towards failure on this segment. The Coachella Valley segment extends from the Salton Sea on
the southeast to the Indio Hills on the southeast, through Desert Hot Springs, and joins with the
Mill Creek and Mission Creek faults to the northwest. Although paleoseismic data indicate that
the average time interval between earthquakes on the Coachella Valley segment is about 230
years, the most recent rupture occurred about 300 years ago.
The San Bernardino Mountains segment consists of the fault zone between the San Gorgonio
Pass on the southeast and the Cajon Pass to the northwest. (WGCEP, 1988) It includes a near-
vertical fault segment at the base of the San Bernardino Mountains. The fault trace turns
southerly as it approaches the San Gorgonio Pass and breaks into short continuous segments, in
the vicinity of Banning. The San Bernardino fault trace crosses the northernmost part of the City,
within the boundary of the San Bernardino National Forest. The San Bernardino segment is
considered the most likely to fail within the next 30 years, with a 28% chance of rupturing. The
segment’s last rupture occur in 1812, however, the Landers earthquake series of 1992 may have
accelerated the potential for another great earthquake on this segment by 8 to 22 years.
The Mojave segment is approximately 63 miles long and represents the northernmost segment of
the southern San Andreas Fault system. The last rupture on this segment occurred simultaneously
with the Carrizo Plain segment to the north during the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake. It is possible
for the Mojave segment to rupture with the Coachella Valley and/or the San Bernardino
segments could initiate simultaneous rupture on the San Bernardino and/or Coachella Valley
segments, potentially causing severe damage to the Banning area.
The San Gorgonio Pass forms the physical boundary that separates the Coachella Valley and San
Bernardino segments of the San Andreas Fault. Its structural complexity includes a 12-mile wide
step-over in the fault’s surface trace, which creates a localized zone of compression, represented
primarily as a reverse and thrust-type faulting. It is believed that the San Gorgonio Pass has
absorbed the slip on the Coachella Valley fault segment.

Banning Fault
The Banning fault is an ancient right-lateral strike-slip structure. It has a western segment that is
considered inactive and a central segment that includes a 2-mile long section that is active and
connects with the Gandy Ranch fault. The Banning fault traverses through the City of Banning as
two roughly parallel strands. The northernmost strand consists of thrust-type movement; the
southernmost strand demonstrates compressional characteristics and is considered inactive in the
Banning Bench area. The eastern portion of the Banning fault, also known as the Coachella
Valley segment, from Cottonwood Canyon to its intersection with the San Andreas fault near the
Indio Hills, has been reactivated during the Quaternary period.
San Gorgonio Pass Fault Zone
The San Gorgonio Pass fault zone is a series of north-dipping reverse and thrust faults connected
by strike tear faults, resulting to a surface trace that appears like an irregular, saw-tooth. This
east-west trending fault zone contains faults that were formed during the Pleistocene Epoch, of
which some have been active in the later Holocene Epoch. The most recently active strands of
faults occur at the base of the Banning Bench, in the central part of Banning. The Highland Scarp
along the western edge of the City is considered an active segment of the San Gorgonio Pass
fault zone.
San Jacinto Fault Zone
The San Jacinto fault zone is primarily a right-lateral strike-slip fault that trends northwesterly
and extends approximately 175 miles in length. It has an annual slip rate of between 7 and 17
mm. The most recent surface-rupturing earthquakes on the San Jacinto fault occurred on the
Coyote Creek segment in 1968 and on the Superstition Hills segment in 1987. As with other
large fault zones, the San Jacinto fault has been divided into segments. Its closest point is
approximately five miles southwest of the Banning. Historically, the San Jacinto fault has
generated more large earthquakes than any other fault in southern California. However, none of
these seismic activities have been as large as the San Andreas Fault earthquakes of 1857 and
1906.
Garnet Hill Fault
The Garnet Hill fault is predominantly a right-lateral strike-slip fault along most of its trace, but
splays into a series of oblique reverse faults at its western base. It trends similarly to the
Coachella Valley segment of the Banning fault and extends from a few miles west of Whitewater
south to Thousand Palms, where the fault trace dies out. According to seismological data, the
Garnet Hill fault merges with the Coachella Valley segment of the Banning fault approximately
5 km deep, and that the underlying single fault plane is responsible for the 1986 North Palm
Springs earthquake.
Gandy Ranch Fault
The Gandy Ranch fault is a right-lateral strike slip fault that branches off the active section of the
Banning fault at Millard Canyon. It passes through the City and should be considered as an
active fault. However, much data regarding this fault is unknown, including slip rate and
earthquake potential due to lack of investigation/studies.

Mission Creek Fault
The Mission Creek fault is a right-lateral strike slip fault along most of its trace, but turns into a
thrust-type fault at its western end. The western end of the fault occurs at the northern boundary
of the City of Banning, within the San Bernardino National Forest. The Mission Creek fault and
the western end of the Coachella Valley segment of the San Andreas Fault merge and continues
westward to a point truncated by the San Bernardino segment of the San Andreas. The California
Geological Survey (CGS) considers this fault active and has designated it as an Alquist-Priolo
Earthquake Fault Zone.
Beaumont Plain Fault Zone
The Beaumont Plain fault is located to the west and southwest of the City of Banning. It is
comprised of a number of northwest-trending faults represented by the discontinuous northeast-
facing scarps. Detailed studies have not been conducted regarding the Beaumont Plain fault
zone.
Cox Ranch Fault Zone
The Cox Ranch fault occurs in the mountains between Portero and Whitewater Canyons. This
group of discontinuous, west to northwest-trending faults varies in movement, from strike-slip to
primarily normal dip-slip. They are considered active faults and have slip rates that appear to be
small in comparison to other faults in the region.
SEISMICALLY INDUCED GEOTECHNICAL HAZARDS
Ground Shaking
Seismically induced ground shaking is the most significant potential geotechnical hazard facing
the Banning area. Given the City’s proximity of the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults, the
urban core of the City has the potential to experience very high and extremely high ground
shaking values of about 50% of the force of gravity, with a 10% chance of such a seismic event
occurring in 50 years. These are probabilistic values, which combine all seismic sources in the
area and assess the likelihood of each source to generate an earthquake. These values are among
the highest in southern California and are the result of the City’s proximity to major fault
systems with high earthquake recurrence rates.
The effects of ground motion on structures are difficult to predict, and depend on the intensity of
the quake, the distance from the epicenter to the site, the composition of soils and bedrock,
building design, and other physical criteria. Based on these factors, ground shaking may cause
no, little, or major structural damage or destruction; however, in general, peak ground
accelerations and seismic intensity values decrease with increasing distance from the causative
fault. Local conditions, such as soft soils, shallow ground water, and the presence of ridge tops,
could amplify the effects of seismic waves and result in higher localized accelerations. The
Uniform Building Code, California Building Code, and Unreinforced Masonry Law are the
primary tools used by local agencies to ensure seismic safety in structures (see Legislation
sections below).
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                  V-16

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
Liquefaction
Liquefaction is a common occurrence in loose, saturated, sandy sediments that are subjected to
ground vibrations greater than 0.2 g. This geologic process causes the total or substantial loss of
shear strength in the affected sediments. During liquefaction, involved soils behave like a liquid
or semi-viscous substance and can cause structural distress or failure due to ground settlement, a
loss of load-bearing capacity in foundation soils, and the buoyant rise of buried structures.
Three general conditions induce liquefaction. One condition is strong ground shaking of
relatively long period. Another condition is the presence of unconsolidated granular sediments. A
third condition is the occurrence of water-saturated sediments within 50 feet of the ground
surface. These general conditions appear to occur in the Banning planning area, thereby allowing
the potential for liquefaction. A number of active faults in the region could potentially generate
earthquake characterized by strong ground shaking of long durations. Granular loose sediments
are present along the major drainages in the City, as well as, within the valley, wherein the
majority of the built environment exists. Because the alluvium that underlies the Banning areas is
coarsely granular and percolates well, the water table is not within 50 feet of the ground surface.
However, in the past, shallow groundwater was detected on the southernmost part of the valley
before water pumping activity. In general, recently deposited sediments are likely vulnerable to
liquefaction during an earthquake, if shallow ground water is present. Liquefaction hazards in the
planning area are illustrated in Exhibit V-4.
Seismically Induced Settlement
Under certain circumstances, strong ground shaking can cause the densification of soils, resulting
in local or regional settlement of the ground surface. This type of ground failure results when
loose granular, cohesionless soil grains become tightly packed due to the collapse of voids and
pore spaces. Recently deposited alluvial sediments and artificial fills that are not properly
compacted are especially susceptible to this hazard. Effects can include structural damage and
damage to water, sewer, and other subsurface pipelines. In Banning, areas underlain by late
Quaternary alluvial sediments may be susceptible to seismically induced settlement.
Seismically Induced Rockfalls and Landslides
Strong ground motions can result in landslides, rock slides and rock falls, particularly where
saturated ground conditions exist. In the Banning planning area, the potential for landslides to
occur increases where there is a high seismic potential, rapid uplift and erosion resulting in steep
slopes and deeply incised canyons, rock with inherently weak components such as silt or clay
layers and highly fractured and folded rock. In addition, slope orientation relative to the direction
of the seismic wave also contributes to the occurrence of landslides in the planning area. The
northernmost and southernmost portions of the Banning planning area are highly susceptible to
seismically induced slope failure given these areas encompass the mountains and hillsides. Areas
of Banning which contain slopes steeper than approximately 15 degrees are generally subject to
slope failure; however, failures on flatter slopes are also potential when the face of the slope
consists of unsupported, weak rock units. During an earthquake, groundwater conditions have an
influence in the development of seismically induced slope failures, as well as landslides and
mudflows.
                                                                                Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                 V-17

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
Deformation of Sidehill Fills
Strong seismic ground shaking could also result to the deformation of sidehill fills that can cause
minor to severe property damage. Sidehill fills are artificial fill wedges typically constructed on
natural slopes to create roadways or level building pads. Cracking at the cut/fill contact area,
differential settlement in the fill wedge, and bulging on the slope face can develop from strong
ground shaking. This phenomenon has occurred most often in relatively thin fills of 27 feet or
less placed near the tops of narrow ridges. Hillside grading designs within the planning area may
be susceptible to this hazard, and the likelihood of its occurrence should be evaluated during site-
specific geotechnical investigations.
Ridgetop Fissure and Shattering
Ridgetop fissuring and shattering is the result of intense amplification or focusing of seismic
energy due to local topographic features. Linear fault-like fissures and shattering of surface soils
on the crests of steep, narrow ridgelines occurred during the 1989 Loma Prieta and 1994
Northridge earthquakes. Surfaces affected by ridgetop shattering appear as if plowed. This
phenomenon can result in severe structural damage, particularly if it occurs on relatively high
(greater than 100 feet), narrow (typically less than 300 feet wide) ridges flanked by slopes
steeper than about 2.5:1 (horizontal:vertical). Topographically steep areas in Banning are
susceptible to ridgetop fissuring and shattering, while continued development into the City’s
hillsides and mountains increases the potential for this hazard. Concerns include above ground
reservoirs, storage tanks and utility towers which are typically located on ridgetops that could
fail or topple over, cause severe damage to development downgradient, and disrupt lifeline
systems in the event of intense ground shaking.
Seiches and Seismically Induced Inundation
Seiches are seismically-induced oscillation or sloshing of water contained in enclosed bodies of
water including lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and swimming pools. This hazard is dependent upon the
frequency of seismic waves, distance and direction from the epicenter, and site-specific design
criteria of the enclosed body of water. Swimming pools and other small bodies of water are
likely to incur minor damages in the event of seismically induced seiches. However, seiching
could result in the failure of larger bodies of water, including water tanks, retention basins,
recharge basins and other water storage structures, and could result in the inundation of land and
structures downslope. Within portions of the northern and southern Banning planning area, there
are percolation ponds and man-made lakes, such as those within the Sun Lakes project, which
may be subject to seiches. At present, there are no open reservoirs in the City of Banning.
Damage to water storage tanks and systems could substantially affect efforts to suppress fires
and limit the supply of potable water after a major earthquake. Design elements, such as baffles,
are required to reduce the potential for seiches in tanks, open reservoirs, and ponds where
overflow or structural failure may cause damage to nearby properties. Criteria for seismic design
of water tanks are provided in the American Water Works Association (AWWA) Standards for
Design of Steel Water Tanks.

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
MITIGATION OF EARTHQUAKE HAZARDS
The majority of injuries and loss of life related to earthquakes are typically linked to the collapse
of buildings and structures. While preventing the occurrence of an earthquake is not feasible,
their destructive effects can be minimized through comprehensive hazard mitigation measures
that include the identification and mapping of potential hazards, sensible planning, strict
implementation of building codes, and the retrofitting and rehabilitation of weak structures.
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act
California’s Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act was signed into law in 1972, primarily
to mitigate the hazards of fault rupture by prohibiting the location of structures for human
occupancy across the trace of an active fault. The Act requires the State Geologist to delineate
“earthquake fault zones” that show evidence of Holocene surface displacement along one or
more of their segments, and are clearly detectable by a trained geologist as a physical feature at
or just below the ground surface. The boundary of an earthquake fault zone is generally about
500 feet from major active faults, and 200 to 300 feet from well-defined minor faults. The Act
also requires counties and cities to withhold development permits for sites within earthquake
fault zones until geologic investigations demonstrate that the sites are not threatened by surface
displacement associated with future faulting. State law defines which types of development must
be regulated, but local agencies could be more restrictive than state law.
The State Geologist has issued Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone mapping for the Banning
General Plan planning area. The mapping consists of the Beaumont quadrangle (CDMG, 1995a),
Cabazon quadrangle (CDMG, 1995b), and the San Gorgonio SW quadrangle (CDMG, 1974).
Several faults within the Banning area are currently zoned under the Alquist-Priolo Act. It is
important to recognize that the State Geologist revises the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones
occasionally based upon new data resulting from scientific research or fault studies. Additional
fault hazard study zones could be imposed by local agencies, either at the county or city level.
Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
In addition to the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act which addresses only the hazard
of surface fault rupture, the State enacted the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act (1990). The Seismic
Hazards Mapping Act (1990) addresses non-surface rupture earthquake hazards that includes
strong ground shaking, liquefaction, and seismically induced landslides. The Act intends to
reduce loss of life and property by identifying and mitigating seismic hazards. The California
Geological Survey (CGS) is responsible for implementing the Act. CGS provides local
governments with seismic hazard zone maps that delineate areas susceptible to seismic hazards
and other ground failure hazards termed as “zones of required investigations”. When
development projects are proposed within the designated hazard zones, site-specific geological
hazard investigations are required. CGS has not completed its seismic hazard mapping for the
Riverside County, including the City of Banning. However, specific studies conducted for the
City General Plan Update have analyzed and mapped this hazard.
Real Estate Disclosure Requirements
Since June 1, 1998, in accordance to the Natural Hazards Disclosure Act, sellers of real estate
properties and their agents must provide prospective buyers with a “Natural Hazard Disclosure
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                  V-20

                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
Statement” if the property being sold occurs within one or more State-mapped hazard areas.
Further, the California State law requires a seller to provide the buyer of a house built before
1960, a completed earthquake hazards disclosure report and a copy of booklet entitled “The
Homeowner’s Guide to Earthquake Safety.” This publication was written and adopted by the
California Seismic Safety Commission. Under the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act
and Seismic Hazards Mapping Act, realestate agents or sellers of real estate acting without an
agent must disclose to potential buyers that the property is located in an Earthquake Fault Zone
and/Seismic Hazard Zone.
California Environmental Quality Act
The California Environmental Quality Act of 1970 was passed to ensure that local governmental
agencies consider and review the environmental impacts of proposed projects within their
jurisdictions. According to CEQA regulations, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) must be
prepared for projects that may have significant impacts to the environment. An EIR must identify
geologic and seismic hazards and include potential mitigation measures to reduce potential
impacts.
Uniform Building Code and California Building Code
The Uniform Building Code (UBC) is an important tool used by local agencies to ensure seismic
safety in structures. It defines minimum lateral forces needed to resist seismic shaking, purpose
of the building, seismic zone, type of structural system, building configuration and height, and
soil profile types that result in various degrees of shaking. The last version of the UBC was
issued in 1997.
The California Building Code (CBC) also known as Title 24 of the California Code of
Regulations provides building regulations tailored for California earthquake conditions. By law,
every local agency, City and County enforcing building regulations must adopt the CBC within
180 days of its publication. In addition to CBC regulations, a local jurisdiction may adopt more
stringent amendments provided that they are based upon local geographic, topographic or
climatic conditions.
It is important to note that the Building Codes are minimum requirements. In some cases, these
requirements may not be adequate to protect health and safety. Therefore, it is essential for
geotechnical consultants, engineers, the City and reviewers of their work to keep up to date with
current research.
Seismic Retrofitting
According to the Unreinforced Masonry Law of 1986, all cities and counties in Seismic Zone 4
must identify potentially hazardous unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings in their jurisdictions,
establish a URM loss reduction program, and report their progress to the State by 1990. The
entire Banning area occurs within Seismic Zone 4. Seismic zones are zones near historically
active faults. In compliance to the Unreinforced Masonry Law, the City of Banning conducted an
inventory of their URMs and notified building owners about the hazards of URM construction.
In 2003, the City reported to the Seismic Safety Commission that 49 non-historic URMs had
been identified. Of these, only one building has not been upgraded but is currently not being
utilized. Furthermore, past earthquakes have shown that many types of structures, in addition to
                                                                               Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                V-21

                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
URMs, are potentially hazardous. These include pre-cast tilt-up concrete buildings (including
pre-1971 structures), soft story structures, unreinforced concrete buildings, and pre-1952 single-
family structures. Irregular-shaped buildings and mobile homes are also considered at risk. It is
recommended that the City consider developing and adopting a program that inventories and
provides mitigation of these structures.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Given the continued challenges posed by local seismic and geotechnical conditions, it is
important for the City to implement and enforce the regulations and guidelines set forth in the
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act, CEQA Statutes and Guidelines,
Uniform/International Building Code, zoning ordinance, and other applicable legislation to
manage hazards addressed in this Element. Further, it is essential for the City to maintain and/or
develop close coordination with state, regional, and county agencies for the purpose of
establishing and keeping an up-to-date information database of geotechnical and seismic
conditions in the region. The City’s development review process must ensure comprehensive and
careful evaluation of geotechnical and seismic safety associated with development proposals,
including that all necessary special studies are conducted and reviewed, and that comprehensive
mitigation measures are implemented.

FLOODING AND HYDROLOGY ELEMENT
PURPOSE
By providing discussion and setting forth its goals, policies, and programs, the Flooding and
Hydrology Element of the Banning General Plan addresses potential drainage and flooding
hazards within the community. The foremost goal of this Element is to protect the general health,
safety and welfare of the community from potential flood and associated hazards. It references
and coordinates with other elements of the General Plan, which also address threats to the lives
and property of the community’s residents. The potential for and extent of major future flooding
is also evaluated. It is the intention of the community to facilitate, plan and implement the phased
development of flood control facilities, both project-specific and Citywide.
BACKGROUND
Other General Plan Elements related to this Element include the Geotechnical Element, which
addresses some of the City’s most primary environmental threats. The Hazardous and Toxic
Materials Element is also related, as it discusses the potential of transporting and storing
hazardous and toxic materials above and below ground. The Circulation Element, which
addresses the need for, and availability of adequate access and evacuation routes in the event of a
major community disaster or threat, is another related Element. Policies and programs set forth in
the Land Use Element direct the location of open space, essential public facilities, and developed
areas which have some effect on flooding issues, and their potential for damage.
State policies and regulations require that the General Plan address potential flooding hazards
within a community and offer mitigation measures to lessen their impacts. Chapter 73 of the
Statutes of California, 1939, mandates the joint planning of area-wide drainage plans affecting
local jurisdictions. In addition, Government Code Section 8401 (c) requires that local
governments plan, adopt, and enforce land use regulations for flood plain management. This
legislation, also known as the Cobey-Alquist Flood Plain Management Act, also establishes
requirements for receiving state financial assistance for flood control measures. California
Government Code Section 8589.5 and 65302 (g) require the mapping of areas subject to
inundation in the event of dam failures.
Meteorological Setting
Floods that impact the City can be attributed to three different types of storm events: general
winter storms, combining high-intensity rainfall and rapid melting of the mountain snowpack;
tropical storms out of the southern Pacific Ocean; and summer thunderstorms. A summer storm
poses greater threat of flooding than a winter storm because of its high intensity and short
duration of rainfall. Most of the rainfall occurs during the cooler months of November through
April, but occasional high-intensity thunderstorms and tropical storms occur in late summer and
early fall. Although the ground may be generally dry at the beginning of a storm, sufficient
amounts and intensities of rainfall can saturate the surface, substantially reducing percolation and

                                                                                           General Plan
increasing runoff. Since mountain areas generally have higher rainfall, the mountains
surrounding the planning area average an annual rainfall of over 25 inches, while the valley
floor, including the planning area, averages about 18 inches annually.
Rainfall in southern California is extremely unpredictable on an annual basis. For example, the
annual rainfall in Banning between the year 1977 and 2004 ranged from a low of 4.44 inches to a
high of 49.54 inches. These readings were recorded at the Riverside County Flood Control rain
gage, on the upper part of the Banning Bench (el. 3,600’).
General Conditions and Flood Hazards
Floods are natural, recurring events. They become hazardous only when man’s encroachment
onto floodplains results in modification of the landscape and building structures in the areas
intended to convey excess water during flooding. Floodplains typically provide level ground and
fertile soils suitable for agriculture, and access to water supplies and transportation routes.
However, these benefits come with a price, as flooding is one of the most destructive natural
hazards in the world. It is responsible for more deaths per year than any other geologic hazard.
Further, the economic costs as measured in average annual flood losses (in dollars) have
increased steadily over the last decades as development in floodplains has increased. Major flood
events occurred in southern California in 1862, 1884, 1916, 1938, 1969, 1978, 1980, 1983, 1988,
1992, 1995, and 1998. As a result of floods, particularly in dense urbanized floodplains and
alluvial fans, awareness of the potential for public and private losses has increased.
With development also comes an increase in impervious surfaces, such as buildings, concrete
walks and asphalt roadways. Water that previously absorbed into the ground now becomes
runoff to downstream areas. If the storm drain systems associated with new development are not
designed or improved to convey increased flows due to runoff from impervious surfaces, areas
down stream that may not have flooded in the past may be subject to flooding in the future. This
is especially true for developments downstream of canyons and at the base of the mountains. The
surrounding mountain slopes generally receive rainfall that increases with elevation. Potential
flooding problems in the City of Banning, its Sphere-of-Influence and planning area are
associated with storm events in the San Gorgonio River basin.
Banning encompasses sharp contrasts in terrain, with high to moderately steep slopes bordering
the City on the south, and a narrow southeastward-sloping valley characterizing the central part
of the City. Steep, rugged mountains rise from the northern edge of this valley to form a dramatic
backdrop. The mountains have been deeply incised by large, south-flowing streams that have
created drainage basins that extend miles beyond the City limits. The San Gorgonio River is the
largest of these streams, and has the greatest drainage basin area. It receives runoff from several
other large canyons along its lower reaches before it exits the City near Interstate 10 (I-10).
Smith Creek, the largest tributary (within the City) to the San Gorgonio River, drains the west
side of the City. Smith Creek originates in the San Bernardino Mountains and flows south across
the valley. It then turns east, following the base of the San Jacinto Mountains to its confluence
with the San Gorgonio River east of the City. Smith Creek collects runoff from numerous
smaller streams that drain the southern part of the Banning Bench, including Pershing,
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards

                                                                                           General Plan
Montgomery, Gilman Home Channel, and several unnamed drainages. Runoff from the gently
sloping alluvial fans that comprise the valley also collect in Smith Creek. Streams in the most
populated part of the valley (generally adjacent to, and north of, I-10) have been largely confined
to open channels, culverts, and storm drains, although for most of their length, most of these
drainages remain in a natural, unmodified state.
Stream Flow and Flood Hazard
Stream flow in the planning area’s streams is negligible, except during and immediately after
rains, since climate and basin characteristics are not conducive to Ongoing flow. Therefore, the
San Gorgonio River is dry most of the year; small flows generally occur only a few times a year.
Other drainages in the City exhibit similar characteristics, and in particularly dry years may not
have any flows at all.
Flood hazards in the Banning area can be classified into three general categories. These are: flash
flooding through natural channels; ponding, with flows impeded by man-made obstructions; and
sheet flooding across the alluvial fans upon which most of the City’s development is currently
located.
Flash floods are of short duration; however, they have high peak volumes and high velocities.
Flash flooding takes place in response to the local geology and geography, and man-made
structures. Because the San Bernardino Mountains are very steep and fairly impervious to water,
little precipitation infiltrates the ground. Therefore, rainwater flows across the surface as runoff,
collecting in the major drainages that traverse the City. Water from major storms in the area
collects and runs off rapidly, descending the steep mountain slopes into natural and man-made
channels within the developed areas. These flood flows often carry large amounts of mud, sand,
rock fragments, and scoured vegetation due to the constant shedding of debris from the steep
mountain slopes (primarily as dry gravel and rock falls). Ponding can occur near the east-west
oriented embankments along I-10 that block or obstruct the south-flowing stream channels.
When the capacities of the existing man-made or natural channels are exceeded and water spills
over into the adjacent areas, sheet flow can occur.
During the severe winter storms of 1938 (the March 1938 flood is the maximum flood in the
historical record), 1965, 1966, and 1969, the Banning area sustained flood damage. Flows
recorded on the San Gorgonio River near the Banning levee during the floods of 1969 reached an
estimated peak discharge of 17,000 cubic feet per second (cfs). This significantly exceeded the
Riverside County Food Control District’s estimates for the 100-year flood, and caused extensive
damage and loss of life downstream in the Cabazon area. However, damage from the river within
the City’s corporate limits was limited by the Banning levee. In 1969 this was not the case for
Smith Creek and its tributaries. Parts of the City experienced heavy flood damage in January and
February of that year. For example, Highland Springs Avenue (all places) was washed out,
cutting off access to San Gorgonio Pass Hospital. The concrete lining in Pershing channel was
heavily damaged by erosion, and some storm drain inlets became clogged with debris.

                                                                                                  V-27

                                                                                             General Plan
Inundation From Above-Ground Storage Tanks
Strong ground shaking can cause structural damage to aboveground water storage tanks, which
can result in seismically induced inundation. If tanks are not adequately braced and baffled,
sloshing water can lift a water tank off its foundation. This may result in the tank’s shell
splitting, damage to the roof, and bulging the bottom. Movement can also shear off the pipes
leading to the tank, and water may be released through the broken pipes. During southern
California’s 1992 Landers, 1992 Big Bear, and 1994 Northridge earthquakes these types of
damage occurred. About 40 steel tanks were rendered non-functional during the Northridge
earthquake. In the Santa Clarita area, a tank failed and inundated several houses below. Lessons
learned from these earthquakes resulted in new standards for design of steel water tanks, which
were adopted in 1994. The new tank design includes flexible joints at the inlet/outlet connections
to accommodate movement in any direction.
There are 7 aboveground water storage reservoirs in Banning, all owned by the City. Together
they have a total storage capacity of 11.5 million gallons. With the exception of the Southwest
Reservoir, which is constructed with pre-stressed reinforced concrete, all reservoirs consist of
welded steel tanks. In 2000, three of the older reservoirs were seismically upgraded. Should the
tanks or their connections fail during an earthquake, inundation paths have not been prepared. A
determination should be made as to which reservoirs, if any, might pose an inundation hazard to
downstream properties.
In the event of an earthquake, water released by any of these tanks can significantly reduce the
water resources available to suppress earthquake-induced fires and limit the amount of water
available to residents. There are 20 operating production wells that currently serve the City.
Currently (2004) seven additional wells are not operational, and one is abandoned. These wells
may be subject to damage during an earthquake, especially a near-source earthquake on the any
of the active faults in the City. Therefore, it is vital that the water storage tanks in the area retain
their structural integrity during an earthquake in order to meet water demands after the
earthquake. This requires that the tanks be kept at or near full capacity at all times.
FLOOD CONTROL MEASURES
Regional Flood Control
The Riverside County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (RCFC) is responsible for
the management of regional drainage within and in the vicinity of Banning, including rivers,
major streams and their tributaries, and areas of significant sheet flows. The District is
empowered with broad management functions, including flood control planning and construction
of drainage improvements for regional flood control facilities, as well as watershed and
watercourse protection related to those facilities. To carry out their mandate, the RCFC also has
power of taxation, bonded indebtedness, land and water rights acquisition, and cooperative
partnerships with local, state, and federal agencies. The Riverside County Board of Supervisors
is the official decision-making body for RCFC.
                                                                                   Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                    V-28

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
Local Flood Control
While RCFC has the primary responsibility for managing regional drainage in and around the
community, they work in cooperation and coordination with the City. They play a key role in the
management of local drainage. The City, however, remains directly responsible for the
management of local drainage. The preservation of lands constrained by topography or drainage,
including steep slopes, areas rich in vegetation and cover, and alluvial plains and drainage
channels greatly reduces runoff and preserves the capacity of downstream facilities. The planned
integration of on-site stormwater detention facilities, where possible and appropriate,
significantly reduces the needed size of downstream facilities, while creating opportunities for
groundwater recharge, and enhanced open space and/or recreation areas.
It is important that hydrologic studies be conducted as new developments are considered. In
order to assess the impact that increased development may have on the existing development
downgradient, these studies should quantify the effects of increased runoff and alterations to
natural stream courses in the earliest stages of planning. The project proponent needs to prove
that any deficiencies that are identified can be mitigated to a satisfactory level prior to
proceeding forward with the project, in accordance with the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA) guidelines. Mitigation measures generally include flood control devices, such as
catch basins, storm drain pipelines, culverts, detention basins, desilting basins, velocity reducers,
and debris basins for protection from mud and debris flows.
RCFC sets forth the methodology for analysis and design of flood control structures. RCFC will
also have future responsibility for operation of regional flood control facilities. The local storm
drain network outside of the regional system will be with the City of Banning. Therefore, to
assure compatibility, both agencies must be involved in the planning and approval of mitigation
measures.
The effectiveness with which the City and RCFC manage drainage issues will have a direct
effect on the scale, complexity and cost of future flood control facilities. The cost-effectiveness
of prevention and on-site management should be actively integrated into community land use
planning and regulation, recognizing significant physical and financial constraints in many areas
of the City.
Banning Master Drainage Plan
The Banning Master Drainage Plan, published by the RCFC, includes many new structures for
future development. These include open channels, storm drains, box culverts, and debris basins..
Though not adopted by the County, the Master Drainage Plan is a working document used by
both the City and County to determine the need for facilities in the region.
The flood control structures in the City Limits include the Highland Springs Channel, the Smith
Creek Channel, the West and East Pershing Channels, the Montgomery Creek Channel, the
Gilman Home Channel, the Indian Canyon Channel, the Ramsey Street Storm Drain, the San
Gorgonio Avenue Storm Drain, the Banning Levee, and other numerous culverts beneath
Interstate-10.

Existing Flood Protection Measures
Existing flood control consists of pre-1938 rubble-lined channels constructed by the Works
Progress Administration (WPA), newer (1950s and later) facilities constructed by the RCFC, and
storm drains constructed as part of private developments. At the time FEMA (1978) published
their report, the WPA structures were considered substandard in design and inadequate to control
flooding in the City. Flood control facilities and improvements later constructed by the County
consist of open concrete channels and reinforced concrete box channels designed for 100-year
capacity, all designed at mitigating floodwater emanating from the hills to the north as it passes
through the developed portions of the City in the valley. With the exception of the San Gorgonio
River, runoff from the various channels ultimately reaches Smith Creek, along the southern edge
of the City. The following briefly summarizes components of the RCFC flood control network in
Banning, from west to east:
Highland Springs Channel
The Highland Springs Channel follows the alignment of Highland Springs Avenue, north of I-10,
just outside of the western boundary of the City. North of Wilson Street, to the base of the hills,
this primarily consists of a concrete trapezoidal channel 5 feet wide (at the base), which ranges
from 4.5 to 5.5 feet deep. This occurs on the western side, nearest the City of Beaumont. A
segment approximately 3,000 feet long consists of storm drain where it passes through Tract
14209-1 (again, on the western, or Beaumont side). South of Wilson Street, the channel consists
of an enclosed reinforced concrete box to I-10. At this point, flows are conveyed into an open
channel that parallels the north side of the freeway eastward for about 3,800 feet, where flows
pass under the freeway through a reinforced concrete box culvert and enter the natural tributary
channel of Smith Creek. There are two smaller tributary storm drains, one along Wilson Street,
and one along Ramsey Street, that connect to this system just west of the freeway box culvert.
Where the system crosses Highland Springs Road it is in the City of Banning.
Smith Creek Channel
Smith Creek is predominantly still in its natural state, although intermittent channel
modifications have been completed between Wilson Street and I-10. Modifications consist of a
storm drain through Tract 21882-1 (a 120-foot long segment of open trapezoidal channel 12-foot
wide by 12-feet deep) and box culverts below the freeway and the railroad tracks. These
modified segments are separated by short segments of unimproved channel. There are channel
modifications and a debris basin planned for the undeveloped portion of the Smith Creek alluvial
fan area north of Wilson Street. In the southern part of the City, future storm drains are planned
for Hargrave and Hathaway Streets, from which flows will exit into Smith Creek.
There are two small segments of the Smith Creek natural channel along the southern edge of the
City that have been somewhat modified for bank protection. However, they still consist of open
unlined channels. These segments are located south of the sewage treatment plant, between San
Gorgonio and Hargrave Streets.
                                                                               Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                V-30
                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
West Pershing Channel
West Pershing consists of a 5-foot wide by 5-foot deep trapezoidal channel, which follows the
alignment of Highland Home Road for about 1,500 north of Wilson Street, and will be extended
northward to the base of the hills in the future. At Wilson Street, a reinforced concrete box
culvert conveys flows. South of Wilson Street, the open channel continues southeastward to
Ramsey Street. In the future, this line will be extended by culverts beneath the freeway and the
railroad tracks. South of I-10, the Pershing Creek channel remains in a natural state.
East Pershing Channel
The East Pershing Channel extends southward from the Mountain Reservoir site to where it
merges with the West Pershing Channel just north of Ramsey Street. This improvement consists
of 72-inch reinforced concrete pipe and is under construction.
Montgomery Creek Channel
Montgomery Creek Channel extends from Sunset Avenue, near the base of the hills,
southeastward to Ramsey Street. It consists of an open concrete channel, either trapezoidal or
rectangular in shape, which varies from 5 to 6 feet deep and 3 to 10 feet wide. Several smaller
tributary storm drains occur in this reach. At the northern end of the channel, planned
improvements include a debris basis and a small tributary storm drain along Nicolet Street. At
Ramsey Street, flows enter a 10-foot wide by 6-foot high box culvert and exit into the natural
channel south of the railroad tracks. Montgomery Creek is in a natural state between this point
and its confluence with Smith Creek,
Gilman Home Channel
Gilman Home Channel extends from George Street southeastward to I-10. This portion consists
of open concrete channel and storm drain. At the I-10, it merges with the Indian Canyon
Channel. It continues southward as an open trapezoidal channel to Westward Avenue, where
flows enter an unlined channel that ultimately empties into Smith Creek. Along Ramsey,
Williams, and Nicolet Streets are smaller tributary storm drains. There are additional storm
drains planned for 8th and Gilman Streets in the future.
Gilman Home Channel splits into two branches north of George Street. East Gilman Home
consists of a trapezoidal concrete channel that extends northward to a debris basin at the base of
the hills. West Gilman Home Channel has also been improved, consisting of a concrete
trapezoidal channel.
Indian Canyon Channel
This channel was originally constructed by the WPA and has been replaced with a concrete
trapezoidal channel. It extends from the base of the hills, where a debris basin has been
constructed, and continues southeasterly to its intersection with the Line C-1, of the RCFC
Master Drainage Plan, at Wilson and Linda Vista Streets. The line continues as a storm drain
south of Wilson Street beneath Repplier Park and southward along 4th Street. Indian Canyon
Channel joins the Gilman Home Channel at I-10.
Line C-1 extends from the base of the hills, near San Gorgonio Avenue and Lombardy Street,
southward to Wilson Street where it joins the Indian Canyon Channel. The northernmost
                                                                               Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                 V-31
                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
segment consists of about 880 feet of reinforced concrete pipe, with a concrete trapezoidal
channel southward to Wilson Street. A small tributary storm drain is planned for the central part
of this line, which would extend to the base of the hills to the west.
Ramsey Street Storm Drain
The Ramsey Street Storm Drain, which extends from Wilson Street southeast to Ramsey Street,
continues eastward along Ramsey Street for about 3,500 feet to I-10. Flows passing from north
to south beneath I-10 through a box culvert exit into an unimproved channel that runs north of
the airport and ultimately joins the San Gorgonio River floodplain to the east. There are two
future tributary lines proposed for the Ramsey Street Storm Drain, one along Hargrave Street,
and one along Hathaway and George Streets, both north of I-10.
San Gorgonio Avenue Storm Drain
This storm drain is located along San Gorgonio Avenue, between the railroad tracks and Smith
Creek. The line consists of reinforced concrete pipe ranging in size from 33 to 42 inches.
Banning Levee
The Banning Levee was constructed along the south side of the San Gorgonio River, about 900
feet north of the intersection of Banning Canyon Road and Summit Drive. It consists of 700
lineal feet of rock and wire mesh.
Other Structures
There is a 600-foot long storm drain along Sunset Avenue, beneath I-10 and the railroad tracks.
Additionally, numerous other culverts exist beneath the freeway, most consisting of 18- to 30-
inch reinforced concrete pipe.
The existing flood control structures have provided significant protection from flooding. In fact,
in 1978 the Federal Emergency Management Agency reported that Montgomery Creek,
Pershing, and Sidney Street channels, as well as the San Gorgonio River levee, significantly
reduced the amount of flood damage suffered by the City during the severe winter storms of
1969. Nonetheless, current Flood Emergency Management Agency Flood Rate Maps indicate
that additional protection is needed, especially as more open space is developed.
Federal Emergency Management Agency and Federal Flood Rate Maps
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has mapped many of the areas of the
United States subject to flooding from 100-year storms. The resulting documents, FEMA Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), serve as the basis for determining the need for and availability of
federal flood insurance. Exhibit V-5, Flood Zones in the Study Area, illustrates a compilation of
the data presented in the corresponding FIRM Community Panels (maps).

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
Based on the FEMA maps for the City of Banning planning area, lands within the 100-year flood
plain are designated (Zone A) in major portions of the San Gorgonio River. These include
portions of the upper Smith Creek drainage and are comprised of washes, channels and areas
subject to sheet flow flooding. The San Gorgonio River flows southeasterly near of the eastern
boundary of the City. As shown on the FEMA maps, the 100-year flood zone for the San
Gorgonio River is generally confined to the area along the channel of the river and its tributaries.
However, the bedrock underlying the surrounding hills and mountains of the City has low
permeability. Therefore, heavy runoff from these areas during strong storms cannot be
prevented.
Each of the applicable flood zones is briefly described below.
Zone A & A1: Areas of 100-year flood for which no base flood elevations have been
determined.
Zone B: Areas between limits of 100-year and 500- year flood; or certain areas subject to 100-
year flooding with average depths less than 1 foot or where the contributing drainage area is less
than 1 square mile; or areas protected by levees from the base flood.
Zone C: Areas that have been determined to be outside the 100-year and 500-year floodplains.
Land Use Planning as a Flood Control Strategy
Land use planning can be one of the most effective and direct methods to control flooding and
limit threats to lives and property. Land use planning is consistent with other primary community
goals that call for the preservation of natural vegetation in the foothills and mountains. These
preserves can function as natural water sheds for local drainage and ground water recharge and
can have positive affects to the volume of Stormwater and debris that reach downstream
facilities.
Land use planning can also limit human exposure to the hazards of flooding, improvements to
storm hazards, and damage. Restrictions on the type and location of structures in the vicinity of
major drainages within the community can greatly reduce potential losses. Development should
be severely limited and regulated within the limits of improved and unimproved 100-year
floodplains. These limits should include prohibitions of the construction of structures for human
habitation.
Within flood zones subject to sheet flooding, development approvals should be conditioned to
assure protection of improvements from flood damage. Protection measures may include raising
the finished floor level above the flood depth projected for the surrounding area and providing
protection against scouring. Such measures are incorporated into RCFC Ordinance 458 as the
standard that applies to FEMA Zones A (see discussion of FEMA Zones, above). In the planning
area, this ordinance is particularly relevant to lands along the Smith Creek Channel and the San
Gorgonio River. Until such time as flood protection is provided and removes areas from severe
threats of flooding, development in these areas should be carefully regulated.
                                                                                Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                 V-34
                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
Flood Protection Measures for Property Owners
As previously discussed, structures and residents located on alluvial fans emanating from the San
Bernardino Mountains are subject to significant risk from flooding. Flood hazards are mainly
associated with Smith Creek and the San Gorgonio River, as well as, to a lesser extent, other
streams than traverse the area.
To reduce the impact of flooding, property owners in susceptible areas can make modifications
to their houses. There are several flood protection measures FEMA has identified that can be
implemented by property owners to reduce flood damage. These include: installing waterproof
veneers on the exterior walls of buildings; putting seals on all openings, including doors, to
prevent the entry of water; raising electrical components above the anticipated water level
improvements; and installing backflow valves that prevent sewage from backing up into the
house through the drainpipes. However, these changes vary in complexity and cost, and some
need to be carried out only by a professional licensed contractor. For additional information and
ideas, please refer to the FEMA web page at www.fema.gov. In the process of obtaining permits
from the City’s Building Department, which are required for structural modifications,
homeowners may also obtain guidance as to whether or not flood protection measures would be
appropriate for any given property or structure.
Other Flood Control Measures
The National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
The Clean Water Act of 1972 set goals to restore and maintain water quality by reducing "point
source pollution" such as pollutants from industry and sewage treatment facilities. In 1987,
amendments to the Act shifted focus to polluted runoff, requiring states to reduce discharges into
waterways. These amendments required the US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) to
formally regulate polluted runoff just as it regulates industry and sewage treatment plants - with
permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). The NPDES
program requires communities with populations exceeding 100,000 to apply for a municipal
permit. Municipal permits require cities and counties to eliminate or control "non-point source
pollution."
In most states, including California, the state administers the NPDES permitting program, rather
than the EPA. Nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards administer the program for
California. Portions of Riverside County fall under the jurisdiction of three of these Boards: the
Santa Ana, the San Diego, and the Colorado River Basin Regional Water Quality Control
Boards. Banning is under the jurisdiction of the Colorado Basin Regional Water Quality Board.
Recognizing that this regulation would affect them all, RCFC, the County of Riverside, the 23
Riverside County cities (excluding Blythe) and the Coachella Valley Water District joined forces
to apply for joint NPDES municipal permits, rather than separate ones. This has allowed the "co-
permittees" to share resources, eliminate duplicate efforts, and minimize program costs to the
public.

                                                                                                V-35

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
The program emphasizes pollution prevention, control measure activities, utilization of existing
resources and programs, and coordination with regional and state compliance activities. The
goals of these activities include the following:
•       Eliminate illicit connections and illegal discharges to the storm drain system;
•       Promote public awareness and participation through the Program's education program -
        The Storm Water/Clean Water Protection Program;
•       Identify and control stormwater pollution created by industrial and commercial activities;
•       Establish stormwater management programs for public agencies to reduce the amount of
        pollutants that enters and accumulate in storm drains;
•       Identify and establish local regulatory control measures for activities that can pollute the
        storm drain system, such as new development and construction, and residential,
        commercial and industrial activities;
•       Monitor wet and dry weather flows to identify the origin, types, and concentrations of
        non-point source pollutants;
•       Increase existing municipal efforts to clean streets, collect solid waste, and prevent used
        oil and other hazardous wastes from entering storm drains;
•       Develop local ordinances to establish legal authority for cities and counties to regulate
        stormwater discharges.
Flood Control, Wildlife Habitat and Recreation Enhancement
Controlling stormwater flows is consistent with the goals and policies set forth in the General
Plan, and should also be viewed as an opportunity for multiple uses, including recreation and
wildlife enhancement. Washes, detention/retention basins and channels should be designed with
this multi-use function in mind.
In addition to the opportunity to integrate hiking and equestrian trails into these facilities, these
areas are consistently frequented by numerous birds and small and large mammals, and can offer
meaningful areas for passive enjoyment. As a retreat from the more urban environments of the
area, they are important as a source of forage and cover, and offer opportunities for the continued
integration of the natural habitat into the built environment.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The Flooding and Hydrology Element is applied through the direct expression of policies and
implementation of programs of the Element, and through the implementation of other General
Plan Elements, including Water Resources, Open Space and Conservation, Land Use, and
Biological Resources Elements.
The principle and direct implementation of this Element, however, will be accomplished through
the enforcement and implementation of the Master Drainage Plan. The improvements associated
with Master Drainage Plan help control and confine the area-wide drainage pattern to more
discreet and focused routes where it can be better managed. It may also point to facilities that
complement land use patterns, provide cost-effective flood control alternatives, and maximize
opportunities for multiple uses, including enhanced groundwater recharge. The Master Drainage
Plan will also set critical parameters for future development along areas subject to area-wide
flooding. The Element will also be implemented through the development guidelines and
regulations of the Banning Zoning Ordinance, Grading Ordinance, and Subdivision Ordinance.

NOISE ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Noise Element is intended to coordinate the community’s land uses with the existing and
future noise environment. Further, this element provides for design measures that are intended to
minimize or avoid community exposure to excessive noise levels. The potential for land use
conflicts that can result in an unacceptable noise environment increase as the City grows. The
implementation of policies and programs set forth in this Element can greatly reduce or even
avoid current and future noise impacts and land use conflicts.
BACKGROUND
The Noise Element is directly related to the Land Use and Circulation Elements. Noise levels in
the community impact the quality of life, since perceptions of the community’s desirability may
be affected by noise levels. Therefore, this element is also related to the Economic Development
Element.
The noise environment can also have a significant influence on the health and comfort of the
community. Portions of the planning area enjoy a relatively quiet noise environment, with
existing community noise being dominated by local traffic, commercial heating/ventilation
equipment, and industrial/manufacturing sources. Portions of the planning area more impacted
by noise from motor vehicles and rail traffic, due to proximity with U.S. Interstate 10 and the
railroad, or by airport noise in the southeastern portion of the City.
Primary noise generators include traffic on Interstate-10, as well as major roadways within the
City, such as Ramsey Street, and portions of Wilson Street, Eighth Street, Hargrave Street, 22nd
Street, San Gorgonio Avenue, and Sunset Avenue. Freight rail service along the railroad lines,
which are located immediately south of and parallel to U.S. I-10 are also responsible for
generating substantial noise levels in this area. Other community noise generators include the
Interstate 10/railroad right of way, Banning Municipal Airport, as well as industrial operations,
construction activities, and special event noise. Commercial activities, such as live music, home
appliances, and gasoline powered lawnmowers and leaf blowers also constitute noise generators
in the planning area. Schools, libraries, a hospital, and senior care facilities are all sensitive
receptors that occur in the planning area.
The California Department of Health Services has prepared a Model Community Noise Control
Ordinance. Developed in accordance with Section 46026 of the Health and Safety Code, this
model assists local agencies in developing ordinances designed to control and abate noise. The
City of Banning has adopted such ordinances (Nos. 1138 and 1243). The Noise Element
addresses issues such as those set forth in California Government Code Section 65032(f), which
requires that the Noise Element identify and evaluate the community’s noise problems. Section
21083.1 of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) mandates adherence to the State
Guidelines. It empowers communities to determine whether a proposed project may have a
                                                                                Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                 V-40

                                                                                     City of Banning
                                                                                        General Plan
“significant effect on the environment.” Noise impacts may range from excessive traffic noise in
a residential neighborhood to industrial manufacturing noise impacting a hospital or
convalescent home. A community noise control ordinance is recommended by state guidelines
in order to resolve local noise complaints.
Community Noise Equivalent Level
Noise is defined as unwanted or undesired sound. The combination of noise from all sources
near and far is known as the Ambient Noise Level. Airborne sound results from a very sudden
change in air pressure from the immediate “normal” atmospheric pressure. For purposes of this
discussion, the ambient noise level at a given location is termed “environmental noise.”
To understand environmental noise, it is necessary to have some familiarity with the physical
description of noise. The primary physical characteristics of sound are its frequency range,
intensity/loudness and temporal/time-varying aspect. The decibel (db), A-weighted level (dBA)
and Community Noise Equivalency Level (CNEL) are all used to describe and numerically
weight noise. Each of these measurement scales are described briefly below.
Amplitude, or strength of sound, is described by a unit of measurement, the decibel. The A-
weighted decibel approximates the subjective response of the ear to a noise source by
discriminating against the very low and very high frequencies in the spectrum. The Community
Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) is the average of the intensity of a sound over a 24-hour period,
with corrections for time of day. The time of day corrections result in the addition of five
decibels to sound levels in the evening between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m., and the addition of ten
decibels to sound levels at night between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. These adjustments are necessary
because of the decrease in background noise levels during the evening and night hours, when
people are more sensitive to noise as compared with daytime hours. Sounds seem louder during
evening and night when ambient noise is lower. During evening and night hours, tolerable noise
levels should be 5 to 10 dBA lower, and the CNEL number is weighted accordingly.
Ranges and Consequences of Noise
Noise sources are classified as either “line source” (a busy street) or “point source” (a
commercial compressor). Factors that affect noise as it travels through the air include
temperature, wind speed and direction, hard and soft ground surfaces, and landscaping and walls.
When considering noise generated by a roadway, these factors are particularly important insofar
as they can mitigate or intensify the noise level.
The most common sounds range between 40 dB (very quiet) and 100 dB (very loud). Normal
conversation is roughly 60 dB at three feet, whereas a loud engine noise is about 100 dB. Most
everyday sounds occur in the range of 40 to 100 dB. Due to the logarithmic nature of the sound
measuring (decibel) scale, doubling the sound energy of a noise source only increases the decibel
rating by 3 dB. However, because of the internal mechanism of the human ear, a sound must be
nearly 10 dB higher than another sound to be considered twice as loud. Excessive noise can
affect physical health, psychological well-being, social cohesion, property values, and economic
productivity.
                                                                              Environmental Hazards
                                                                                               V-41

                                                                                              City of Banning
                                                                                                 General Plan
The effects of noise on people can be grouped into three general categories: subjective effects,
such as annoyance and nuisance; interference with activities such as conversation and sleep; and
physiological effects, ranging from a startle to hearing loss. With an increase in the difference
between background or ambient noise and the noise generated from a particularly intrusive
source such as traffic, a barking dog, aircraft or industrial operations, adverse reactions to noise
generally intensify. Noise control measures should reduce noise by 5 to 10 dBA in most
circumstances to effectively lower the perceived sound. Loud, short duration noises from
barking dogs and low-flying aircraft, for example, therefore generally have little impact upon the
CNEL levels of an area, because of the averaging techniques used to define CNEL.
Existing Banning Noise Environment
The primary noise source in the City of Banning is motor vehicle traffic. Portions of the
planning area also impacted by noise from U.S.-Interstate 10 and the railroad, which run east to
west through the planning area. Aircraft noise from the Banning Municipal Airport also
contributes to the noise environment to a lesser extent. Other noise sources include mechanical
equipment serving commercial and industrial lands.
In preparing this General Plan, a number of sites were monitored to characterize the noise
environment. The results of this monitoring are shown in the Table below.

Motor Vehicle Noise
Motor vehicle noise includes automobiles, trucks, buses, and motorcycles, and is the major noise
source measured (2004) within the City. Cars generate noise from engine vibration, the
interaction of tires and the roadway, and the exhaust system. Factors that impact noise levels
include traffic volumes, the percentage of trucks, and average speeds. Table V-3 lists existing
noise levels at several locations, while Table V-5, below illustrates the General Plan buildout
noise levels. The City has established truck routes within the City, which include Ramsey Street,
and portions of Hathaway Street, Sunset, 8th, San Gorgonio and Hargrave. As illustrated in the
Table, the noise levels along truck routes in the City are currently high.
The Table below illustrates the distance from centerline for current noise levels on City streets.

U.S. Interstate-10 and Railroad Lines
In addition to traffic along major arterial roadways impacting the City, rail and vehicular traffic
associated with the railroad and U.S. Interstate-10, respectively, impact the planning area. The
passage of trains occurs only periodically and with limited duration; nonetheless, rail traffic does
represent an intrusive noise source in the community. However, the influence of Interstate-10
traffic noise, which can increase at night due to persistent truck volumes can be more significant.
                                                                                Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                 V-45
                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
Currently (2004), local rail facilities carry approximately 60 trains per day, which average 7,000
feet in length and generally travel up to 60 miles per hour (mph) in the planning area. The noise
levels at a distance of 200 feet from the railroad tracks is estimated at 71.4 dBA CNEL, while the
noise level at a distance of 400 feet is estimated at 69.3 dBA CNEL when trains are passing.
These noise levels exceed the acceptable level of 65 dBA CNEL for sensitive receptors, such as
homes, schools and medical facilities. In addition to audible noise, train traffic also creates
vibration, which can also negatively impact surrounding development.
Several segments of U.S. Interstate 10 in the planning area average more than 100,000 vehicle
trips per day. Vehicle trips along U.S. Interstate 10 are projected to increase over the buildout
period. 2004 estimates place the distance to a 65 dBA CNEL along the Interstate 10 corridor at
between 1,758 and 1,885 feet without mitigation, depending on the location. Sensitive receptors
proposed near the freeway must therefore be carefully planned to ensure that noise levels are
mitigated.
Aircraft Noise
The Banning Municipal Airport, located south of U.S. Interstate 10 in the southeastern portion of
the City, averages approximately 10 to 15 takeoffs and landings daily, and about 12,000
operations per year. Air traffic is comprised primarily of private, single-engine fixed-wing
aircraft. The Banning Municipal Airport Master Plan (December 1990), shows typical takeoff
noise levels for such aircraft. Levels range from approximately 56 dBA to 68 dBA at 7,100 feet
from brake release.
Exhibit V-6 and V-7, respectively, show existing (2003) noise contours, and projected noise
contours for the Banning Municipal Airport. The current noise contours are generally contained
within the airport boundary, and extend to lands designated for airport and related industrial uses,
which are considered less sensitive.
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                  V-46


                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
The buildout noise contours extend considerably east and west of the airport, but the 65 dBA
CNEL contour remains in the area of the airport itself, and the surrounding industrial lands.
Lower noise levels, within the range of acceptable noise levels for sensitive receptors, occur
further east and west, over lands designated for industrial and residential development.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommends that schools not be located within
noise contours of 65 dBA CNEL and above. For schools within urban areas, the State of
California Noise Standards specify 65 dBA CNEL as the point of general acceptability. No
schools are located within or in proximity to the airport’s annual projected 65 dBA CNEL noise
contour.
Mechanical and Industrial Noise
In addition to noise generated by automobile traffic and aircraft, there are other generators in the
City that could create substantial noise-related dissonance. Construction activities, automotive
repair, and aggregate operations can result in unacceptable noise levels. Loading and materials
transfers and other acoustically unscreened operations also raise issues of impact and
compatibility.
Significant noise can also result from mechanical equipment operation, including refrigerator
units and heating/air conditioner equipment in commercial centers. Noise from roof-mounted
equipment can travel to bordering neighborhoods and impact sensitive receptors. Fans and
compressors emit a constant hum and can adversely affect the quality of life in a residential
neighborhood. The City should include design and location of this equipment in review of new
development projects, in order to mitigate this potential impact.
The Community Noise and Land Use Compatibility Model
For the City of Banning, the applicable limit one-hour average for outdoor noise levels in
residential areas is 55 dBA during daytime hours, and 45 dBA during evening and nighttime
hours (Ordinance 1138). The standard used for maximum outdoor noise levels in residential
areas in California and the City specifically is a CNEL of 65 dBA. These noise impacts are
characteristically “unmitigated” and represent the worst-case noise impact without any
obstruction of the noise. As discussed below, a variety of design and technical measures are
available to substantially reduce noise impacts. Land use compatibilities are directly related to
the user’s sensitivity to noise and the potential for impacts to be mitigated.
Sensitive noise receptors include residences, schools, libraries, churches, hospitals, nursing
homes, and destination resort areas. Golf courses, parks, and other outdoor activity areas can
also be sensitive to noise levels. Commercial and industrial uses, conventional hotels and
motels, neighborhood ballparks and playgrounds, and other outdoor spectator sport areas
comprise less sensitive land uses. Table V-4 shows the CNEL ranges of allowable exterior
ambient noise levels for various land uses at buildout.

Banning Noise Ordinance
The City has established noise standards by adopting amendments to its Municipal Code.
Chapter 11D of the Banning Ordinance Code establishes community-wide noise standards and
emphasizes the value of an acceptable noise environment. The City Council passed Ordinance
1138 in 1994, which provides regulations for noise measurement and monitoring and cites
special provisions of and exemptions to the ordinance. In addition to establishing criteria and
standards for the regulation of noise levels in the City, it is intended to implement the noise
provisions in the City’s General Plan. This Ordinance also provides definitions of key terms and
defines exterior noise level standards on a time-of-day basis, along with adjustments for intensity
and duration. In 1999, Ordinance No. 1234 was passed to further amend and augment the City’s
Ordinance code with regard to noise standards and regulations.
Violations of these Noise Ordinances are defined as a nuisance. The Ordinances establish
procedures, remedies and penalties to which violators are subject. The City’s Noise Ordinances
are intended to regulate excessive noise from existing uses and their activities. The noise
standards in the General Plan are intended to guide the location of future noise generators and
sensitive land uses.
Noise Measurements and Computer Modeling: Projected Future Noise Levels
Based on increases in traffic level on Interstate 10, and the land use map for this General Plan,
noise level estimates have been prepared, and are depicted in the Table below.

                                                                                            General Plan
Managing the Noise Environment
A variety of strategies are available for managing the City’s noise environment. To preserve a
quiet noise environment, thoughtful transportation and land planning, project design mitigation,
simple and sophisticated technical measures, and acoustical barriers should be applied to
community noise compatibility issues. Site planning and design standards should provide direct
noise impact mitigation for areas particularly impacted by noise. Applied mitigation measures
include the use of buffer zones consisting of earthen berms, walls and landscaping between
sensitive land uses and roadways, and other noise sources. Building orientation, particularly the
placement of windows, can significantly mitigate impacts on residential land uses. Incorporating
effective acoustical materials into building walls and windows can effectively reduce outdoor
noise. Development proposals planned adjacent to the roadways described in Table V-4 should
be required to complete a noise analysis; these analyses will include mitigation measures to
ensure that buildout of the project will not result in unacceptable noise levels.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Although the City of Banning has an essentially quiet noise environment, highway and major
roadway noise sources clearly impact the City. The Land Use Element and the assignment of
land use designations will play a critical role in the City’s ability to control noise for sensitive
receptors in the future. Zoning designations provide another level of land use control, as they
establish development standards that reduce impacts and enhance compatibility. Where possible,
the Circulation Element has also been designed to protect the City’s residential areas from
excessive traffic noise and assure appropriate noise levels. As the City’s population continues to
grow, coordination of these two elements of the General Plan must play a key role as the City
considers development projects, public works improvements and City-sponsored construction.

WILDLAND FIRE HAZARDS ELEMENT
PURPOSE
By providing discussion and setting forth its goals, policies, and programs, the Wildland Fire
Hazards Element of the Banning General Plan addresses potential wildland fire hazards within
the community. The foremost goal of this Element is to protect the general health, safety and
welfare of the community from potential fires and associated hazards. It references and
coordinates with other elements of the General Plan, which also address threats to the lives and
property.
BACKGROUND
Other General Plan Elements related to this Element include the Geotechnical Element, which
addresses some of the City’s most primary environmental threats. The Circulation Element,
which addresses the need for and availability of adequate access and evacuation routes in the
event of a major community disaster or threat, is another related Element. Policies and programs
set forth in the Land Use Element direct the location of open space, essential public facilities,
and developed areas which have some effect on wildfire issues, and their potential for damage.
State policies and regulations require that the General Plan address potential wildfire hazards
within a community and offer mitigation measures to lessen their impacts. Public Resources
Code section 4290 requires minimum statewide fire safety standards pertaining to: road
standards for fire equipment access; standards for signs identifying streets, roads, and buildings;
minimum private water supply reserves for emergency fire use; and fuel breaks and greenbelts.
With certain exceptions, all new construction after July 1, 1991 in potential wildland fire areas
has been required to meet the statewide standards. The State requirements, however, do not
supersede more restrictive local regulations.
Historic Context
Wildland fires are also called chaparral or brush fires, and are typically associated with the
indigenous vegetation in the mountain and foothill areas of southern California. This vegetation
has a very high oil content that creates severe fire danger. Wildland fires can also occur in
suburban and rural areas where developed lands are adjacent to uncultivated lands, undeveloped
lands, timber, range, watershed, brush or grasslands.
Prior to the arrival of European settlers, many areas of the United States experienced small but
frequent wildfires. These primarily impacted grasses and low-lying bushes, without severely
damaging the tree stands. Native Americans in California reportedly used fire to reduce the
density of vegetation (fuel load) and thus improve their ability to hunt and forage. It is estimated
that various tribes burned perhaps as much as 12 percent of the State every year. However, as
development began to encroach onto the foothills in the early 20th Century, wildfire suppression
was practiced. In the early 1920s, the Fire Service began campaigns to prevent wildfires from
                                                                               Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                V-58

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
occurring. Over time this suppression has led to increased fuel loads. Therefore, wildfires that
reach areas with fuel buildup can burn more intensity and result in significantly more damage
than historic fires of high frequency and low intensity.
Over time, fire suppression and increasing populations have led to:
•   Increased loss of life, property, and resources;
•   Increased difficulty in fire suppression, increased safety problems for firefighters, and
    reduced productivity by fire crews on perimeter lines;
•   Longer periods between recurring fires;
•   Increased volume of fuel per acre; and
•   Increased taxpayer costs and property losses.
Large areas of southern California are particularly susceptible to wildfire due to the region’s
weather, topography and native vegetation. The typically mild, wet winters result in an annual
growth of grasses and plants that dry out during the hot summer months. This dry vegetation
provides fuel for wildfires in the autumn when the area is intermittently impacted by Santa Ana
winds, hot, dry winds that blow across the region in the late fall and can help spread fires.
However, wildfires are a necessary part of the natural ecosystem of southern California. Many of
the native plants require periodic burning to germinate and recycle nutrients that enrich the soils.
The most common causes of wildfires are arson, improperly maintained campfires, smoking, and
improper use of incendiary devices. Multiple ignitions can develop under the right conditions
and as a result of the wind transport of burning cinders over distances of a mile or more. In those
areas where the wildland approaches or interfaces with the urban environment (referred to as the
urban-wildland interface area, or UWI area), wildfires can be particularly dangerous and
complex and pose a severe threat to public and firefighter safety. Wildfires can cause devastating
losses of life and property. Therefore, continuous planning, preparedness, and education are
required to reduce fire hazards, and to limit the potential destruction caused by fires.
Historical Wildland Fires in the Banning Area
As shown in Exhibit V-8, since the early 1900s, a large portion of the Banning area has burned,
often repeatedly, with many fires that have been recorded in this area burning thousands to tens
of thousands of acres. In areas where fire has been suppressed for more than 30 years, especially
in undeveloped areas, there is the greatest potential for future fires to burn uncontrollably. This is
due to the fact that there is likely to be a thick accumulation of fallen branches and dry litter on
the ground. Areas that have burned periodically therefore may have less destructive fires that
will burn with less intensity.
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                  V-59


                                                                                         City of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
Wildfire Susceptibility of the Banning Area
The fire hazard of an area is typically based on the combined input of several parameters. These
include: fuel loading, topography (slope), weather, dwelling density, and wildfire history.
Further, fire hazard is related to whether local mitigation measures are in place that help reduce
an area’s fire rating (such as an extensive network of fire hydrants, fire-rated construction, fuel
modification zones, etc.).
As the historical fire exhibit illustrates, there are large areas of the City susceptible to damage
from wildland fire. Portions of the Banning region and surrounding areas to the north, south and
east include grass and brush covered hillsides, which, along with significant topographic relief,
facilitate the rapid spread of fire, especially if fanned by Santa Ana winds.
Fire Hazard Assessment Systems
Several fire hazard assessment systems have been developed since the early 1970s for the
purpose of quantifying the severity of the hazard in a given area. Early systems based
characterization of the fire hazard of an area on a weighted factor that typically considered fuel,
weather and topography. More recently, systems have been developed that rely on the use of
Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to integrate the factors listed above to map
hazards, and to predict fire behavior and the impact on watersheds. Those that have been
developed in California are described further below.
State Responsibility Areas
Senate Bill 81, (Ayala, 1981) and Senate Bill 1916, (Ayala, 1982) became effective on July 1,
1986, and required the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) to develop
and implement a system to rank the fire hazards in California. The legislation applies to non-
federally owned lands which are covered in whole or in part by timber, brush, undergrowth or
grass, and over which the state has primary financial responsibility for fire protection and
suppression. Based primarily on fuel types, areas were rated as moderate, high or very high, and
were referred to as State Responsibility Areas (SRAs) (Public Resources Code Section 4125).
Exhibit V-9 illustrates the Fire Severity Zones in the Banning area that are State Responsibility
Areas.
Local Responsibility Areas
As a result of Assembly Bill 337 (September 29, 1992), the CDF, in cooperation with local fire
authorities was given the task of identifying Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones (VHFHSZs)
in Local Responsibility Areas (LRAs). The boundaries of a VHFHSZ are delineated, and the
CDF notifies the local fire authorities within that area. The State is not financially responsible for
LRAs, therefore, local jurisdictions have final say regarding whether or not an area should be
included in a VHFHSZ (Government Code Section 51178). The Local Responsibility Areas in
the Banning are shown on Exhibit V-9.
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                   V-61


                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
Fire Threat Zones
The California Fire Plan was established in 1996 and is a cooperative effort between the State
Board of Forestry and Fire Protection and the CDF. Using four main criteria, this system ranks
the fire hazard of the wildland areas of the State. The criteria are: fuels, weather, assets at risk,
and level of service (a measure of Fire Department’s success in initial-attack fire suppression).
Fire Threat Zones in the Banning area as mapped by the CDF are shown on Exhibit V-10.
History of fire frequency, fuel loads (vegetation), terrain, and assets at risk were used to develop
this map.
The planning area is broken into five fire threat zones: Extreme, Very High, High, Moderate, and
No Fuel. The Extreme Fire Hazard Zone primarily includes the undeveloped canyon and hillside
areas where native vegetation predominates (chaparral scrub and tree assemblages). The Very
High Fire Hazard Zone includes areas of moderate relief at the interface with the more developed
areas of the City. This zone is comprised of undeveloped or partially undeveloped areas where
grasses predominate. The High Fire Hazard Zone includes most of the developed central portion
of the City along the Interstate 10 freeway (I-10). In this zone, relief is minimal and hardscape
(concrete, asphalt and structures) and landscaping vegetation predominate. This zone also
includes most of the bed of the San Gorgonio River, where some vegetation is present
seasonally. The Moderate and No Fuel Fire Hazard Zones include those areas where there is
either no fuel for fires to burn, or no structures that can burn.
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                  V-63


                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
WILDLAND FIRE PROTECTION STRATEGIES
The northern and southern portions of Banning and adjacent areas are particularly susceptible to
wildfires because they are vegetated with high fire hazard plants such as tall grasses and
chaparral; include steep slopes and canyons. They are also subjected to strong seasonal Santa
Ana wind conditions that can transport embers up the canyons. Even if no special wind
conditions exist, fire department response can be hindered by heavy traffic during peak hours,
and by the long travel distances in the canyon and hillside areas of the City. Enhanced onsite
protection for structures and people in and near these wildfire-susceptible areas is therefore
necessary.
Vegetation Management
Based on experience and research, vegetation management is an effective means of reducing the
wildland fire hazard. Land development is governed by special State, county and local codes in
those areas identified as susceptible to wildland fire. In these areas, property owners are required
to follow maintenance guidelines aimed at reducing the amount and continuity of the fuel
(vegetation) available. By following strict vegetation management practices at the urban-
wildland interface (UWI), damage resulting from fire can be significantly reduced.
Following the 1993 wildland fires that impacted large areas of Orange, Los Angeles and Ventura
counties, requirements for vegetation management at the UWI in California were revisited. The
Urban-Wildland Interface Code was developed as a result of the 1993 Southern California
wildfires, with support from the Federal Emergency Management Agency Grant Program,
administered by the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services through the Office of
the State Fire Marshal. The first draft of this code was published in 1995, with revisions in 1997,
2000 and 2003.

Hazard Reduction and Fuel Modification
Communities most often use hazard reduction and fuel modification to reduce the amount of
combustible fuel available and thus reduce the amount of heat, associated flame lengths, and the
intensity of the fire that may threaten adjacent structures. These methods are intended to reduce
the hazard of wildfire by establishing a “defensible space” around buildings or structures in the
area. Defensible space, defined as a man-made or natural area where plant materials and natural
fuels have been treated, cleared, or modified to slow the rate and intensity of an advancing
wildfire, can also act as an area for firefighters to suppress fires and save the structures.
Residents are required to comply with fuel modification zone requirements in some communities
or developments proposed adjacent to a wildland area. A fuel modification zone is a ribbon of
land surrounding a development within a fire hazardous area that is designed to diminish the
intensity of a wildfire as it approaches the structures. Fuel modification includes both the
thinning of native combustible vegetation, as well as the removal and replacement of native
vegetation with fire-resistive plant species. The optimum width of a fuel modification zone is
generally 170 feet. Fuel modification zones may be owned by individual property owners or by a
homeowners’ association. Space near structures that provides natural landscape compatibility
with wildlife, water conservation and ecosystem health is emphasized. This approach provides
immediate benefits, including improved aesthetics, increased health of large remaining trees and
other valued plants, and enhanced wildlife habitat.

                                                                                                    V-66

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
Fuel modification zones can be divided into four areas, referred to as the A, B, C and D zones.
Each of these zones is described below.
        •  The A Zone is the defensible space where firefighters can set up hose lines to
           extinguish the approaching fire. The A Zone is the closest to the homes, and is the last
           20-feet of the backyard of the private residences. All plants in this area are required to
           be irrigated and must be fire-resistive.
        •  The B Zone represents the next 50 feet adjacent to the back fence line. This zone is
           an area where natural vegetation has been replaced with fire-resistive, drought-
           tolerant plants. The B zone should be fitted with automatic water sprinklers on a
           permanent basis. Non-approved vegetation must be removed from this zone.
        •  The C and D Zones include the next 100 feet from the B Zone. The C and D Zones
           are each a minimum of 50 feet in width. These zones are called the thinning zones.
           Natural vegetation is reduced by 50 percent in the C zone, and by 30 percent in the D
           zone. Conceptually, in 50 percent thinning zone (C zone) two people can walk side by
           side around clusters of vegetation. In a 30 percent thinning zone (D Zone), two people
           would have to walk single file between clusters of natural vegetation. These areas are
           not irrigated.
The guidelines for vegetation management in defensible areas are designed to be a fire
prevention partnership between property owners and the City and County in order to prevent
disastrous fires. They are further designed to minimize fire danger by controlling density and
placement of flammable vegetation. The local Fire Marshal may determine that conditions in
some high fire hazard areas warrant greater fire protection measures than those provided by
minimum standards. Further, higher standards may be warranted during certain times of the year
when there is an increased risk of wildfires.

Notification and Abatement
As set forth in City and County Codes, property owners are required to mitigate the fire hazard in
their property by implementing vegetation management practices such as those discussed above.
If uncontrolled or high weeds, brush, plant material, or other prohibited items are present on a
property, the authority that has jurisdiction (Code Enforcement and Fire Marshal) has the
authority to serve notice to the property owner of record to abate the hazard within a specified
time period. If the owner does not comply, the City may take further action to reduce the fire
hazard, including the following:
         •  The City or its contractor may enter the parcel of land and remove or otherwise
            eliminate or abate the hazard;
         •  Upon completion of the work, the City can bill the property owner for the cost of the
            work plus any administrative costs, or the cost can become a special assessment
            against that parcel; and
         •  Upon City Council confirmation of the assessment and recordation of that order, a
            lien may be attached to the parcel, to be collected on the next regular property tax bill
            levied against the parcel.
The applicable authority (Code Enforcement and Fire Marshal) must notify the property owner
by certified mail, of the intention to abate the fire hazard. Typically, notices must be mailed at
least 15 days prior to the date of the proposed abatement. The property owner may appeal the
decision of the City Code Enforcement requiring the maintenance of an effective firebreak by
sending a written appeal to the City (Planning Department Code Enforcement) within 10 days of
the notice. For additional information regarding the Notification and Abatement procedures,
refer to the City’s Municipal Code.
Prescribed Fire
A prescribed fire is a fire that is deliberately set under carefully controlled and monitored
conditions in order to remove brush and other undergrowth. Prescribed fire is used to modify,
maintain or restore vegetative communities, and to achieve desired resource conditions. Further,
it is used to protect life and property that would be degraded by wildland fire. Prescribed fire is
only accomplished through managed ignition. It should be supported by the appropriate
documentation and environmental analyses.
Prescribed fire has been the primary means of fuel management in Federal and State-owned
lands since 1981. An average of 30,000 acres a year, or approximately 500,000 acres total, have
been treated with prescribed fire under the vegetation management program throughout the State.
In the past, the typical vegetation management project targeted large wildland areas, however,
development at the urban-wildland interface often precludes the use of large prescribed fires.
Prescribed fire is not presently being used in the City of Banning to mitigate the wildland fire
hazard.
The wildfire susceptibility of an area changes throughout the year, and from one year to the next,
in response to local variations in precipitation, temperature, vegetation growth, and other
                                                                                Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                 V-68

                                                                                         City of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
conditions. The fire season in Riverside County typically begins in mid April and lasts until the
first rains. Site-specific vegetation maps available from the US Geological Survey (USGS)
assess the regional and local condition of vegetation throughout the year, including growing
season profiles and water content of vegetation. Fire departments and land managers can use
these maps to establish regional prevention priorities that can help reduce the risk of wildland
fire ignition and spread. They can also help improve the allocation of suppression forces and
resources, which can lead to faster control of fires in areas of high concern. Further, these maps
can be used for scheduling of prescribed burns and study of long-term vegetation changes
resulting from human or natural factors
Building to Reduce the Fire Hazard
Structural Fires
The density of construction can be an important issue in the spread of fires. Residences that are
close to each other can hinder emergency access to the back of residences. A3-foot wide area
should be maintained cleared at all times between buildings so as to allow firefighters and
emergency response personnel to access the back of the structures. Therefore, window
projections and other additions, or storage of household items (such as trash bins, bicycles, etc.)
in these areas should be discouraged or prohibited. Efforts to evacuate an area during a fire or
other disaster may be hindered by narrow city streets. These can also make it difficult to
maneuver and position response vehicles so as to be most effective in fighting a fire.
Construction Materials
Building construction standards for such items as roof coverings, fire doors, and fire resistant
materials help protect structures from external fires and contain internal fires for longer periods.
Due to the deposition of burning cinders or brands, the roof is the portion of a structure most
susceptible to ignition from a wildland fire.. Burning brands are often deposited far in advance of
the actual fire by winds, and roofs can also be ignited by direct contact with burning trees and
large shrubs. The City of Banning has established standards for roofing and construction
materials, with specialized requirements within Very High Fire Hazard Severity areas. The City
requires that roofing materials be (at a minimum) effective against moderate fire exposures
(Class B roof). New construction and reconstruction in Very High Fire Hazard Security Areas
are required to have, as a minimum, roof coverings that are effective against severe fire
exposures per Section 6.6 of Appendix II-A-2 of the 2001 California Fire Code (Class A roof).
Another concern regarding the fire survivability of a structure attic ventilation openings, which
are typically provided by openings to the outside of the structure. However, these opening can
also provide pathways for burning brands and flames to be deposited within the attic. Therefore,
it is important that all ventilation openings be properly screened. The use of non-combustible
exterior siding materials and to site trees and shrubs far enough away from the walls of the house
to prevent flame travel into the attic even if adjacent trees or shrubs catch fire can also reduce the
potential for ignition of attic spaces. The type of windows used in a structure can also help
reduce the potential for fire to impact a structure.
                                                                                  Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                   V-69
                                                                                         City of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
Model Ordinances and Fire Codes
An area’s infrastructure, including adequacy of nearby water supplies, transport routes and
access for fire equipment, addresses, and street signs, as well as maintenance, must also be
considerations for effective fire suppression. The City of Banning has adopted the 2001
California Fire Code with City amendments. Provisions within the Fire Code include
constructions standards in new structures and remodels, road widths and configurations designed
to accommodate the passage of fire trucks and engines, and requirements for minimum fire flow
rates for water mains. Construction requirements are a function of building size, type, material,
purpose, location, proximity to other structures, and the type of fire suppression systems
installed. Some of the more significant fire codes that help reduce the hazard of structural fire
pertain to the installation of fire sprinklers, which can help contain a fire that starts inside a
structure from spreading to other nearby structures. Sprinkler systems can also help prevent total
destruction of a building. For building construction standards in the City of Banning please refer
to the City’s Municipal Code.
Real-Estate Disclosure Requirements
As required in California state law, fire hazard areas must be disclosed in real estate transactions.
This means that real-estate sellers are required to inform prospective buyers whether or not a
property is located within a wildland area that could contain substantial fire risks and hazards
[Assembly Bill 6; Civil Code Section 1103(c)(6)]. These disclosure requirements are particularly
important because in California the average period of ownership for residences is typically five
years. Uninformed homeowners may attempt landscaping or structural modifications that could
be a detriment to the fire-resistant qualities of the structure, with negative consequences.
Fire Safety Education
There are other actions homeowners can take to significantly reduce the risk of fire throughout
the City, in addition to the specific code requirements and guidelines mentioned above regarding
defensible space, appropriate landscaping and construction materials. These actions may include
the following:
        •   Become familiar with local regulations regarding vegetation clearings, disposal of
            debris, and fire safety requirements for equipment.
        •   When building, selecting or maintaining a home, consider the slope of the terrain. Be
            sure to build on the most level portion of the lot, since fire spreads rapidly on slopes,
            even minor ones.
        •   Avoid construction on ridges and cliffs. Keep a single-story structure at least 30 feet
            away from edges; increase distance if structure exceeds one story.
        •   Use construction materials that are fire-resistant or non-combustible whenever
            possible.
        •   Driveways should provide easy access for fire engines. The driveway and access
            roads should be well maintained, clearly marked, and include ample turnaround space
            near the house.
        •   Provide at least two ground level doors for safety exits and at least two means of
            escape (doors or windows) – in each room.
                                                                                  Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                   V-70

                                                                                         City of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
        •   Install automatic seismic shut-off valves for the main gas line to your house.
            Information for approved devices, as well as installation procedures, is available from
            the Southern California Gas Company.
        •   Use of signs during high and extreme fire conditions along the freeways and major
            roads that cut through the City and adjacent areas can also help reduce the fire hazard
            by alerting and educating motorists about the potential fire hazard in the area.
Peakload Water Supplies
Emergency water storage is critical, especially when battling large wildland fires. Problems can
occur when water reservoirs are located at lower elevations because the water cannot be supplied
to the higher elevations as fast as the fire engines can pump from it. Leaks and breaks in the
water distribution system, including leaking irrigation lines and open valves in destroyed homes
also reduced the amount of water available to the fire fighters. A seven-day emergency storage
supply is recommended, especially in areas likely to be impacted by fires after earthquakes. As
discussed in the Geotechnical/Seismic Hazards Element, earthquakes can damage water
distribution systems through ground failure due to fault rupture, liquefaction, or landslides.
Maintaining fire flow is critical in fighting fires. Fire flow is the flow rate of water supply
(measured in gallons per minute – gpm) available for fire fighting measured at 20 pounds per
square inch (psi) residual pressure. Available fire flow is the total water flow available at the fire
hydrants, also measured in gallons per minute. As of the writing of this report, Banning had
adopted the section of the 2001 California Fire Code that lists the minimum required fire-flow
and flow duration for buildings of different floor areas and construction types. For additional
information regarding the required fire-flow for your building, contact the Fire Department.
Local water districts are required to test their fire protection capability for the various land uses
per the flow requirements of the 2001 California Fire Code.
POST-FIRE EFFECTS
Fires usually last only a few hours or days, but their effects can last much longer, especially in
the case of intense fires that develop in areas where large amounts of dry, combustible vegetation
have been allowed to accumulate. If wildland fires are followed by a period of intense rainfall,
flood control facilities may be severely taxed by the increased flow from the denuded hillsides
and the resulting debris that washes down. If the flood control structures are overwhelmed,
widespread damage can ensue in areas down gradient from these failed structures. However, if
remedial measures are taken after a wildland fire in anticipation of the next rainy season impacts
can be reduced. As shown in the photo below, sandbags, plastic covers and other measures can
be implemented in order to increase slope stability following a fire.
                                                                                  Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                   V-71

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
                                    Denuded Slopes Due To Fire
There may also be economical and social effects of wildfires. Loss of homes due to wildfires
may affect homeowners financially and emotionally for years thereafter. Recreational areas that
have been affected may be forced to close or operate at a reduced scale. Local property tax
revenues may be reduced, since the buildings that are destroyed by fire are usually eligible for
re-assessment.
The impact of wildland fire on plant communities is generally beneficial. However, it often takes
time for plant communities to re-establish. While grasslands will re-sprout the following spring,
chaparral plant communities take three to five years. Oak woodland requires at least five to ten
years for a new crop to start if most of the seedlings and saplings are destroyed by fire.
FIRE SUPPRESSION RESPONSIBILITIES
The City contracts with the Riverside County Fire Department for fire services. In turn, the
County contracts with the California Department of Forestry. This agreement has been in place
since 1998. The City’s Fire Marshal is authorized and directed to enforce the provisions of the
Fire Code throughout the City. As part of these responsibilities, the Fire Marshal reviews plans
for new construction and additions, coordinates with the City for disaster preparedness programs,
and manages the weed abatement program described above. The Fire Marshall also manages
inspections and the Hazardous Materials Business program.
The County’s fire stations may include a mix of state, county, contract city, and volunteer staffed
equipment. All stations dispatched by the same County Fire 9-1-1 Center and are part of the
"Integrated fire protection system," under contract with the State. The Riverside County Fire
Department monitors the fire hazard in the City constantly. The Fire Department has ongoing
programs for investigation and alleviation of hazardous situations. In the Banning Area, fire
fighting resources include Fire Station Nos. 89 and 20. Fire Station No. 89 is located at 172
                                                                                Environmental Hazards

                                                                                          General Plan
North Murray in Banning, and Fire Station No. 20 is located at 1550 E. 6th Street, in Beaumont,
to the west of Banning. If additional resources are needed due to the intensity or size of the fire, a
second alarm may be requested. Additional fire units are requested via automatic or mutual aid
agreements.
Automatic and Mutual Aid Agreements
The Riverside County Fire Department operates under a Regional Fire Protection Program.
Automatic aid agreements obligate the nearest fire company to respond to a fire regardless of the
jurisdiction. Numerous other agencies are available to assist the City if needed. These include
local law enforcement agencies that can provide support during evacuations due to wildfire.
Several State and Federal agencies have roles in fire hazard mitigation, response, and recovery,
including: the Office of Emergency Services, the Fish and Wildlife Service, US Forest Service,
National Weather Service, and, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior.
Private companies and individuals may also assist. The California Master Mutual Aid Agreement
is the overall agreement negotiated and signed by all participating agencies to provide
emergency resources.
Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS)
The Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS law) is described by the Petris Bill
(Senate Bill 1841; California Government Code Section 8607, made effective January 1, 1993).
The SEMS law is intended to improve the coordination of State and local emergency response in
California, and requires all jurisdictions within the State of California to participate in the
establishment of a standardized statewide emergency management system.
Emergency response in every jurisdiction in the State of California is handled in accordance with
SEMS. Individual City agencies and personnel take on their responsibilities as defined by the
City’s Emergency Plan. The City’s Emergency Plan describes the different levels of
emergencies, the local emergency management organization, and the specific responsibilities of
each participating agency, government office, and City staff.
Insurance Services Office Rating for the City of Banning
The Insurance Services Office (ISO) provides rating and statistical information for the insurance
industry in the United States. The ISO does this by evaluating a community’s fire protection
needs and services, and assigns each community evaluated a Public Protection Classification
(PPC) rating. The PPC rating, which is developed as a cumulative point system, is based on the
community’s fire-suppression delivery system, including fire dispatch (operators, alarm dispatch
circuits, telephone lines available), fire department (equipment available, personnel, training,
distribution of companies, etc.), and water supply (adequacy, condition, number and installation
of fire hydrants). Insurance rates are based upon this rating, which ranges from Class 1 (best) to
Class 10 (worst). Banning currently has a Class 4 ISO rating.
                                                                                Environmental Hazards

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
With substantial challenges posed by local wildfire conditions, the City will need to rely upon
the regulations and guidelines set forth in the Urban-Wildland Interface Code, zoning ordinance,
and other applicable legislation to adequately mitigate hazards addressed in this Element. The
City will benefit from close coordination with state, regional, and county agencies in establishing
and maintaining an up-to-date information database of wildfire hazard conditions in the region.
Furthermore, the City’s development review process must assure that development proposals are
thoroughly evaluated with regard to fire safety and the urban wildland interface, that all
necessary special studies are conducted and reviewed, and that comprehensive mitigation
measures are implemented.
As more development occurs in the City planning area, and the demand for developable lands
increases, the threat of wildfire will continue to impact the Banning community. Mitigation of
this hazard will require a regional approach to fuel reduction and fire wise education. The City is
responsible for actively participating in these efforts to assure that hazards associated with
wildfire are minimized.
State Government Code 54119 mandates that the State Fire Marshal, in consultation with the
Director of Forestry and Fire Protection and the Director of Housing and Community
Development, shall, pursuant to Section 18930 of the Health and Safety Code, recommend
building standards that provide for comprehensive space and structure defensibility to protect
structures from fires spreading from adjacent structures or vegetation and vegetation from fires
spreading from adjacent structures. These building and fire codes are scheduled for public review
January 2006. Once these codes are adopted by the state they will subsequently be adopted by
the City.

HAZARDOUS & TOXIC MATERIALS ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Hazardous and Toxic Materials Element is to present methods of safe
management for hazardous and toxic materials in the community. This Element highlights the
City’s concern for the protection of residents and visitors from harmful impacts associated with
hazardous and toxic materials that may pose a threat to life and property, and may call for costly
public improvements. Reduction or elimination of these hazards can be accomplished through
the City’s continued establishment of policies and programs that identify hazard areas and
reviews and regulates development where such hazards occur, assuring effective and safe use,
storage, and transport of hazardous and toxic substances in the City of Banning.
BACKGROUND
New technologies and chemical processes, often developing at a rapid pace, can result in the
introduction of new and potentially hazardous materials into the environment. Accidental spills,
illegal dumping, and other uncontrolled discharges of these materials can pose a significant
threat to the community and its environment.
General Plan Elements that directly relate to the Hazardous Materials Element include Air
Quality and Water Resources Elements, whose efforts are to preserve clean air and protect
against water resource contamination, as well as the Land Use Element, with the potential of
hazardous material use, storage, or disposal undermining land use compatibility. Improper
management of these materials may also negatively impact the Biological Resources Element. In
addition, the Emergency Preparedness Element plays an important role in establishing policies
and programs to protect the general public from adverse impacts associated with toxic and
hazardous materials.
California Government Code Section 65302(g) mandates that the General Plan of a community
address safety issues, including but not limited to hazardous materials. Responsibility for
regulating and monitoring the management, disposal, labeling, and use of toxic and hazardous
materials lies with a variety of federal, state, and local agencies, including the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, the California Office of Health Planning and Development,
and the Riverside County Department of Health. AB 2948 (Chapter 1504, Statutes of 1986),
commonly known as the Tanner Bill, authorizes counties to prepare Hazardous Waste
Management Plans (HWMP) in response to the need for safe management of hazardous
materials and waste products.
                                                                              Environmental Hazards
                                                                                               V-78

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB), as well as the City, Banning
Heights Mutual Water Company, and High Valley Water District maintain information
concerning contaminated water wells and groundwater. The state and federal Environmental
Protection Agencies (EPA) and the State Department of Health also provide information
concerning specific hazardous waste sites.
Hazardous and Toxic Materials
A search of the US EPA Envirofacts Data Warehouse for the City of Banning identified two
facilities that produce and release air pollutants, two facilities that have reported toxic releases,
31 facilities that have reported hazardous waste activities, and one facility that is permitted to
discharge to waters of the United States.1
The EPA database identifies three large industrial/commercial users of hazardous materials in the
City of Banning, which include electronic switchboard/connector manufacturing, metal plating,
and a gas station with a convenience store. Twenty-three small quantity hazardous/toxic material
generators are located in the City, and these are associated with commercial, and quasi-industrial
and medical operations, which have the potential to be associated with accidental spills,
purposeful illegal dumping, air emission, and other uncontrolled discharges into the
environment. In addition, two hazardous materials transporters are located in the City.
Improper use and management of these materials by service stations, petroleum product and
equipment suppliers, pesticide vendors and users, automotive dealers, medical practitioners,
hospitals and clinics pose a significant potential threat to the community and its environment.
A wide variety of chemical and purified chemical compounds, products, and elements that are
considered hazardous or toxic are used in households, commercial businesses and industrial
operations and processes. These chemicals can include chlorine products, chemical fertilizers,
herbicides and pesticides, stored fuels and waste oil, chemical solvents and lubricants, and a
variety of medical materials. All are considered “small quantity generators”.
There are a limited number of potentially hazardous waste sites in the City, and these are
generally restricted to the previously mentioned and regulated “small quantity generators”. In
addition to those mentioned above, there are other sites that have been or should be monitored.
These include waste-generating medical clinics and facilities, gasoline service stations,
equipment and fuel storage yards, and waste haulers.
Underground storage tanks, such as those typically located at service stations and the City
Maintenance Yard, and at the airport, pose the most significant hazards due to potential leakage.
The U.S. EPA requires all service stations to retrofit or replace underground storage tanks with
double-walled construction. Several sites in the City have already complied with this rule.
In the southern portion of the City, various industrial activities also have the potential for
uncontrolled discharge of hazardous materials.

                                                                                         General Plan
Natural Gas and Fuel Lines
The Gas Company provides natural gas services and facilities to the City of Banning. Natural gas
supply to the City originates from Texas, transported by two major east-west trending gas lines.
These high pressure gas lines, of varying sizes up to 36 inches in diameter, traverse through the
eastern desert areas to the western end of Riverside County. In addition to the two major east-
west trending high-pressure transmission gas lines, other natural gas high pressure lines are
located underground in Wilson and Lincoln Streets. A pipeline designed to carry liquid fuels
runs east-west through the City. Though not currently in use, this pipeline has been used to
transport crude oil, diesel fuel and gasoline. These lines are illustrated in Exhibit V-11, Major
Natural Gas and Fuel Lines in the Study Area
                                                                               Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                V-80

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
The primary danger from these pipelines is fire resulting from accidental leaks or spillage. As
part of the right-of-way and maintenance easements for these lines, the appropriate identification
and setbacks should be maintained in order to insure the safety of adjacent development. Any
construction activities in proximity to these lines should be appropriately restricted.
Responsible Agencies
There are several sources of information concerning hazardous waste sites in the City of Banning
area.
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB) the City, Banning Heights
Mutual Water Company and the High Valley Water District maintain information concerning
contaminated wells and groundwater. The state and federal Environmental Protection Agencies
(EPA) and the State Department of Health also supply information concerning specific
hazardous waste sites and their locations. The California Department of Industrial Relations, Cal-
OSHA Division, regulates the proper use of hazardous materials in industrial settings. Private
database screening and documentation services are also available, which will search, extract, and
summarize reports on contaminated sites recorded in various state and federal databases.
Hazardous Waste Management Planning
The City of Banning has the opportunity to coordinate with appropriate county, state and federal
agencies in the identification of hazardous material sites, and the active regulation of their timely
cleanup. Management strategies may include establishing and maintaining information on these
sites, and periodic monitoring of facilities and operations that produce, utilize or store hazardous
materials in the city. Involvement in multi-agency monitoring of illegal dumping in the City,
conferring in the regulation of underground storage tanks and septic systems, and regulating the
transport of hazardous materials through the community is also appropriate.
AB 2948 (Chapter 1504, Statures of 1986), commonly known as the Tanner Bill, authorizes
counties to prepare Hazardous Waste Management Plans (HWMP) in response to the need for
safe management of hazardous materials and waste products. The Riverside County HWMP was
adopted by the Board of Supervisors and approved by the California Department of Health
Services in 1990. The County HWMP identifies the types and amounts of wastes generated in
the County and establishes programs for managing these wastes.
To comply with Health and Safety Code Section 25135, the Riverside County HWMP assures
that adequate treatment and disposal capacity is available to manage the hazardous wastes
generated within the jurisdiction, and addresses issues related to manufacture and use of
hazardous waste. This plan was developed jointly by the County, Banning and other cities within
the County, the State, the industry and widespread public participation in order to address the
disposal, handling, processing, storage and treatment of local hazardous materials and waste
products.
HWMP policies require the coordination of County efforts with state and federal agencies in the
identification and establishment of programs for managing these wastes. As an integral part of
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards
                                                                                                  V-82
                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
the County HWMP, the City of Banning hazardous waste management policies for the General
Plan are basically extensions of the County Plan and are hereby incorporated by reference.
Hazardous Materials Response
The City of Banning has a Hazardous Response Area Plan that was developed as part of its
requirements as a participating agency in the statewide Certified Uniform Program
Administration. The agency responsible for insuring that the Hazardous Response Plan addresses
hazardous and toxic materials is the County of Riverside Health Hazardous Materials Division
and/or the Regional Water Quality Control Board.
When the City dispatcher receives a hazardous materials related call, a local engine will respond
in conjunction with the Riverside County Hazardous Materials Team. Currently, the local fire
stations have responsibility as the First Response Team, and, depending on the location of the
call, either Banning’s Fire Station No. 89 (located at 172 North Murray) or Fire Station No. 20
(located at 1550 E. 6th Street in Beaumont) will respond. Future fire stations will respond to their
service areas. The County Hazardous Materials Team includes Riverside County Fire
Department personnel and a member of the County Health Department. The County Hazardous
Materials Team is located at the Riverside County Fire Department headquarters in Perris.
Under the Hazardous Response Area Plan, during emergency circumstances where hazardous
and toxic materials are determined unsafe by the County Department of Health, the City can
require property owners to test, temporarily close and/or remove all hazardous liquids, solids or
sludge located on the site. Leaking underground storage tanks must be removed by contractors
having Hazardous Waste Certification and a General Engineering license. Between termination
of storage and actual closure of a site, monitoring is generally required by the site’s operating
permit.
When soil contamination is detected, the clean up procedure to be followed, the degree or level
of cleanliness required by the regulator, and the method of treatment (if permitted) will be
directed by the County Health Hazardous Materials Division and/or the Regional Water Quality
Control Board. The City of Banning has the opportunity to coordinate with appropriate county,
state, and federal agencies in the identification of hazardous material sites, and the active
regulation of their timely cleanup.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
It is the City’s responsibility to coordinate with the appropriate agencies in the identification and
regulation of sites where hazardous materials are stored within the City. In response to incidents,
it is also the City’s responsibility to work with other agencies to identify contaminated sites as
they occur and actively regulate their timely cleanup. The Hazardous and Toxic Materials
Element can most efficiently be implemented through regular consultation with the Regional
Water Quality Control Board and the County Health Department, by updating information on
hazardous material sites, and by monitoring facilities that utilize or produce hazardous materials
within the City. The City should also remain current regarding the monitoring and regulating of
underground storage tanks and septic systems, and monitoring the transport of hazardous
materials through the community.
                                                                                 Environmental Hazards

Oversight and management between responsible agencies through a carefully coordinated
program will be essential. Regular consultation and coordination between the City Emergency
Preparedness Director and responsible county and state agencies is also appropriate. Processes
for determining appropriate levels of local, County and State personnel and facilities will also be
critical. The goals, policies and programs of this element help to guide the planning and
development of appropriate strategies to address hazardous and toxic materials in the
community.

WATER, WASTEWATER, AND UTILITIES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Water, Wastewater and Utilities Element establishes City policies and programs directed at
the adequate provision of domestic water, sewage treatment, and utility services to the entire
community. The orderly growth and development of the community is dependent upon the
provision of these services. The Element describes domestic water, sanitary sewer, natural gas,
electricity and solid waste services provided in the community. Other utilities, such as telephone
and cable services are also discussed.
BACKGROUND
The Water, Wastewater and Utilities Element is interrelated to the Land Use Element. All urban
development must be planned according to, and in conjunction with, the availability and
extension of essential utility infrastructure. This Element is also directly related to the Water
Resources, Energy and Mineral Resources, and Economic Development elements.
The California Government Code Section 65302(d) states that a General Plan must address the
conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources, including water. The
management of other natural resources, such as natural gas and electricity, must also be
addressed. This element, in part, satisfies, the requirement for a Conservation Element, and
addresses other utilities outlined in Section 65303. According to California Government Code
Section 65103(c), the City is required to review its capital improvement program annually to
assure consistency with the General Plan. The City must also comply with the requirements of
the state Water Code. This Element serves as an effective and meaningful framework from
which to comply with the state law.
DOMESTIC WATER
The various storage units of the San Gorgonio Pass groundwater basin serve as the main water
source for the City of Banning. Runoff stored in a series of retention basins recharge the
underlying basins. The hydrological and geophysical characteristics of the San Gorgonio
subbasins are addressed in greater detail in the Water Resources Element of the General Plan.
The City of Banning Public Works and Utilities Department provides domestic water services to
the City of Banning. The City also provides domestic water services to unincorporated Riverside
County lands located southwesterly of the City limits. The City owns and operates wells,
reservoirs, and a distribution line system to deliver domestic water within their service area. The
distribution line system serving the City consists of water lines ranging from 2” to 30” in
diameter. Mapping of the existing water system for the City is included in the City of Banning
Water Master Plan (prepared by NBS/Lowry, March 1994). According to the existing water
maps, eight, twelve and fourteen-inch water mains are located within the San Gorgonio Avenue
                                                                          Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                  VI-1

                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
right-of-way; eight and twelve-inch water mains are within the 8th Street right-of-way; twelve,
fourteen, and eighteen-inch water lines lie within the Sunset Avenue right-of-way; within the
Wilson Street right-of-way, pipelines ranging from four to eighteen inches transmit water; water
lines from eight inches up to twelve inches convey water from within the Ramsey Street right-of-
way. Water lines vary from two inches to eighteen inches within the Westward Avenue right-of-
way. The Sun Lakes community is served by eight, ten, twelve and sixteen -inch water lines.
The City operates its water services with guidance from its Urban Water Management Plan.
Other Domestic Water Service Purveyor
The Banning Heights Mutual Water Company provides water services to the northwestern half
of the planning area. Water delivered to its service area is primarily utilized for irrigation, and
originates from the Whitewater River. The company employs a flume and pipe–reservoir system
to divert water supply from the River.
WASTEWATER TREATMENT
The City of Banning Public Works – Wastewater Division provides sanitary wastewater services
to the City of Banning. The City Public Works Department is located at 99 East Ramsey Street.
The City of Banning Wastewater Reclamation Plant is located at 2242 East Charles Street. The
City contracts with United Waters Services for the operation and maintenance of the water
reclamation plant. Recent upgrade of the plant resulted in an increase of secondary treatment
capacity design to 3.6 million gallons-per-day, including the addition of several plant parts that
could accommodate future capacity to approximately 5.8 million gallons-per-day. On a daily
basis the, plant receives an average flow of approximately 2.3–2.4 million gallons-per-day.
Collected wastewater is transported by sewer main lines of 8, 10, 15, and 18 inches in diameter,
which are connected to trunk lines. The trunk lines, ranging from 24 to 30 inches in diameter,
convey wastewater to the plant. Trunk lines are located within the City major public right-of-
ways including a 30-inch line in Porter Street.
While sewer services are provided to the entire city limits, sewer services are also provided in
the unincorporated Riverside County lands surrounding the southeastern portion of the City of
Banning. Areas without sewer facilities utilize septic tanks.
ELECTRIC SERVICE
The City of Banning Public Works – Electric Division provides electric services and facilities to
the City of Banning. The City Public Works Department is located at 99 East Ramsey Street. The
City plans to continue to provide electricity to the community at reasonable rates. The City
Electric Division contracts with the Southern California Public Power Authority (SCPPA) for
most of the City’s power needs. SCPPA is a joint power that acquires energy from out of state
sources. In addition, the City contracts with both public and private entities for the provision of
specialized services.
                                                                         Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                 VI-2

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
Electricity is conveyed to the City through a series of transmission lines including several owned
by Southern California Edison (SCE). SCE delivers power to the City via 115 kV transmission
lines to a substation located on East Ramsey Street. From the East Ramsey Street substation,
power is transmitted by one 33 kV transmission line to five distribution stations owned and
operated by the City, which in turn distribute power through 4 kV and 12 kV distribution
systems. Within the City system, high voltage transmission lines deliver power to a substation
where power is stepped down and distributed through lower voltage lines. Individual homes and
businesses then receive power through a final transformer, which brings voltages down to more
safe and useful levels.
NATURAL GAS
Natural gas services and facilities are supplied to the City. Natural gas supplies originate from
out of State, transported by two major east-west trending gas lines. These high-pressured gas
lines, of varying sizes, traverse through the eastern desert areas to the western end of Riverside
County. In addition to the two major east-west trending high-pressured gas lines, other natural
gas pipelines are located in Wilson and Lincoln Streets.
It should be noted that adjacent to the two major east-west trending gas lines is a pipeline
designed to carry liquid fuels. Though not currently in use, this pipeline has been used to
transport crude oil, diesel fuel and gasoline.
Natural gas services and facilities are not available in some small pockets of the Banning
planning area. Propane is utilized as the alternative source of fuel.
TELEPHONE SERVICE
Verizon is the telephone service provider in the City of Banning. A wide variety of
telecommunication products and services are available to Verizon residential and business
customers, including local and long distance calling, DSL and internet, wireless communication,
conference services, and online courses. At present, there is no local Verizon customer service
center located in the Banning area. However, Verizon online account management is available to
Banning customers.
Verizon facilities in the Banning area include one central switching office, which connects
telephone and data transmissions. The central switching office is located at 160 West Hayes.
CABLE TELEVISION SERVICE
Cable television services are provided to the City of Banning by Time Warner Cable through a
franchise agreement. The Time Warner local customer service center in Banning is located at
300 South Highland Springs Avenue. Time Warner offers a wide range of cable products and
services, including high speed internet, digital cable with access to over 200 channels, iControl
movies and High Definition TV (HDTV). Online bill payment and 24-hour technical support are
also available.
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                   VI-3
                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
The current franchise agreement between the City and Time Warner includes one public access
channel, Channel 10, exclusive to the City of Banning. The Banning Channel 10 broadcasting
program includes live City Council meetings, planning commission and other committee
meetings, events calendar and public service announcements.
SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
The City of Banning contracts with Waste Management Inland Empire for solid waste and
disposal services. The schedule for standard residential waste collection is once per week, while
commercial waste collection is available from Monday through Friday.
Waste Management utilizes a 3-cart automated collection system throughout the City. Customers
are provided with one bin for trash, another bin for green waste, and one bin for recyclables. The
bins are lifted and dumped into garbage trucks mechanically. Bulky item pick-up is also
available to Waste Management customers free of charge. Bulk items, such as mattresses,
appliances and furniture, are collected three times per calendar year, typically in February, June,
and September.
In 2003, trash collected within the City totaled 19,314 tons. Trash collected from the City is
taken to the Lamb Canyon Sanitary Landfill, El Sobrante Landfill, and the Badlands Landfill for
disposal. Lamb Canyon Sanitary Landfill is located in the City of Beaumont, approximately
three miles southwest of the City of Banning. It is owned and operated by the Riverside County
Waste Management Department and accepts solid waste collected from the communities of
Banning, Beaumont, Hemet and San Jacinto. It may also accept solid waste generated from
anywhere within Riverside County.
The California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB) has compiled a database of the
various landfills in the state of California. Based upon CIWMB’s database, Lambs Canyon
Sanitary Landfill occupies an area of 1,088 acres for all of its landfill operations. It has a total
permitted disposal volume of 23,601,596 cubic yards and has a permit to accept a maximum of
1,900 ton of solid waste per day. CIWBM data estimates that the Lamb Canyon Sanitary Landfill
had a remaining capacity of 16,926,000 cubic yards in 1998. The El Sobrante Landfill, owned
and operated by Waste Management Inc., is located in the City of Corona. According to data
compiled by the California Integrated Waste Management Board (CIWMB), the El Sobrante
Landfill encompasses a total of 1,322 acres and has a total permitted disposal volume of
184,930,000 cubic yards. On a daily basis, this landfill is permitted to accept a maximum of
10,000 tons of solid waste. CIWMB data also indicates that as of 2001, the El Sobrante Landfill
has an estimated remaining capacity of 3,674,267 cubic yards. Waste Management Inc. has
received approval for the expansion of the El Sobrante Landfill.
Recycling Efforts
The California Waste Management Act (AB 939) requires municipalities to reduce the amount of
waste it sends to landfills by 50% beginning in 2000. The City of Banning implements recycling
programs in response to AB 939 and individuals may also participate through privately run
recycling operators.
                                                                          Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                  VI-4

                                                                                         City of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
In 2003, a total of 2,996 tons of recyclable materials were collected within the City of Banning.
Of this total, approximately 270 tons are from commercial sources, and 2,726 tons are from
residential sources. In 2003, the City generated a total of 4,152 tons of green waste materials.
Collected green waste from the Banning area is taken to a green waste recycling station in
Romoland, an unincorporated area in Riverside County, just west of Hemet. This green waste
facility is operated by BP John Hauling. Other recyclable materials, such as glass, plastic, and
paper are transported to a third party recycler in the City of Pico Rivera.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The organized extension of water, sewer and other public utilities is essential to land use
planning. The availability of high quality services influences the economic development of a
community by attracting revenue-generating development, such as commercial, industrial, and
hotel/motel development. The City must be actively involved in long-range facilities planning,
and continuously consult and coordinate with appropriate public and quasi-public agencies and
service providers to adequately meet public services and utility demands associated with buildout
of the community.
In the near term, the City will need to address service issues, such as the statewide energy crisis,
the potential connection of unsewered development to the sewer system, and domestic water
supplies and facilities. The City is responsible for monitoring the demand for and extension of
new technologies, such as fiber optic cabling and digital and high-speed data transmission, to
assure that City residents and businesses are offered the most state-of-the art technologies. The
General Plan provides service providers with information about the levels of growth expected in
the planning area so that they can best meet the demands of the growing community.

PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
Public and quasi-public facilities are built to accommodate the needs of the community, and
some play a major role in determining the location, intensity and timing of future development.
Such facilities also comprise an important part of the community’s quality of life. The range of
public buildings and facilities in the City include City Hall, fire stations, water wells, electric
power substations, telephone and cable transmission lines, schools and libraries.
This category includes City and utility maintenance yards and facilities, roads, bridges and traffic
signals. Advance planning for public facilities assures they are built in time to accommodate
existing and anticipated future needs of the community. Some, most notably utility
infrastructure, play a key role in determining the location, intensity and timing of future
development. Most of these facilities are shown on the General Plan map included in this
element.
The Public Buildings and Facilities Element provides background information on the various
structures and facilities owned by public and quasi-public agencies in the City. It reflects the
state of available technological and organizational resources. The element reviews these
buildings and facilities in light of issues of land use compatibility, aesthetic impacts, and
functionality. The element is meant to provide sufficient information to assure coordinated
planning and development. It sets forth goals, policies and programs which address the City’s
long-term planning needs.
BACKGROUND
This element is directly related to the Land Use Element, which assigns land use designations
and assures that adequate and optimally planned lands are available for existing and future public
buildings and facilities. It is related to the Circulation Element, which is directed at providing
efficient, safe transportation corridors throughout the City, and especially to essential public
facilities. The ability of the City and other responsible public and quasi-public agencies to
provide necessary facilities is also directly related to the Economic Development Element and
the strength of the local and regional economy.
Government Code Section 65103(c) states that the planning agency is to “annually review the
Capital Improvement Program of the City or County and the local pubic works projects of other
local agencies for their consistency with the General Plan . . .” Further, according to Government
Code Section 65303, the local jurisdiction may emphasize the importance of this issue by
requiring an optional Public Facilities Element in the General Plan.
                                                                            Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                    VI-9

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
The location of public buildings and facilities largely depends on their function in the
community. These functional criteria do not preclude the logical and sensitive integration of
these facilities into the City’s existing and planned land use patterns. Public buildings that serve
as offices in which residents and City officials conduct business should be conveniently located
and provided with safe access and adequate parking. Electrical substations, water wells, and
other utility infrastructure can be effectively screened from public view and integrated into the
natural and built environment both aesthetically and from a cost standpoint.
CITY HALL AND ASSOCIATED FACILITIES

various non-profit and public agencies. Programs include a senior nutrition meal program. Many
services and programs are offered free of charge; fees, as required for other programs and
services, vary. The Center is staffed by a part-time Senior Center Coordinator, as well as
volunteer and custodial staff.
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                  VI-10

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
The Banning municipal swimming pool, located at 749 North San Gorgonio Avenue, provides
facilities for swimming classes and aquatic special events. It includes a 6-lane, 25 yard
competition pool with dive tank, which is utilized February through May by Banning and
Beaumont high school swim teams. From March through July the facilities are utilized by the
non-profit Pass Sting Rays Swim team, a high school summer program, and elementary through

The Banning Youth Center is a not-for-profit agency that receives a portion of its funding from
the City of Banning. The City provides the Center space in the Laura May Stewart Bowl
Building in Repplier Park. The building is approximately 1,600 square feet and is the "back
stage" facility for the concert bowl. It consists of three rooms, in which are housed a kitchenette,
snack bar, and a small office. The building was damaged by fire in April 2003 and remained
closed until January 2004. During this time Youth Center programs were significantly curtailed,
with limited tutoring programs offered in the Senior Center building. The Youth Center is
currently (2004) being relocated back into the Laura May Stewart building. A date for Youth
Center programs to resume in full has not yet been determined.
Fire Stations
The City has made a concentrated effort to assure the highest level of fire protection services for
the community. Fire protection services are provided to the City of Banning through a
contractual agreement with the Riverside County Fire Department, which contracts with the
California Department of Forestry. Through a mutual aid agreement with surrounding
communities, including Beaumont, Calimesa and Cabazon, each city has access to and benefits
from the services provided by fire stations in other cities.
The Riverside County Fire Department’s Regional Fire Protection Program allows its fire
stations to actively support one another regardless of geographic or jurisdictional boundaries. On
receipt of an emergency call, the station physically closest to the emergency will respond,
allowing neighboring communities to share the use of specialized equipment and staff.
Currently (2004) only one fire station is located in the planning area, Station No. 89 at 172 North
Murray. The planning area is also served by a fire station located in the City of Beaumont. Four
additional stations are proposed in the planning area, including one in the vicinity of the Banning
Municipal Airport.
Please refer to the Fire and Police Protection Element for more information about the City’s fire
services and facilities.
Police Station
The Banning Police Department is currently (2004) relocating to temporary facilities located at
5261 West Wilson Street. The existing police station, at 125 East Ramsey Street, is expected to
be demolished, and a new and expanded facility is expected to be constructed at that site. Current
staffing includes 35 sworn positions, organized into three departments: Administration,
Operations, and Special Operations. The Police Department implements a wide range of crime
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                  VI-11

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
prevention and public safety programs, including the School Resource Officer Program, K-9
Team, Community Oriented Policing (COPPS), and the Adopt-A School Program.
Police services for the City’s Sphere of Influence and planning area are provided by the
Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, which operates out of the Cabazon substation.
EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES
K Through 12 Schools
The planning area is served by two school districts, the Banning Unified School District and the
Beaumont Unified School District. The Banning Unified School District boundaries encompass
the majority of the planning area. The Beaumont Unified School District is bounded to the east
by Highland Home Road, which extends to the northerly and southerly boundaries of the
planning area. Approximately 200 students in the planning area live within Beaumont Unified
School District boundaries. However, there are no Beaumont Unified public school facilities
located within the planning area. Through the inter-district transfer program, approximately 3%
of the students (average daily attendance) who reside within the Banning Unified School District
attend Beaumont Unified public schools.
There are eight Banning Unified public schools within the planning area: Cabazon Elementary,
Central Elementary, Hemmerling Elementary, Hoffer Elementary, Nicolet Middle, Susan B
Coombs Middle, Banning High, and New Horizons Continuation High. The District also
administers a home schooling program with offices at Nicolet Middle School, as well as adult
education classes that meet at Nicolet Middle.
Private educational facilities are provided by Calvary Christian School and Precious Blood
Catholic School. Riverside County educational facilities and programs in the planning area
include the Coombs North program for middle and high school students with severe disabilities,
and Twin Pines High School, a probation placement facility. The Morongo Band of Mission
Indians also operates educational programs at its campus in Banning.

clubhouse, driving range and swimming pool will also be constructed, according to the plan, as
well as a commercial retail center including restaurants and a hotel. A community park complex
will feature playgrounds, basketball and tennis courts, picnic areas, shade structures, and
pathways.
OTHER PUBLIC FACILITIES
U.S. Post Office
One U.S. Post Office is located in the planning area, at 176 N. Alessandro Road. The building
was constructed in 1961 and offers basic postal facilities, including post office boxes, shipping
services and postage stamp sales. The post office also offers passport services.
Airport
The Banning Municipal Airport is located at 600 South Hathaway Street, adjacent to the
Southern Pacific Railroad and US Interstate-10. The approximately 295 acre airport site includes
65 hangars and 32 tie downs. It includes a 5,100-foot runway and is capable of handling most
private single-engine and corporate jet aircraft. Services include fuel, parking, flight school/flight
school training, charter services, and rental car services. The Airport is administered by the City
Public Works Administration District. In 2004 the City completed a $750,000 runway asphalt
overlay. This improvement was primarily funded by a grant from the Federal Aviation
Administration.
Hospital
San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital is located at 600 North Highland Springs Avenue. The 85,000
square foot hospital, which opened in 1951, is licensed for 70 beds. The hospital opened as a
state district hospital, funded by a percentage of property tax from residents within the hospital
district. It is one of only four non-profit hospitals in Riverside County. It provides general
medical-surgical care, intensive care, emergency care, obstetrics, in and outpatient surgery, and a
range of ambulatory services including physical therapy and cardiac rehabilitation. Staffing
includes the only round-the-clock board certified emergency physicians in the Pass area. The
single-story hospital’s acute care facilities currently (2004) meet state-mandated hospital seismic
safety requirements.

                                                                                                   VI-15

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
The hospital recently opened a 15,000 square foot, state of the art Women’s Center that provides
birthing, diagnostic, surgical and preventative medicine services. The hospital has also launched
a $6 million capital campaign to fund expansion of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The expanded
ICU is expected to be operational within three years.
Utility Infrastructure
The City of Banning Public Works Department houses several divisions that provide utility
services to the planning area. These include wastewater treatment services and electric service;
the City provides domestic water service to most of the planning area. The Banning Heights
Mutual Water Company provides domestic water services to the northern half of the planning
area. The City purchases electrical energy from Southern California Edison (SCE), and
distributes its to its service area. Other utilities service providers include the Gas Company,
Verizon, Time Warner Cable, and Waste Management Inland Empire. Major utility buildings
and facilities in the City include the City wastewater reclamation plant, a SCE-owned electrical
substation, and a Verizon switching office.
There are also 22 operating groundwater wells from which the City obtains its water. These are
located in Banning Water Canyon and in residential and commercial districts throughout the
City. The City also owns 6 unequipped groundwater wells, three of which could be used as a
future water source. The majority of water storage reservoirs are located at two reservoir sites,
San Gorgonio and Sunset.
Utility buildings and facilities, including electrical substations and switching facilities and well
sites, and telecommunication switching facilities can generate noise and also detract from the
scenic value of an area. Landscaping and architectural elements can be incorporated into the
design of these structures to minimize their visual and noise impacts. These elements may
include decorative block walls, vegetative buffers, and the use of locally compatible architectural
style and color, which may be used to assure their compatibility with the surrounding built and
natural environment. Some utility transmission lines can be undergrounded to shield them from
view.
CRITICAL STRUCTURES
“Critical structure” refers to any building or facility that provides important and/or essential
emergency services following a hazardous event, such as an earthquake, flood or wildfire.
Examples include fire stations, hospitals, and major airports and roadways, as well as primary
communications facilities.
Civic structures, as well as school facilities, may also be included. To the greatest extent
practicable, these structures should be located in areas that are least susceptible to impacts from
seismic activity, flooding, and other hazardous occurrences. Specifically, they should not be
located within or near the 100-year floodplain or a fault zone.
Given the City’s location in relationship to the San Andreas and other fault zones, special
consideration should be made in the construction of critical structures. In particular, the City and
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                  VI-16

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
other responsible agencies should assure that thorough engineering analyses are performed, to
the extent necessary, prior to construction of future critical facilities. Building design should
allow for the offset of building foundations resulting from strong groundshaking or surface
displacements. These and other safety issues are addressed in more detail in the Geotechnical,
Flooding and Hydrology, and Emergency Preparedness Elements of the General Plan.
                                                                          Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                 VI-17

                                                                                         City of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The continued funding of public services and facilities is crucial to meeting essential needs of the
community, and the construction and/or expansion of new facilities will be necessary as the City
continues to grow. The City Public Works Department is primarily responsible for planning for
the City’s facilities’ growth. The department reviews current infrastructure several times
annually to plan for facilities’ expansion and funding. The City Finance Department also reviews
requests for expansion of public services and facilities, which are funded through a variety of
sources, including Measure A Sales Tax, Gas Tax, and developer fees.
The City is in a unique position in that it owns facilities associated with the provision of many of
the utilities that serve the community. The City should continue to annually review and adjust its
capital improvement planning process and developer fees to assure adequate resources to
maintain and expand public facilities and services. It should also continue to identify funding
sources to fund development, and explore the possibility of implementing a New Construction
tax as one such source.

                                                                                             General Plan
SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Schools and Libraries Element describes the educational and library facilities in the City,
sphere-of-influence and planning area. It discusses the services, resources and opportunities
available through the local school and library systems. The Element also helps to plan for future
needs to guide decision-makers in formulating expansion plans to ensure that adequate and
accessible educational facilities are provided to the community. The Element identifies the
City’s role in planning and siting new school and library facilities. It establishes goals, policies
and programs to enhance the educational experience of the City’s residents.
BACKGROUND
The Schools and Libraries Element is directly related to the Land Use Element, in that it
addresses the need for adequate and conveniently located public lands for educational facilities.
Schools and libraries are considered sensitive receptors with regard to community noise levels,
and this Element is therefore related to the Noise Element. It is also related to the
Traffic/Circulation Element, in the City’s efforts to protect these facilities from excessive traffic.
This Element is also related to the Public Building and Facilities Element in its definition and
location of existing facilities.
California Government Code 65302(a) requires that, among other things, the General Plan assess
the general distribution, location and adequacy of educational facilities. State legislation
(AB2926), effective January 1, 1987, authorized school districts to charge per square foot
development fees to fund the construction and reconstruction of public school facilities. The
fees are paid by developers directly to the appropriate school district prior to the issuance of
building permits. In 2004, the fee for residential development increased from $2.14 to $2.24 per
square foot, and the fee for commercial development increased from $0.34 to $0.36 per square
foot.
EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES
Public Education
Banning Unified School District
The Banning Unified School District (BUSD) provides kindergarten through 12th grade public
educational services to most of the City of Banning. In 2004, BUSD schools enrolled an average
of 4,700 students in eight schools and an independent study home schooling program. There are
four elementary schools, two middle schools, one high school, and one continuation high school
in the District. The District is averaging an approximately 5 percent annual growth rate in
enrollment, and has maintained a student-teacher ratio of 20:1 in kindergarten through 3rd grade
levels and a ratio of 30:1 in 4th through 12th grade levels. All of the District’s schools are at or
                                                                             Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                    VI-22

                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
beyond capacity, and many use temporary, portable buildings for additional classroom space.
The District is involved in a school reconfiguration and master planning process that is described
below.
The following briefly describes the BUSD schools located in the planning area, and reflects
current (February 2004) per school grade configurations and student enrollments.
Cabazon Elementary School is located at 50575 Carmen Street in Banning and currently includes
kindergarten through 5th grades. In 2004 the school enrolled 272 students.
Central Elementary School is located at 295 North San Gorgonio Avenue and currently includes
kindergarten through 5th grades. Enrollment in 2004 was 728 students.
Hemmerling Elementary School is located at 1928 West Nicolet and currently serves
kindergarten, and 3rd through 5th grades. Student enrollment in 2004 was 594.
Hoffer Elementary School is located at 1115 East Hoffer and currently includes kindergarten
through 3rd grades. In 2004, there were 686 students enrolled.
Nicolet Middle School is located at 101 East Nicolet and currently includes 6th through 8th
grades, primarily comprised of students who live in the eastern portions of the District. In 2004
student enrollment was 563.
Susan B. Coombs Middle School is located at 1151 West Wilson. It currently includes 6th
through 8th grades, primarily students who live in the western portions of the District.
Enrollment in 2004 was 560 students.
Banning High School is located at 100 West Westward. It includes 9th through 12th grades. In
2004, there were 1,120 students enrolled.
New Horizons Continuation High School classes meet in facilities located on the Coombs Middle
School campus, and shared with the Riverside County Office of Education “Coombs North”
program (see County programs, below). New Horizons includes 9th through 12th grades. In
2004, the school enrolled approximately 100 students. The school serves students who have a
credit deficiency. Enrollment is usually short term until the deficiency has been remedied and
the students can re-enter Banning High School.
The Independent Study Program is a home schooling program administered by BUSD. Program
offices are located at Nicolet Middle School. Approximately 120 students from kindergarten
through 12th grades were enrolled in 2004.
Inter-District Transfers
In 2004, approximately 339 students who reside within the boundaries of BUSD attended
schools or were enrolled in programs in the adjacent Beaumont Unified School District
(Beaumont USD) through the inter-district transfer program. Of these, approximately 165 were
elementary students, 60 were middle school students, and 107 were high school students.
                                                                         Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                VI-23

                                                                                         City of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
Approximately 7 BUSD students were enrolled in the Beaumont USD Independent Study (home
schooling) program.
Families of students requesting inter-district transfers are required by BUSD to re-apply for the
transfer prior to each academic year. In recent years, transfers to out-of-district schools have
accounted for up to nearly 10 percent of BUSD’s total enrollment. State law authorizes school
districts to limit inter-district transfers to 3 percent of the total enrollment in order to remain
financially solvent. BUSD has begun to limit its approval of inter-district transfer requests such
that only students with qualifying extenuating circumstances, as determined by the District,
would be eligible. Exceptions include high school students already attending out-of-district high
schools (primarily Beaumont High School), who would be allowed to graduate from the school
they have been attending.
BUSD students are enrolled at the following Beaumont USD schools and programs:
Chavez Elementary School, located at 1730 Cherry Avenue, is a year round school that includes
kindergarten through 5th grades. In 2004, student enrollment was 594.
Palm Elementary School is located at 751 Palm Avenue, and includes kindergarten through 5th
grades. Student enrollment in 2004 was 671.
Sundance Elementary School is located at an interim site at 650 Magnolia Avenue and includes
kindergarten through 5th grades. A new school facility is being constructed at 8th and Xenia
Streets. In 2004, student enrollment was 390.
Three Rings Ranch Elementary School is located at 1040 Claiborne Avenue. It includes
kindergarten through 5th grades, and enrolled 788 students in 2004.
Mountain View Middle School is located at 200 Cougar Way. It includes 6th through 8th grades.
In 2004, student enrollment was 1,194.
Beaumont High School is currently located at 1591 Cherry Avenue in Beaumont and has a total
enrollment of 1,153. Beaumont USD plans the construction of a new high school campus, with a
student capacity of 3,200, to be completed in August 2005 at a new location at Brookside and
Beaumont Avenue in Beaumont.
Beaumont Independent Study Program offices are located in the Wellwood Resource Center at
715 Wellwood Avenue. In 2004, the program enrolled 95 students.
BUSD Adult Education
The District also provides adult education classes, which meet at Nicolet Middle School.
Enrollment averaged approximately 200 students in 2004. Adult education courses include
English as second language (ESL), adult secondary education towards a high school diploma,
conversational Spanish, citizenship, computer courses, and community based English tutoring
(CBET) courses to train parents to teach their children the English language.
                                                                            Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                   VI-24

                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
BUSD Master Planning Process
The District has initiated development of a master plan that is expected to be completed in the
summer of 2004. Grade level configurations at individual school facilities have been reviewed
in order to maximize school effectiveness and address issues related to student safety. In school
year 2004-2005, elementary and middle school grade level allocations will be reconfigured such
that all elementary schools will include kindergarten through fourth grade. All 5th and 6th
graders will attend Susan B. Coombs Intermediate School (currently Coombs Middle School)
and all seventh and eighth graders will attend Nicolet Middle School.
Prior to the reconfiguration, District expansion plans called for construction of one new
elementary school. Expansion plans are currently being reviewed in light of school
reconfigurations and in conjunction with the master planning process. In addition, several
District schools are slated for modernization. These include Central, Hoffer, and Hemmerlings
Elementary Schools, and Coombs and Nicolet Middle Schools. The District is also considering
construction of traffic islands on school properties where feasible to relieve traffic congestion
during student drop off and pick up times.
Other District Programs
The District also provides multi-lingual programs such as the English Learner program, and
categorical programs including Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities, Rural Education
Achievement, and Indian Education. It offers special education programs, including the Gifted
and Talented (GATE) program. Severely disabled students in the District are currently served
through the Coombs North program, administered by the Riverside County Office of Education,
and discussed under County programs, below.
Beaumont Unified School District
The Beaumont Unified School District’s eastern boundary occurs within the City of Banning
corporate limits at Highland Home Road, extending to the northerly and southerly boundaries of
the planning area within Riverside County. In addition to the 339 inter-district transfer students
previously discussed, there are approximately 302 students in the City of Banning who also live
within the Beaumont USD boundaries. Beaumont USD has no school facilities located in the
planning area.
Of the 302 students noted above, approximately 144 are elementary school students, enrolled as
follows: 11 attend Palm Elementary School; 18 attend Chavez Elementary School; 33 attend
Three Rings Ranch Elementary School; and 82 attend Sundance Elementary School. There are
74 students who attend Mountain View Middle School from Banning, and 67 students who
attend Beaumont High School.
An additional 9 of these students are enrolled in the Laura May Stewart Independent study
program for home-schooled students. There are 8 students enrolled in Beaumont USD alternative
education programs, which include Glenview High School, located at 905 Michigan Avenue, and
San Andreas Continuation High School, located at 901 East 9th Street.

Private Education
Calvary Christian School is located at 1325 Mountain Avenue. Classes are held in the Mountain
Avenue Baptist Church and include kindergarten through 12th grades. Maximum capacity is 20
students per classroom, and in 2004 the school utilized seven classrooms. In 2004, student
enrollment was 78. A capital campaign to raise money to construct a freestanding school
building within approximately three years is currently underway.
Pass Christian School is located at 5297 West Williams, and serves a current enrollment of 55
pre-school and 1st grade students.
Precious Blood Catholic School, at 117 West Nicolet, includes pre-school through 8th grades.
The school’s capacity is 250, and in 2004 enrollment was 187. Classes are held in a freestanding
building separate from the church.
County Educational Facilities and Programs
Coombs North provides classes for middle and high school students identified as having severe
mental and/or physical disabilities. The program shares space with the New Horizons
Continuation High School, at a facility located on the Coombs Middle School campus. Students
range in age from 13 to 22 years and are referred from Banning and Beaumont Unified School
Districts. In 2004, enrollment was approximately 30 students, although enrollment varies based
on referrals from the districts.
Funding for new facilities comes primarily from the state. Programs are funded on a per-student
basis by the school districts. Student enrollment of more than twelve to sixteen students per
classroom triggers a review process that may result in formation of a new class. However,
expansion is constrained by availability of new facilities.
Milo P. Johnson Learning Center is located at 671 North Florida Avenue. It is operated by the
Riverside Office of Education. It serves community school districts by providing short-term,
focused educational services for junior high and high school students who have been expelled or
placed on legal probation. Students are referred by their school district or the court system. The
program is designed to equip students to re-enter mainstream educational facilities as soon as
possible. The Center includes nursery/day care facilities for infants and toddlers, and offers
anger management and drug counseling programs. Current enrollment is approximately 100
students and 10 infants and toddlers. Current (2004) plans potentially include expanding the
school day to a community day school format that would provide vocational training, focusing
on technology.
Twin Pines High School is located at 49500 Twin Pines Road. Twin Pines is a probation
placement, residential correctional facility for juveniles who have been court-referred as a result
of a second felony offense. The facility has a maximum capacity of approximately 75 residents,
and in 2004 there were 58 juveniles in the program. Each placement is for a ten-month period. In
addition to high school classes, the probationary program includes Alcoholics Anonymous
meetings, HIV/AIDS awareness and education, anger management classes, counseling, and
parenting classes. Vocational classes are also offered at Twin Pines.
                                                                          Public Services and Facilities

Tribal Educational Facilities and Programs
The Morongo Band of Mission Indians operates several educational programs for qualifying
students within the City of Banning. Students must be Morongo tribally enrolled or descendents
thereof, or meet low-income qualifications. Tribal programs include:
Morongo Band of Mission Indians Headstart program is located at a four-building campus at
12150 Santiago Road in Banning. In 2004, the program operated at its capacity, serving 40 three
and four year olds, and had a waiting list of 60 children. The federally-funded Headstart
program, initiated in the 1960’s, prepares children for kindergarten through education and
attention to social and emotional issues.
The Tutoring/Shadow Program, located on the same campus, is available to all kindergarten
through twelfth grade students who are Morongo tribally enrolled or their descendents. In 2004,
200 children were involved in the program, which employed 13 full-time tutors to provide
tutoring and enhancement services. Tutors also visit school campuses to shadow and advocate
for tribal students.
The Independent Study Program is available to assist students with difficulty functioning in a
traditional classroom setting. The program also provides adult GED classes, which typically
enroll approximately 12 students.
Colleges and Universities
Regional colleges and universities in the planning area include Mount San Jacinto College, a
state community college. Currently (2004) Mount San Jacinto College has campuses located in
San Jacinto and Menifee, with classes offered in rented facilities in Banning. The college has
initiated plans to construct a new education center on 48 acres in Banning, at the corner of Sunset
and Westward Avenues. The center could serve up to 5,000 students when completed.
At buildout, campus development is expected to include approximately 213,000 square feet of
development. Although the campus master plan has not been finalized, structures may include a
library, a student center, several instructional complexes, a gymnasium, a student services office;
athletic facilities, and maintenance buildings. A performing arts facility may also be constructed.
Initiation of construction may begin within five to seven years and is contingent on state funding.
Development is expected to be phased, also based on funding.
LIBRARY FACILITIES
The Banning Public Library participates in the Inland Library System, a cooperative of
independent public libraries in Riverside, San Bernardino and Inyo counties. The approximately
306-square mile Banning public library district is primarily funded as a special Riverside County
tax district.
There are two Banning public library branches. The main branch is located at 21 West Nicolet
Street in Banning. The most recent addition was in 1990, when the facility was expanded by
2,760 square feet to its current size of 9,573 square feet. A second branch is located at 50171
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                  VI-27

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
Ramona Avenue in Cabazon in a 1,300 square foot facility. Together, the two branches own
approximately 76,000 volumes.
The system contracts with the OCLC Inter-Library Loan database system on a fee basis. This
arrangement allows patrons to request materials from other libraries in the OCLC system.
Although the library is not part of the Riverside County library system, library staff has computer
access to view library catalogs for libraries in the Riverside County system.
Riverside County and San Bernardino counties have applied for state funding to set up a system
linking library facilities in the two counties, and have invited participation from other counties.
The Banning public library is eligible to join the fee-based system, which would increase library
access to materials via electronic request. However, participation would also require release of
patron and other information from the library’s database. Library administration is currently
reviewing participation in this system.
The library offers Internet access at both the Banning and Cabazon locations, as well as English
as a Second Language (ESL) and adult literacy classes, a children’s library and associated
services, and a children’s reading program. The Banning location includes a small (19-person
capacity) conference room.
The library owns an impressive collection of historical materials, including photographs, deeds
and newspapers. Limited space is currently available to display these materials, however many
of the materials are protected in archival-quality storage on-site. Future plans include electronic
archiving of these materials.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
As the planning area develops, Banning Unified School District facilities will need to expand to
accommodate the accompanying growth in student population. Public school districts are
considered “responsible agencies” and have “lead agency” status for the siting, planning, and
processing development plans with their own facilities. While consultation with local
jurisdictions is required, most decisions rest with the school districts. Building, planning and
design plans are processed and approved by the State Architect’s Office. Nonetheless, the City
of Banning can assist and coordinate with BUSD, and as applicable with Riverside County and
state agencies to assure the provision of adequate educational facilities and services, including
those to special needs populations.
The public library is heavily utilized as an after school gathering place, primarily by middle
school students, with some resulting behavioral problems. The east-west separation of middle
school student populations has apparently contributed to a sense of divisiveness. Resulting
tensions and associated issues of student safety have been a factor in the District’s decision to
reconfigure grade-level allocations. The City should consider developing youth programs aimed
at providing positive after school activities for all students, with a focus on middle school
students where the need seems to be most expressed. Construction of a youth center, or joint use
of existing facilities for these programs, should also be considered.
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities

Expansion of services and facilities by Mt. San Jacinto College affords the City additional

POLICE & FIRE PROTECTION ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Police and Fire Protection Element addresses the provision of adequate police and fire
protection services in the City. The Element describes existing levels of police and fire
protection services and identifies the agencies providing these services. It also incorporates
policies and programs developed and focused to ensure adequate long term public safety services
for the entire community.
BACKGROUND
The Police and Fire Protection Element is essential and directly related to several other General
Plan elements, including Land Use, Traffic and Circulation, Emergency Preparedness, Water
Resources, and Health Services. Effective fire and police services are dependent upon the
distribution and intensity of land uses, accessibility, coordination of emergency response, the
availability of water to suppress fires, and health service to treat the injured, and the provision of
“defensible space” in urban development.
The City of Banning provides its own law enforcement services within City limits, while it
contracts with the Riverside County Fire Department for fire protection and maintains
cooperative/mutual agreements with other communities and agencies for additional emergency
response support.
Several state regulatory codes, including Government Code Section 65302 (g) and Public
Resources Code 4125 (a), are directed at the importance of addressing the protection of the
community from natural and man-made hazards. Government Code Section 65302 (g) states that
a Safety Element or its equivalent be included in the General Plan to address measures necessary
to protect the community from risks related to fire and other hazards and threats. Public Resource
Code 4125 (a) requires that the State Board of Forestry classify all lands within the State for the
purpose of determining hazards and addressing financial responsibility for the prevention and
suppression of fires. Unclassified lands fall under the jurisdiction of the City or appropriate
federal agency, such as the Bureau of Land Management or the U.S. Forest Service.
POLICE PROTECTION
Police protection services within City limits are provided by the Banning Police Department. In
2004, the Police Department is undertaking relocation to 5261 West Wilson Street. Prior to
relocation and since 1980, the City Police Station has been located at 125 East Ramsey Street,
adjacent to City Hall. The police station on East Ramsey Street is scheduled for demolition and
will be replaced by a new and expanded facility for the Police Department. Construction is
expected to take from twelve to eighteen months.
                                                                             Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                    VI-32

                                                                                                 City of Banning
                                                                                                    General Plan
The current level of law enforcement staffing in the City of Banning is approximately 1.4 sworn
officers for every 1,000 residents.1 The City has historically maintained a goal of 1.8 police
officers per 1,000 residents.
Police protection services to the City’s Sphere of Influence and Planning Area are provided by
the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department. The Sheriff’s Department operates out of the
Cabazon substation located at 50290 Main Street in Cabazon.
Police Personnel
At present (2005), the Banning Police Department has a total of 35 sworn positions, of which
three are grant positions and will be completed in 2005, and 16 unsworn positions for a total of
51 positions. The 35 sworn positions include the Chief of Police, 2 Commanders, 6 Sergeants, 6
Corporals, and 20 Officers. The Banning Police Department is organized into three main
departments: the Administration, Operations, and Special Operations departments. The
Administration Department is comprised of the Detective Bureau, School Resource Officer
Program, Community Service Officer (CSO), Dispatch, Records Personnel, Volunteers, and
Explorers. The Operations Department includes the Patrol Division, Traffic Division, K-9 Team,
Reserve Police Officer Program, Chaplain, and the Abandoned Vehicle Abatement (AVA)
Program. The Special Operations Department is comprised of Community Oriented Policing, the
Narcotics Task Force, and the Gang Unit.
The Banning Police Department Patrol Division is currently organized into two shifts per day,
based on a 12-hour plan. The patrol teams are deployed with one sergeant, one corporal, and two
patrol officers. In addition, there is a traffic officer assigned to each day of the week.
The Banning Police Department divides the City into either two or three geographic areas or
“beats,” based upon the way the shift Sergeants deploy their personnel. When personnel are
deployed in a two beat system, the beats are divided at San Gorgonio Avenue and cover the east
and west portions of the City. When personnel are deployed in a three beat system; Beat #1
covers the area from San Gorgonio Avenue to the eastern City limits; Beat #2 covers from San
Gorgonio Avenue west to 22nd Street; and Beat #3 covers from 22nd Street to the western City
limits.
The Banning Police Department fleet inventory consists of patrol cars, unmarked units,
motorcycles and bicycles.
Demand for Police Services
In 2003, the Banning Police Department responded to approximately 28,852 calls for service.
Banning Police Department officers respond to high priority calls within 3-7 minutes, depending
on the time of the day and traffic flow. As the City population continues to increase, law
enforcement response time, calls for police services, and traffic levels are expected to increase.
Over the past five years, the highest demand for police services in the City of Banning has been
assaults and burglaries. Between 1999 and 2003, assault and burglary rates have varied from a
5% annual decrease to a 9% annual increase.

Crime Prevention and Public Safety
The Banning Police Department implements a variety of crime prevention and public safety
programs. It currently deploys personnel in the following public safety programs, including
several community-based policing programs: Patrol, Detectives, Traffic Enforcement, K-9,
Narcotics Task Force, School Resource Officer, Adopt-A-School program and COPPS.
The Uniform Patrol Division is the primary responder for all police service calls within the City.
The Detective Bureau is responsible for follow-ups and investigation of reports, arrests, and tips
initiated by the uniformed officer. Detectives also conduct crime scene analysis. The Traffic
Enforcement Division consists of motor officers, whose responsibilities include traffic law
enforcement, traffic collision investigations, and follow-ups on traffic related crimes. The Police
K-9 teams are utilized by the patrol and narcotics division to track and locate suspects, as well as
for suspect apprehension, searches, narcotic detection, and crowd control.
Community-based policing programs include the School Resource Officer (SRO) program,
directed at resolving situations that involve school age children and young people in the
community and in schools. As part of the program, law enforcement officers are placed in the
educational environment to conduct programs focused on prevention and intervention. The
Youth Resource Officer (YRO) provides and teaches program curricula such as DARE and
GREAT, which are drug and gang awareness programs, to elementary and middle school
children. The Explorer program is available to teenagers and adults who are interested in law
enforcement. Candidates must be between 14 and 20 years of age and must pass an oral
interview and a background investigation. The Banning Police Department Citizen’s Volunteer
program primarily provides additional patrol capabilities to the community, and helps in clerical
duties throughout the department. Volunteers must be at least 21 years old, are required to
complete training classes, and must comply with the City and Police Department guidelines and
policies. The Police Department also operates a substation on Highland Springs Avenue, south
of Ramsey Street, to provide neighborhood presence in this area.
Banning Police Department Strategic Plan
The Banning Police Department has drafted a strategic plan to address the current and future law
enforcement needs of the community. The strategic plan sets forth the objectives of the Police
Department. The Plan provides a description of the strategies and efforts that will be
implemented under each of its objectives. The Plan is expected to serve as the Banning Police
Department’s catalyst for achieving needed changes, by providing focus and direction as
outlined in the Plan’s objectives and strategies. Development of the Banning Police Department
Strategic Plan involved the review and input of department employees, the City Manager, and
city policy makers.

                                                                                            General Plan
FIRE PROTECTION
Fire protection services are provided to the City of Banning through a contractual agreement
with the Riverside County Fire Department, which in turn contracts with the California
Department of Forestry. The contract provides various fire related services, including emergency
medical services, fire prevention, disaster preparedness, fire safety inspections, hazardous
materials business plan programs and plan reviews.
The service contract for fire protection includes a Regional Fire Protection Program with other
surrounding cities, such as Beaumont, Calimesa, and Cabazon, wherein each city has access to
and benefits from the services provided by fire stations in the other cities.
Further, the Riverside County Fire Department operates under a Regional Fire Protection
Program, which allows its fire stations to actively support one another regardless of geographic
or jurisdictional boundaries. When an emergency call is received, the station that is physically
closest to the emergency will respond, even if the emergency is located outside the station’s
official “jurisdiction.” This provides the community with the most effective and efficient method
of emergency response, and allows for the shared use of specialized equipment and personnel
between neighboring communities.
At present, the Riverside County Fire Department has an International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) fire insurance rating of Class 4.
The Insurance Services Office (ISO) provides rating and statistical information for the insurance
industry in the United States. The ISO does this by evaluating a community’s fire protection
needs and services, and assigns each community evaluated a Public Protection Classification
(PPC) rating. The PPC rating, which is developed as a cumulative point system, is based on the
community’s fire-suppression delivery system, including fire dispatch (operators, alarm dispatch
circuits, telephone lines available), fire department (equipment available, personnel, training,
distribution of companies, etc.), and water supply (adequacy, condition, number and installation
of fire hydrants). Insurance rates are based upon this rating, which ranges from Class 1 (best) to
Class 10 (worst). Banning currently has a Class 4 ISO rating.
Fire Department Staffing
Currently, a total of 12 fire personnel are stationed in the City of Banning. This equates to .47
fire personnel per 1,000 residents. The County Fire Chief recommends that personnel assigned to
Banning be increased by six.
Fire Stations and Fire Equipment
Currently, Station No. 89 is the only fire station that is located within the Banning city limits.
Station No. 20, located within the Beaumont city limits, also responds to fire emergencies that
occur in the City of Banning.
Station No. 89 is located at 172 North Murray in Banning. Staffing at Station No. 89 includes a
total of 6 crewmembers, 2 of which are on duty at any on time. Station No. 89 is equipped with
one Type 1 pumper engine, one Rescue Unit, one Utility Unit and one State Office of Emergency
Services (OES) Type I engine.
                                                                            Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                   VI-35

                                                                                          City of Banning
                                                                                             General Plan
Station No. 20 is located at 1550 East 6th Street, in the City of Beaumont. Station No. 20 is less
than one quarter mile west of Highland Springs Avenue. Equipment inventory at Station No. 20
includes one Type 1 pumper engine (Engine #90), and two Type 3 wildland engines. Engine 90,
the City Fire engine, is also staffed with 5 personnel, 2 of which are on duty at any one time.
Another currently unused fire station is located at 5461 Wilson Street. This facility is currently
being used by the Police Department (please see discussion above). Four additional fire stations
have been proposed within the Banning City limits. One station is being proposed in the vicinity
of the Banning Municipal Airport; another is recommended in the southwest portion of the City;
a fire station is being considered in the northern portion of the Banning Bench, in the Black
Bench area. Further recommendations are being made for the replacement of aging fire engines.
Other Fire Protection Services
The Riverside County Fire Department provides a variety of fire related educational activities
and programs for all age groups to the City of Banning. Programs offered in schools include the
3rd Grade Home Escape Plan program and an annual poster contest. Education for disaster
preparedness is also offered.
The fire protection services contract between the City of Banning and Riverside County Fire
Department also provides for a Fire Marshal. The responsibilities of the Fire Marshall include
plan reviews, coordination with the City for disaster preparedness programs, management of
programs such as weed abatement, inspections, and the Hazardous Materials Business program.
Fire protection associated with the fighting of wildfires is addressed separately in the
Environmental Hazards Chapter.
Emergency Medical Services
Emergency medical services, including ambulance services, are currently provided under
contract with the County by a private company, American Medical Response. Their services and
vehicles are regional, and there is no unit assigned specifically to Banning.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Additional demand for police and fire protection services is a function of the continued growth
of the City. It is difficult to determine the exact timing, and location of additional police and fire
facilities necessary to provide adequate safety related services, given that this is dependent upon
the type, location and intensity of future development. The City will continue to monitor growth
patterns and respond to additional demand for public safety facilities and services.
Focused attention will be given to issues involving land use and circulation patterns, the
provision of water for sufficient fire flows, the financing of future police and fire stations, and
the adequacy of emergency response times.

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Emergency Preparedness Element outlines the potential for natural and man-made disasters
that could affect the City of Banning and its Sphere of Influence and Planning Area. It also
discusses the plans and facilities currently in place to deal with such emergencies and assess the
additional critical facilities and services necessary for the City to respond quickly and efficiently
to protect its citizens from injury and loss. This Element also discusses systems and approaches
the City has in place to minimize damage, loss of life and impacts to financial resources during
and after an emergency. It describes how the City relates to and coordinates with County, State
and Federal agencies with regard to emergency response. Finally, it sets forth the City’s goals,
policies and programs that shape its priorities and direction in sustaining adequate readiness for
emergency situations.
BACKGROUND
This Element is included as part of the overall discussion and planning regarding general
environmental hazards, in accordance with Government Code Section 65302(g), which mandates
that General Plans address hazards such as seismic disturbances and their effects, “other geologic
hazards . . . flooding; and wildland and urban fires.” This Element is directly related to the
Geotechnical, Flooding and Hydrology Elements, as they provide information regarding natural
constraints and hazards, which need to be addressed in emergency planning. It is also related to
the Water, Sewer and Utilities Element, which defines the City’s utilities infrastructure and
hazard planning associated with these services; the Land Use Element, which allows the City to
address planning issues in making critical facilities accessible, and provides for their protection
from location-specific hazards; and the Police and Fire Protection Element, which outlines
protection of public safety, rescue operations and emergency transportation during times of
disaster. It also relates to the Hazardous and Toxic Materials Element, which defines potential
man-made hazards, mismanagement of which can induce the need for emergency response.
The Banning area is located at the boundary, formed by the San Andreas fault, between the
North American and Pacific plates. The San Andreas fault, one of the most active faults in
California, crosses the Banning General Plan planning area. Therefore, the area is subject to
seismically-induced ground shaking, landslides, ground lurching, structural damage or
destruction, and liquefaction. Seismic hazards, as well as fires, flooding, and hazardous materials
releases all require emergency planning. The City may also be vulnerable to man-made
emergencies such as major accidents involving trains and motor vehicles, especially given its
proximity and relationship to U.S. Interstate 10 and the Union Pacific Railroad, both of which
run east to west through the planning area. Aircraft accidents and power outages could also
occur. In addition, terrorism and school and workplace violence are very real potential incidents
necessitating action and response plans.
                                                                            Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                   VI-40

                                                                                      City of Banning
                                                                                         General Plan
MANDATED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
The following discusses mandated emergency management systems. State programs, which have
been in place for over a decade, are discussed first, followed by recently enacted federal
requirements that must be implemented by year 2005. The City’s emergency plans and systems
are also discussed.
Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS)
Senate Bill 1841, California Government Code Section 8607, made effective January 1, 1993
(Petris Bill) describes the statewide Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS). This
legislation relates to “responding to and managing emergencies and disasters involving multiple
jurisdictions or multiple agency responses…” (Section 8607(a). Compliance with SEMS requires
all jurisdictions within the State of California to use standardized equipment and language to
ensure that assistance offered across jurisdictional boundaries can be effectively utilized.
Further, local jurisdictions are required to adopt SEMS to be eligible to recover costs associated
with State-level emergency responses. Individual City agencies and personnel take on their
responsibilities as defined by the City’s Emergency Plan.
SEMS incorporates the Incident Command System (ICS) for field-level activities. ICS can be
adapted to any scope of emergency and quantifies specific actions, personnel, equipment and
facilities necessary to systematically and adequately respond to a particular hazard. The ICS
organizational structure identifies five principal activities performed at any incident:
Management, Operations, Logistics, Plans and Finance.
Federal Emergency Management Requirements
In March 2004 the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced approval of the National
Incident Response Management System (NIMS), which is intended to standardize response to
terrorist attacks, natural disasters and other emergencies across federal, state and local
governmental tribal association lines. Like SEMS, NIMS is based around the Incident Command
System and associated functional areas. It also employs a Joint Information System (JIS) to
standardize public communication during an incident. A National Response Plan is currently
(2004) being finalized to provide for system implementation. State and local governments must
demonstrate compliance with NIMS beginning in Fiscal Year 2005 in order to be eligible for
Federal preparedness assistance. Given the common basis for SEMS and NIMS in ICS, required
changes to State and local government emergency plans in California are expected to be
relatively minimal.
State governments must submit pre-disaster mitigation assessments for all local jurisdictions to
the federal government by November, 2004. Therefore, California has drafted the State Multi-
Hazard Mitigation Plan, which will incorporate assessments provided by each jurisdiction.
Banning has completed and submitted its assessment to Riverside County, which will submit
local plans to the State by established deadlines. These pre-disaster mitigation assessments are
also linked to federal financial emergency assistance.
                                                                         Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                VI-41

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
Banning Emergency Plans
The City adopted the Multi-Hazard Functional Planning Guidance document in 1996. The
document is organized into three-parts, which include: 1) the Banning Emergency Plan; 2)
twelve functional Annexes that describe the emergency response organization; and 3) a listing of
operational data such as resources, key personnel, and essential facilities and contacts. The
Multi-Hazard Functional Planning Guidance and associated Banning Emergency Plan are herein
incorporated by reference.
The Emergency Plan addresses the City’s planned response to extraordinary emergency
situations associated with natural and man-made disasters and emergencies. The Plan’s
operations concepts focus on coping with potential large-scale disasters that pose major threats to
life and property and can impact the well-being of large numbers of people.
As previously noted, the Multi-Hazard Functional Planning Guidance document includes twelve
functional Annexes. These cover operational areas of management, fire and rescue, law
enforcement and traffic control, medical, public health, coroner, care and shelter, movement,
rescue, construction and engineering, resources and support, and radiological protection. The
multi-hazard function plan with accompanying annex documents, has been the standard used
throughout the State. It is regarded as cumbersome and outdated, with an emphasis on structure
and specific operational checklists that may limit response flexibility. A newer model, based on
the Emergency Operations Plan concept, has now been adopted statewide. Riverside County is
in the process of adapting this model to better meet its needs. Once completed, the County will
assist individual jurisdictions within the County with further jurisdictional-specific adaptations.
However, it is unclear when this process will be completed and the City’s existing plan will
continue to be utilized until the newly-adapted model is available. Federally-mandated updates
will be incorporated by required deadlines. The Plan is designed to include the City as part of
SEMS. Emergency response and chain of command are further described below.
The Banning Police Department is currently developing an emergency preparedness plan to deal
specifically with incidents of domestic violence, terrorism, and other threats to public health and
safety directly resulting from human activity. It will list possible threats, potential targets, and
will include a vulnerability assessment. This document is expected to be completed in 2005.2
The Banning Unified School District (BUSD) has developed its own Emergency Operations
Procedure document that sets forth responses to natural and manmade emergencies, establishes
communication links and provides for the establishment of shelters. This document, which is
based on the SEMS model, has recently been substantially revised and enhanced, and is pending
approval by the District’s Board. Once approved, the plan will be available for review at the
BUSD business office and City Hall.
Each District school also has a site-specific emergency plan listing assigning emergency
operations responsibility to specific staff members. School sites are equipped with emergency
kits that include sufficient food, water and medical supplies to allow schools to be self-sustaining
for a minimum of three days.

                                                                                                 VI-42

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
The District is represented on PASSCOM and has a PASSCOM-issued radio unit linked directly
to the City Fire Department for use in the event other communications systems fail. BUSD also
has an internal microwave radio communications network in the event that other systems fail.
The District collaborates closely with the City and County emergency operation offices to plan
for emergencies.3
In addition, the active adult community of Sun Lakes implements an Emergency Preparedness
Action Plan (EPAP). The Sun Lakes EPAP is an emergency response plan administered by
volunteers that provides for emergency communication, medical, security and transportation
systems if a major disaster strikes the Sun Lakes community.
Hazardous Materials Area Plan
In 2000, the City adopted a Hazardous Materials Area Plan. This plan covers a range of
potential incidents involving hazardous materials. The scenarios discussed in this plan include:
chemical spills, hazardous spills, railway and gas line incidents, and military and non-military
radiological incidents. The plan lists appropriate contacts, including state, federal, and local
government agencies, and private organizations, based on the type of incident. It also designates
possible evacuation centers in the City, further discussed under Critical Facilities. The Banning
Hazardous Materials Area Plan is hereby incorporated by reference. (Please also see the
Hazardous and Toxic Materials Element).
Critical Facilities
Critical facilities are those that provide emergency or other services, or shelter, for those in
danger. Such facilities are an integral part of any emergency plan, and may include hospitals,
police and fire departments, governmental operations, communications centers, evacuation and
emergency shelters, and utilities installations and systems. Support facilities, such as fire and
police communications, auxiliary personnel and commercial radio stations, can support the
primary critical facilities by providing information and direction to the public during a crisis.
Critical facilities also include access, such as evacuation routes and transport of the injured,
peak-load water supply and delivery, and airport services. Transportation system constraints
must also be accounted for, as these may hinder ground-based access or delivery of supplies or
emergency services to the affected areas.
Communications
The City participates in PASSCOM, which stands for Pass Communications Group. PASSCOM
is part of a County-mandated network of regional committees formed to provide emergency
communications planning. Emergency Managers from local jurisdictions and San Gorgonio
Memorial Hospital, and County Office of Emergency Services (OES) representatives meet
monthly to discuss emergency preparedness issues related to communications and public
education. Local business and volunteer leaders are also encouraged to attend PASSCOM
meetings. Although the Morongo Band of Mission Indians has been invited to participate in
PASSCOM, no tribal representatives currently attend the meetings.

                                                                           Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                  VI-43
                                                                                         City of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
The City has access to a County-owned satellite telephone system linking the County Emergency
Operations Center (EOC) with the EOCs of local jurisdictions. The City can also utilize the
County’s disaster-net radio system, which operates at dedicated frequencies used only for
emergency-related communications. Disaster-net provides a further link with the County EOC
as well as EOCs of other jurisdictions within the County.
The City also participates in the County-wide Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Services
(RACES) program, which provides emergency communications support operated by volunteer
radio operators. RACES volunteers are trained by County Office of Emergency Services staff.
Radio operators work from activated EOCs and at key locations, including hospitals, to provide
emergency operations and other critical facilities’ staff an alternative communications link.
Hospitals within Riverside County, including San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital in Banning, are
linked to the County EOC by means of the Ready Net communications system. The system is
computer-based and relies on the county’s microwave communications links, which provide
greater reliability than telephone lines. Ready Net provides a daily “snapshot” of hospitals’
respective facilities, staffing and patient-load status. In an emergency, this would allow updated
information regarding availability and need so patient traffic could be routed appropriately, and
emergency supplies and services directed where needed.
Community Training and Resources
The Citizens Emergency Response Teams (CERT) program trains private citizens in basic search
and rescue, fire suppression, first aid and utilities management. The County plans to provide
CERT training in the Pass region in 2004, in cooperation with Pass cities.
The City is home to numerous gated communities and mobile home parks. The largest gated
community, Sun Lakes Country Club, is represented on PASSCOM and has prepared a disaster
organization plan. The community has a limited stockpile of food, water and emergency medical
supplies that would allow it to be self-sufficient for a period of time following an emergency,
thus alleviating demands on emergency shelters in the larger community. Some other smaller
gated communities and mobile home parks have similar plans.
Shelters and Supplies
Shelters must be available to handle large numbers of people and to provide basic services such
as food, potable water and medical supplies. In the event of an emergency involving the City,
shelters would be administered by the American Red Cross. Shelters would be located at
Banning High School at 100 West Westward and the Banning Community Center at 789 North
San Gorgonio Avenue. Each shelter has a capacity of approximately 100 to 150 people.
As previously noted, the City’s Hazard Materials Area Plan designates three possible evacuation
centers in the City in the event of an incident involving hazardous materials. These are the
Banning Community Center, Nicolet Middle School, and under limited climate conditions,
Sylvan Park. Evacuation centers would accommodate approximately 100 to 150 people.
                                                                            Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                   VI-44

                                                                                       City of Banning
                                                                                          General Plan
The City currently (2004) has a small stockpile of food, water, and emergency medical supplies
stored at the City EOC. This is primarily for use by EOC staff. Currently the City does not have
storage capacity for, and therefore does not maintain larger stockpiles of these items for use by
the general population.
Emergency Accessibility, Transportation and Circulation
Immediate access to impacted areas by emergency personnel and supplies is essential after a
disaster. Highland Springs Avenue, Hargrave Street, Sunset Avenue, 22nd Street, Eighth Street,
and San Gorgonio Avenue are major intra-city north-south roadways. Wilson Street, Ramsey
Street, Lincoln Street and Westward Avenue are major inter-City east-west roadways. U.S.
Interstate-10 and State Highway 243 to State Route 79 are major regional access routes serving
the City and the planning area. Bridges and underpasses are critical roadway components for
delivery of food, water and medical supplies and personnel, as well as for the evacuation of the
injured. Currently, there are six access points to the City from Interstate-10, via interchanges at
Fields Road, Ramsey Street, Hargrave Street, 8th Street, 22nd Street, Sunset Avenue, and
Highland Springs Avenue, all of which pass under I-10.
Currently (2004), there are six railroad crossings in the City. Of these, four are at-grade and
occur at Hargrave Street, San Gorgonio Avenue, 22nd Street, and Sunset Avenue. Grade
separated crossings occur at 8th Street and Highland Springs Avenue.
Freeway underpasses and railroad crossings are generally protected from flooding by existing
flood control structures. However, in the event of major flood events, access to the U.S.
Imterstate-10 freeway, which links Banning with other Pass cities and communities to the east
and west may become flooded or damaged. U.S. Interstate-10 effectively bisects the City into
two distinct, north-south communities, either of which could become isolated should
interchanges or railroad crossings be damaged or blocked
In the event of a major disaster, including major earthquakes or floods, urban wildfires, major
truck or rail accidents, or by other natural or man-made disasters, critical roadways and
components could be damaged or blocked. The loss of freeway bridges over interchanges, or
road closures due to rockfalls or landslides would also impede the delivery of emergency
services and supplies.
The City does not have established evacuation routes, although depending on the location and
extent of an emergency, major surface streets could be utilized to route traffic through the City.
Should U.S. Interstate-10 underpasses be blocked, or freeway bridges or roadway segments be
damaged, limited access to neighboring communities may be available via connecting surface
streets. The City should consider developing an evacuation plan based on various hazard
scenarios and locations.
The City shall continue to coordinate with CalTrans, the Federal Highway Administration, and
the railroad, as well as adjoining cities, the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, and Riverside
County to provide the highest functional reliability of major roadways and the public
transportation system serving the City and the region. The City shall also continue to coordinate
with Riverside County Flood Control and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
                                                                          Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                 VI-45
                                                                                         City of Banning
                                                                                            General Plan
to address continuing flooding hazards that threaten people and property, and that may isolate
portions of the community. Programs that can identify and address weak links in the circulation
system, in conjunction with the efforts of other jurisdictions in the Pass region, should be
developed. PASSCOM may provide one means for such collaboration.
The Banning Municipal Airport is located within the City limits. It is classified as a General
Aviation airport and is capable of accommodating most private single-engine and corporate jet
aircraft, as well as helicopters. The City is located approximately 20 miles from the Palm Springs
International Airport, which is accessible by means of helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft.
Emergency and Other Medical Facilities and Supplies
Emergency medical services are provided by the City of Banning Fire Department. The
Department can provide emergency medical services at the scene. All Fire Department personnel
are trained as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs). Emergency medical transport is
provided by American Medical Response (AMR), which has ambulances staffed with
paramedics. AMR is dispatched through the City’s 911 police dispatch center, which links to the
County in the event of a fire or medical emergency. AMR can also link with Mercy Air, which
has airlift capabilities and has a station at the Banning Municipal Airport. Patients are either
transported via emergency ground transportation to the airport for airlift, or AMR coordinates
with Riverside County Fire Department to land a Mercy Air helicopter at the scene of the
emergency. California Highway Patrol (CHP) also has airlift capabilities. CHP may be called in
to supplement Mercy Air services when multiple patients must be transported, or when transport
is needed from remote and rugged terrain such as occurs in the northern and southernmost
portions of the planning area.
There are several medical facilities that may provide medical services and personnel in the event
of an emergency affecting Banning or the region. These include San Gorgonio Memorial
Hospital, Desert Regional Medical Center, Riverside County Medical Center, and Loma Linda
Medical Center. As has been noted, all hospitals in Riverside County are linked to the County
EOC via the Ready Net system, described in the Critical Facilities section of this element.
San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital is located at 600 North Highland Springs Avenue in Banning.
The hospital is licensed for 70 beds and encompasses 85,000 square feet. It provides general
medical-surgical care, intensive care, emergency care, obstetrics, in and outpatient surgery, and a
range of ambulatory services including physical therapy and cardiac rehabilitation. Hospital
staffing includes 24-hour board certified emergency physicians, and is the only facility with such
staffing in the Pass area. Currently there is no helipad on-site. When patient transport via Mercy
Air helicopter is necessary, the hospital and City coordinate closing Highland Springs Avenue in
the hospital vicinity. The hospital has plans to utilize an approximately 9-acre grassy area in the
eastern portion of the hospital site for helicopter landings and departures in the future.
San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital has generators that could provide back up power at 80 percent
of normal hospital functioning for approximately 10 days without refueling. The hospital also
maintains a stockpile of bottled water that could sustain a full patient load and associated staff
for approximately 4 days. The hospital has access to both Banning and Cherry Valley-Beaumont
                                                                            Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                   VI-46

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
Water District supplies via feeder pipes. The hospital owns several portable cooling units that
can be moved to critical care areas, and a supply of box fans.
The City is located approximately equidistant (approximately 21 miles) to two regional medical
centers. Desert Regional Medical Center, in Palm Springs to the east, is licensed for 396 beds.
Riverside County Medical Center is located west of the City in Moreno Valley and is licensed
for 363 beds. Both centers include acute care hospitals and are designated Level II trauma
centers. Both have on-site helipads. Riverside County Medical Center is designated as a
pediatric trauma center and is the only such facility in the Inland Empire.
Riverside County Medical Center has back up systems and supplies for water, electricity, air
conditioning, and natural gas. The primary water back up source is a 10,000 gallon holding tank
on-site; the hospital also stores several hundred cases of potable water packaged in pouches.
current storage capacity of water supplies stored on-site could provide the hospital water for
approximately 24 hours. The hospital also has capability of connecting directly to Eastern
Municipal Water District (EMWD) facilities. If the medical center campus is accessible to
ground transportation following an emergency, shuttle trucks could also transport water from
EMWD. Other back up systems would sustain hospital operations for from three days to
approximately two weeks. These include three electrical generators, for which the hospital has an
approximately three-day supply of diesel fuel and which could also operate an auxiliary air
conditioning system, as well as a 10,000 gallon propane tank (approximately a two-week supply)
for use for heating and cooking.
Desert Regional Medical Center has auxiliary power sources for basic medical functions,
lighting and air conditioning. The hospital also owns diesel-fueled generators that could run for a
minimum of 72 hours. The hospital also maintains a stockpile of bottled water for emergency
use.
More severe injuries requiring Level I care would be transported to the Loma Linda Medical
Center, approximately 28 miles from Banning. Loma Linda has 900 beds and is the only Level I
trauma center for Inyo, Mono, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties.
Due to emerging concerns over chemical and bioterrorism and in compliance with state hospital
commission mandates for accredited hospitals, both regional medical centers now have
decontamination systems and facilities. Decontamination facilities include outside showers and
interior “detail rooms” for individual patients.
Riverside County Medical Center also owns a portable “search capacity” patient care tent, which
includes generators to supply power for heating. This tent allows care to be offered at alternate
care sites and has capacity for approximately 20 patients.
The County has secured grant money for use in establishing medical supply caches throughout
the county. These include decontamination tents as well as Level C (personal) respirators that
could be set up in portable trailers for use in decontamination efforts.
Emergency Operations Center
The City’s Emergency Operations Center is located at 3900 West Wilson Street, in the same
location as the City Fire Department Administration and Fire Prevention Offices. The Alternate
EOC is located at City Hall, 99 East Ramsey Street. The County’s Primary EOC (PEOC) is
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                  VI-47

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
located at the County Administrative Center in Riverside at 4080 Lemon Street, and its Alternate
EOC (AEOC) at the County Administrative Center in Indio at 82675 Highway 111. The County
may also dispatch its mobile EOC as needed. The County EOC is activated either upon the
request of an affected city, or when two or more cities have activated their EOC’s.
Emergency Response, Organizational Structure and Chain of Command
In general, the City’s response to a disaster will be dictated by the type and magnitude of the
emergency, with progression from local to regional, to state, to federal involvement. The City
may provide overall emergency management in three different modes:
     1)   Decentralized coordination and direction, which would not require City EOC
          activation;
     2)   Centralized coordination and decentralized direction, in which case the City’s EOC
          would be activated for coordination purposes only;
     3)   Centralized coordination and direction, wherein the City’s EOC would be activated and
          all activities are directed through the EOC.
Should conditions warrant activation of the City’s EOC, this would be done upon the order of the
Disaster Preparedness Coordinator. Currently, the City’s Disaster Preparedness Coordinator is
the City Fire Marshal. Upon activation of the EOC, the City Manager assumes the role of
Emergency Services Director, and activates the other four ICS functions (Operations, Logistics,
Plans and Finance) with their respective areas of responsibility. If the City Manager is unable to
fill or continue the duties of Incident Commander, an Assistant City Manager assumes those
duties.
In accordance with Section 8605 of the Emergency Services Act, each county is designated as an
Operational Area, which are activated under certain conditions. These conditions may include a
situation that requires cooperative efforts on the part of two or more cities within the County, or
when emergency conditions extend across county lines. The county-designated Operational Area
Coordinator would be responsible for managing emergency operations within incorporated
jurisdictions in the County. In unincorporated areas, the County Emergency Corps Commander
would assume responsibility.
The state is divided into six Office of Emergency Services (OES) Mutual Aid Regions. The State
OES Director coordinates among the six regions. Riverside County is part of Region 6 for fire
and law enforcement mutual aid. Region 6 also includes the counties of San Diego, Imperial, San
Bernardino, Inyo and Mono. Designated state agency representatives who comprise the Regional
Emergency Management staff coordinate and support local emergency operations as requested
by the Operational Area Coordinator.
Upon the declaration of a Local Emergency, and once the city’s EOC and the County’s PEOC or
AEOC have been activated, the State OES is advised. Should the Governor declare a State of
Emergency in the impacted areas, the State OES Director, the County’s Operational Area
Coordinator and Emergency Corps Commander, and the City’s Director of Emergency Services
coordinate the necessary activities. The Governor is responsible for requesting a Presidential
declaration of an Emergency or Major Disaster, and would thereupon appoint a State
Coordinating Officer to coordinate with the Federal Coordinating Officer to support local
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities
                                                                                                  VI-48

                                                                                        City of Banning
                                                                                           General Plan
operations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is the main federal
government contact during emergencies.
Extended Emergency Response, Organizational Structure and Assistance
The City’s immediate response to an emergency is crucial to minimizing loss of life and
property. Conditions that result from a disaster can, in the aftermath, threaten health and safety
as significantly as the initial event. The City may expend substantial financial resources during
the emergency, and must keep careful records and follow appropriate reporting procedures to
ensure recovery of those resources from appropriate state and federal agencies.
Once the immediate crisis has passed, the City assesses the damage, and seeks to contain hazards
posed by damaged infrastructure. Basic services must also be restored. Continued safety and
rescue functions, and the restoration of order, are the responsibility of Fire and Police personnel.
Department of Public Works staff provide necessary equipment. Working through the Federal
and State Coordinating Officers (SCOs), and County and City representatives execute state and
federal assistance programs and begin the recovery process. These agencies would coordinate to
establish Disaster Assistance Centers (DAC’s) where individuals can apply for and access on-
going emergency and recovery services and provisions in one location. DAC personnel would
process subsistence monies, loan applications, insurance claims and other necessities for
emergency victims.
The post-emergency recovery period would begin as early as feasible. During this period, the
State OES Director, through the designated SCO, would coordinate the efforts of appropriate
federal, state, local, and Red Cross officials to implement state and federal assistance programs
and establish support priorities. There are several major objectives of the recovery period. These
are reinstatement of family autonomy, provision of essential public services, permanent
restoration of private and public property; reinstatement of public services; and research to
uncover residual hazards, advance knowledge of disaster phenomena, and improvement of future
emergency operations.
Once the major field tasks associated with emergency assistance and restoration of public safety
and basic services has been accomplished, the City’s EOC is deactivated. However, post-
emergency tasks, such as record keeping and receipt submittal, are still necessary and would be
completed as quickly as possible following de-activation of the EOC.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The City has comprehensive emergency and hazardous materials incident plans in place. The
emergency plan will be upgraded over the near term to ensure compliance with new federal
requirements. Plans and systems must be maintained and upgraded as needed to keep pace with
population growth, new construction, business development, and growth-induced circulation
issues.
The City has begun coordinating with local volunteer organizations to develop and implement its
first emergency drill. The City should continue to pursue this important initiative and fully utilize
                                                                           Public Services and Facilities

                                                                                          General Plan
volunteer personnel to extend its limited staffing resources. This exercise should also be used to
better understand potential disaster scenarios and to establish evacuation routes based on those
scenarios.
Nursing homes, licensed daycare facilities and private schools, all of which serve potentially
vulnerable populations, are required to development disaster plans. However, since these are
non-public agencies, they may not be part of established communications networks or back up
systems. Riverside County has indicated it intends to begin coordinating with local jurisdictions
to provide CERT training within the community. The City should fully cooperate and coordinate
with the County to provide CERT training at these facilities. The City should also provide the
County lists of Homeowner’s Associations, local businesses and volunteer groups that would
benefit from the CERT training and augment community awareness and preparation for
emergency situations.
The City currently has no large stockpile of food, water or emergency medical supplies that
could serve the general population. Although storage capacity for a large, centralized stockpile
is an issue, the City should explore the possibility of locating smaller stockpiles, or caches, at
locations throughout the planning area, both north and south of U.S. Interstate 10. Potential
locations could include schools, medical offices, and businesses. The City should collaborate
with the County to use the CERT training sessions to recruit community assistance with this
need.
