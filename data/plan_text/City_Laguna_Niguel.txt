THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                                       HOUSING
I.       INTRODUCTION
A.       Purpose of the Housing Element
The Housing Element is a guide for housing within Laguna Niguel. The Element provides an indication of
the need for housing in the community in terms of housing affordability, availability, adequacy, and
accessibility. The Element provides a strategy to address housing needs and identifies a series of specific
housing programs to meet community needs.
The Housing Element is an official municipal response to a growing awareness for the need to provide
housing for all economic segments of the community, as well as a legal requirement for all California
jurisdictions. It provides Laguna Niguel with the opportunity to plan for the existing and future housing
needs in the community. This Element has been prepared in compliance with the 2013-2021 planning cycle
for cities within the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) region. It identifies strategies
and programs that focus on: 1) providing diverse housing sites and opportunities; 2) conserving and
improving the existing affordable housing stock; 3) removing governmental and other constraints to
housing development; and 4) promoting equal housing opportunities.
B.       Scope and Content of the Housing Element
The State Legislature recognizes the role of local general plans and particularly the Housing Element in
implementing statewide housing goals to provide decent and adequate housing for all persons. Furthermore,
the Legislature stresses continuing efforts toward providing affordable housing for all income groups. The
State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) also sets forth specific requirements
regarding the scope and content of housing elements prepared by cities and counties.
As mandated by state law, the planning period for this Housing Element extends from 2013 to 20211. The
Housing Element consists of the following major components:
       x      An analysis of the City’s demographic and housing characteristics and trends (Chapter II);
       x      An evaluation of land, financial, and administrative resources available to address the City’s
              housing goals (Chapter III);
       x      A review of potential constraints, both governmental and non-governmental, to meeting the
              City’s housing needs (Chapter IV); and
       x      A Housing Plan for the 2013-2021 planning period, including housing goals, policies and
              programs (Chapter V).
       x      A review of the City’s accomplishments and progress in implementing the 2008-2013 Housing
              Element is provided in Appendix A.
C.       Public Participation
Section 65583(c)(5) of the Government Code states that "The local government shall make diligent effort to
achieve public participation of all the economic segments of the community in the development of the
housing element, and the program shall describe this effort." Public participation played an important role
in the formulation and refinement of the City’s housing goals and policies and in the development of a
Land Use Plan that determines the extent and density of future residential development in the community.

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                         HOUSING
City residents had several opportunities to recommend strategies, review, and comment on the Laguna
Niguel Housing Element. In early 2013, public hearings to consider the draft Housing Element were held
by the Planning Commission and City Council. Following review by the State Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD), public hearings were conducted by the Planning Commission and City
Council to review and consider adoption of the Housing Element. Meeting notices were posted on the
City’s website, and notification was published in the local newspaper in advance of the meetings. Copies of
the draft Element were made available for review at City Hall and were posted on the City website, and
notices were sent directly to agencies that serve the City’s special needs populations. These service
providers included organizations that represent the housing interest groups.
The following is a list of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of this Housing Element
update. A summary of materials and public comments from these meetings is included in Appendix C.

D.       Consistency with Other Elements of the General Plan
State law requires that all portions of the General Plan be internally consistent. The Laguna Niguel General
Plan contains the following nine elements: 1) Land Use; 2) Open Space and Parks; 3) Circulation; 4) Public
Facilities; 5) Noise; 6) Seismic/Public Safety; 7) Housing; 8) Growth Management; and 9) Community
Service Standards. The City will ensure consistency between the various General Plan elements and ensure
policy direction introduced in one element is reflected in other plan elements. For example, residential
development capacities established in the Land Use Element and constraints to development identified in
the Seismic/Public Safety Element are incorporated into the Housing Element and the discussion of
infrastructure and public services in the Housing Element is based upon information from the Public
Facilities element. This Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan elements and is consistent
with the policies and proposals set forth by the Plan. As the General Plan is amended from time to time, the
City will review the Housing Element for internal consistency, and make any necessary revisions.
SB 1087 of 2005 requires cities to provide a copy of their Housing Elements to local water and sewer
providers, and also requires that these agencies provide priority hookups for developments with lower-
income housing. The Housing Element will be provided to these agencies immediately upon adoption.
Government Code §65302(g)(3) requires that the Safety Element be reviewed upon each revision of the
Housing Element and, if necessary, be revised to include new information regarding flood hazard and
management information. The required Safety Element review was conducted, and no changes were found
to be necessary.

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                                             HOUSING
II.       HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Laguna Niguel is located in southern Orange County approximately midway between San Diego and Los
Angeles. The City is a master-planned community that offers a range of lifestyle and housing opportunities.
Much of Laguna Niguel’s growth took place prior to its incorporation in 1989. Since incorporation, the city
has grown substantially from a population of approximately 44,400 to about 63,700 residents in 2012.
Laguna Niguel is approximately 14.7 square miles in area and is bounded by Dana Point to the south, San
Juan Capistrano to the east, Mission Viejo to the northeast, Laguna Hills to the north, Aliso Viejo to the
northwest, and Laguna Beach to the west. The Census Bureau reported that the population is relatively
affluent with a median household income in 2010 of about $97,000 compared to $74,000 for Orange
County and $61,000 for California.
This chapter examines general population and household characteristics and trends, such as age, race and
ethnicity, employment, household composition and size, household income, and special needs.
Characteristics of the existing housing stock (e.g., number of units and type, tenure, age and condition,
costs) are also addressed. Finally, the city’s projected housing growth needs based on the 2014-2021
Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) are examined.
The Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent data from the U.S. Census2, California Department
of Finance (DOF), California Employment Development Department (EDD), Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) and other relevant sources. Supplemental data was obtained through
field surveys and from private vendors. In addition, the City’s 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan provides
useful information for this update of the Housing Element.
A.        Population Characteristics
          1.         Population Growth Trends
Laguna Niguel was incorporated December 1, 1989 with a population of approximately 44,400. From 1990
to 2000, the population of the newly incorporated city grew by about 39 percent. The city has experienced
slower growth since 2000, increasing by only about 3 percent from 2000 to 2012 to an estimated population
of 63,691 in 2012 (see Table II-1 and Figure II-1). The city’s 2012 population represents approximately 2.1
percent of the county’s total population of 3,055,792.

    The two primary sources of Census data used in this analysis are the 2010 Decennial Census, which is based on a 100% survey
    of American households, and the American Community Survey (ACS), which is a random sampling process updated annually.
    At the time this document was prepared, the 2006-2010 5-year ACS data was the most current data available.

         2.      Age
Housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of the population. Different age groups require
different accommodations based on lifestyle, family type, income level, and housing preference. Table II-2
provides a comparison of the city’s and county’s population by age group in 2010. This table shows that the
City’s population is somewhat older than the county as a whole, with a smaller proportion of residents in
the age groups up to 40 and a larger proportion of mature adults and senior citizens. The median age of the
city’s population exceeds the county median by over 6 years (42.8 vs. 36.2 years).

         3.        Race and Ethnicity
The racial and ethnic composition of the city differs from the county in that a lower proportion of city
residents are Hispanic/Latino or other racial minorities. Approximately 73 percent of city residents are non-
Hispanic white, contrasted with 44 percent for the county as a whole. The percentage of Hispanics residing
in the city, at approximately 14 percent, is substantially lower than that of the county. Asians, at 9 percent,
represent the City’s largest non-Hispanic minority group (Table II-3).

B.       Household Characteristics
         1.        Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing needed in a city. The
Census defines a “household” as all persons occupying a housing unit, which may include single persons
living alone, families related through marriage or blood, or unrelated persons sharing a single unit. Persons
in group quarters such as dormitories, retirement or convalescent homes, or other group living situations are
included in population totals, but are not considered households.
Table II-4 provides a comparison of households by type for the city and Orange County as a whole, as
reported in the 2010 Census. Family households comprised approximately 71 percent of all households in
the city, the same as the county as a whole. The household composition in the city is very similar to that of
the county although a smaller proportion of City households have children under 18. However, the city’s
average household size of 2.59 is somewhat lower than Orange County as a whole (2.99).

        2.        Housing Tenure
Housing tenure (owner vs. renter) is an important indicator of the housing market. Communities need an
adequate supply of units available both for rent and for sale in order to accommodate a range of households
with varying income, family size and composition, and lifestyle. Table II-5 provides a comparison of the
number of owner-occupied and renter-occupied units in the city in 2010 as compared to the county as a
whole. It reveals that the level of home ownership for the city (69 percent) is substantially higher than the
county (56 percent).

        3.       Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The U.S. Census
Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than one person per room, excluding
bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding when there are more than 1.5 occupants per room.
Table II-6 summarizes recent overcrowding data for the City of Laguna Niguel compared to the county as a
whole.

This table shows that overcrowding was much more prevalent among renters than for owner-occupied units
in both Laguna Niguel and the county. Approximately 4 percent of the city’s renter-occupied households
were overcrowded compared to less than 1 percent of owner-occupants.
        4.       Household Income and Overpayment
Household income is a primary factor affecting housing needs in a community. According to recent Census
data, the median household income in Laguna Niguel was approximately $97,000, approximately 30
percent higher than the Orange County median income of $74,344 (Table II-7).

While median income statistics provide a general indication of residents’ financial status, overpayment data
is more useful in assessing needs, particularly at the lower end of the spectrum. Recent amendments to state
law now require an assessment of the needs of extremely-low-income households, defined as those whose
annual incomes do not exceed 30% of the county median (about $29,000 for a 4-person family in 2012 –
see Table II-15). According to state housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30
percent of gross household income. Table II-8 displays recent estimates for overpayment by household
income level. This table shows that 90 percent of all lower-income renter households and 72 percent of all
lower-income owner households in Laguna Niguel were overpaying for housing. For all households in
Laguna Niguel, 52 percent of renters and 44 percent of owners were overpaying. While extremely low-
income owners appeared to suffer the greatest cost burden, with 96 percent of this category overpaying for
housing, a majority of all lower-income households, both renters and owners, were found to be overpaying
for housing. Although homeowners enjoy income and property tax deductions and other benefits that help
to compensate for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may need to defer maintenance or repairs
due to limited funds, which can lead to deterioration. For lower-income renters, severe cost burden can
require families to double up, resulting in overcrowding and related problems.

Extremely Low Income Households
State law requires quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of extremely-low-
income (ELI) households. Extremely-low-income is defined as households with income less than 30% of
area median income. According to HCD income data (see Table II-7), the area median income for Orange
County in 2012 was $85,300. For ELI households, this results in an income of $28,900 or less for a four-
person household. ELI households have a variety of housing problems and needs.
Existing Needs. Recent Census data estimated that approximately 735 ELI households resided in Laguna
Niguel (Table II-8), and of these, 88% of renter households and 96% of owner households were
overpaying. High cost burden can also lead to other problems such as overcrowding and deferred
maintenance of owner-occupied housing.
Projected Needs. The projected housing need for ELI households is assumed to be 50% of the very-low-
income regional housing need of 43 units (see Table II-24). As a result, the City has a projected need for 22
ELI units during the current planning period. The resources and programs to address this need are generally

the same as for other lower-income categories and are discussed throughout the Housing Element,
including Chapter V, the Housing Plan. Because the needs of ELI households overlap extensively with
other special needs groups, further analysis and resources for these households can be found in Section
IV.A.1.d, Zoning for Affordable Housing and Special Needs Housing, page 41.

C.      Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. The jobs available in each
employment sector and the wages for these jobs affect the type and size of housing residents can afford.
        1.        Current Employment
Current employment and projected job growth have a significant influence on housing needs during this
planning period. Recent Census estimates (Table II-9) reported that the city had a workforce of 34,233
persons, or 68 percent of the working-age population. About 5 percent of those in the labor force, in both
Laguna Niguel and the county as a whole, were unemployed.

As seen in (Table II-10), approximately 51 percent of the city’s working residents were employed in
management, business, science and arts. A significant percentage of workers (30 percent) were employed in
sales and office-related occupations. A relatively low percentage of workers (11 percent) were employed in
service-related occupations such as waiters, waitresses, and beauticians. Blue collar occupations such as
machine operators, assemblers, farming, transportation, handlers, and laborers constituted about 4 percent
of the workforce.

           2.          Projected Job Growth
Future housing needs are affected by the number and type of new jobs created during this planning period.
Table II-11 shows projected job growth by occupation for the Santa Ana-Anaheim-Irvine MSA (Orange
County) for the period 2008-2018. Total employment in Orange County is expected to grow by 8.4%
during this 10-year period. The overall growth is expected to add 135,500 new jobs and bring the total
employment in Orange County to approximately 1.75 million by 2018.

 (A) Self-Employed persons work for profit or fees in their own business, profession, trade, or farm. Only the unincorporated self-employed are
     included in this category. The estimated and projected employment numbers include all workers who are primarily self-employed and wage
     and salary workers who hold a secondary job as a self-employed worker.
 (B) Unpaid family workers are those persons who work without pay for 15 or more hours per week on a farm or in a business operated by a
     member of the household to whom they are related by birth or marriage.
 (C) Private Household Workers are employed as domestic workers whose primary activities are to maintain the household.
 Industry employment is based on the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program.

        3.      Jobs-Housing Balance
A regional balance of jobs to housing helps to ensure that the demand for housing is reasonably related to
supply. When the number of jobs significantly exceeds the housing supply, the rental and for-sale housing
markets may become overheated, requiring households to pay a larger percentage of their income for
housing. In addition, a tight housing market can result in overcrowding and longer commute times as
workers seek more affordable housing in outlying areas. The current jobs-housing objective within the
SCAG region is one new housing unit for every 1.5 jobs.3 According to SCAG’s Integrated Growth
Forecast, in 2010 there were 18,536 jobs in Laguna Niguel compared to 25,312 housing units, a
jobs/housing ratio of 0.73.
According to recent Census data, 89.3 percent of employed Laguna Niguel residents worked in Orange
County, and approximately 20 percent of all workers were employed within the city limits (Table II-12).

D.       Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the community’s housing stock and helps in
identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the number and type of housing units,
recent growth trends, age and condition, tenure, vacancy, housing costs, affordability, and assisted
affordable units at-risk of loss due to conversion to market-rate. A housing unit is defined as a house,
apartment, mobile home, or group of rooms, occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for
occupancy as separate living quarters.
         1.      Housing Type and Growth Trends
As of 2012, the housing stock in Laguna Niguel was comprised mostly of single-family homes, which
made up about 77 percent of all units, while multi-family units comprised about 23 percent of the total.
There are no mobile homes in the city. Table II-13 provides a breakdown of the housing stock by type
along with growth trends for the city compared to the county as a whole for the period 2000–2012.

          2.      Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior to 1978 before
stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed may have interior or exterior building
components coated with lead-based paint. Housing units that are more than 30 years old are the most likely
to need rehabilitation and to have lead-based paint in deteriorated condition. Table II-14 shows the age
distribution of the housing stock in Laguna Niguel compared to Orange County as a whole.

                  Source: Census 2006-2010 ACS, Table DP-4
This table shows that only about 23 percent of housing units in Laguna Niguel were constructed prior to
1980. The fact that the vast majority of the city’s housing stock is less than 30 years old suggests that there
is less need for rehabilitation than in most jurisdictions in Southern California.
Because more than three-quarters of the city housing stock was built after 1980, structural deterioration and
maintenance problems are rare. However, the goal of the City’s Code Enforcement program is to address
housing concerns before they become serious problems.
It is estimated that approximately 5 percent of the homes in the City’s older neighborhoods, typically built
in the late 1960s and early 1970s, are in need of structural repairs consisting primarily of new roofs and
window replacements. There are approximately 6,000 dwelling units in Laguna Niguel that were built prior
to 1980, therefore it is estimated that approximately 300 dwelling units may be in need of some structural
repair, which represents about 1 percent of the total housing stock in Laguna Niguel.
          3.      Housing Cost
a.        Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on the area (i.e.,
county) median income (“AMI”): extremely-low (30% or less of AMI), very-low (31%-50% of AMI), low
(51%-80% of AMI), moderate (81-120% of AMI) and above moderate (over 120% of AMI). Housing
affordability is based on the relationship between household income and housing expenses. According to
HUD and the California Department of Housing and Community Development4, housing is considered
“affordable” if the monthly payment is no more than 30% of a household’s gross income. In some areas,
such as Orange County, these income limits may be increased to adjust for high housing costs.

Table II-15 shows affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices for housing in Orange
County (including Laguna Niguel)5 by income category. Based on state-adopted standards, the maximum
affordable monthly rent (including utilities) for extremely-low-income households is $723, while the
maximum affordable rent for very-low-income households is $1,204. The maximum affordable rent for
low-income households is $1,926, while the maximum for moderate-income households is $2,559.
Maximum purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage interest rates,
qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments, homeowner association fees, property
insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the maximum home purchase prices by income category shown in
Table II-15 have been estimated based on typical conditions.

b.       For-Sale Housing
Housing sales price statistics for 2012 (Table II-16) show that the median sales prices of single-family
detached homes and condos were $636,000 and $279,000, respectively. Based on the estimated affordable
purchase prices shown in Table II-15 above, most detached homes are only affordable for above-moderate
income households but a significant proportion of condo units were affordable to moderate- and even some
lower-income residents. These data illustrate that large public subsidies are generally required to reduce
sales prices to a level that is affordable to very-low-income buyers.

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                         HOUSING
c.       Rental Housing
As described previously in the discussion of income and overpayment (Table II-8), a large proportion of
renters in Laguna Niguel fall within the lower-income categories. As a result, trends in rental rates have a
major impact on these residents. According to the apartment research firm RealFacts, rents in Orange
County reached an all-time high in 2012 with a countywide average of $1,604. In the wake of the financial
crisis of 2008-2009 average rents in Orange County declined from $1,603 in 2008 to $1,473 in early 2010,
but growing demand has allowed the market to fully recover those temporary losses. Real estate
professionals expect rents to continue rising in the near future as growing demand exceeds the pace of new
apartment construction.
When market rents are compared to the amount lower-income households can afford to pay (Table II-15), it
is clear that very-low- and extremely-low-income households have a difficult time finding housing without
overpaying. The gap between average rents and affordable rent for 4-person families at the very-low-
income level is about $400 per month, while the gap at the extremely-low-income level is $881 per month.
However, at the low-income and moderate-income levels, households are much more likely to find
affordable rentals.

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                               HOUSING
E.       Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to special circumstances.
Such circumstances may be related to one’s employment and income, family characteristics, disability, or
other conditions. As a result, some Laguna Niguel residents may experience a higher prevalence of
overpayment, overcrowding, or other housing problems.
State Housing Element law defines “special needs” groups to include persons with disabilities (including
developmental disabilities), the elderly, large households, female-headed households with children,
homeless people, and farm workers. This section contains a discussion of the housing needs facing each of
these groups.
         1.       Persons with Disabilities
The most recent available Census data reported that approximately 2,970 people between 16 and 64 years
of age, or about 7.2 percent of the working age population, reported a work-related disability (Table II-17).
Of those aged 65 and over, 941 (about 17.1 percent) reported some form of physical disability. Reported
disabilities included persons whose disability hinders their ability to go outside the home (3.8 percent of the
working age population and 16.9 percent of the senior population). Housing opportunities for the
handicapped can be maximized through housing assistance programs and providing universal design
features such as widened doorways, ramps, lowered countertops, single-level units and ground floor units.

Developmentally Disabled
As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an individual
that:
       x     Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical
             impairments;
       x     Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
       x     Is likely to continue indefinitely;
       x     Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major
             life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-
             direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-sufficiency;
       x     Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special, interdisciplinary, or
             generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance that are of lifelong or
             extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S. Administration on
Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage of the population that can be defined as
developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work
independently within a conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a
group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may
require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because
developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate
level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based services to
approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide
system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The
Regional Center of Orange County (RCOC) is one of 21 regional centers in the State of California that
provides point of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities. The RCOC is a private, non-
profit community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to
individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.
Any resident of Orange County who has a developmental disability that originated before age 18 is eligible
for services. Services are offered to people with developmental disabilities based on Individual Program
Plans and may include: Adult day programs; advocacy; assessment/consultation; behavior management
programs; diagnosis and evaluation; independent living services; infant development programs;
information and referrals; mobility training; prenatal diagnosis; residential care; respite care; physical and
occupational therapy; transportation; consumer, family vendor training; and vocational training. RCOC also
coordinates the state-mandated Early Start program, which provides services for children under age three
who have or are at substantial risk of having a developmental disability. According to the RCOC February
2010 Facts and Statistics data, the RCOC currently serves approximately 16,728 individuals. Of those, a
total of 239 individuals, 138 whom are under age 18, currently reside in Laguna Niguel according to Jack
Stanton, RCOC Chief Counselor.
The mission of the Dayle McIntosh Center is to advance the empowerment, equality, integration and full
participation of people with disabilities in the community. The Center is not a residential program, but
instead promotes the full integration of disabled persons into the community. Dayle McIntosh Center is a
consumer-driven organization serving all disabilities. Its staff and board are composed of over 50% of
people with disabilities. Its two offices service over 500,000 people in Orange County and surrounding

areas with disabilities. The Center’s South County branch is located in Laguna Hills, immediately adjacent
to Laguna Niguel.
In addition to these resources, City housing programs that respond to the needs of this population include 1-
Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing, 2-Affordable Housing Development, 3-
Conservation and Improvement of Existing Low- and Moderate-Income Housing, and 4-Promotion of
Equal Housing Opportunity.
         2.      Elderly
Recent Census Bureau estimates reported 18,428 owner-occupied households and 5,928 renter-occupied
households in Laguna Niguel where the householder was 65 or older (Table II-18). Many elderly persons
are dependent on fixed incomes or have disabilities. Elderly homeowners may be physically unable to
maintain their homes or cope with living alone. The housing needs of this group can be addressed through
smaller units, second units on lots with existing homes, shared living arrangements, congregate housing,
and housing assistance programs.

         3.      Large Households
Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as those with five or
more members. Recent Census estimates show that approximately 57 percent of owner households and 64
percent of renter households in Laguna Niguel have only one or two members. About 9 percent of renter
households had five or more members, while about 8 percent of owners were large households (Table II-
19). This distribution indicates that the need for large units with four or more bedrooms is expected to be
significantly less than for smaller units.

        4.        Female-Headed Households
Recent Census estimates reported that 7 percent of owner households and 17 percent of renter households
in the city were headed by a female (Table II-20). While female-headed households represent a small
portion of households, they are likely to have housing problems such as overpayment or overcrowding.
City programs to facilitate new affordable housing development and conservation of existing affordable
homes help to serve the needs of single-parent households with low- and moderate-incomes.

        5.        Farm Workers
Farm workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary income is from seasonal agricultural
work. Historically, Orange County’s economy was linked to agriculture. Today, Orange County is a mostly
developed urban/suburban region, with a strong local economy that is not tied to an agricultural base.
While there are still significant active farming areas on the Irvine Ranch to the north and Rancho Mission
Viejo to the southeast, shifts in the county’s economy to manufacturing, technology, and service-oriented
sectors have significantly curtailed agricultural production. Recent Census6 estimates reported that 91
persons living in Laguna Niguel were employed in agricultural occupations. This total includes all
occupations, including profession and managerial categories. Since there are no significant agricultural
operations within Laguna Niguel, the need for permanent farmworker housing is of less concern than in
other areas where large-scale agricultural operations exist. The needs of lower-income agricultural workers

who are permanent residents are addressed through a variety of affordable housing programs that serve the
needs of all lower-income persons and are not restricted only to farmworkers.
          6.      Homeless Persons
Throughout the country, homelessness is a serious problem. Factors contributing to homelessness include:
the general lack of emergency shelters and transitional housing, housing affordable to lower-income
persons; an increasing number of persons whose incomes fall below the poverty level; reductions in public
assistance for the poor; and the de-institutionalization of the mentally ill.
To estimate the number of homeless in the city an analysis of existing studies/estimates was utilized and
different organizations and agencies were consulted. The County of Orange Housing and Community
Services Department undertakes a biannual “Point-in-Time” survey of the homeless population as part of
its application for homeless assistance grant funds to HUD. The most recent Point-in-Time survey for
which results are available (January 2011) estimated that there were approximately 6,939 homeless persons
at the time of the survey, of which 2,667 were sheltered and 4,272 were unsheltered7. While the survey did
not estimate the total homeless population by jurisdiction, the survey did ask respondents where they lived
just prior to becoming homeless. Of the 610 survey respondents, 4 (0.7%) reported Laguna Niguel as their
last city of residence.
By the very nature of homelessness, it is difficult to determine the location of homeless persons. Based on
field observations, law enforcement personnel reported that there are no locations in the City where the
homeless congregate, but individuals are occasionally seen passing through. Regardless of what
methodology is used for estimating the location of the homeless, this is a regional issue and the City will
continue to work cooperatively with the County and other agencies to address it from a regional
perspective.
Senate Bill (SB) 2 of 2007 requires that jurisdictions quantify the need for emergency shelter and determine
whether existing facilities are adequate to serve the need. An emergency shelter is defined as “housing with
minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or less by a
homeless person. No individual or household may be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to
pay.” If adequate existing facilities are not available, the law requires jurisdictions to identify areas where
new facilities are permitted “by-right” (i.e., without requiring discretionary approval such as a use permit).
A jurisdiction could also satisfy its shelter needs through a multi-jurisdictional agreement with up to two
adjacent communities to develop at least one year-round shelter within two years of the beginning of the
planning period. As noted in Chapter IV the City allows emergency shelters in compliance with SB 2.
Inventory of Emergency Shelters and Transitional Housing Facilities
Local facilities that are available to serve the needs of homeless persons and families in Laguna Niguel are
discussed below.
       x      Emergency Shelters – Emergency shelters are generally geared toward providing immediate
              housing to persons without shelter. Stays in emergency shelters are typically limited to a short
              period of time (1 to 90 days). Several service agencies located near Laguna Niguel provide
              emergency shelter and services for the homeless in south Orange County. These shelters and
              services are identified in Table II-21. The number of beds listed represents total shelter
              capacity – none of the shelter beds are restricted for persons from Laguna Niguel. Based on
              this data, there are approximately 130 emergency shelter beds available to serve homeless
              persons who may be in Laguna Niguel.

F.         Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
This section identifies all residential projects in the city that are under an affordability restriction, along
with those housing projects that are at risk of losing their low-income affordability restrictions within the
ten-year period 2013 to 2023. This information is used in establishing quantified objectives for units that
can be conserved during this planning period. The inventory of assisted units includes all units that have
been assisted under any federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), state, local and/or
other program.
           1.        Inventory of Assisted Units
Assisted projects in Laguna Niguel are shown in Table II-23. The table shows that of the three assisted
projects in the city, two are eligible to convert to market rate within the 2013-2023 timeframe.

           2.        Units at Risk
According to the California Housing Partnership and the City’s analysis, there are two assisted projects that
are at-risk during 2013-2023 in Laguna Niguel. In general, there are three actions that can result in the
conversion of public-assisted units:
        1.      Prepayment of HUD mortgages:
                a.      Section 221(d)(3) or (4)M – property owner receives either below-market interest rate or
                        market interest rate loans from HUD with a rental subsidy for tenants as well. The
                        program also allows for long-term mortgages (up to 40 years) that can be financed with
                        Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) Mortgage Backed Securities.
                b.      Section 236 – property owner receives financial assistance from HUD to pay interest
                        costs, thereby reducing tenant rental costs. Rental subsidies may also be provided to the
                        tenants.
                c.      Section 223(a)(7) – property owner is provided funds to refinance existing debt and to
                        complete necessary repairs, resulting in lower debt service and improved mortgage
                        security. It is available only to mortgages currently insured by FHA.
                d.      Section 202 – non-profit property owner receives a loan from HUD to pay for
                        development costs with a rental subsidy for senior tenants.
                e       Section 811 – property owner receives financial assistance from HUD to pay for
                        development costs of units for special needs.
August 20, 2013                                                                                                      25

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                            HOUSING
       2.     Expiration/opt-out of project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts
              The Section 8/Housing Voucher Choice Program provides rental subsidies to the property
              owner of a pre-qualified project. The financial assistance pays the difference between the
              tenant’s ability to pay and the contract rent.
              An opt-out may occur if the property owner decides to pre-pay the balance of the HUD
              mortgage. During this process, HUD may offer incentives to the property owner. Such
              incentives range from refinancing the mortgage at a lower interest rate to establishing higher
              rents. If at any point during this process the property owner fails to complete a HUD-required
              step, the Section 8 contract automatically rolls over for another 5-year period.
       3.     Other
              Expiration of other affordability periods may occur when utilizing the following funding
              sources:
                   a.       Low-income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC)
                   b.       Bond financing
                   c.       Density bonuses
                   d.       California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA)
                   e.       Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
                   f.       HOME Program
At-Risk Status
Two assisted properties, representing 156 lower-income rental units, are at risk of conversion as identified
in Table II-23 above. Financial assistance mandates affordable income restrictions and occupancy that will
expire on the date shown.
       x       Alicia Park Apartments and Village La Paz – The use restrictions for Alicia Park Apartments
               and Village La Paz are a result of HUD-issued, Project Specific Section 8 Contracts that were
               executed at the time the original FHA mortgages were originated. The purpose of the Project
               Specific Section 8 contract is to ensure that the project’s units remain affordable to qualified,
               low-income tenants for the life of the contract, which is offered at 15- to 20-year terms, and
               require renewal every 5 years thereafter.
              If the owners of Alicia Park Apartments and Village La Paz choose to opt-out of their Section
              8 contracts, it would represent a loss of 156 units of affordable rental housing, a significant
              decrease in Laguna Niguel’s available pool of affordable housing units.
The projects that are at risk of conversion contain a significant number of 3- and 4-bedroom units.
Therefore, loss of any large family units as well as the 1- and 2-bedroom affordable units would likely
affect the already burdened low-income rental population.
Cost Analysis
The primary factors used to analyze the cost of preserving low-income housing include:
       1.     Acquisition costs – depends on size, location, current sales figures.
       2.     Rehabilitation costs – average cost to rehabilitate - $40,000 (based on data compiled by the
              State Department of Housing and Community Development’s Multifamily Housing Programs).
       3.     New construction costs – depends on size, construction materials, financing costs, and off- and
              on-site improvements.
August 20, 2013                                                                                              26

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                          HOUSING
      4.     Rental assistance – depends on the income of the household and Fair Market rents. As of
             March, 2012, Fair Market rents for Orange County are as follows:
             x      Efficiency - $1,126
             x      1-bedroom - $1,294
             x      2-bedroom - $1,621
             x      3-bedroom - $2,268
             x      4-bedroom - $2,525
As shown previously in Table II-15, a very-low-income household of four persons earning 50% of median
income ($48,150) can afford to pay $1,204 per month (including a utility allowance) for housing. This
would require a monthly rental subsidy of $417, or $5,004 per year for a 2-bedroom unit. Therefore if
affordability covenants were to expire on all of the 156 units in the at-risk projects, a total cost of
approximately $780,000 per year would be required in order to provide rental housing at comparable
affordability levels.
Preservation Resources
Efforts by the City to retain the at-risk housing units must draw upon basic resources as follows:
      x      Organizational Resources - The following local agencies are potential organizations with
             experience and capacity to assist in the preservation of at-risk units:
              a.     Orange County Community Housing Corp. (Santa Ana)
              b.     Jamboree Housing Corp (Irvine)
              c.     Mary Erickson Foundation (San Clemente)
              d.     National Community Renaissance of California (Rancho Cucamonga)
      x      Financial Resources – The following is a list of potential financial resources to be considered
             as part of the City’s overall financial plan to retain affordable housing units. The City of
             Laguna Niguel does not have a Redevelopment Agency.
             a.     Community Development Block Grant – The City currently receives approximately
                    $232,000 in CDBG funds from HUD annually.
             b.     Orange County Housing & Community Development Department – The County receives
                    annual funding from HUD to administer the Section 8 Housing Voucher Choice Program
                    and the HOME Program.
             c.     Affordable Housing Clearinghouse – serves a mortgage brokerage that specializes in
                    financing affordable housing projects.

The western edge of the city is within the Coastal Zone. Government Code Section 65590 et seq. prohibits
conversion or demolition of existing residential dwelling units occupied by low- or moderate-income
persons or families unless provision has been made for the replacement in the same city or county of those
dwelling units with units for persons and families of low- or moderate-income (excludes structures with
less than 3 units, or less than 10 units for projects with more than one structure, among other exclusions).
Section 65590(d) further requires new housing development in the coastal zone to provide housing units for
persons and families of low or moderate income, or if not feasible, to provide such units at another location
within the same city or county, within the coastal zone or within three miles thereof.
Prior to the incorporation of Laguna Niguel in 1989, 727 housing units were permitted by the County
within the portion of the Coastal Zone that is now part of the City. One apartment project, Seaview
Summit, was built prior to incorporation and included 48 deed-restricted lower-income units. The
affordability covenants on those units subsequently expired and the units converted to market rate. A small
number of new single-family infill homes have been built but no residential units have been demolished or
converted within the Coastal Zone since City incorporation in 1989.
H.       Future Growth Needs
         1.       Overview of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is a key tool for local governments to plan for
anticipated growth. The RHNA quantifies the anticipated need for housing within each jurisdiction for the
projection period from January 2014 to October 2021. Communities then determine how they will address
this need through the process of updating the Housing Elements of their General Plans.
The current RHNA was adopted by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) in
October 2012. The future need for housing is determined primarily by the forecasted growth in households
in a community. Each new household, created by a child moving out of a parent's home, by a family
moving to a community for employment, and so forth, creates the need for a housing unit. The housing
need for new households is then adjusted to maintain a desirable level of vacancy to promote housing
choice and mobility. An adjustment is also made to account for units expected to be lost due to demolition,
natural disaster, or conversion to non-housing uses. The sum of these factors – household growth, vacancy
need, and replacement need – determines the construction need for a community. Total housing need is
then distributed among four income categories on the basis of the county’s income distribution, with
adjustments to avoid an over-concentration of lower-income households in any community.
         2.       2014-2021 Laguna Niguel Growth Needs
In October 2012 SCAG adopted the final RHNA growth needs for each of the County’s cities plus the
unincorporated area. The total housing growth need for the City of Laguna Niguel during the 2014-2021
planning period is 182 units. This total is distributed by income category as shown in Table II-24. While
not explicitly addressed in the RHNA, state law8 now requires the Housing Element to estimate the future
needs of extremely-low-income (ELI) households. Pursuant to state law, the ELI need is estimated to be
50% of the very-low category, or 22 units during this planning period.

LAND USE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element establishes goals, policies and actions that give direction to land use
development in Laguna Niguel. It is through the realization of the goals, policies and
corresponding implementation actions that the future land use pattern of Laguna Niguel will
continue to be shaped. In addition, the goals and policies in the Land Use Element will affect
numerous issues in the other General Plan Elements, including those concerned with housing,
open space and conservation, public facilities, growth management, public safety and noise.
The Land Use Element promotes the achievement of goals by establishing clearly defined
policies that guide future land uses in the City. The Element describes these land use policies
through the use of narrative text, tables and maps. The most important of these maps is the Land
Use Element Map. This Map delineates the location of future land uses in the City as a
framework for future land use planning and decision making in the City.
  A. The Planning Framework
        An essential part of the formulation of a General Plan for a community is to clearly
        understand the unique character of the community. What are the elements that make a
        community a desirable place to live? What attracted the residents of Laguna Niguel to
        live here? Those factors which have contributed most significantly to the shaping of
        Laguna Niguel and serve as the basis for the Land Use Element include the land use
        patterns, the open space system, and the circulation system.
        1.      Land Use Pattern
                Laguna Niguel is predominately a detached single family residential community
                although opportunities for attached single family and multiple family housing
                exist throughout the City. The City does not have a dominant “Downtown” area.
                Its retail needs are served by several commercial areas such as the Town Center,
                Plaza de la Paz, Ocean Ranch and the Rancho Niguel Center. In addition, there
                are several other distinct commercial “opportunity areas” such as the Country
                Village Area and the Camino Capistrano Area in the northwestern portion of the

THE CITY OF LA GUNA NIGUEL                                                             LAND USE
              It is a high priority to develop the remaining commercial areas with a mixed use
               character and an emphasis on pedestrian circulation and amenities such as
              landscaped plazas, walkways, and distinctive street furniture.
       2.      Open Space Management System
              The abundance of open space resources is one of the most outstanding
              characteristics of the City of Laguna Niguel. Over one third of the total land area
              within the City is devoted to Open Space and Recreation Areas. If the surrounding
              area outside the City limits including Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park and
              the Salt Creek Regional Park, Aliso Creek Greenbelt, and other County open
              space areas are considered, the City has access to over 5,000 acres of open space.
              The Salt Creek Regional Park provides a continuous open space system and trail
              connections through the City of Dana Point to the coast. These open space
              opportunities provide Laguna Niguel residents with a unique living environment.
              The General Plan policies stress that the Open Space System should be
              maintained and enhanced in order to reinforce the exceptional open space
              character of the City. The Open Space/Parks/Conservation Element articulates the
              open space and recreational resources of Laguna Niguel.
       3.     Circulation System
              Most of the major circulation system for Laguna Niguel has been established and
              is now in place. The proposed San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor and the
              extension of Alicia Parkway will complete the basic structure. Some circulation
              improvements are, however, needed in the Camino Capistrano area.
              Future improvements of Moulton Parkway/Golden Lantern corridor, are also
              anticipated. The General Plan includes consideration of the necessary portions of
              these projects in determining the impacts of existing and proposed land uses on
              the circulation system. The expansion and development of non-vehicular modes
              of circulation including the potential for a commuter rail station, completion of
              sidewalks on arterials, a system of bicycle trails, and on-street bicycle facilities
              for the community are also important aspects of the City’s future circulation
              system.
B.     Vision

THE CITY OF LA GUNA NIGUEL                                                               LAND USE
       The challenge of the General Plan is to establish clear and sustainable direction. General
       Plans can fail in this respect because of their singularly physical orientation, complexity
       and detachment from the real process of decision making once the surge of effort to
       prepare and adopt them has been expanded. This vision statement is intended to
       document the rationale for the new City’s General Plan in order to facilitate its
       implementation.
       Given this planning context, a statement of the most important dimensions of community
       character to be preserved or achieved as development occurs, is essential. That is the
       Community Vision. The purpose of this Vision Statement is to declare a commitment to a
       quality of living that substantially exceeds what would otherwise occur. It provides a
       foundation for the Laguna Niguel General Plan. It will enable future community leaders
       and citizens to recall and endorse the meaning of the Plan and maintain diligence in
       carrying out its intent.
       1.      A Vision of Laguna Niguel
               Laguna Niguel’s overall vision includes the following goals:
               •       A high quality suburban community that has excellent schools and
                       extensive park and recreational opportunities.
               •       An attractive, safe, and comfortable place to live.
               •       An effective traffic circulation system within the city and convenient
                       access to other areas of the County.
               •       High levels of public services for its residents.
               •       A balance of residential and employment opportunities.
               •       A comprehensive system of open spaces linked by hiking, equestrian and
                       bicycle trails.
C.     Consistency With State Planning Law
       Government Code Section 65302(a) states that the General Plan shall include       “. . .a Land
       Use Element which designates the proposed general distribution and general location and

THE CITY OF LA GUNA NIGUEL                                                              LAND USE
D.     Scope
       The Land Use Element consists of five sections. Section II provides a discussion of
       different plans and programs that are related to the management of land uses in the City.
       Section III presents the Land Use Plan for the City. This section discusses the land use
       planning process. It also provides a discussion of the General Plan land use designations.
       Section 1V presents the goals, policies and implementation actions that will guide land
       use decisions in the City. Section V provides a Citywide, Profile Area and Sub profile
       Area analysis of the City. This analysis includes land use statistical summaries of each of
       the Profile Areas and specifics land use intensity.
THE CITY OF LA GUNA NIGUEL                                                            LAND USE
II.    RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
       A.      Local Coastal Program
              Laguna Niguel’s Local Coastal Program (LCP) is comprised of two Orange
               County adopted Local Coastal Programs, the South Laguna Specific Plan and the
              Aliso Creek Specific Plan. Presently, Laguna Niguel’s corporate boundaries
              include portions of these two specific plans. Additionally, the Aliso Creek
               Specific Plan incorporates by reference policies from the County Village Planned
              Community and the Laguna Niguel Planned Community for the portions of
              these two planned communities that are located within the coastal zone. Figure
              LU-i depicts the Coastal Zone boundary        within the City.
              After incorporation, the City requested that the California Coastal Commission
              certify those applicable portions of the previously certified South Laguna and
              Aliso Creek Specific Plans/Local Coastal Programs, as a single City Local
              Coastal Program. No changes to the policies, land use designations,
              implementation actions or maps of the previously certified the LCP’s occurred.
               On November 14, 1990, the California Coastal Commission certified the Laguna
              Niguel Local Coastal Program.
              The Local Coastal Program includes required components and issue areas which
              relate to the subjects of several different General Plan Elements; therefore,
              components of the LCP are distributed among various elements of the General
              Plan and are individually discussed within the applicable plan element.
       B.     Planned Communities/Specific Plans
              The City of Laguna Niguel is largely comprised of several master Planned
              Communities (PC) and Specific Plan areas that were approved by the County of
              Orange over the last twenty years, prior to the City’s incorporation in December
              of 1989. These Planned Communities are the Laguna Niguel PC, Country Village
              PC, Colinas de Capistrano PC, South Laguna Specific Plan, Beacon Hill PC, Bear
              Brand Hill PC, Bear Brand PC, and the Narland Business Center PC. Each of the

THE CITY OF LA GUNA NIGUEL                                                                LAND USE
       C.      City of Laguna Niguel Zoning Code
              The City of Laguna Niguel has adopted portions of the County of Orange Zoning
               Code as an interim means to regulate land uses that are not within a planned
               community area and to address standards not included in the planned community
              texts. The City will adopt its own Zoning Ordinance subsequent to the adoption of
              the General Plan. The City Zoning Map will be consistent with City’s General
              Plan and Land Use Policy Map. Together, the Zoning Ordinance and the Zoning
              Map will identify specific types of land use, intensity of use and development
               standards applicable to specific areas and parcels of land within the City.
       D.      Orange County 1992 Projections
              In 1979 the Orange County Board of Supervisors placed the responsibility for the
              development and dissemination of demographic projections with the County
              Administrative Office. Since the Board’s action, there have been five iterations of
               a countywide forecast; Orange County Preferred (OCP)-88 is the most recent
              update of the series. The 1990 Census, new legal mandates and changing
               socioeconomic conditions require that another update be prepared. The County is
              currently in process of updating the countywide 1992 Projections.
              The County’s planning efforts, as well as recently enacted congestion
              management, air quality management, integrated waste management and growth
              management requirements and a wide array of on-going local and regional
              planning efforts have placed added importance on the need for accurate and
              consistent data projections to be utilized by all agencies.
              The County has proposed a process to update the 1992 Projections that
               emphasizes the need to intensify the level of input from cities in all aspects of
              data development. The data generated from the City will have to be approved by
               city managers and/or City Councils prior to consideration by the County Board of
               Supervisors. This mandated approval reflects an increased level of commitment
               and will ensure consistency in the use of demographic projections at the regional
               and sub-regional levels.
       E.     Regional/Planning Programs
              The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is the agency

THE CITY OF LA GUNA NIGUEL                                                             LAND USE
               The adopted growth forecast policies become the basis for SCAG’s functional
              plans (transportation, housing, air quality and growth management) for the region.
               The population totals and growth distribution are used in planning the future
               capacity of highways and transit systems, quantity and locations of housing, water
               supply systems, and siting and sizing of sewage treatment systems.

III. LAND USE PLAN
   A. The Land Use Planning Process
       The planning process involved the early development of a vision statement that captured
       the desired character of the community. This led to an assessment of development
       choices available to the City, given its extent of development and the inclusion of most of
       the remaining residential development areas in development agreements inherited from
       the County of Orange. Three areas within Laguna Niguel were identified to have
       development potential to implement the goals of the City. These areas were identified as
       “opportunity areas”, meaning areas within which further development or intensification
       were either imminent or desirable and which could benefit from focused policy direction
       in the General Plan.
       The General Plan alternative land use process focused primarily on a series of land use
       alternatives for the three opportunity areas: Country Village/Narland Business Center,
       Camino Capistrano/Cabot Road Business Area and the Town Center Area. Figure LU-2
       shows the three opportunity areas. Each one offers special economic and community
       development opportunities. The alternatives for each opportunity area were formulated in
       response to the values and goals established in the City’s Vision Statement, through input
       from the City officials and advisory commissions/committees and from public comments
       at numerous community forums.
       The alternative analysis examined opportunities that were available through the
       development of vacant land and/or through the intensification of existing uses. Both
       alternative land uses and different development intensities were proposed for each
       opportunity area. An analysis of the market potentials for retail and service commercial;
       office; business park, industrial and visitor serving uses was conducted in order to
       calibrate approximate acreage limits considered practicable in light of competing
       economic development in South Orange County. The types of alternatives ranged from
       high intensity industrial and business parks, to high intensity commercial-retail, and to
       mixed use-business, retail and multifamily residential development. The land use acreage
       and development potentials proposed for each alternative served as the basis for fiscal,
       traffic, and infrastructure demand analysis and environmental documentation. This
       information provided the criteria for selecting the preferred land use concept for the City.
       Based on the input and recommendations from the City Council, Planning Commission,

THE CITY OF LA GUNA NIGUEL                                                          LAND USE
       Country Village/Narland Business Center
       The Country Village/Narland Business Center area will continue to be the largest
       business, commercial and retail center in the City. The opportunity area is designated for
       Community Commercial, Professional Office, Industrial/Business Park and
       Public/Institutional uses. The Country Village Planning Area A-i parcel is designated
       Community Commercial and Professional Office. It is anticipated that 1,272,900 square
       feet of Community Commercial and Professional Offices uses could be developed. The
       plan encourages the development of plazas and other pedestrian gathering areas. The
       General Plan also projects a 300,000 square foot expansion on the Chet Holifield
       Property. The plan also reflects the expansion of the Birtcher Business Center and the
       Aliso Village Center. It is projected that an additional 2,233,410 square feet of
       Community Commercial and Professional Office uses can be developed within the
       opportunity area.
       Camino Capistrano/Cabot Road Business Area
       The Camino Capistrano/Cabot Road Business Area (also referred to as the Laguna Niguel
       Gateway Area) is located in the northeastern corner of the City. The Laguna
       Niguel/Mission Viejo Metrolink transit station, constructed in 2002 at the south end of
       Forbes Road, provides commuter rail service to the area.
       The Laguna Niguel Gateway Specific Plan was originally adopted in 1999, and the area
       was designated for Community Commercial, Professional Office, Industrial/Business
       Park and Public/Institutional uses, consistent with the trend at that time toward
       commercial development.
       In November 2011, the Gateway Specific Plan was updated to add the Residential
       Attached land use designation, based on market demands and trends toward high-density,
       transit-oriented, residential and mixed-use development. A total of 2,994 attached
       dwelling units and a total of 2.26 million square feet of non-residential development are
       projected for the Gateway Area.
       A number of improvements have been proposed to enhance circulation within the
       opportunity area. The Gateway Specific Plan includes plans for the widening of Crown
       Valley Parkway to eight through lanes, from Greenfield to 1-5, as well as related
       intersection improvements at both Forbes and Cabot Roads. In addition, a roadway
       connection has been considered from Camino Capistrano to Cabot Road, just north of
       Laguna Niguel in the City of Mission Viejo.
THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                  LAND USE
       redeveloped with public uses such as Laguna Niguel City Hall. The Crown Valley
       Branch Library and Fire Station #5 will remain in the Civic Center area.
B.     Land Use Designations
       The ten land use designations shown on the Land Use Element Map (Figure LU-3)
       provide for a broad range of land uses. The designations are intended to be broadly
       defined to provide for future flexibility and options in site specific land use planning. The
       government code requires a clear and concise description of the land use categories
       shown on the Land Use Element Map.
       The land use designations describe the various types of planned or future land uses within
       the City of Laguna Niguel. These designations are classified under general categories of
       residential, commercial, industrial, open space and community facilities.
       These designations are further defined by specific purpose and function. Additionally,
       they are described in terms of the character and intensity of desired development within
       each designation.
       The number of designations may be expanded or reduced by combining them where
       appropriate. The categories are identified based upon similar designations in the existing
       planned communities.

       In certain situations special areas within the land use designations may be described in
       greater detail or have special characteristic or requirements. The zoning districts to be
       established in the future must be consistent with the Land Use Categories. Customized
       zoning districts (such as specific plans) may be needed to provide the needed regulations
       for such areas.
       Residential Detached: The Single Family Detached designation is applied to areas
       characterized by one single family dwelling constructed on each individual subdivided lot
       or legal building site.
       Residential Attached: The Residential Attached designation is applied to townhomes,
       apartments, and condominium projects. These areas are characterized by attached
       dwelling units constructed on individual lots.
       Residential Reserve: The Residential Reserve designation indicates that an area is
       reserved for future residential use, however, the character (attached vs. detached) and
       intensity of residential use will be determined as a result of discretionary action taken on
       the specific residential project. A General Plan Amendment shall be processed
       concurrently with residential projects located within this land use designation. The
       purpose of the General Plan Amendment is to replace the Residential Reserve designation
       with a specific land use designation and intensity limitation established as a result of the
       discretionary action taken on each specific residential project
       Neighborhood Commercial: The Neighborhood Commercial designation is applied to
       commercial center uses that are intended to provide daily convenience goods and services
       at the neighborhood scale. A typical neighborhood commercial center will consist of
       several small retail uses and/or personal services uses. Neighborhood Commercial
       Centers are generally between one and ten acres. Typical uses are described on Table
       LU-i.
       Community Commercial: The Community Commercial designation is applied to
       commercial centers with uses intended to serve the entire community. Community
       Commercial centers are larger planned shopping complexes which provide for a broader
       range of goods and services, and serve a greater trade area than neighborhood centers.
       Typical uses with the Community Commercial designation are described on Table LU-i.
       Professional Office: The Professional Office designation provides for professional
       offices, corporate headquarters, research and development, and administrative offices. It
       is intended to provide for office uses, and supporting limited retail uses.
THE CITY OF LA GUNA NIGUEL                                                                LAND USE
       IndustrialtBusiness Park: The Industrial/Business Park designation provides for the
       development of a variety of compatible light manufacturing, wholesaling and office uses
       supportive of a contemporary business center environment. Typical uses permitted under
       this designation are described on Table LU-i.
       Public/Institutional: The Public/Institutional designation includes a wide range of
       public, quasi-public and special purpose private facilities that are aimed at providing a
       variety of governmental or social services to the community. Typical land uses in the
       Public/Institutional designation are indicated in Table LU-i.
       Parks and Recreation: Areas designated Parks and Recreation are intended for active
       recreational uses and activities within open space areas. Such uses include: ball-fields and
       other playing fields; parks; activity and playgrounds; and community and neighborhood
       recreational facilities. Passive recreational activities may also be included as an ancillary
       part of the recreation complex. In selected situations, cultural facilities such as theaters,
       museums or other similar specialized uses with a recreational value may fit with this
       designation.
       Open Space: Areas designated Open Space are primarily intended for passive
       recreation, or visual enhancement or resource conservation uses. Such uses would
       include; conservation of a natural resource area, natural hillsides, and landscaped slopes
       or buffers and trails. Active sports or other organized recreational activities are not
       encouraged in these areas.
       The Open Space Designation includes those areas of the community that are primarily
       open and unimproved, except for recreational, or other public use, such as bike trails,
       view areas, benches, pedestrian trails and picnic tables, etc.
       Typical Uses Permitted in the Land Use Designations
       Table LU-i describes the typical land uses that may be permitted in the development
       oriented land use designations. This table is not intended to be all inclusive. Detailed
       listing of permitted and prohibited land uses will be provided as a part of subsequent
       zoning regulations that will be prepared by the City following the adoption of the General
       Plan.
       Senior Housing/Congregate Care/Managed Care: These types of uses which provide
       varying levels of care to senior citizens are unique because they include both residential
       and commercial land use characteristics. Although, a specific land use designation has

THE CITY OF LA GUNA NIGUEL                                                                LAND USE
C.     Land Use Element Map
       The Land Use Element Map for Laguna Niguel Summarizes the land use patterns which
       are now considered to best facilitate achievements of the community vision. The map
       establishes general locations and relationships of land uses, placed in the context of the
       circulation system. The land use map is a graphic expression of the land use policy of a
       city. While this generalized approach allows for some flexibility in interpretation, the
       Land Use Element Map and the policy language in the Land Use Element are both
       required to make a judgment on the consistency of public or private development
       proposals with the General Plan. The Map should be viewed as the framework for future
       land use decisions, while the policies and implementing actions provide guidance on how
       particular land used should be interpreted, tailored and applied as development decisions
       are required. A number of implementation measures and tools such as zoning and
       subdivision ordinances, building codes and capital improvement programs will be used to
       realize the goals and policies established in this Element. It is important to recognize that
       planning is a dynamic process. If and when community goals change, it may become
       necessary to amend the land use plan and map to further the community’s interest.
       The Land Use Element Map is more than a representation of the policies established
       through this General Plan. It also defines the interrelationship of land uses that will
       contribute to accomplishing many of the social, economic, and environmental goals of
       the General Plan. By careful adherence to the patterns established, a viable community
       with a quality living environment and a desirable physical character will be sustained.
       The realization of the plan will depend on the creation of well-conceived and
       comprehensive implementation tools and the continuing support and vision of the
       community’s decision-makers. This latter point is critical because a key part of the City’s
       planning and development program is the establishment of its own land use regulations
       and related tools which will allow for a more straightforward and understandable land use
       administration than would a continuation of the complicated system used under previous
       County jurisdiction.
D.     Future Land Use Distribution
       A site by site analysis was conducted to determine the amount of additional development
       that is available in the City. This information was calibrated to determine future
       economic and traffic conditions in Laguna Niguel. Table LU-2 indicates the additional
       amount (number of residential units and amount of commercial square footage) and types
       of land uses that are allowed in each profile area. Table LU-3 indicates the total land use

IV.    LAND USE GOALS, POLICIES AND ACTIONS
Goal 1        A well-balanced mixture of land uses that meet the residential, commercial
              open space and public service needs of residents.
Intent        A well-balanced community provides a broad range of land uses that are planned
              in desirable patterns and intensities. By providing for balanced mixture of land
              uses, the City can achieve a suitable inventory of housing to meet the needs of
              different income groups, a viable commercial and employment base, ample open
              space and recreational opportunities and adequate public facilities and services.
              The existing mix of land uses in Laguna Niguel were largely shaped before
              incorporation. The City consists predominantly of residential and open space uses.
              Commercial, industrial and community facility land uses account for a relatively
              small portion of the total land area. By providing a more balanced mixture of land
              uses, the City can increase its overall quality of life and economic base.
       Policy 1.1     Encourage the development of land uses that contribute to the goal of a
                      well-balanced community.
              Actions
              1.1.1   Require comprehensive analysis of any proposed General Plan
                      Amendment to ensure that the amendment will result in a desirable
                      mixture of land uses meeting the social and fiscal needs of the City and its
                      residents.
              1.1.2   Promote commercial, office, industrial, and/or high-density residential
                      uses, as appropriate, within the three opportunity areas in order to improve
                      the City’s land use balance.
Goal 2        A sufficient amount of commercial and industrial uses which provide jobs
              and revenue to the City without compromising environmental quality.

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                              LAND USE
                      with new commercial or industrial development must be adequately
                      mitigated to help preserve the high quality environment in Laguna Niguel.
       Policy 2.1     Allow a wide range of uses in the City that will be beneficial in terms of
                      employment and revenue generation, but without undue impacts on public
                      services and facilities.
              Actions
              2.1.1 Continue the site plan review process to ensure that adequate public
                      services and facilities are provided for in commercial and industrial
                      development.
              2.1.2   Work closely with organizations and interests involved with economic
                      development to attract businesses that contribute positively to the City’s
                      economic growth and environmental well being
       Policy 2.2     Enhance the quality and competitive advantage of commercial centers and
                      business parks within the City.
              Actions
              2.2.1 Consider the adoption of commercial design standards to ensure that high
                      quality commercial centers and business parks are developed in the City.
              2.2.2   Incorporate landscaping requirements for commercial development
                      into community design guidelines.
Goal 3        Compatible relationships between land uses in the community.
Intent        Most of the residential uses in Laguna Niguel are concentrated in well-defined
              areas linked together by parks, greenbelts and curvilinear landscaped streets. Most
              of the commercial and business uses in the City are situated within a number of
              neighborhood and community commercial centers. Future residential,
              commercial, and mixed-use development should be compatible with existing land
              uses and should reflect high quality site planning and design.
       Policy 3.1     Ensure that effective buffers between residential and non-residential uses

THE CITY OF LA GUNA NIGUEL                                                               LAND USE
       Policy 3.3      Reduce land use conflicts between residential and non-residential uses.
              Actions
              3.3.1 Enact design guidelines to ensure that neighborhood commercial areas are
                       compatible with adjacent residential areas.
              3.3.2    Evaluate the impacts on surrounding land uses when reviewing proposals
                       for new development.
              3.3.3    Develop compatibility guidelines         and  procedures   for   effectively
                       evaluating development projects.
              3.3.4    Adopt site development standards which mitigate land use conflicts.
              3.3.5    Enact development standards and design guidelines to ensure land uses
                       within a mixed-use project complement one another.
       Policy 3.4      Ensure that residential densities are compatible with the surrounding land
                       uses and buildings are in scale with the neighborhood character.
Goal 4        Urban design that provides community gathering areas and other pedestrian
               spaces.
Intent        Laguna Niguel desires to have attractive urban design reflected in development
              projects which also contribute to more efficient and productive use of land.
              Additionally, we wish to have pedestrian gathering areas and spaces which
              promote social interaction, improved business patronage and greater civic
              identity.
               Policy 4.1      Emphasize attractive and functional urban design in new
                       development.
              Action
              4.1.1 Prepare comprehensive design guidelines, to guide new development,
                       especially in commercial and industrial areas.
THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                               LAND USE
       Policy 4.3     Require, where feasible, the development of open spaces and places for
                      people to gather within commercial and office complexes.
       Policy 4.4     Provide, where feasible, pedestrian walkways and linkages between
                      residential, commercial, office, open space/recreation facilities and other
                      public places.
              Action
              4.4.1 Prepare and implement pedestrian access design                guidelines  for
                      implementation in the development review process.
Goal 5        Preservation and enhancement of the natural setting of the City.
Intent        Over one-third of the land area in Laguna Niguel is devoted to open space. A
              combination of parks, greenbelts, landscaped slopes, undeveloped hillsides, and
              sensitive open space corridors are provided throughout the City. It is this
              significant amount of open space in Laguna Niguel that establishes the open space
              character of the City. Residents desire to maintain and preserve the high quality
              open space areas in Laguna Niguel.
       Policy 5.1     Preserve existing sensitive open space areas within the City.
              Actions
              5.1.1 Establish a Conservation zoning designation over designated sensitive
                      open space areas.
              5.1.2   Ensure that land uses within designated and proposed scenic corridors are
                      compatible with scenic enhancement and preservation.
       Policy 5.2     Ensure that adequate recreational and open space areas are provided.
              Actions
              5.2.1 Pursue development of active parks in the Galivan Basin.
              5.2.2   Pursue development of active and passive parks on proposed sites the
                      Capistrano Unified School District does not plan to develop.
THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                               LAND USE
Goal 6        Enhanced community identity for residents, visitors and commuters.
Intent        Laguna Niguel is composed of several individual planned communities. For this
              reason, the City lacks a comprehensive design theme or common design elements.
              The City desires to have a greater sense of community identity. This can be
              accomplished through the creation of unifying design elements such as City
              signage, median improvements, entry gateways, the development of pedestrian
              gathering areas and the provision of distinctive street furniture.
       Policy 6.1     Provide for the development of pedestrian gathering areas to promote
                      social interaction.
              Actions
              6.1.1. Require pedestrian amenities and public gathering areas to be part of new
                      commercial development.
              6.1.2   Establish Citywide design themes for signage and major activity centers.
Goal 7        A mix of retail, office and hotel/motel land uses on the undeveloped Country
              Village parcel.
Intent        Country Village Planning Area A-i is one of the largest undeveloped non
              residential parcels of land in the City. The site is bounded by the Plaza de La Paz
              Shopping Center to the east and that Narland Business Center to the south. The
              site has good visibility and access to the San Joaquin Hills Transportation
              Corridor. The site is compatible for the development of commercial land uses.
              These commercial land uses would generate additional jobs and revenue for the
              City. Plazas and other pedestrian gathering areas should be incorporated into any
              development in this area. The Aliso Creek Corridor is located immediately west
              of the site. The Aliso Creek Corridor is a regional open space corridor that
              extends from the Santa Ana Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. It contains several
              recreational opportunities. Any development on the Country Village site should
              consider providing pedestrian linkages to the Aliso Creek corridor.
THE CITY OF LA GUNA NIGUEL                                                               LAND USE
               7.1.2   Work with the property owners of the Country Village Planning Area A-i
                       to prepare detailed plans for the area which should include pedestrian
                       linkages to the Aliso Creek Corridor and Public Plaza areas.
Goal 8        Revitalization of Camino Capistrano/Cabot Road Business Area.
Intent        The Camino Capistrano/Cabot Road Business Area (also referred to as the
               Laguna Niguel Gateway Area) contains one of the largest concentrations of
              industrial and commercial land uses in the City. A considerable amount of Laguna
              Niguel’s sales tax revenue is generated in this area. The area is predominantly
               developed, but many sites are underutilized. Typical Gateway area development,
               characterized by low-rise, one-story buildings with inappropriate signage,
              deficient circulation and infrastructure, and inadequate parking, would benefit
               from reinvestment.
              The Camino Capistrano/Cabot Road Business Area offers new development
              opportunities through the intensification and revitalization of the area with a mix
              of high-density residential, commercial, retail, and office uses to create a
              pedestrian and transit-oriented village in proximity to the Metrolink train station,
               all within an urban design framework to distinguish the area as a symbolic and
               functional entry to the City. It is important that the City stimulate private
              reinvestment and change in the area.
       Policy 8.1      Ensure that high quality urban design is incorporated into the project area.
              Actions
               8.1.1 Prepare specialized urban design standards and sign design guidelines
                       tailored to the unique needs and characteristics of the area.
               8.1.2   Implement form-based development and design standards, as appropriate,
                       for development of a unified, pedestrian-oriented street character,
                       integrated into distinct urban villages.
               8.1.3   Implement pedestrian and transit-oriented design principles to
                       accommodate access to and maximize benefit of proximity to the

               8.2.2  Coordinate with OCTA and other appropriate agencies on the
                      development of transit station parking facilities adequate to accommodate
                      future ridership demand at the Metrolink station.
       Policy 8.3     Allow for the revitalization or reuse of existing commercial and industrial
                      uses along with the phasing of adequate infrastructure and other needed
                      public facilities.
              Action
              8.3.1   Prepare a Specific Plan to guide and regulate future development in-the
                      Camino Capistrano/Cabot Road Business Area including a thorough
                      review of potential circulation, infrastructure and utility improvements to
                      accommodate increased development intensity, including a balance of
                      office, retail, hotel, high-density residential and mixed land uses.
                      Consider mechanisms in the Specific Plan that allow land use flexibility in
                      response to market conditions.
       Policy 8.4     Enhance riding, biking and bikeway opportunities within the project area.
              Action
              8.4.1 Through the site plan approval process, ensure that pedestrian and bicycle
                      linkages are provided from existing and future land uses to the Oso Creek
                      Regional Multi-Use Trail.
Goal 9        Enhancement of The Town Center.
Intent        The Town Center area of Laguna Niguel is identified as one of the primary focal
              points of the community. However, the area suffers from a number of constraints
              that prohibit the attainment of its market potential. Although the structures in the
              Town Center are relatively new, many of the uses were developed at a
              relatively low level of intensity. The land uses in the Town Center are located
              within their own enclaves, separated from each other by parking lots, landscaping
              and arterial roads. The area has poor pedestrian circulation. The Town Center also
              lacks a comprehensive design theme and pedestrian-oriented spaces for people to
              gather and interact. It has very little activity during evening hours.
THE CITY OF LA GUNA NIGUEL                                                              LAND USE
       Policy 9.2    Enhance pedestrian circulation through the construction of pedestrian
                     walkways and paths
       Policy 9.3    Encourage the development of new land uses that provide both daytime
                     and evening activities
       Policy 9.4    Ensure high quality urban design in the Town Center area.
              Actions
               9.4.1 Encourage a diverse mixture of land uses including specialty retail offices
                     and entertainment uses in the Town Center area.
               9.4.2 Coordinate with the County of Orange on the potential plans for the
                     relocation of the existing County facilities from the Town Center area to
                     another site and the potential reuse of the Town Center site for the Laguna
                     Niguel City Hall.
THE CITY OF LA GUNA NIGUEL                                                           LAND USE
V.     CITYWIDE AND COMMUNITY PROFILE ANALYSIS
       The City of Laguna Niguel consists of 9,421 acres, or 14.72 square miles, and is located
       in the southwestern area of Orange County. The City is bounded by the City of Dana
       Point to the south; the City of San Juan Capistrano to the east; the County of Orange
       (Aliso and Woods Canyon Regional Park), the planned community of Aliso Viejo, and
       the City of Laguna Beach to the west; and the cities of Laguna Hills and Mission Viejo
       and a small area of unincorporated Orange County to the north. Regional access to the
       City is mainly provided by Interstate 5 (1-5). Over the last ten years Laguna Niguel and
       the surrounding Southern Orange County region has experienced an unprecedented rate
       of growth. Concurrent with this fast rate of growth, have been a significant increase in
       traffic congestion along the south Orange County segment of 1-5. In an effort to enhance
       regional access, County transportation organizations have proposed construction of the
       San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor and the Moulton Parkway/Golden Lantern
       improvements. Both of these transportation facilities are designed to facilitate regional
       access to and from Laguna Niguel, as well as other nearby communities.
       The land use pattern within Laguna Niguel is the result of several master planned
       communities and specific plans that were approved by the County of Orange over the last
       twenty years, prior to the City’s incorporation. Each of the planned communities
       prescribes specific land uses, site development standards, circulation routes, and
       infrastructure systems. Almost eight-eight percent of Laguna Niguel is presently
       developed. The majority of the remaining vacant land in the City has approved
       development agreements or other entitlement.
       Laguna Niguel is predominantly a “bedroom” community with residential uses
       accounting for approximately sixty percent of the total land area. Most of the residential
       uses are concentrated in well-defined areas linked together by parks, greenbelts, and
       curvilinear landscaped streets.
       Over one-third of the City is devoted to open space. A combination of regional parks,
       community parks, neighborhood parks, private recreation facilities, open space corridors,
       greenbelts and landscaped slope banks are provided throughout the City. This large
       amount of open space establishes the open space character of the City.
       Retail, office, industrial and public/institutional land uses currently comprise only eight
       percent of the total land area of the City. Most of the retail land uses in the City are
       situated within neighborhood and community shopping centers. The majority of the

THE CITY OF LA GUNA NIGUEL                                                               LAND USE
       For comprehensive planning purposes, the City of Laguna Niguel has been separated into
       14 Community Profile Areas. By separating the City into profile areas a much more
       manageable approach to community planning can be accomplished and subsequently
       implemented. The Community Profile Map for the City is presented on Figure LU-5.
       The delineation of the 14 Community Profile Areas was based upon factors that
       demonstrate common orientation or similar characteristics. These factors include land use
       type, planning area boundaries, major street boundaries, natural features, homeowner
       association boundaries and Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZ). The intent of the profile areas
       has been to provide sub-areas of the community for statistical analysis as vhen as to
       identify localized concerns.
       The Community Profile Area analysis provides the framework for the formulation of City
       goals, policies and implementation actions at a profile area level. In some cases broad
       citywide policies may not clearly address issues unique to a specific profile area. The
       Community Profile Area analysis identifies these issues and provides the basis for the
       formulation of appropriate implementation actions.
       Each of the profile areas is provided with a setting description and summaries of land use,
       public facilities and socioeconomic data. Within each of the profile areas sub profile area
       analyses are provided. These sub profile area analyses provide a database of major land
       uses and gives context to their distribution.
       In addition, each sub profile area analysis summarizes the existing and projected
       development. The summaries include either a statement that the sub profile area is built-
       out with no additional residential or non-residential development projected, or a
       statement of the maximum future development of residential units or commercial square
       footage. The projection of maximum future development sets the land use limits within
       each sub profile area. Community Profile Area 4 (also known as the Laguna Niguel
       Gateway Specific Plan Area) has sub-profile areas that also use floor area ratios to
       specify commercial intensity limits. Floor area ratio (FAR) is defined as the ratio of gross
       building square footage to gross site area. The square footage limitations set forth in this
       plan are gross square feet. The baseline FAR established for each sub-profile area may
       be exceeded provided the project site exceeds two acres and/or the applicant satisfies
       specific conditions that justify a bonus FAR.
       When the General Plan was prepared, the land use limits established in the Land Use
       Element were used to conduct the necessary analyses, including, but not limited to the
       Traffic Model and the Economic Study. Therefore, development applications which

        intersections; and, (2) there are adequate public facilities, either existing or proposed, to
        meet any additional facility demands generated by the project.
A.       Community Profile Area 1
Setting
Community Profile Area 1 includes 320 acres and is located within the northwestern portion of
the City. The profile area, shown on Figure LU-6, is bounded by Pacific Park Drive to the north,
Laguna Niguel Regional Park to the south, proposed Alicia Parkway alignment to the west and
La Paz Road to the east. An interchange for the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor is
planned to the north of the profile area on La Paz Road.
Community Profile Area 1 is one of the largest business districts in the City. The profile area
includes the Chet Holifield Federal Building which is a Laguna Niguel landmark. A combination
of retail, restaurant, and office land uses are provided throughout the profile area. Additionally,
the profile area includes over 85 acres of vacant land that is planned for retail and office
development.
As of January1992, Profile Area 1 included 1,846,488 sq. ft. of commercial development. The
General Plan forecasts an additional 2, 233,410 sq. ft. of commercial development for Area 1 for
a total of 4,079,898 sq. ft. of commercial development at build-out. Area 1 is anticipated to be
the major employment center in the community, with a projected 13,056 employees at build-out.
Sub Profile Analysis
A.       S & S Commercial
         This sub area includes one of the largest undeveloped areas in the City. A maximum
         future development including 544,500 sq. ft. of Community Commercial use and 653,400
         sq. ft. of Professional Office use is projected for this sub area. In addition, a hotel of up to
         150 rooms (75,000 sq. ft.) is projected for this area. Alternatively, a maximum of 925,650
         sq. ft. to include only Community Commercial uses would be permitted within the sub
         area. Vehicular access will be enhanced by the future Alicia Parkway and Pacific Park
         roadway extensions to the north and west respectively. Regional access to the site will
         also be improved by the construction of the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor,
         which will have an interchange north of the site at La Paz Road. The southwestern
         portion of the sub profile area includes Southern California Edison’s Niguel substation
         and the mechanical equipment area for the Chet Holifield Federal Building which are

B.     Plaza De La Paz Center
       This area is designated Community Commercial. It is one of the largest retail centers in
       the City. Currently, the center includes 299,606 sq. ft. of Community Commercial uses.
       Future development within this sub profile area is limited to two vacant pad sites. A
       maximum of 7,400 sq. ft. of additional Community Commercial uses are projected for
       Plaza de La Paz.
C.     Chet Holified Building
       The Chet Holifield Building is one of Laguna Niguel’s earliest landmarks. Built in the
       1960’s, this building includes 980,000 sq. ft. of government office (Public/Institutional
       use) and the entire site covers 85 acres. An additional 300,000 sq. ft. of Professional
       Office use is projected for this site which is currently underutilized.
D.     Birtcher North
       This area currently has 258,410 square feet of office, light manufacturing, and
       governmental office development. A maximum of 155,440 sq. ft. of additional
       Professional Office and 77,720 sq. ft. of additional Industrial/Business Park uses are
       projected for this site.
E.     Birtcher South
       This area is currently vacant. A maximum of 300,000 sq. ft. of Professional Office uses
       and 74,500 sq. ft. of Community Commercial uses are projected for the site.
F.     Design Center
       This area is designated Community Commercial. Located near the intersection of Aliso
       Creek and Alicia Parkway, the Design Center will benefit from the improvement of the
       intersection and the extension of Alicia Parkway. The center is built-out and includes
       210,258 sq. ft. of wholesale interior decorating/design uses. The Community Commercial
       designation will allow the continuation of this use pattern and will also allow retail sales
       within the sub area.

Community Profile Area 3 consists of 526 acres and is located in the northeastern area of Laguna
Niguel. The profile area, shown on Figure LU-8, is generally bounded by unincorporated Orange
County and the City of San Juan Capistrano to the south, Crown Valley Parkway and Street of
the Golden Lantern to the west and the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor (SR 73) to the
north and east.
The profile area has a rolling topography with extended views to the east and west. It is
designated mainly for Residential Detached and Residential Attached housing. The existing
homes in the profile area are well established with large lots and mature landscaping.
The largest concentration of commercial uses is within the Ranch Niguel Center located at the
intersection of Crown Valley Parkway and Greenfield Drive. This area experiences a significant
amount of traffic congestion, especially near the intersection of Greenfield and Crown Valley
Future development will incrementally add to the congestion in the area.
The profile area contains private recreation facilities and the Niguel Hills Middle School site that
provide recreational opportunities for residents. A network of riding, hiking and equestrian trails
is located within the southeastern portion of the profile area providing linkages to park sites and
open space in other areas of the City.
The San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor lies adjacent to the northern edge of the profile
area with an interchange at Greenfield Drive. A 169-space parking lot, for the exclusive use of
park-and-ride commuters, is located in the northern portion of the profile area close to the San
Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor interchange. In addition, 135 spaces in the parking lot of
the commercial center located west of Greenfield Drive and north of Rancho Niguel Drive, are
provided for non-exclusive use as an expanded park-and-ride lot.

(SR-73) extends through portions of the profile area before intersecting with 1-5 south of Avery
Parkway. The western and eastern portions of the profile area are physically separated by the
BNSF Railroad Line and Oso Creek.
The profile area is currently developed with approximately 1,371,000 square feet of office, retail,
auto-service, and industrial land uses. Many of the land uses in the area have existed since the
1970’s and early 1980’s. Many of the uses along Camino Capistrano and Forbes Road are
characterized by low-rise, single-story buildings, substandard lot sizes, nonconforming signage,
outdoor industrial activities and storage, and inadequate parking.
Over the years, there have been a limited number of new significant developments in the profile
area, such as a 6-story office building on Cabot Road (1986), a Costco Wholesale at the
southeast corner of Crown Valley Parkway and Cabot Road (1988) and Mercedes-Benz of
Laguna Niguel (1999) on Star Drive in the southern-most portion of the profile area. In 2002, a
Metrolink commuter rail station opened at the south end of Forbes Road. In 2004, the SR-73
Toll Road opened, which provides indirect access to the profile area via an interchange at
 Greenfield Drive near Crown Valley Parkway.
 Access to the area is constrained and the portion of Crown Valley Parkway within this Profile
 area is the most highly traveled area within the City. The easterly portion of the profile area,
 along Camino Capistrano, can only be accessed by Avery Parkway and Paseo de Colinas. The
 intersections along Avery Parkway, Camino Capistrano, and Crown Valley Parkway presently
 operate at a poor level of service. Several circulation improvements are planned within the
 profile area, including a connection between Camino Capistrano and Cabot Road just north of
 the Laguna Niguel City boundary in the City of Mission Viejo, and widening Crown Valley
 Parkway to eight lanes between Greenfield Drive and the I-S Freeway.
 In June of 1999, the City adopted the Laguna Niguel Gateway Specific Plan with new land use

COMMUNITY PROFILE AREA 
THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                  LAND USE
In November 2011, the City adopted a significant update to the Laguna Niguel Gateway Specific
Plan to accommodate high-density residential uses, along with retail, office, entertainment, hotel,
and mixed land uses within certain portions of the Profile area to facilitate the creation of a
pedestrian-oriented urban village. Consistent with that Specific Plan update, Community Profile
Area 4 allows for a maximum of 2,994 dwelling units, up to 2,259,931 square feet of commercial
uses, and a maximum of 350 hotel rooms. The Statistical Summary for this Profile Area
estimates the anticipated distribution of residential and commercial uses within each of the sub-
profile areas. As specific projects are implemented, the exact amount of residential units and
commercial square footage may be exchanged between certain sub profile areas provided the
overall totals for the Profile Area are not exceeded. Any such exchanges may be considered as
part of the discretionary application process for the respected development project and without
the need for a General Plan Amendment if the applicant can successfully demonstrate that such
exchange is:
    1.       Consistent with the Laguna Niguel Gateway Specific Plan;
    2.       Consistent with the traffic generation thresholds established in the Specific Plan and,
    3.       Successfully demonstrate that no additional traffic impacts would be created.
    Density and Floor Area Ratio Criteria
    As discussed in the Sub Profile Area Analyses, below, Sub Profile Areas C, D, E, F, G, and
    H are designated Community Commercial; Professional Office; Public/Institutional; and
    Residential Attached, allowing mixed use projects or stand-alone commercial, office, or
    residential development in accordance with the following density and FAR criteria:
    o   Community Commercial land uses are permitted with a baseline FAR of .35 and a
        maximum FAR of .5 for projects that exceed two acres in size.
    o   Professional Office uses are permitted with a baseline FAR of .5 and a maximum FAR of
         1.0 for projects that exceed two acres in size. In addition, Professional Office projects
        may achieve a maximum FAR of 2.0 provided specific bonus FAR findings can be made,
        as described below.
     o  Residential Attached land uses are permitted with a minimum density of 40 dwelling
        units per acre (dulac) and a maximum baseline density of 50 du/ac. Residential Attached
        projects may achieve a maximum density of 120 du/ac provided specific bonus density
         findings can be made, as described below.

    1. The proposed development substantially advances the objectives of the Laguna Niguel
       Gateway Specific Plan;
    2. The proposed development results in substantial public benefit, beyond that required for
       projects not requesting a bonus FAR or density.
    3. The proposed development results in significant improvements over existing site and
       building conditions creating exceptionally high quality development in terms of site
       planning, architecture, circulation, landscaping, signage, pedestrian amenities and other
       design elements; and
    4. The proposed development implements all provisions of the Laguna Niguel Gateway
       Specific Plan applicable to the project site.

E.      Community Profile Area 5
Setting
Community Profile Area 5 includes 585.96 acres and is located in the north central area of
Laguna Niguel. The profile area, shown on Figure LU-b, is generally bounded by the City of
Laguna Hills to the north, Crown Valley Parkway to the south and east, and La Paz Road to the
west.
The profile area is comprised primarily of residential uses. Most of the residential uses are
relatively new and are characterized with Mediterranean architectural themes. A small residential
area in the northeastern portion of the profile area, is located outside of the City, within
unincorporated Orange County. The only access to this area is through the City of Laguna
Niguel. This area is proposed for annexation to the City of Laguna Niguel.
A 1.86 acre future commercial center is located south of Aliso Creek Road on Moulton Parkway.
The largest recreation facility in the profile area is the private Club at Rancho Niguel. The Club
is a recreation center that offers a wide array of riding and hiking trails. In addition to the Club,
there are several other privately maintained recreation facilities within the profile area.
Sub Profile Analysis
A.      Del Prado
         This area is located north of the City boundary in a small area of unincorporated Orange
         County. Annexation of this sub area into the City is likely as the developing residential
         complex has its only access through the City of Laguna Niguel. This area is designated
         Residential Attached and includes the Del Prado neighborhood with 196 existing units. A
         maximum of 248 additional attached units are projected for this sub area. The San
         Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor will form the area’s northern boundary.
 B.      Rancho Niguel North
         This sub area is designated Residential Attached and includes the neighborhoods of
         Ventanj a, Mirador, Expressions, and Milano. Each area includes a private recreational
         facility. The area is built-out with 1,090 attached units.

M.      Community Profile Area 13
Setting
Community Profile Area 13 includes 648.75 acres and is located in the southwestern portion of
Laguna Niguel. The profile area, shown on Figure LU- 18, is generally bounded by Sea View
Park and Club House Drive to the north, the cities of Dana Point and Laguna Beach to the south,
Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park to the west, and Crown Valley Parkway to the east. A
portion of the profile area is within the area covered by the South Laguna Specific Plan, which is
the Local Coastal Program for the southern part of the City of Laguna Niguel.
The profile area consists predominantly of residential land uses situated along coastal hills and
canyons. Expansive ocean views are provided to the west. A coastal influence is reflected
throughout the profile area. A number of private recreational facilities area provided. Two
County operated parks offer passive recreational opportunities along the ridgelines overlooking
the Pacific Ocean.
Sub Profile Area Analysis
A.      Laguna Sur/Monarch Point
        This area includes Residential Detached, Residential Attached, Public/Institutional, Parks
        and Recreation, and Open Space land uses. The detached residential area includes the
        custom home neighborhoods of Laguna Sur and Monarch Point which have 90 existing
        units and a private recreation facility. A maximum of 63 additional detached units are
        projected for the Laguna Sur and Monarch Point neighborhoods. The attached residential
        area is within the Laguna Sur neighborhood and is built-out with 353 units and a private
        recreation facility. The Binion property, located to the west of the Monarch Point
        neighborhood is currently vacant and is designated Residential Reserve. The Residential
        Reserve designation indicates that the site is reserved for future residential use, but that
        the character (attached vs. detached) and intensity of the residential use will be
        determined during review of the proposed Tentative Tract Map. A project level
        Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is being prepared for a proposed Tentative Tract
        Map which evaluates land use intensity alternatives ranging from no physical
        development to 95 residential attached units. The final determination regarding the land
        use intensity on the Binion property will be made following the public hearings on the
        proposed Tentative Tract Map. A General Plan Amendment will be processed
        concurrently with the project to replace the Residential Reserve designation with a

N.      Community Profile Area 14
Setting
Community Profile Area 14, shown on Figure LU-19, includes 117.62 acres and is generally
bounded by the intersections of Crown Valley Parkway/Niguel Road, Alicia Parkway/Niguel
Road and Alicia Parkway/Crown Valley Parkway.
The profile area currently includes a concentrated mix of retail, office, restaurant and civic center
land uses. The land uses in the profile area are situated within separate areas. Each of the areas
are separated by major arterials and parking areas. A significant amount of traffic occurs in the
vicinity of the profile area. The area is not well oriented for pedestrian circulation
The northeastern portion of the profile area consists mostly of office uses. The South County
Branch of the U. S. Post Office is located in this area.
The southeastern portion of the profile area is the Town Center area. It consists of retail, office
and restaurant uses. The Town Center has a variety of retail stores and a sufficient amount of
parking area. However, much of the available parking is located away from the retail uses. The
Town Center lacks a uniform design theme and pedestrian-oriented spaces for people to use.
The western portion of the profile area currently includes the County of Orange Civic Center. If
the County Civic Center relocates from this area, office and retail uses are projected for that site.
In addition, City Hall facilities may be incorporated with the office use projected for that site.

III. RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES
A variety of resources are available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing in the
City of Laguna Niguel. This chapter provides a description of the land resources and adequate sites to
address the City’s regional housing need allocation for the projection period of January 1, 2014 to
October 1, 2021, as adopted by the Southern California Association of Governments (see Table II-24). This
chapter also describes the financial and administrative resources available to support the provision of
affordable housing. Additionally, the chapter discusses opportunities for energy conservation that can lower
utility costs and increase housing affordability.
A.       Land Resources
Section 65583(a)(3) of the Government Code requires Housing Elements to contain an “inventory of land
suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having potential for redevelopment,
and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to these sites.” A detailed
inventory of residential development sites is provided in Appendix B. The results of this analysis are
summarized in Table III-1 below. The table shows that the City’s land inventory for potential residential
development is more than sufficient to accommodate the RHNA in all income categories for this projection
period.
                                                          Table III-1

A discussion of public facilities and infrastructure needed to serve future development is contained in
Section IV.B, Non-Governmental Constraints. There are currently no known service limitations that would
preclude the level of development described in the RHNA, although developers will be required to pay fees
or construct public improvements prior to or concurrent with development. Additionally, while some of the
RHNA sites may have environmental constraints such as steep slopes or geotechnical issues, the level of
development described in the RHNA reflects anticipated development yield given feasible methods for
addressing such constraints.
B.       Financial and Administrative Resources
         1.       State and Federal Resources
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) - Federal funding for housing programs is
available through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The City’s use of federal
funds is described in the 2010-2015 Consolidated Plan. As an Entitlement City, Laguna Niguel participates
in the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. CDBG funds are used by the City to fund
a variety of community services available to assist low- and moderate-income City residents and those with
special housing needs.
August 20, 2013                                                                                                  31

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                            HOUSING
The expected Community Development Block Grant Allocation for the 2012-13 program year is $232,358,
which represents a substantial reduction from levels in previous years. These funds will be used for capital
improvements, public services, economic development and administrative activities. The City does not
currently participate in other HUD programs such as HOME, Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG), or Housing
Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA).
Section 8 Rental Assistance – The City of Laguna Niguel cooperates with the Orange County Housing
Authority (OCHA), which administers the Section 8 Voucher Program. The Housing Assistance Payments
Program assists low income, elderly and disabled households by paying the difference between 30 percent
of an eligible household's income and the actual cost of renting a unit. According to the Orange County
Housing Authority, a total of 142 tenant-based Section 8 vouchers are used in the City. Of these, there are
23 family households, 32 disabled households, and 87 elderly households9.
The City facilitates use of the Section 8 program within its jurisdiction by advertising the availability of
OCHA Section 8 programs when the County accepts new applications.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program - The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program was created
by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to provide an alternate method of funding low-and moderate-income
housing. Each state receives a tax credit, based upon population, toward funding housing that meets
program guidelines. The tax credits are then used to leverage private capital into new construction or
acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable housing. Limitations on projects funded under the Tax Credit
programs include minimum requirements that a certain percentage of units remain rent-restricted, based
upon median income, for a term of 15 years.
         2.       Local Resources
Homesharing – South County Senior Services coordinates the Senior Citizen Homesharing program in
south Orange County. The programs provide referral/matching services to people with limited incomes
seeking housing as well as owners who wish to share their homes. The program relies on CDBG funds, and
funding from the Orange County Housing Authority and participating cities. Prior to February 2003, this
program was operated by Lutheran Social Services. In recent years the City of Laguna Niguel contributed
$3,000 in CDBG funds to this program.
Non-Profit Corporations - The City actively supports local non-profit groups to facilitate the development
and improvement of both senior citizen and low-cost housing in Laguna Niguel. Such support includes
assistance locating and acquiring financing, and coordinating discussions between property owner, non-
profit developer, and various governmental agencies.
C.       Energy Conservation Opportunities
There are many opportunities for conserving energy in new and existing homes. Construction of energy-
efficient buildings does not lower the price of housing. However, housing with energy conservation
features should result in reduced monthly occupancy costs as consumption of fuel and energy is decreased.
Similarly, retrofitting existing structures with energy-conserving features can result in a reduction in utility
costs. Examples of energy conservation opportunities include weatherization programs and home energy
audits, installation of insulation, installation or retrofitting of more efficient appliances and mechanical or
solar energy systems, and building design and orientation that incorporates energy-conservation
considerations. The City enforces all provisions of Title 24 of the California Administrative Code, which
provides for energy conservation features in new residential construction.

Many modern design methods used to reduce residential energy consumption are based on proven
techniques that have been known to humans since the earliest days of collective settlement. These methods
can be categorized in three ways:
      1.     Building design that keeps natural heat in during the winter and keeps natural heat out during
             the summer. Such design reduces air conditioning and heating demands. Proven building
             techniques in this category include:
             x     Location of windows and openings in relation to the path of the sun to minimize solar
                   gain in the summer and maximize solar gain in the winter;
             x     Use of thermal mass, earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete, and tiles that
                   absorb heat during the day and release heat at night;
             x     Burying part of the home in a hillside or berm to reduce solar exposure or to insulate the
                   home against extremes of temperature;
             x     Use of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to reduce heat exchange
                   between the interior of a home and the exterior;
             x     Location of openings and the use of ventilating devices that take advantage of natural air
                   flow (particularly cool evening breezes); and
             x     Use of eaves and overhangs that block direct solar gain through window openings during
                   the summer but allow solar gain during the winter.
      2.     Building orientation that uses natural forces to maintain a comfortable interior temperature.
             Examples include:
             x     North-south orientation of the long axis of a dwelling;
             x     Minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces; and
             x     Location of dwellings to take advantage of natural air circulation and evening breezes.
      3.     Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures. Such techniques include:
             x     Use of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home;
             x     Use of natural or artificial flowing water; and
             x     Use of trees and hedges as windbreaks.
In addition to natural techniques that have been used for millennia, a number of modern methods of energy
conservation have been developed or advanced during the present century. These include:
      x       Use of solar energy to heat water;
      x       Use of solar panels and other devices to generate electricity;
      x       Window glazing to repel summer heat and trap winter warmth;
      x       Weather-stripping and other insulating devices to reduce heat gain and loss; and
      x       Use of energy efficient home appliances.

IV. CONSTRAINTS
In planning for the provision of housing, constraints to the development, maintenance and improvement of
housing must be recognized, and jurisdictions must take appropriate steps to mitigate them where feasible.
Local government cannot control many of these constraints, such as those related to general economic and
market conditions, but others can be addressed. Potential constraints to housing are discussed below, and
include governmental constraints and non-governmental constraints.
A.         Governmental Constraints
Governmental regulations, while intentionally controlling the quality of development in the community,
can also unintentionally increase the cost of development and thus the cost of housing. These governmental
constraints include land use controls, building codes and their enforcement, site improvements, fees and
other exactions required of developers, and local development processing and permit procedures.
Land use controls may limit the amount or density of development, thus increasing the cost per unit. On-
site and off-site improvements such as roads, traffic signals on adjacent streets, or sewer systems may
increase development costs. Processing and permit requirements may delay construction, increasing
financing and/or overhead costs of a development. The following describes potential governmental
constraints, which may affect the supply and cost of housing in Laguna Niguel.
           1.           Land Use Plans and Regulations
a.         General Plan
Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term General Plan to guide its
future. The Land Use Element of the General Plan establishes the basic type and density of development
within the various areas of the city. Under state law, the various General Plan elements must be internally
consistent and the City’s zoning must be consistent with the General Plan. Thus, the land use plan must
provide suitable locations and densities to implement the policies of the Housing Element.
The Laguna Niguel General Plan Land Use Element provides for two residential land use designations, as
shown in Table IV-1.
                                                                  Table IV-1
                                                   Residential Land Use Categories –

 Residential Detached               n/a          Designated area characterized by one single-family dwelling constructed on each individual
                                                 subdivided lot or legal building site.
 Residential Attached               n/a          Designated area characterized by attached dwelling units constructed on individual or
                                                 common lots--including townhomes, apartments and condominium projects.

 *The Laguna Niguel General Plan does not specify maximum densities in units per acre; however, the maximum buildout is determined by
 dwelling unit allocations assigned to individual community profile areas and sub-profile areas identified in the Land Use Element. Nearly all
 sub-profile areas with the exception of the Gateway Specific Plan area have been built out.
The majority of the buildable land area within city boundaries is developed or is designated for parks and
open space. The Land Use Element of the Laguna Niguel General Plan designates approximately 3,508 net
acres (37%) of the City’s total land inventory for residential uses, providing a variety of residential types

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                           HOUSING
throughout the City. The maximum residential density permitted in Laguna Niguel is determined by unit
allocations assigned to individual community profile areas and sub-profile areas identified in the Land Use
Element. Nearly all sub-profile areas (with the exception of the Gateway Specific Plan area) have been
built-out to the General Plan maximum unit allocations, leaving few opportunities for new housing units.
Average developed densities for Laguna Niguel are approximately 5.2 dwelling units per gross acre for the
Residential Detached areas and approximately 14.6 dwelling units per gross acre for the Residential
Attached areas.
b.       Planned Communities and Specific Plans
The City of Laguna Niguel is largely composed of master planned communities (PCs) and Specific Plan
(SP) areas that were approved by the County of Orange prior to the City’s incorporation in 1989. These
Planned Communities are the Laguna Niguel PC, the Country Village PC, the Colinas de Capistrano PC,
the Beacon Hill PC, the Bear Brand Hill PC, the Bear Brand PC, and the Narland Business Center PC. Each
of the Planned Communities is implemented through Feature Plans, Area Plans, and Site Plan approvals.
Prior to incorporation, the Planned Community development plans provided policy guidance and regulatory
control over development in Laguna Niguel. Today, the Planned Communities are subject to the policies
and regulations of the Laguna Niguel General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance. Portions of the City are
located in the South Laguna Specific Plan area and are subject to the land use and zoning regulations of that
plan.
The most noteworthy opportunity for new development in Laguna Niguel is in the Gateway Specific Plan.
Due to the lack of available undeveloped land or annexation opportunities, other new planned communities
within the City are unlikely in the foreseeable future.
Gateway Specific Plan
    Background
The Laguna Niguel Gateway Specific Plan area contains approximately 300 acres along the eastern border
of the city. A majority of the existing buildings predate City incorporation and were constructed in the late
1970s and early 1980s. At present, the area contains a mix of office, retail and service commercial, light
industrial and auto-related sales and service uses. The Gateway Specific Plan defines the overall vision,
goals, policies, land use regulations, development standards, and design guidelines for the Gateway area,
and regulates land use and urban form, mobility, infrastructure, streetscape, and architectural design.
With the growth and development of southern Orange County during the past 40 years and the
establishment of the Metrolink rail station in the Gateway in 2002, the area presents a significant
opportunity for revitalization and transformation into a major mixed-use, transit-oriented activity center.
The City enlisted the Urban Land Institute Orange County District (ULIOC) to bring its expertise in
identifying new initiatives that could be brought to bear in stimulating real change in the Gateway Area
consistent with the City‘s visions. In May 2006, the ULIOC conducted a Technical Advisory Panel (TAP)
workshop consisting of a team of professionals in the land use planning industry to study the site and make
recommendations to the City on how best to address its objectives. The ULIOC TAP consisted of high-
level land use professionals with backgrounds and experience in transit-oriented development, mixed
use/multi-use development, multi-family housing, affordable housing, retail/commercial development,
urban planning and design, traffic/transportation, revitalization, real estate law/development agreements,
market research and site analysis. The TAP panel presented their findings and recommendations to the City
Council concluding that:
       x      Housing is the key to unlocking the potential of the Gateway District and that initial housing
              must create a new character and sense of place
August 20, 2013                                                                                             36

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                             HOUSING
       x     There must be a plan for phasing in residential development fronting along Forbes Road and
             that it will not happen without improvements of the public realm and infrastructure
       x     Financing options exist for those improvements and the Specific Plan is the vehicle for
             structuring the entitlements and requirements
       x     The Gateway needs a Champion both in the Council and City government and in the private
             sector, e.g., an enlightened developer, in order to succeed with the vision to revitalize the area.
In order to implement the recommendations presented by the TAP, the City assembled a multi-disciplinary
team of urban designers, economists, transportation planners, and engineers to prepare the Specific Plan.
The consultant team was charged with building upon the City‘s previous studies for the Gateway area
including the goals and objectives identified by the TAP. The Specific Plan, adopted by the City Council in
2011, is the result of the collaborative planning efforts between the City, the public, land and business
owners, and the project team.
Existing development in the Specific Plan area is clustered primarily along the north/south roadways
including Camino Capistrano, Cabot Road, and Forbes Road. It is predominately developed with a variety
of commercial service, light industrial, auto sales and services, retail, and office uses. Most of the uses are
characterized by low-rise, one-story buildings and/or multi-tenant structures such as the business park on
Forbes Road north of Crown Valley Parkway. There is a six-story Crown Cabot Financial office building
on Cabot Road and a large retail/warehouse (Costco) on Crown Valley Parkway. Auto dealerships are
located on Camino Capistrano and Star Drive. There are several one- and two-story buildings located on
Forbes Road. Vacant properties within the area are generally located along Cabot Road.
Numerous lots within the Specific Plan area are too narrow and/or shallow to adequately accommodate
identified market capture opportunities for new development, particularly with larger retail, office, or
business park uses. Because many of the lots along Forbes Road are small and/or shallow in depth, the
Specific Plan encourages lot consolidation, and provides incentives for doing so, to support larger buildings
and more intensive land uses such as residential mixed-use developments, and retail/entertainment centers.
Two distinct areas form the heart of the Gateway community and offer the best opportunity for high-
density residential or mixed-use development in a walkable, pedestrian-oriented environment. These two
areas are referred to as the Mixed Use Village, located on Forbes Road north of Crown Valley Parkway,
and the Transit-Oriented Mixed-Use Corridor, located on Forbes Road south of the Crown Valley Parkway.
Both of these areas are envisioned to transition and become a desirable and attractive mixed-use village
containing a mix of multi-family residential, office, and commercial uses. Buildings will be located directly
along, and oriented towards the street frontage to foster pedestrian activity along the sidewalks, Oso Creek
pedestrian greenway, and internal streets.
Gateway Land Use Policies, Regulations and Development Standards
The Gateway Specific Plan includes the following policies intended to facilitate compact, transit-oriented
development that includes opportunities for high-density workforce housing:
       3.2.1   Transit-Oriented Development. Accommodate the development of a mix and density of land
               uses that benefit from the presence and support of transit use in the Gateway area.
       3.2.2   Land Use Mix and Balance. Promote the development of a diverse mix of uses within
               distinct neighborhoods and districts containing housing, general and medical offices, retail
               commercial, dining and entertainment, community services, and amenity uses supporting
               residents, workers, and transit riders.
       3.2.3   Housing. Provide for increased densities to encourage the development of housing that
               accommodates a variety of persons and households who choose to live in an active, urban
               environment.
August 20, 2013                                                                                               37

      3.2.8     Parcel Assembly. Provide for increased densities for the assembly of adjoining parcels as
                incentives for the development of larger scale, cohesive mixed-use development projects.
      3.2.9     Development Density. Promote development that creates a high-density urban community,
                concentrating residents and jobs in proximity to the Metrolink station.
The Mixed-Use Village and the Transit-Oriented Mixed-Use Corridor districts offer the best opportunities
for high-density residential and mixed-use development in a pedestrian-oriented environment (see
Appendix B, Figure B-2). At buildout, the Gateway Specific Plan envisions a total of 2,994 high-density
housing units and over 2 million square feet of commercial development (see Table IV-2).

The Mixed-Use zone district allows exclusive residential and mixed-use projects, as described below.
Mixed-Use (MU) Zone
      The MU zone is intended to encourage development of an active urban environment that exhibits the
      character of distinct and a vibrant pedestrian friendly village and transit corridor where residents live,
      work, dine, are entertained, and recreate, with easy access to Metrolink transit. It allows for the
      intermixing of a diversity of land uses that will be unified by their urban form and relationship to
      street frontages and adjoining parcels. While more than one use may be located on any block within
      the zone, all buildings shall be placed on their lot, oriented to the street frontage, and designed to
      convey an urban character. Densities are maximized to reflect intentions for these areas to function as
      the symbolic and activity cores of the Gateway area.
      Allowable uses. Any property in the MU zone may be developed exclusively for office, multi-family
      residential, or hotel uses, or a mix of these with retail commercial integrated either vertically or
      horizontally on a single site. Stand-alone multi-family projects are a permitted use while mixed-use
      projects are subject to approval of a Use Permit by the Planning Commission.

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                          HOUSING
       Development standards. The height limit in the MU zone ranges from 80 to 120 feet depending on
       district. Sites developed for office uses must adhere to Floor Area Ratio requirements between 0.5
       and 1.0 depending on lot size. Sites developed with residential must be developed at densities
       between 40 and 50 dwelling units per acre, and may be increased up to 120 dwelling units per acre as
       incentive for providing important community benefits such as affordable housing, community
       facilities, and open space amenities and infrastructure to further the implementation of the Gateway
       area. Mixed-use projects may be built to a minimum FAR of 1.5 and maximum of 2.0. Densities may
       be increased to a maximum of 3.0 FAR as an incentive for the provision of community benefits such
       as affordable housing. The residential portion of mixed-use projects must be a minimum of 1.15 FAR
       and 40 dwelling units per acre.
       Approval procedures. Residential projects conforming to the applicable development standards are
       permitted subject to approval of a Site Development Permit by the Community Development
       Director or Planning Commission, while mixed-use projects require approval of a Use Permit by the
       Planning Commission (see also the discussion under Development Processing Procedures in Section
       IV.A.2, page 46 below).
Incentives for High-Density Residential Development
The development regulations in the Gateway Specific Plan encourage and facilitate the development of
affordable workforce housing by providing strong incentives to developers. The regulations provide
incentives by allowing increased density when public benefits such as affordable units are included in a
project. The minimum residential density is 40 dwelling units per acre, significantly higher than the
“default density” for lower-income housing specified in state law. In order to achieve maximum utilization
of sites within the Mixed Use zone, a residential component must be included in the project. An FAR
increase of 0.65 (from 1.0 up to 1.65) is granted for mixed-use projects as compared to exclusively non-
residential projects. When community benefits are provided, mixed-use projects may reach 3.0 FAR
compared to a maximum 2.0 FAR for exclusively office projects. Purely residential projects are also
permitted within the MU zone. When combined with other development incentives described in the City’s
housing programs (see Chapter V) these regulations provide significant financial incentives for developers
of multi-family housing that support the development assumptions contained in the Vacant Sites Inventory
(Appendix B, Table B-2).
c.       Zoning Designations
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development through the Zoning
Ordinance and Zoning Map. Zoning regulations serve to implement the General Plan and are designed to
protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents. The Zoning Ordinance also helps
to preserve the character and integrity of existing neighborhoods. The Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map set
forth residential development standards for each zoning district.
The seven zoning districts (other than planned communities and specific plans) that allow residential units
as a permitted use are as follows:
       RS-1        Rural Residential District
       RS-2        Residential Estate District
       RS-3        Single Family District 3
       RS-4        Single Family District 4
       RP          Planned Residential District
       RA          Attached Residential District
       RM          Multi-Family District
A summary of the development standards for the seven major zoning districts (excluding specific plans)
permitting residential development is provided in Table IV-3. These development standards are reasonably

   Notes:
         (a) RP standards are contained in approved precise plans for each project.
         (b) No maximum density. Maximum dwelling units established by General Plan Land Use Element.
   1. 0 feet on attached side and 5 feet on open side.
   2. 20 feet where rear yard abuts a street.
   3. 10 feet adjacent to streets.
There are no maximum densities established in the Zoning Ordinance. The allowable number of residential
units on any parcel is controlled by the dwelling unit allocations set forth in the Land Use Element of the
General Plan. As most of the City (with the exception of the Gateway area) is nearly built-out, these
residential allocations have been fully utilized. For this reason, efforts to provide new affordable housing
opportunities in the community must focus on the remaining infill and revitalization sites that are suitable
for higher-density residential or mixed-use development.
While major residential projects are excluded, some types of special needs housing are allowed in the
Neighborhood Commercial District (CN), the Community Commercial District (CC), the Office
Commercial District (CO), the Business Park District (BP) and the Public Institutional District (PI),
typically through use permits. Managed care facilities are permitted in the CN, CC, and PI Districts when
combined with the Managed Care Overlay District and a use permit has been obtained.
A summary of the residential uses permitted by the City’s Zoning Ordinance is provided in Table IV-4.

  Notes.
  1. Mobile home parks are not specifically identified in zoning ordinance. However, mobile home units are permitted in the districts shown.
  2. Allowed when combined with the Managed Care Overlay District (MC)
The Zoning Ordinance provides for a variety of housing types including single-family homes (both
attached and detached), multi-family apartments, manufactured housing, mobile homes and second units.
Second units, which are one option for facilitating affordable housing, are permitted by-right as an
accessory use in the RS-1, RS-2, RS 3, and RS-4 Districts.
d.         Zoning for Affordable Housing and Special Needs Housing
Persons with special needs include those in residential care facilities, persons with disabilities, the elderly,
farm workers, persons needing emergency shelter or transitional living arrangements, and single-room
occupancy units. The City’s provisions for these housing types are discussed below.
Housing for Lower-Income Persons
Pursuant to AB 2348 of 2004, the “default density” for most Orange County jurisdictions, including
Laguna Niguel, is 30 dwelling units per acre10. The default density refers to the density at which lower-
income housing development is presumed to be feasible, although state law allows jurisdictions to propose
alternative densities that are sufficient to facilitate affordable housing based on local experience and
circumstances.
As noted in the previous discussion of Planned Communities and Specific Plans, the Gateway Specific Plan
represents the city’s most significant opportunity for new affordable housing. The Gateway plan allows

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                             HOUSING
multi-family and mixed-use development at densities ranging from 40 to 120 units per acre, in close
proximity to both a Metrolink/Amtrak station and bus transit. Since allowable densities are significantly
higher than the default density, the Gateway Specific Plan land use regulations encourage and facilitate
housing that is affordable to lower-income households.
Senior Housing, Residential Care and Managed Care Facilities
Age-restricted senior housing that does not include services (such as assisted living or medical care) is
permitted as a residential use subject to the same standards and procedures as other non-age-restricted
residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
Residential Care and Managed Care Facilities generally refer to any family home, group home, or
rehabilitation facility that provides non-medical care to persons in need of personal services, protection,
supervision, assistance, guidance, or training essential for daily living. The City of Laguna Niguel Zoning
Ordinance defines residential care facilities as “a residential facility which is licensed by the state to
provide living and treatment facilities on a monthly or longer basis for six or fewer of the following: wards
of the juvenile court, elderly persons, mentally disordered persons, developmentally disabled persons,
persons undergoing treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, handicapped persons, or dependent and neglected
children.” The Zoning Ordinance defines managed care facilities as “assisted living facilities, convalescent
hospitals, and residential care facilities for the elderly, which serve seven or more persons.”
In accordance with state law, residential care facilities that serve six or fewer persons are permitted by-right
in all residential districts. Managed care facilities that serve seven or more persons are permitted by use
permit in the RM, CN, CC, and PI Districts when combined with the Managed Care Overlay District (MC).
Managed care facilities must meet the requirements of the MC Overlay District as set forth in §9-1-54.2 of
the City of Laguna Niguel Zoning Code. These requirements are consistent with state law and do not pose a
significant constraint on the establishment of such facilities.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Both the federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act impose an
affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e., modifications or
exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such accommodations may be
necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. The Building Codes
adopted by the City of Laguna Niguel incorporate accessibility standards contained in Title 24 of the
California Administrative Code. For example, apartment complexes of three or more units and
condominium complexes of four or more units must be designed to accessibility standards.
The City uses the Minor Adjustment permit process to review and approve requests for modifications to
planning or building code requirements in order to provide reasonable accommodation for persons with
disabilities.
Other potential constraints on housing for persons with disabilities include the following:
       Definition of “Family”
              Zoning Code Sec. 9-1-142 defines “family” as “one or more related or unrelated persons
              occupying one dwelling unit. The word "family" includes the occupants of residential care
              facilities, as defined herein, serving six or fewer persons which are permitted or licensed by the
              state. The word "family" does not include occupants of a fraternity, sorority, boardinghouse,
              lodging house, club or motel.” This definition is consistent with current law.
August 20, 2013                                                                                              42

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                            HOUSING
       Separation Requirements
             There is no City requirement for minimum separation distance between group homes or care
             facilities other than as may be provided in state law.
       Parking Standards
             The required number of parking spaces for large group homes (7 or more residents) is
             determined through a project-specific parking analysis as part of the use permit process.
       Supportive Services
             There are no limitations on supportive services in group homes or care facilities.
Compliance with building codes and the ADA may increase the cost of housing production and can also
impact the viability of rehabilitation of older properties required to be brought up to current code standards.
However, these regulations provide minimum standards that must be complied with in order to ensure the
development of safe and accessible housing.
Farm Worker Housing
As discussed in Chapter 2 (Needs Assessment), the City of Laguna Niguel does not have major agricultural
areas and has no significant need for permanent on-site farm worker housing. The City’s overall efforts to
provide and maintain affordable housing opportunities will help to support the few farm workers that may
wish to reside in the city.
Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing
Emergency shelters are facilities that provide a safe alternative to the streets either in a shelter facility or
through the use of motel vouchers. Emergency shelter is short-term, usually for 30 days or less.
Transitional/supportive housing is longer-term housing, typically up to two years. Transitional/supportive
housing requires that the resident participate in a structured program to work toward the established goals
so that they can move on to permanent housing. Residents are often provided with an array of supportive
services to assist them in meeting goals.
SB 2 of 2007 strengthened the planning requirements for emergency shelters and transitional housing. This
bill requires jurisdictions to evaluate their need for shelters compared to available facilities to address the
need. Jurisdictions must also designate at least one location where a year-round shelter can be
accommodated. There are currently no emergency shelters located in the city. The Municipal Code allows
emergency shelters as a permitted use by-right in the CN, CC, CO, BP and PI zones in conformance with
state law. With respect to transitional and supportive housing, SB 2 requires that such facilities be treated as
a residential use subject to the same requirements that are applied to other residential uses. Under City
policy, transitional and supportive housing are considered residential uses that are subject to the same
standards and procedures as apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone, consistent
with state law.
Single Room Occupancy
Single room occupancy facilities are small studio-type units and are allowed subject to a use permit in the
PI District, provided the units conform to the requirements set forth in §9-1-45.25 (Single Room
Occupancy Hotels) of the City of Laguna Niguel Zoning Code. The development standards for these uses
are reasonable to assure minimum amenities and adequate levels of safety and are not considered to be a
constraint to the development of SRO units.
August 20, 2013                                                                                              43

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                                                      HOUSING
e.        Off-Street Parking Requirements
The City’s parking requirements for residential uses vary by residential type. Single-family dwellings
require 2 covered parking spaces per unit. Multi-family dwellings require 1.5 parking spaces for studio and
one-bedroom units, 2 spaces for 2-bedroom units, and 2.5 spaces for 3-bedroom or larger units. The
parking requirements are summarized in Table IV-5, below.
The required parking is typical for most cities in Orange County and is not considered to be a constraint on
the production of affordable housing. This is especially true for Laguna Niguel, which is essentially built-
out with all of the required parking in place. The Planning Commission has the ability to grant reduced
parking for senior housing and other affordable housing projects through the site development permit
process. It is widely accepted that senior and lower-income households have fewer cars on average than
higher-income households.
                                                            Table IV-5
                                             Residential Parking Requirements
              Type of Unit                                              Minimum Parking Space Required
 Single Family Dwellings                   2.0 enclosed parking spaces per dwelling + 1.0 additional off-street parking space for
                                           dwellings set back less than 20 feet from back of curb or sidewalk (whichever is less).
 Two or More Dwellings on One Building Site
     Studio and One-Bedroom Units          1.5 off-street parking space per dwelling unit
                                           One space shall be covered for each dwelling unit.
     Two-Bedroom Units                     2.0 off-street parking spaces per dwelling unit
                                           At least one space shall be covered for each dwelling unit.
     Three or More Bedroom Units           2.5 off-street parking spaces per dwelling unit + 0.5 off-street parking space for each
                                           bedroom in excess of three.
                                           Two spaces shall be covered for each dwelling unit.
 Guest Parking (all unit types)            0.5 guest parking spaces per dwelling unit located within 100 feet of dwelling unit served.
 Senior Housing                            Standards are same as for non-senior projects. However, alternative standards are allowed
                                           through the site development permit process.
 Guest Houses                              One additional covered or uncovered space.

f.        Second Units
In response to state-mandated requirements and local needs, the City of Laguna Niguel allows for the
development of second dwelling units by right (i.e., no discretionary approval required) in the RS-1, RS-2,
RS 3, and RS-4 Districts subject to an accessory residential unit permit. The accessory residential unit
permit is a ministerial action that does not require public notice or public hearing. The standards and
requirements for the establishment of second units are provided in §9-1-35.7 (Second Units) of the Zoning
Code. Among other requirements, the second unit: 1) cannot exceed 30% of the area of the primary
residence or 1,200 feet if detached, 2) must contain a minimum of one off-street covered parking space if
up to 640 square feet, or one covered and one uncovered space is greater than 640 square feet, and 3) must
remain under the same ownership as that of the primary residence.
Second units serve to augment resources for senior housing or other low- and moderate-income segments
of the population. The development standards are reasonable to ensure neighborhood compatibility, and do
not present an unreasonable constraint to development.
August 20, 2013                                                                                                                        44

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                           HOUSING
g.        Density Bonus
The City of Laguna Niguel Zoning Code (§9-1-37, Density Bonuses for Affordable Housing) offers a
density increase of up to 35 percent over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density to
developers who agree to construct housing developments with units affordable to low- or moderate-income
households or senior housing projects. These density bonus standards are consistent with Government Code
§65915.
h.        Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
There is often an economy of scale in manufacturing homes in a factory rather than on site, thereby
reducing cost. State law precludes local governments from prohibiting the installation of mobile homes on
permanent foundations on single-family lots (Government Code §65852.3). It also declares a mobile home
park to be a permitted land use on any land planned and zoned for residential use, and prohibits requiring
the average density in a new mobile home park to be less than that permitted by the Municipal Code
(Government Code §65852.7).
In the City of Laguna Niguel, manufactured housing and mobile homes are allowed in the RS-1, RS-2, RS-
3, and RS-4 Districts as a permitted use. The City currently has no mobilehome parks.
i.        Condominium Conversions
In order to provide standards for regulating the conversion of rental housing to condominiums, some of
which provides housing for low- and moderate-income persons, and to mitigate any hardship to tenants
caused by their displacement, the City’s Municipal Code provides for the following:
       1.    Application for a use permit and approval of tentative and final subdivision maps.
       2.    Submission of an engineering report on the general condition of all structural, electrical,
             plumbing, and mechanical elements of the existing development.
       3.    Submission of a housing program which includes:
             x     The means by which the provision of housing affordable to lower- and moderate-income
                   households will be achieved;
             x     A housing report addressing housing affordability within the General Plan community
                   profile area, including vacancy rates and other available housing of similar type and rent;
             x     A survey of existing tenants as to their length of occupancy, and the number of those
                   who express the intention of purchasing one of the units;
             x     A relocation plan that identifies the steps that will be taken to ensure the successful
                   relocation of each tenant if the conversion is completed.
When a condo conversion is permitted, the increase in the supply of less expensive for-sale units helps to
compensate for the loss of rental units. The ordinance to regulate condominium conversions is reasonable to
preserve rental housing opportunities, and does not present an unreasonable constraint on the production of
ownership housing.
j.        Building Codes
State law prohibits the imposition of building standards that are not necessitated by local geographic,
climatic or topographic conditions and requires that local governments making changes or modifications in
building standards must report such changes to the Department of Housing and Community Development
and file an expressed finding that the change is needed.
August 20, 2013                                                                                            45

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                           HOUSING
The City's building codes are based upon the California Building, Plumbing, Fire, Mechanical, Electrical,
and Energy Codes. These are considered to be the minimum necessary to protect the public's health, safety
and welfare. No additional regulations have been imposed by the City that would unnecessarily add to
housing costs.
          2.     Development Processing Procedures
a.        Residential Permit Processing
State Planning and Zoning Law provides permit processing requirements for residential development.
Within the framework of state requirements, the City has structured its development review process in
order to minimize the time required to obtain permits while ensuring that projects receive careful review.
All residential development is reviewed by City staff for zoning, building and fire code compliance prior to
issuance of building permits. With the exception of single-family homes on existing lots, a site
development permit must be approved by the Community Development Director or the Planning
Commission for all new structures or significant alterations to the exterior of existing structures. Zoning
Code Section 9.1.114.1(d)(1) provides for the Community Development Director to determine, on a case-
by-case basis, whether the public interest would be better served by review of the permit by the Director or
by the Planning Commission and whether a public hearing is required. The required findings for approval
of a Site Development Permit are as follows:
       1.    Consistency with general plan. The project is consistent with the general plan.
       2.    Consistency with zoning code. The project is consistent with the provisions of this zoning code.
       3.    Compliance with CEQA. Processing and approval of the permit application are in compliance
             with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act.
       4.    Consistency with design standards. The project is consistent with the goal and objectives of the
             community design standards as set forth in section 9-1-91.2.
       5     Surrounding uses. Approval of the application will not create conditions materially detrimental
             to the public health, safety and general welfare or injurious to or incompatible with other
             properties or land uses in the vicinity.
Processing times vary and depend on the size and complexity of the project. Projects reviewed by the
Planning Commission, including site development permits, use permits, tentative parcels maps, and
tentative tract maps, typically require from 3 to 9 months to process. Projects reviewed by the City Council,
such as General Plan and Zoning Code amendments, typically require between 6 and 12 months to process.
The greatest potential for new multi-family housing development in Laguna Niguel is within the Gateway
Specific Plan (see also the previous discussion in Section IV.A.1.b, page 36 above). The Gateway Plan
includes detailed development standards and design guidelines that provide developers with clear direction
regarding the type of development that the City seeks to encourage in this area. As a result, the specific
plan simplifies the project design and review process thereby increasing development certainty and
minimizing delays and overall development costs. The review and approval process, whether conducted by
the Director or by the Planning Commission, focuses on confirming that the project is consistent with the
objective physical design parameters contained in the specific plan rather than on the appropriateness of
multi-family residential uses. The regulations also encourage affordable multi-family housing by allowing
increased density when deed-restricted affordable units or other public benefits are provided.
Certain steps of the development process are required by state laws rather than local laws. The state has
defined processing deadlines to limit the amount of time needed for review of required reports and projects.
In an effort to provide an efficient permit processing system, the City has implemented the following time
and cost saving developmental processes:
August 20, 2013                                                                                            46
THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                            HOUSING
       x     Prepared permit processing guidelines to assist residential builders in applying for
             development permits for single-family residences, multifamily residential developments and
             subdivisions.
       x     Located all City divisions involved in the permitting process in one central location.
       x     Encourages “early consultation” pre-application meetings to identify issues as soon as possible
             and reduce processing time.
       x     Encourage concurrent processing of applications
These processes help to ensure that the development review process does not act as a constraint to housing
development.
b.       Environmental Review
Environmental review is required for all development projects under the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA). An Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is required of all developments that have the potential
of creating significant impacts that cannot be mitigated. All of the planned communities that make up the
City of Laguna Niguel required the preparation of EIRs. Some residential projects in Laguna Niguel are
either Categorically Exempt or require only an Initial Study and Negative Declaration. A Negative
Declaration process typically takes four to six weeks to prepare depending on complexity of the project and
required technical studies, followed by a state-mandated public review period. Categorically Exempt
developments require a minimal amount of time. As a result, state-mandated environmental review does
not pose a significant constraint to housing development.
c.       California Coastal Act
The California Coastal Act requires each local government lying wholly or partly within the state-
designated Coastal Zone to prepare a Local Coastal Program (LCP). The City’s LCP is comprised of
portions of the South Laguna Specific Plan and the Aliso Creek Specific Plan, both of which were certified
by the California Coastal Commission prior to incorporation. After incorporation, the California Coastal
Commission certified the Laguna Niguel Local Coastal Program as a single plan. The City is responsible
for the issuance of Coastal Development permits in the Coastal Zone.
The developable portions of the City’s Coastal Zone are essentially built-out with only a few vacant single-
family sites remaining to be developed with custom homes. Most of the housing within the Coastal Zone
was built as part of planned communities and does not provide low-income housing opportunities.
Therefore, the preservation and/or replacement of low-income housing within the Coastal Zone is not likely
to be an issue within the current planning period. (Please refer to Chapter II, Section G for a discussion of
construction, demolition and replacement of housing units within the Coastal Zone.)
         3.      Development Fees and Improvement Requirements
State law limits fees charged for development permit processing to the reasonable cost of providing the
service for which the fee is charged. Various fees and assessments are charged by the City and other public
agencies to cover the costs of processing permit applications and providing services and facilities such as
schools, parks and infrastructure. Almost all of these fees are assessed through a pro rata share system,
based on the magnitude of the project's impact or on the extent of the benefit that will be derived.
Table IV-6 provides a list of fees the City of Laguna Niguel charges for new, standard residential
development. The rates charged by the City are inclusive and based on standardized unit sizes.
Development fees will vary from project to project depending on the specific characteristics.

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                              HOUSING
residents. One of the main consequences of Proposition 13 has been the shift in funding of new
infrastructure from general tax revenues to development impact fees and improvement requirements on
land developers. The City requires developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements necessary to
serve their projects. Such improvements may include water, sewer and other utility extensions, street
construction and traffic control device installations that are reasonably related to the project. Dedication of
land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for rights-of-way, transit facilities, recreational
facilities and school sites, consistent with the Subdivision Map Act.
Although development fees and improvement requirements increase the cost of housing, cities have little
choice in establishing such requirements due to the limitations on property taxes and other revenue sources
needed to fund public services and improvements.
B.        Non-Governmental Constraints
          1.      Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints include physical features such as steep slopes, fault zones, floodplains, sensitive
biological habitat, and agricultural lands. In many cases, development of these areas is constrained by state
and federal laws (e.g., FEMA floodplain regulations, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act,
and the state Fish and Game Code and Alquist-Priolo Act). Because Laguna Niguel is fully developed,
these issues do not pose a significant constraint to new development within City limits. The City’s land use
plans have been designed to protect sensitive areas from development, and to protect public safety by
avoiding development in hazardous areas. While these policies constrain residential development to some
extent, they are necessary to support other public policies.
          2.      Infrastructure Constraints
As the City has been developed as a planned community, infrastructure, including water, sewer and
sidewalks, are readily available and adequate within the City limits. As discussed under Development Fees
and Improvement Requirements, the City requires developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements
necessary to serve their projects. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for
rights-of-way, transit facilities, recreational facilities and school sites, consistent with the Subdivision Map
Act.
Additionally, the City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public improvements
including streets, bridges, and other public works projects to facilitate the remaining build-out of the City’s
General Plan. The CIP helps to ensure that construction of public improvements is coordinated with private
development. As a result of these policies, any infrastructure constraints which currently exist must be fully
mitigated and financed as growth occurs.
a.        Wastewater
Sewage collection and treatment in Laguna Niguel is provided primarily by the Moulton Niguel Water
District (MNWD). A small portion of Laguna Niguel near the southwesterly boundary is served by the
South Coast Water District (SCWD). The MNWD has developed a reclaimed water system to deliver
treated wastewater to landscaped areas in the City. The MNWD and SCWD currently operate below their
maximum treatment capacities and do not constrain development in the City.
b.        Water
Water for City residents is supplied by the MNWD and the SCWD. The MNWD and the SCWD are
members of the Municipal Water District of Orange County (MWDOC), which in turn is a member of the

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                              HOUSING
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD). Almost all of the water supply is purchased
from MWD, which imports water from the Colorado River Aqueduct (a small portion comes from Northern
California through the State Water Project). Domestic water supply is not expected to limit development
during the planning period.
c.        Storm Water Drainage
Regional flood control facilities consist of major collector channels and storm drains, and are maintained
by the Orange County Flood Control District (OCFCD). Five regional facilities serve the City, four of
which are located within the City limits, with the fifth facility running adjacent to the City on its westerly
boundary. Flows from within the City are conveyed to these facilities by local storm drain facilities or
overland flow. Local drainage facilities consist mostly of underground closed conduits located in the
developed areas of the City. With these facilities in place, the City’s flood control system in not expected to
limit development during the planning period.
          3.       Land Costs
Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of new housing. Land values fluctuate
with market conditions, and steadily increased from 2000 to 2006. The cost of undeveloped residential land
in southern Orange County varies according to location and other factors, and can exceed $2 million per
acre. The downturn in the housing market in 2008 affected land values negatively, however. Changes in
land prices reflect the cyclical nature of the residential real estate market. The high price of land throughout
Orange County historically has posed a significant challenge to the development of lower-income housing.
Per-unit land cost is directly affected by density – higher density allows the cost to be spread across more
units. While the City is essentially built-out to suburban densities typical of neighboring south Orange
County cities, the Gateway Specific Plan creates the opportunity to achieve higher densities on infill and
revitalization sites during the current planning period.
          4.       Construction Costs
Construction cost is affected by the price of materials, labor, development standards and general market
conditions. The City has no influence over materials and labor costs, and the building codes and
development standards in Laguna Niguel are not substantially different than most other cities in Orange
County. Construction costs for materials and labor have increased at a slightly higher pace than the general
rate of inflation according to the Construction Industry Research Board. Typical residential construction
cost is estimated to be $100-140 per square foot for standard quality development.
          5.       Cost and Availability of Financing
The recent crisis in the mortgage industry has affected the availability of real estate loans, although the
long-term effects are unpredictable. The credit “crunch” resulted when “sub-prime” lenders made it
possible for families who could not qualify for standard mortgages to become home owners even though
they might not have had the credit history and income to support repayment of the loans. The problem
typically occurred with adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) after the initial fixed interest rate period expired
(often two to three years) and the interest rate converted to market. Because ARMs often offer “teaser”
initial interest rates well below market for the first few years, monthly payments may increase by several
hundred dollars when the loan adjusts to market rate. When property values were increasing, as was the
case from 2000 to 2006, homeowners had the option of refinancing to a new loan when the initial rate
expired. However, in the current market, homeowners may owe more than the value of their home, making
refinancing impossible. As a result of these conditions, there has been a significant rise in foreclosure rates,
and changes in mortgage underwriting standards is likely to have greater impacts on low-income families
than other segments of the community.

C.      Fair Housing
Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against entire neighborhoods
in lending practices because of the physical or economic conditions in the area (“redlining”). Mortgage data
analyzed in the City’s current Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice indicates that redlining has
not occurred in any area of the City.
State law also prohibits discrimination in the development process or in real property transactions, and it is
the City’s policy to uphold the law in this regard. The City also provides financial support to the Orange
County Fair Housing Council through its CDBG program and supports fair housing activities.

V.      HOUSING PLAN
A.      Goals and Policies
Chapters II, III and IV of the Housing Element evaluate the City’s housing needs, opportunities and
constraints, while Appendix A presents a review of the previous element. This Housing Plan reflects the
City’s experience during the previous planning period and sets forth the City’s goals, policies, and
programs to address the identified housing needs and issues for the 2013-2021 planning period. Quantified
objectives for new construction, rehabilitation and conservation are also identified for this planning period.
The goals and policies that guide the City’s housing programs and activities are as follows:
Housing Diversity and Opportunities
GOAL 1:          Provide a diversity of housing opportunities that satisfy the physical, social, and
                 economic needs of existing and future residents of Laguna Niguel.
Intent:          To promote a balanced inventory of housing in terms of unit type, cost and tenure and
                 range of housing options necessary to support an economically and socially diverse
                 community. Adequate public facilities and services are important in maintaining the
                 quality of life valued by Laguna Niguel residents.
      Policy 1.1:     Ensure that housing is safe and sanitary with adequate public services to
                      accommodate the needs of City residents.
      Policy 1.2:     Promote the continued maintenance and enhancement of the existing housing stock.
      Policy 1.3:     Promote a variety of housing opportunities that accommodate the needs of all income
                      levels of the population.
      Policy 1.4:     Support innovative public, private, and non-profit efforts in development of affordable
                      housing, particularly for special needs groups.
      Policy 1.5:     Pursue county, state, and federal assistance to support the development and
                      implementation of housing programs that require financial assistance from public
                      agencies. In pursuing funding opportunities, in distributing grant allocations (such as
                      CDBG), or in assisting other agencies or private entities, the City’s decisions will be
                      based on the following factors:
                       x    the priority of housing need addressed by the proposed project;
                       x    the City’s non-housing priorities for the use of an annual funding source (such as
                            CDBG) in relation to the priority of the proposed project;
                       x    the likelihood that the proposed project will receive funding from other sources
                            based on those sources’ application rating criteria; and
                       x    the amount of staff time and other costs required to secure and administer
                            funding in relation to available staff resources.
      Policy 1.6:     Monitor the number of affordable housing units eligible for conversion to market-rate
                      units and develop programs to minimize the loss of these units.
August 20, 2013                                                                                             53

Equal Opportunities for All Residents
GOAL 2:          Maintain equal housing opportunities for all residents in Laguna Niguel
Intent:          To prohibit discrimination in housing practices in accordance with federal and state fair
                 housing law.
      Policy 2.1:      Encourage and support the enforcement of laws and regulations prohibiting the
                       discrimination in lending practices in the sale or rental of housing.
      Policy 2.2:      Support actions to reduce regulatory constraints which impede equal housing
                       opportunities.
      Policy 2.3:      Ensure that City land use and housing policies and regulations do not create
                       unreasonable barriers to housing and housing support services to special needs
                       population groups such as the elderly, families with children, persons with
                       disabilities, and the mentally ill.
B.      Housing Programs
Laguna Niguel offers a variety of housing opportunities to meet the needs of the community. This section
of the Housing Plan addresses the issues identified in the previous sections of this Housing Element and
provides strategies and actions to achieve the City’s housing goals. Table V-1 summarizes the programs,
objectives, funding sources, responsible agencies, and time frames for implementation.
Program 1        Provision of Adequate Housing Sites
Objective:       Identify adequate sites for housing commensurate with the City’s identified housing need
                 in the RHNA allocation.
      Action 1.1:      The potential housing sites shown in Appendix B, including approved projects and
                       vacant sites, contain adequate capacity to accommodate the City’s RHNA allocation
                       in all income categories. In order to ensure that adequate capacity is maintained
                       throughout the planning period, the City will comply with the “no net loss’ provision
                       of Government Code Sec. 65863 and report on the progress toward meeting the
                       RHNA objectives each year in the Annual General Plan Implementation Report. The
                       City’s efforts to facilitate development commensurate with the RHNA are described in
                       Program 3 below.
      Action 1.2:      In order to encourage and facilitate multi-family and mixed-use development in the
                       Gateway Specific Plan area, the following incentives will be provided:
                        x   Increased residential density and floor area ratio will be permitted when
                            affordable housing is provided.
                        x   CDBG or other available funding assistance may be allocated to projects that
                            include multi-family units targeted for extremely-low-income households.
                        x   City staff will provide administrative assistance to affordable housing developers
                            in preparing grant applications.
                        x   A current inventory of vacant sites suitable for multi-family residential or mixed-
                            use development will be maintained on the City website.
                        x   At least once each year the City will publicize development opportunities within
                            the Gateway Specific Plan area.
August 20, 2013                                                                                             54

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                          HOUSING
Program 2 – Sites for Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing
Objective:      Promote and assist in the               development      of    emergency     shelters    and
                transitional/supportive housing.
     Action 2.1:     While surveys have not identified a significant local homeless population in Laguna
                     Niguel, the City will continue to monitor the issue of homelessness in the future,
                     continue its participation in the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force, and
                     continue to allocate an appropriate level of CDBG funding in relation to the local
                     need.
     Action 2.2:     The City will continue to implement the provisions of state law that define transitional
                     and supportive housing as residential uses subject to the same standards and
                     procedures as apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
Program 3 – Affordable Housing Development
Objective:      Promote, assist, and remove constraints on the development of housing for low- and
                moderate-income households, including units affordable to persons with extremely-low
                incomes.
     Action 3.1:     The City will continue to implement its affordable housing regulations (Subarticle 3,
                     §9-1-37 of the Laguna Niguel Zoning Code) in compliance with the current provisions
                     of Government Code §65915 (state density bonus law) which provides for a density
                     increase of up to 35 percent over the otherwise maximum allowable residential
                     density (or bonuses of equivalent financial value) for developers who agree to
                     construct housing developments with units affordable to low- or moderate-income
                     households or seniors.
     Action 3.2:     The City will assist developers in seeking available state and federal funding and/or
                     tax credits for the construction of low- and moderate-income housing, and will
                     facilitate projects that incorporate affordable units by granting the modification of
                     development standards, expedited processing, or other financial incentives consistent
                     with state law. The City will provide administrative assistance to interested
                     developers in accessing funding for private, local, state, or federal programs if
                     needed to develop a low- or moderate-income project. Available assistance will be
                     advertised and marketed continuously on the City website.
     Action 3.3:     The City will continue to encourage the production of housing designed specifically
                     for special needs population groups and extremely-low-income (ELI) households, in
                     conjunction with density bonuses and/or regulatory incentives described in Action 3.1
                     of this Program. Additional assistance such as modified development standards and
                     fee waivers will be provided to assist extremely-low-income units, when feasible.
                     Targeted funding assistance will be prioritized for ELI units whenever feasible.
     Action 3.4:     In accordance with §65852.1 and §65852.2 of the Government Code, the City will
                     continue to implement a second unit ordinance that allows for the construction of
                     second units on single-family lots in residential areas. Publicize the opportunities for
                     second units on the City website, at City Hall and at other community facilities.
August 20, 2013                                                                                           55

THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL                                                                          HOUSING
Program 4 – Conserve and Improve Existing Low- and Moderate-Income Housing
Objective:      There are two projects with 156 units in Laguna Niguel that are at risk of conversion to
                market-rate apartments by 2023. While the City supports efforts to conserve and improve
                the existing supply of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households, the
                level of need is greater than the financial resources under the City’s control.
     Action 4.1:     Support efforts to conserve assisted rental units currently affordable to low- and
                     moderate-income households that are at-risk of converting to market rate between
                     2013 and 2023. The City’s strategy will be to:
                      1.     Monitor the status of assisted units annually in order to assess the risk of
                             conversion to market rate.
                      2.     In collaboration with the Orange County Housing & Community Services
                             Department, encourage the owners of at-risk properties to maintain their rental
                             units as affordable housing in exchange for appropriate financial incentives.
                      3.     Depending on the interest of property owners and County HCS, allocate a
                             portion of the City’s CDBG funds to assist in extending affordability
                             covenants for at-risk units, and work with potential purchasers of at-risk
                             properties to extend affordability covenants.
                      4.     In cooperation with County HCS, provide educational materials to tenants of
                             properties with expiring covenants regarding options for securing other
                             affordable housing.
     Action 4.2:     Continue the City’s active property maintenance program run by the Code
                     Enforcement Division of the Community Development Department. Under this
                     program, code enforcement staff has an ongoing routine of conducting “windshield”
                     surveys, covering all property in Laguna Niguel every two to three months. Code
                     enforcement officers take note of and follow up on issues they may find that threaten
                     public health, safety, and welfare, such as fire hazards, polluted waters, refuse and
                     waste, overgrown or dead vegetation, and unsafe structures, all in accordance with
                     Municipal Code Division 14 (Nuisances). The program will help to maintain the
                     City’s existing housing stock in good condition to prevent the need for rehabilitation.
     Action 4.3:     Participate in existing Homesharing Programs that benefit Laguna Niguel residents.
                     This program is designed to match people with limited incomes, typically seniors,
                     seeking housing as well as owners that wish to share their homes.
     Action 4.4:     Continue to administer the City's Condominium Conversion Ordinance.
     Action 4.5:     Require the replacement of low-income units converted or removed in the Coastal
                     Zone according to the requirements of Government Code §65590. The program shall
                     also include a component to monitor the construction, demolition, and conversion of
                     units affordable to low- and moderate-income households in the Coastal Zone.

                    served.
     Action 6.3:    Whenever land use regulations, land use designations, or housing programs are
                    proposed for adoption or modification, the Community Development Department
