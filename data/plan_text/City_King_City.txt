Introduction
1.1 Introduction
California law recognizes the vital role local governments play in the supply and affordability
of housing. Each local government in California is required to adopt a comprehensive, long-
term General Plan for the physical development of the city or county. In compliance with
Government Article 10.6, a Housing Element is to be adopted as one of the seven mandated
elements of the General Plan. Housing Element law, first enacted in 1969, mandates that local
governments adequately plan to meet the existing and projected housing needs of all economic
segments of the community. The State Legislature has found that “the availability of housing
is of vital statewide importance, and the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable
living environment for every California family is a priority of the highest order.” (Government
Code §65580(a)). The Housing Element establishes goals, policies and programs to facilitate
and encourage the provision of safe, adequate housing for its current and future residents of
all income levels.
The Housing Element differs from other required elements, in that the State mandates that
it include specific information and analyze population and housing trends. Also, unlike other
General Plan elements, the Housing Element must be submitted to the California State
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for review and certification.
                                                                                                            1

Chapter 1. Public Participation
        1.2 The City of King 2007-2014 Housing Element
        The greatest areas of existing housing need in the City of King are the provision of apartments
        for renters and the provision of affordable townhomes and condominiums for young families.
        A large share of the population still earns lower incomes, as evidenced by significant levels of
        overcrowding and overpayment. In the future, job growth will bring a need for more affordable
        housing to accommodate the agricultural industry, wholesale/retail industry, and some business
        services. However, there will also be a need to expand single-family housing opportunities for
        higher income earners.
        The City of King faces several key housing issues:
        1) Providing housing affordable to all segments of the population;
        2) Preserving the quality of the housing stock;
        3) Providing adequate residential sites to accommodate the City’s future housing needs; and
        4) Achieving a balance between employment and housing opportunities.
        As mandated by State law, the planning period for this Housing Element extends from January
        1, 2007, to June 30, 2014. This Element identifies strategies and programs that focus on:
        1) Conserving and improving existing affordable housing;
        2) Providing adequate housing sites;
        3) Assisting in the development of affordable housing;
        4) Removing governmental and other constraints to housing development;
        5) Promoting equal housing opportunities; and
        6) Encouraging efficient use of land and energy resources in relationship to
            residential development.
        The Housing Element consists of the following major components, as required by State law:
        Review the Previous Housing Element: The City must review the actual results of the policies,
        programs, and quantified objectives adopted in the previous Housing Element and analyze the
        difference between what was projected and what was achieved.
        Housing Needs Assessment: The Housing Element must include a community profile
        of population characteristics, housing information, housing stock, tenure, and housing
        affordability. The City must also consider special housing needs of the community, such as
        seniors, farmworkers, homeless, large households, and female-headed households.
        Projected Housing Needs: California law requires the Department of Housing and Community
        Development to project statewide housing needs and allocate the need to each region in the
        State. After consulting with the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG), HCD

                                                                               Chapter 1. Public Participation
provided the regional need to AMBAG. It is AMBAG’s responsibility to allocate the projected
needs to the unincorporated County and to each of the incorporated cities within the region.
Land Inventory: The City must compile relevant information on the zoning, acreage, density
ranges, availability of services and infrastructure, and dwelling unit capacity of sites that are
suitable for residential development.
Governmental and Nongovernmental Constraints: The City must identify and analyze
impediments to the development of housing for all income levels.
Program of Actions: The City must develop housing programs that meet local housing goals,
quantify objectives, and fulfill HCD requirements. The City must develop quantified objectives
for new construction, rehabilitation, and conserved units by income category (i.e. very low, low,
moderate, and above moderate) to make sure that both the existing and the projected housing
needs are met, consistent with the City’s share of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA).
1.3 Data Sources
Various information sources have been used to prepare the Housing Element, with 1990
and 2000 Census Data representing the primary sources. Other sources used to update and
supplement the Census data, included:
•	  Population and demographic data from the State Department of Finance.
•	  Housing market information, such as home sales, rents, and vacancies.
•	  Public and non-profit agencies were consulted for data on special needs groups, the services
    available to them, and gaps in the system.
1.4 Relationship to the General Plan
The 2007-2014 Housing Element is one of the eight elements of the City General Plan. The City
of King adopted its General Plan in 1998. The City’s General Plan includes the Land Use Element,
Circulation Element, Housing Element, Noise Element, Conservation/Open Space/and Safety
Element, and the Economic Element. The Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan
Elements and is consistent with the policies set forth in those elements.
The City will ensure consistency between the Housing Element and other General Plan
elements so that policies introduced in one element are consistent with other elements. At this
time, the Housing Element does not propose significant changes to any other element of the
City’s General Plan. However, if it becomes apparent that over time changes to any element
are needed for internal consistency, such changes will be proposed for consideration by the
Planning Commission and City Council. In the event the rezoning is necessary to accomplish the
                                                                                                             3

Chapter 1. Public Participation
        Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), the General Plan will be amended, as appropriate.
        Due to the passage of AB 162 relating to flood protection, the City may be required to amend the
        Safety and Conservation Elements of the General Plan. If amendments are needed the Housing
        Element will be amended to be consistent with the Safety and Conservation Elements.
        1.5 Public Participation
        Community involvement allows residents to provide input on housing issues and helps in the
        development of strategies to address the housing needs of the City of King residents. Given
        limited resources, the City developed an appropriate and cost-effective outreach program that
        maximized input across different segments of the community. The City’s outreach program
        involved the three components listed below. In addition, through a Caltrans Grant awarded to
        the City for downtown planning, the City has been able to expand and continue the discussion
        of housing needs and opportunities. This outreach effort is also discussed below.
        1) One-on-one interviews of key housing and service providers;
        2) A fully-noticed workshop on the Housing Element;
        3) Conducting Public hearings for adoption before the City Council and Planning Commission;
        and
        4) Public review and comment.
        Interviews: As part of the Housing Element update, one-on-one interviews were conducted with
        key housing and service providers, major employers, and several key developers. Information
        from these interviews are incorporated into the Housing Element where appropriate. These
        interviews helped to define housing needs within the community, identify constraints, as well
        as discuss opportunities for future housing growth.
        Workshop: A workshop was held on November 12, 2008, to discuss the Housing Element process,
        address changes to State Housing Element law, and create an opportunity for community
        dialogue. The workshop was noticed in the City of King Rustler newspaper and at City Hall.
        Public Hearings for Adoption: Public outreach will continue through the completion and
        adoption of the Element. The Planning Commission, the City Council, and public will have
        additional opportunities to comment in several duly-noticed public hearings. Copies of the
        draft Housing Element will be available for review on the City website, City Hall, the public
        library, and local schools.
        Downtown Planning Effort: The City of King was recently awarded (early 2009) a Caltrans
        Environmental Justice Grant for strategic planning for the City’s historic downtown (Historic
        Corridor Revitalization Plan). The Plan will provide guidance and recommendations for

                                                                               Chapter 1. Public Participation
enhancing business opportunities, housing, streetscapes, and other community services and
activities. The Plan will also propose new development standards that generate investment
opportunity and facilitate the construction and renovation of downtown mixed-use and
residential buildings.
A robust and inclusive public participation process has been established for developing the
Historic Corridor Revitalization Plan. This includes stakeholder interviews and three workshops.
The interviews were held in July 2009; the first workshop was held in July 2009; the second
workshop was held in September 2009; and the third workshop is scheduled for January 2010.
The preparation and implementation of the Housing Element has benefitted from this process.
Much of the discussion has centered on the housing market, needs, and constraints. To a large
extent the comments reinforce ideas and programs in the Housing Element, however, new
ideas will be incorporated into the document.
The City was also awarded a 2010 Caltrans Environmental Justice Grant. These funds should
be received early next year and will enable the City to continue the downtown planning and
outreach efforts.
Public Review and Comment: In October, copies of the Draft Housing Element for HCD’s 60 day
review were distributed to organizations that represent low-and moderate-income households.
Agencies that received letters include: the Monterey County Housing, Inc., United Farm Workers-
Salinas Office, Community Housing Improvement Systems and Planning Associations, Inc.
(CHISPA), and the Housing Advocacy Council of Monterey. No comments were received.

        Population and Households
        As of 2006 the City of King had 11,225 citizens. The City is expected to grow to approximately
        15,484 people by 2010 (AMBAG, 2004). Figure 2.1 below depicts the population increase in the
        City of King, Soledad, and Monterey County between 1990 and 2006. Between 1990 and 2000,
        the City of King grew by over 45 percent (4.5 percent average annual growth) while the number
        of housing units grew by less than 20 percent. More recently, growth slowed significantly. The
        population grew only 1.2 percent between 2000 and 2006 (0.2 percent annual average growth).
        The growth in nearby Soledad was similar between 1990 and 2000 at 57 percent (5.7 percent
        annual average growth)1. Growth in Monterey County as a whole has been much more gradual
        than either the City of King or Soledad at just under 13 percent between 1990 and 2000 (1.3
        percent annual average growth) and at just 2 percent from 2000 to 2006 (0.4 percent annual
        average growth).

crops accounted for over $2.5 billion in total value, while fruits and nuts contributed over $900
million in total value. The Salinas Valley produced over 40 percent of the nation’s strawberries
as of 2007, and was listed as the second-largest crop grown in the County (Monterey County
Agriculture Commissioner, 2007). Table 2.6 lists some of the City’s major employers.

   2.2 Overcrowding & Overpayment
   Overcrowding
   The Census defines an overcrowded unit as one occupied by 1.01 more persons per room
   (excluding bathroom and kitchen). Units with more than 1.5 persons per room are considered
   extremely overcrowded. Overcrowding can occur where there are not enough adequately
   sized units in a community. Over time, overcrowding can impact the condition of the housing
   stock and stress infrastructure.
   Overcrowding is a significant issue in the City of King, especially in renter-occupied households.
   In 2000, 26 percent of owner-occupied households were overcrowded while 53 percent of
   renter-occupied households were overcrowded (see Table 2.7). Moreover, 33 percent of the
   renter-occupied units were severely overcrowded. In the County, approximately 7 percent
   of owner-occupied households and 29 percent of renter-occupied households were over-
   crowded in 2000.
   To address overcrowding, the Housing Element includes programs to increase the supply of
   multi-family units with three or more bedrooms and to expand affordability by working with
   non-profits to assemble land and write down development costs.

   Overpayment
   Overpayment is defined as paying more than 30 percent of household income on housing
   costs, including utilities. In the City of King, approximately 29 percent of owner-occupied
   households and 40 percent of renter-occupied households are paying more than 30 percent of
   their income towards housing (see Tables 2.8 and 2.9).
                                                                                                                  13
Chapter 2. Existing Conditions
        The impacts of high housing costs fall disproportionately on lower income households,
        especially renters. Most of the renter-occupied units overpaying earns less than $20,000 per
        year.
        To address overpayment, the City of King proposes a variety of programs to expand affordability.
        The City will focus its redevelopment set aside on new construction of affordable units and
        leverage these resources with State funds. Other strategies include proactive outreach to
        project proponents and single-family rehabilitation programs.

2.3 Extremely Low Income Housing Needs
Extremely low income households earn 30 percent or less of median income. The median
income in the County is $64,000 for a family of four. This results in an extremely low income of
$19,440 or less for a four-person household. Of the 2,783 households in the City, 344 renters and
82 owners (about 15 percent of all households) have household income less than 30 percent of
median income. As Table 2.10 illustrates, these households have a higher percentage of housing
problems and a greater cost burden than other households.

Based on State law methodology, the City estimates that 50 percent of its very low income
housing allocation are extremely low income households. As a result, from the very-low
income need of 128 units (see Table 4.1), the City has a projected need of 64 units for extremely
low income. Most extremely low income households receive public assistance, such as social
security or disability insurance.
To address the need for extremely low income households, the City will employ a number of
strategies, including promoting a variety of housing types and working with non-profit builders
that specialize in supportive housing for extremely low-income households.
2.4 Housing Stock Characteristics
Age of Housing Stock
The majority of the City of King housing, nearly 78 percent, was built between 1960 and 2000.
Moreover, the period between 1990 and 2000 saw the largest growth in number of housing
units in the City with roughly 24 percent built. The first half of the century (1949 or earlier) saw
only 11 percent of the City of King’s existing housing built (see Table 2.11).
                                                                                                              15

        2.5 Housing Conditions
        A housing conditions survey was conducted in June 2008 to determine the number of units
        considered to be substandard in quality or in need of repair or replacement. The survey was
        conducted through a windshield study that rates the physical condition of a unit. Information
        compiled by the survey included five structural categories: foundation, roofing, siding, windows,
        and electrical. Based on scores assigned to the five categories, each housing structure was rated
        as being sound, in need of minor repairs, in need of moderate repairs, in need of substantial
        repairs, or dilapidated.
        Although most of the units were found to be in sound condition, Table 2.12 details the results
        of the housing conditions survey. According to the survey, the majority of units that required
        some level of repair fell into the “minor” category with about 23 percent of the total units
        surveyed. No units were found to be dilapidated. Very few units were found to need substantial
        repair.

      Households by Income
      Table 2.19 shows the distribution of income for the City of King and Soledad. As of 2000, the
      largest percentage of households in the City of King earned between $0 - $24,999 (35 percent
      of the total number of households). The second highest percentage of households earned
      between $45,000 - $99,999, (31 percent of the total number of households. Recent studies
      conducted for the City indicate that household income has decreased from 1990 to 2008, from
      $69,000 to $61,800 (adjusted for inflation).

      Cost of Housing
      The average rent in the City of King in 2000 was $644 per month while the average home-value
      was $138,700 (U.S. Census, 2000). These numbers were higher overall in Monterey County with
      an average rent of $776 per month and home value of $265,800. Soledad’s rents were lower at
      $623 per month with a higher average home value of $153,800 (See Table 2.20).
      The average prices of homes and townhomes sold in southern Monterey County in recent years
      are shown in Figures 2.4 and 2.5. While the median home value fell significantly between 2006
      and 2007, the median town home value increased over the same period.

Housing Affordability
To meet the housing needs of various income groups, housing in the community must be
affordable. Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning
a home to the average income levels of households. Table 2.21 shows the annual income for
households by the size of the family and the maximum amount that could be paid for housing.
Typical costs for utilities, taxes, and property insurance are also shown.
Moderate Income Households
The annual income for a moderate-income household ranges from $54,500 to $84,000
depending on family size. Based on these income levels, the maximum affordable home price
ranges from $175,000 to $$281,000 with a maximum affordable rent of $1,363 to $1,554. As a
result, moderate income households can afford some single-family homes in the City of King
and many rental units. However, since a number of newer, larger homes are priced at over
$300,000 much of the City’s newer housing stock is beyond the price range that can be afforded
by moderate-income households without significant down payment assistance.
Lower Income Households
Lower income households earn 80% or less of the County’s median family income which
translates to between $36,300 and $56,000 per year for low income households and less for
very low income households. Based on their income, low income households cannot afford to
purchase a single-family home, but could afford the majority of apartment rentals in the City
of King. With the exception of small apartments, and mobile home rentals, very low income
households are unable to afford the cost of virtually all apartment rentals in the City without
assuming a high housing cost burden.

        2.7 Assisted Housing Developments “At Risk ”of Conversion
        As required by State law, this Section evaluates the City’s affordable housing that is at-risk of
        converting to market rates.
        As Table 2.21 shows, the City of King has several projects that are publicly assisted under
        federal, State, or local programs, including tax credits, HUD, state/local bond programs, density
        bonuses, and local redevelopment or direct assistance programs. Most of these projects are
        secure for affordable housing. However, Riverview Gardens converted to market rate in 2008.
        The Leo A. Meyer project includes 44 units of low and very low-income senior housing originally
        constructed as a tax credit project. It is now owned and managed by Monterey County
        Housing Authority (MCHA). The City of King Migrant Camp consists of 76 units. The Camp is
        operated by MCHA and will remain as low income housing in perpetuity. The 40-unit La Buena
        Esperanza project was constructed in 1982 through cooperation between the Farmers Home
        Administration (FmHA) and CHIPSA. This project provides affordable housing exclusively for
        farm laborers and their families and is expected to remain affordable in perpetuity. Riverview
        Gardens were low and very-low owner occupied townhomes. These units were deed restricted
        for a period of 10 years ending in July 2008.

2.8 Opportunities for Energy Conservation
This Section describes opportunities for conserving energy in existing homes as well as in
new residential construction. This Section also discusses the factors affecting energy use and
conservation programs currently available in the City of King.
Planning to maximize energy efficiency and the incorporation of energy conservation and
green building features can contribute to reduced housing costs for homeowners and renters.
In addition, energy efficient community design can reduce dependence on automobiles. Energy
efficiency reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which contributes to global climate change. In
response to recent legislation on global climate change, local governments are now required
to implement measures that cut greenhouse gas emissions attributable to land use decisions.
The Housing Element supports energy efficiency that benefits the community, the housing
market and the changing climate by:
         Establishing a more compact urban core, bringing residents close to work and services,
         therefore reducing automobile trips and emissions that add to the global climate
         change;
         Implementing passive solar construction techniques that require solar orientation,
         thermal massing, and other energy efficient design techniques;
         Working with local banks to encourage retrofitting of foreclosed homes with energy
         efficient windows, doors, and lighting. This will help reduce both the monthly energy
         bills and monthly expenses; and
         Encouraging the use of solar water and space heating.
Programs for energy conservation in new and existing housing are supported by the City
through application of State residential building standards that establish energy performance
criteria for new residential buildings (Title 24 of the California Administrative Code).
Through appropriate land use policies and development standards that reduce energy
consumption, such as promoting more compact, walkable neighborhoods, with housing close
to transit, jobs, community facilities and shopping; encouraging infill development; planning
and zoning for multi-use and higher density development; permitting cluster development;
and promoting passive and active solar design elements and systems in new and rehabilitated
housing, the City can achieve its energy conservation goals.
                                                                                                            25

Special Housing Needs
This Chapter identifies groups that may require special housing characteristics. These groups
include persons with disabilities, the elderly, large families, female-headed households,
farmworkers, and families and persons in need of emergency shelters, or transitional housing.
                                                                                                     27
Chapter 3. Special Housing Needs
        3.1 Persons with Disabilities
        Housing needs for those with disabilities vary depending on the severity of the disability.
        Many disabled persons live in their own home in an independent situation or with other family
        members. While figures provided by the Census provide useful information regarding the
        disabled population, not all disabled need accessible (based on Americans with Disabilities Act
        (ADA) standards) or low-income housing. According to the 2000 Census, there are 3,240 persons
        age five and over in the City of King with a disability (See Table 3.1). Of these residents 178 have
        a sensory disability, 543 have a physical disability, 357 have a mental disability, 201 have a
        self-care disability, 864 have a go-outside the home disability, and 1,047 have an employment
        disability. These categories are defined below.
      Disability Types
          Sensory disability: Blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing impairment.
          Physical disability: A condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical activities
          such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying.
          Mental disability: Difficulty learning, remembering, or concentrating.
          Self-care disability: Difficulty dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home.
          Going outside of home disability: Difficulty going outside the home alone to shop or visit
          a doctor’s office.
          Employment disability: Difficulty working at a job or business.
        Physically disabled persons may require modifications to housing such as wheelchair ramps,
        elevators or lifts, wide doorways, accessible cabinetry, modified fixtures and appliances, etc.
        If the disability prevents the person from operating a vehicle, then proximity to services and
        access to public transportation are also important. People with severe or mental disabilities
        may also require supportive housing, nursing facilities, or care facilities. If the physical disability
        prevents individuals from working or limits their income, then the cost of housing and the costs
        of modifications can increase. Many disabled people rely solely on Social Security Income,
        which is insufficient for market rate housing.
        The State requires that those with disabilities receive reasonable accommodation for housing
        opportunities. An analysis of housing constraints for residents with disabilities is included
        under the constraints discussion in Chapter 6.

Chapter 3. Special Housing Needs
        A growing number of architects and developers are integrating universal design principles into
        their projects to increase the accessibility of the built environment. The intent of universal
        design is to simplify design and construction by making products, communications, and the
        built environment more usable by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation
        or specialized design. By applying these principles, in addition to the regulations specified in
        the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), new construction will increase the opportunities
        in housing and employment for everyone. The City of King has proposed a new program to
        encourage the use of universal design.
        According to the U.S. Census, the following are the seven principles of universal design as
        outlined by the Center for Universal Design:
                Principles of Universal Design
                    Equitable Use: The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse
                    abilities.
                    Flexibility in Use: The design accommodates a wide range of individual
                    preferences and abilities.
                    Simple and Intuitive: Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of
                    the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration
                    level.
                    Perceptible Information: The design communicates necessary information
                    effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory
                    abilities.
                    Tolerance for Error: The design minimizes hazards and the adverse
                    consequences of accidental or unintended action.
                    Low Physical Effort: The design can be used efficiently and comfortably
                    with minimum fatigue.
                    Size and Space for Approach and Use: Appropriate size and space is
                    provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's
                    body size, posture, or mobility.
                                                                   Source: Center for Universal Design, 2002

3.2 Elderly
Seniors households are included in those with special housing needs because they are more
likely to have limited income, physical disabilities, or higher health care costs.
As of the 2000 Census, there were 384 senior households in the City of King (312 owner and 72
renter) (see Table 3.2). In 2000, the number of elderly living below the poverty level was only 1
percent of the total population (see Table 3.3). The median income of seniors ($28,222 for those
aged 65 to 74 and $14,389 for those aged 75 and older) was significantly lower than the overall
City median income ($34,398). A large proportion of the senior population also experiences
one or more disabilities.

Chapter 3. Special Housing Needs
        The special needs of seniors can be met by congregate care, rent subsidies, shared housing,
        and housing rehabilitation assistance. For the frail or disabled, elderly housing with
        architectural design features that accommodate disabilities can help extend the ability of
        seniors to live independently. In addition, seniors with mobility/self care limitations benefit
        from transportation alternatives. Senior housing with supportive services can be provided to
        facilitate independent living. The City has a 46-unit project for very low-income seniors, which
        is owned and managed by the County Housing Authority.
        According to the Monterey County Regional Guide and Search Engine, the City of King offers a
        multitude of senior services. Services provided range from nutrition programs to social services,
        and are listed below.

        3.3 Large Households
        Large households are defined as units that contain 5 or more individuals. The 2000 Census
        indicates that there are 1,004 (36 percent) large households in the City of King (see Table
        3.4). In the County, 25 percent of the households are classified as large and in Soledad the
        percentage is 43 (see Tables 3.5 and 3.6). In the City of King, 497 large households (50 percent
        of large households) are renter-occupied households. In Monterey County, 49 percent and in
        Soledad 37 percent of large households are in renter-occupied housing (see Tables 3.5 and 3.6).
        As a percentage of total householders, the number of large households in the City of King is
        significantly larger than in the County.

        3.4 Female-Headed Households
        Single-parent households headed by females may have special needs such as accessible day
        care, health care, and other supportive services. Tables 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9 display information
        about female-headed households and families in the City of King, Soledad, and Monterey
        County. Female-headed households often only have income from one parent and higher family
        expenses. As of 2000, 38 percent of female-headed households with children in the City of King
        lived in poverty. There are limited options for low-income families, especially larger families,
        with single parents in the City of King.

Chapter 3. Special Housing Needs
        3.5 Farmworkers
        Farmworkers are a prominent special housing needs group in the City of King. Agriculture is
        an important aspect of the City’s economy and seasonal and permanent farmworkers makeup
        a large percentage of those working in the agricultural sector (see Table 3.10). Housing
        affordability has historically been an issue for farmworkers and continues to be so today. Some
        issues contributing to this challenge include low incomes, large family sizes, and language
        barriers. According to the USDA, in 2002 there were over 31,000 farmworkers in Monterey
        County (USDA, 2002). The 2000 Census identified 1,572 people working in agriculture, forestry,
        fishing, or hunting in the City of King. It is difficult to know how accurate these numbers are as
        under-reporting is common especially for those in the U.S. without documentation.
        According to Monterey County’s Regional Housing Needs Plan of 2002 farmworkers earn
        significantly less than the California Self-Sufficiency Standard. This standards is the estimated
        amount of income required to meet basic needs in the regular “marketplace” without subsidies
        (AMBAG, 2002). The California Self-Sufficiency Standard in 2002 was $40,482. The average
        annual income of farmworkers in Monterey County at the same time was $11,000.
        In the City of King, many farmworkers reside in substandard living conditions. For migrant
        workers, the City permits labor camps in the Agricultural Zone pursuant to a Conditional Use
        Permit. The Monterey County Housing Authority operates the City of King Migrant Camp on
        Jayne Street. The camp is open for 6 months of the year, from June to November, and houses
        76 migrant farm workers and their families.
        Community Housing Improvement Systems and Planning Associates, Inc. (CHISPA) has played
        an important role in developing housing for farmworkers in the City of King. The 40-unit La
        Buena Esperanza project was constructed in 1982 through a cooperative effort of the Farmers
        Home Administration (FmHA) and CHISPA. This project provides affordable housing exclusively
        for farm laborers and their families. In addition, approximately 300 mobile homes are available
        in the City, many of which rent at levels affordable to farm worker families.

3.6 People in Need of Emergency Shelter
In 2007, there were 3,766 homeless people in the County, 35 percent unsheltered and 65 percent
were living in a shelter. (Monterey County, 2007 and 2008). However, the City of King’s homeless
population consists of between 10 and 15 single persons at any given time. The City’s homeless
population is often sighted residing under bridges, in City parks, or walking in the downtown
area. Several of these individuals have mental disabilities or substance abuse problems. Those
with substance abuse problems are referred to the Sun Street Community Recovery Center in
the City of King, which provides referral and assessment services and DUI night classes. Those
needing treatment or housing services are referred to treatment centers in Salinas.
According to the Salvation Army, the number of visible homeless typically consists of single
persons or those traveling through the City of King that suddenly find themselves without
funds. While no shelters are located within the City, Salvation Army provides food, motel and
gas vouchers for those needing emergency assistance. Those needing long term shelter must
travel or are provided assistance to Salinas where shelter beds are located. On occasion several
churches may provide food or monetary donations to the Salvation Army.
Although the number of homeless persons in the City of King is very small, there is also a
number of “at risk” low income families in the City of King that are without a home but not
visible on the street. These families often stay with friends, relatives or group together to share
a house or apartment. Several long term motels are also used by those unable to afford to the
down payment on an apartment. These motels tend to be expensive and often house families,
particularly, single mothers with children, and agricultural workers.
                                                                                                            37

Projected Housing Needs
4.1 Regional Housing Needs
State housing element law (California Government Code § 65580 et. seq.) requires regional
councils of government (COG) to identify for each city and county its “fair share allocation” of the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) provided by the California Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD). The Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments
(AMBAG), the COG for the City of King area, adopted the RHNA in February 2008. AMBAG took
into account several factors in preparing the RHNA, including projected household formation,
job growth, and regional income distribution. In turn, each city and county must address
their local share of regional housing needs in their housing elements. See Table 4.1 for the
2007 - 2014 Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the City of King. Soledad, Salinas, and the
unincorporated County are included for comparison purposes.
                                                                                                          39

        limits for, very-low, low, moderate, and above moderate income households established by the
        U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (California Health and Safety Code
        § 50079.5). Monterey County’s 2008 income limits are shown in Table 4.2.

The City of King can take credit for units built or approved since the beginning of the planning

 Since the City of King has very little vacant or underutilized land (see Chapter 5 - Sites Inventory
 and Analysis), Monterey County recognizes that the City is relying on its contemplated Sphere
 of Influence change(s) to accommodate new housing consistent with its housing allocation. As
 such, housing in areas that are annexed within the planning period can be credited toward the
 City’s allocation (see Appendix B for the County letter).
                                                                                                            41

Sites Inventory and Analysis
5.1 Vacant Land Inventory
State law governing the preparation of housing elements emphasizes the importance of an
adequate land supply by requiring that each housing element “. . . identify adequate sites . .
. to facilitate and encourage the development of a variety of types of housing for all income
levels . . .” (Government Code Section 65583(c)(1)). If an adequate supply of new housing is to
be provided, enough vacant land must be zoned to allow for the construction of a variety of
housing at densities that will satisfy the objectives of the housing element. The land must also
have access to appropriate public services, such as water, sewage treatment, storm drainage,
and roads.
The City’s land inventory was developed with the use of a combination of resources including
the City’s GIS database, aerial photos, field surveys, and review of the City’s Land Use Element
and Zoning Ordinance. As Table 5.1 indicates, there are over 500 vacant parcels suitable for
residential development that have the capacity to accommodate a realistic development level of
751 units (see also Figure 5.1). The anticipated buildout for vacant parcels not in the specific
plan areas is based on historical trends and the assumption that a certain portion of the land is not
suitable or desirable for development. There may be political barriers to full development, as well.
The specific plans are expected to be built out at near capacity (See Appendix A for a full list of
vacant parcels by Assessor Parcel Number.)
                                                                                                              43

Chapter 5. Sites Inventory & Analysis
        The development potential far exceeds the units required to meet the remaining regional housing
        needs allocation of 526 housing units for the current planning period (see Table 4.3). However
        the City recognizes that the State requires land zoned at 20 units per acre to meet the remaining
        very low and low income housing allocation of 208 units (see Table 4.3). At a realistic buildout,
        the vacant parcels in the R-4 zone can accommodate approximately 62 units (see Table 5.1). After
        taking into account the R-4 parcels, the city still needs to address 146 very low and low income
        units.
        Opportunity Site
        A vacant site has been identified in the southeastern portion of the City near Highway 101 and
        First Avenue as a potential site to accommodate the remaining housing need for very low- and
        low-income households (146 Units). The site is 33.7 acres (APN 235-051-010) and is currently
        zoned Highway Service (H-S). A portion of the site (7.3 acres) would need to be rezoned high
        density residential and require a minimum of 20 units per acre “by right” as proposed and
        outlined in Program 3 of the Housing Element. At least half (50 percent) of area(s) rezoned shall
        be for residential uses only. The site is next to the King City Golf Course.

Chapter 5. Sites Inventory & Analysis
        This site or another equally attractive site (e.g. Creek Bridge, Mills Ranch, or the Downtown
        Addition Specific Plan - see Sections 5.2 and 5.3 below) could meet the State adequate sites
        requirement.
        5.2 Specific Plans
        There are two specific plan areas located to the north of the City: Creekbridge and Mills Ranch
        (See Figure 5.1). At build out, these plans can accommodate 822 units. As of December 2008,
        231 units have been constructed and 591 are unbuilt. Of the unbuilt units, 59 units are multi-
        family or carriage units. Table 5.2 details the remaining parcels and housing types. Buildout of
        these plans would contribute to additional housing choices in the city.
        According to the specific plans, most of the unbuilt units were going to be single-family
        detached. However, due to the recent downturn in the housing market, there has been some
        discussion by the developer and property owners to revise the specific plans to accommodate
        higher-density, smaller units.

5.3 Pending Projects
The City is processing an application for a Specific Plan called the Draft Downtown Addition
(see Figure 5.1). The Plan covers 107.03 acres and calls for a mix of commercial and residential
uses. The maximum number of residential units allowed under the plan is 650, which range
from larger-single family detatched to smaller homes, townhomes, row houses, triplexes,
quadplexes, and live-work buildings.
The allowable units in each zone is listed below and totals 680 units. This higher number is
intended to allow flexibility for the developer, not to change the maximum number of 650
units. Two stories would be allowed throughout the plan area. Three-stories would only be
allowed with a Conditional Use Permit.
      Neighborhood General 1 - 80 units
      Neighborhood General 2 - 220 units		          Maximum allowed 650 units
      Neighborhood General 3 - 180 units
      Neighborhood Center - 200 units
Neighborhood General 1:
This zone allows detached single-family residential on larger lots.
Neighborhood General 2:
This zone allows a variety of detached single-family residential homes. Duets and multi-
generation housing are allowed (i.e. bungalow court apartments).
Neighborhood General 3:
This zone allows a wide range of residential development including courtyard housing, row
houses, triplexes, quadplexes, and a small number of detached single-family units. Live/work
units would also be allowed on certain street frontages.
Neighborhood Center:
This zone connects with the heart of the historic downtown. Residential building types may
be accommodated with a Conditional Use Permit in locations where ground floor commercial
uses are not viable.
This City has an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance (Ord. No. 637) that requires fifteen percent
of new developments be affordable to low and moderate-income households. Under this
ordinance, approximately 98 units in the project would be affordable to low and moderate
income households. Developers are required to submit housing programs to determine the
affordability thresholds and incentives.
                                                                                                           47
Chapter 5. Sites Inventory & Analysis
        5.3 Infrastructure Capacity
        The proximity, availability, and capacity of infrastructure help to determine the suitability of
        residential land. Below is an evaluation of water and sewer capacity available to accommodate
        the housing needs during the planning period.
        Wastewater Treatment
        The City’s sanitary sewer system provides collection, treatment and disposal of domestic and
        industrial wastes. The City of King Wastewater Treatment facility lies downstream along the
        Salinas River, northwest of the City. The domestic wastewater treatment and disposal facility
        has a capacity of 1.2 million gallons per day (mgd) of domestic flow.
        According to the General Plan EIR, buildout of the City of King will increase wastewater flows to
        2.4 mgd by 2015. The City of King’s existing treatment plant would be unable to accommodate
        the additional flow. Additional development will eventually require expansion of the City’s
        wastewater system. Improvements to the system will be made on an incremental basis by the
        City, as needed.
        Water System
        The City of King is served by a municipal water system owned and operated by the California
        Water Services Company. This system relies on six wells that draw from the groundwater basin
        that is recharged by the Salinas River. The Cal Water system has a maximum production capacity
        of 3 million gallons per day, current daily usage is about 1.4 million gallons. A 250,000 gallon
        storage tank with a 2,000 gallon per minute pump provides ample water pressure throughout
        the City.
        The water system appears to be generally adequate for existing development, but a new well
        site would appear to be needed as additional development occurs in the future under the
        General Plan. No significant deficiencies are known to exist with respect to water pressure,
        volume, or quality. Improvements to the system will be made on an incremental basis by Cal
        Water as needed.
        The Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) is the State agency responsible
        under State law for the management of water resources within the Salinas Valley. MCWRA has
        undertaken numerous studies of water resources and has identified an imbalance between
        current demands and available long-term water supplies. Thus, the additional net water
        required by the General Plan, buildout is considered a significant impact, but will not constrain
        the development of housing.

                                                                            Chapter 5. Sites Inventory & Analysis
In summary, infrastructure needs present potential constraints on future development. However,
the City recently conducted a “Master Facilities Plan” and “Development Impact Fee Calculation
Report” which provides for a plan to finance the construction, improvement, and replacement
of needed infrastructure resulting from housing and population growth.
5.5 Redevelopment Agency Resources
According to HCD, the Housing Element should identify redevelopment funds available to the
Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund (LMIHF) and how the funds will be utilized during the
planning period.
As of March 2009, the City of King has about $3 million in the LMIHF. The City anticipates
collecting about $275,000 per year until 2034, totaling another $6.8 million in funds.
According to H&SC Section 33334.12, the agency must use any unexpended and unencumbered
LMIHF that exceed one million dollars or the aggregate amount of tax increment deposited into
the low-moderate fund over the preceding four fiscal years. If the City identifies such a surplus
before the end of the fiscal period, then it must use the funds or transfer the funds to the local
housing authority.
Chapter 8: Goals, Policies, and Programs contains a number of program recommendations for
the Redevelopment Agency LMIHF.
Table 5.3 identifies sites owned by the redevelopment agency.

Chapter 6
Constraints
State housing law requires the City to review both governmental and non-governmental
constraints to the construction of affordable housing in order to remove and/or mitigate
potentially negative effects.
This Chapter reviews the City’s land use constraints, development processing procedures, fees,
and code enforcement for possible constraints to affordable housing production. This Chapter
also analyzes nongovernmental constraints, such as land and construction costs, to identify
other potential barriers to housing development.
6.1 Local Government Constraints
Local policies and regulations can affect the quantity and type of residential development.
Since governmental actions can constrain the development and the affordability of housing,
State law requires the housing element to “address and, where appropriate and legally possible,
remove governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of
housing” (Government Code § 65583(c)(3)).
The City of King’s primary policies and regulations that affect residential development and
housing affordability include: the Zoning Ordinance, the Land Use Element of the General Plan,
development processing procedures and fees, on and off-site improvement requirements,
and the California Building and Housing Codes. In addition to a review of these policies and
regulations, an analysis of governmental constraints on housing production for persons with
disabilities is included in this section.
                                                                                                      51

Chapter 6. Constraints
        Existing resource protection standards, including Municipal Code Chapter 17.34 (Open Space),
        Chapter 17.36 (Primary Flood Plain), Chapter 17.38 (Secondary Flood Plain), Chapter 17.40
        (Special Building Site), Chapter 17.42 (Scenic Corridor), and Chapter 17.56 (Environmental
        Protection – Pollution Standards) of the City of King Zoning Ordinance were created to
        encourage resource protection, without significantly limiting development potential.
        The City’s land use controls generally do not constrain the development of multi-family rental
        housing, manufactured housing, mobile homes, housing for agricultural employees, supportive
        housing, single-family occupancy units, and emergency shelters. When constraints were
        identified in the following analysis, programs for minimizing and mitigating those constraints
        are included in Chapter 8 (Goals, Policies, and Programs).
        The City proposes Program 19 to comply with new legislation on emergency shelters and
        transitional housing (SB 2). This legislation requires jurisdictions to permit emergency shelters
        without a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) or other discretionary permits. Transitional housing
        and supportive housing must be considered residential uses and must only be subject to the
        same restrictions that apply to the same housing types in the same zone.
        The following sections provide information on local land use regulations:
        Zoning Ordinance
        This Section describes the Zoning Districts that allow residential development, and the
        development standards for each District, followed by specific development regulations for
        multi-family housing, mixed-use development, and secondary dwelling units.
        Zoning Districts:
        The Zoning Ordinance includes an agricultural district, several residential districts, and two
        commercial districts that allow residential development. The maximum residential density
        allowed is 24 units per acre. Residential development is permitted by right and in some cases
        by Conditional Use Permit in these zoning districts. Each of these zones is outlined below.
        Agricultural District (A):
        The purpose of this District is primarily for agricultural production and processing. Residences
        for agricultural employees are allowed with a Conditional Use Permit. The City proposes
        Program 18 to comply with Health and Safety Code §17021.5 and 17021.6. Section 17021.5
        states that farmworker housing for six or fewer employees should be deemed a single-family
        residential use with the same permitting procedures. Therefore, no conditional use permit,
        zoning variance, or other zoning clearance shall be required of farmworker housing that is not
        required for single family housing. Health and Safety Code Sections 17021.6 states that any
        farmworker housing for twelve of fewer employees shall be deemed an agricultural use and
        shall not be deemed a use that differs in any other way from another agricultural use.

                                                                                        Chapter 6. Constraints
The residential zoning districts are:
a) Single Family Residential District (R-1):
The R-1 Zoning District is applied to areas appropriate for single-family residential development
with 7 units or less per acre. Second units are also permitted by right in this zone. Institutional
uses such as churches and private parochial schools are also allowed in this zone. The R-1 Zoning
District is consistent with and implements the Low Density Residential land use designation of
the General Plan.
b) Residential-Industrial Mixed Use District (R-I):
The intent of this District is as a transitional zone between industrial, agricultural, and other
uses to residential. Some industrial uses, agricultural uses, group and multi-family housing uses
are allowed in this District. Workforce housing is encouraged in this Zone. All uses in this District
are subject to a conditional use permit. There is no General Plan designation for this District.
c) Medium Density Residential District (R-2):
This District allows for slightly higher density residential development than the R-1 District. One,
two, and three unit structures and second units are permitted by right. The intent of the District
is to allow higher density while preserving a sufficient amount of privacy and open space. This
District allows maximum densities of 12 units or per acre. Other uses such as institutional and
some commercial uses are also permitted with a conditional use permit. The R-2 Zoning District
is consistent with and implements the Medium Density Residential land use designation of the
General Plan.
d) Medium High Density Residential District (R-3):
The R-3 District allows higher density than the R-1 and R-2 Districts. This Zone allows a maximum
density of 18 units per acre. Multi-family structures are allowed by right up to 6 units per acre.
Higher density is allowed with a conditional use permit. Other uses such as institutional, some
commercial uses, and senior residential care homes are allowed with a conditional use permit.
The R-3 Zoning District is consistent with and implements the Medium High Density Residential
land use designation of the General Plan.
                                                                                                           53
Chapter 6. Constraints
        e) Multiple Family Residential and Professional Offices District (R-4):
        The R-4 District allows single-family, secondary units, duplexes, multi-family, and some
        institutional residential uses by right. The maximum allowable density is 22 units per acre. The
        R-4 district implements the High Density Residential land use designation of the General Plan.
        f) Planned Development District (P-D):
        The P-D District can be applied to planned communities within the city at least 3 acres or
        greater. A specific plan is required for planned developments. The Planning Commission must
        approve these plans.
        The commercial zoning districts are:
        a) Retail Business District (C-1):
        The C-1 District is primarily a commercial zone and allows residential uses only in mixed-
        use settings. The residential must be located on the second story of a two-story building
        with commercial on the first floor. The residential cannot have a greater floor area than the
        commercial. Mixed use is allowed with a conditional use permit. The C-1 District implements
        the Retail Commercial land use designation of the General Plan.
        b) General Commercial District (C-2):
        The C-2 District is almost exclusively a commercial zone and allows residential uses only for
        caretaker residences in association with uses allowed in this Zone. This type of residential use
        in allowed with a conditional use permit. The C-2 District implements the General Commercial
        land use designation of the General Plan.

Chapter 6. Constraints
        Second Units:
        Second units can be an important source of affordable housing since they are smaller than
        primary units and they do not have direct land costs. Second units can also provide supplemental
        income to the homeowner, thus allowing the elderly to remain in their homes or moderate-
        income families to afford houses. To encourage establishment of second units, State law
        requires cities and counties to either adopt an ordinance based on State standards or, where no
        ordinance has been adopted, to allow second units according to State law requirements. Local
        governments are precluded from totally prohibiting second units in residentially zoned areas
        unless they make specific findings (Government Code § 65852.2). The City of King adopted
        Ordinance 641 in 2003, making second units a ministerially permitted use in some zoning
        districts. Section 17.47 of the Zoning Ordinance provides details regarding second units as
        allowed in the City of King.
        According to the Zoning Ordinance, a second unit is a detached or attached unit that provides
        complete independent living facilities for one or more persons. A second unit is allowed
        without a Conditional Use Permit on existing lots in the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, and P-D Districts that
        already contain a legally established principal dwelling unit. The second unit must satisfy the
        requirements in Section 17.47.015 (Conditional Use Permit Not Required).
        Table 6.3 sets out the primary standards for second units in the City of King. These standards
        do not conflict with State law governing second units.
                       Table 6.3 Second Unit Standards
                        Standard                    Second Unit

Residential Care Facilities:
It is required in California Health and Safety Code §1566.3 requires that certain types of residential
care facilities (6 persons or fewer) be permitted by right in residential zoning districts. The fees,
development standards, etc. must be no stricter than those for a single-family home in the
same districts. Program 20 is proposed to comply with State law.
Manufactured Housing and Mobile Homes:
State law requires that manufactured homes be allowed on parcels zoned for conventional
single-family units. These units cannot be regulated by any planning fees or review processes
not applicable to conventional single-family dwellings. However, the architectural design of
manufactured or mobile homes can be regulated by the City. Program 13 is proposed to comply
with State law.
Emergency Shelter/Transitional Housing:
An emergency shelter is a facility that houses homeless persons on a limited short-term
basis. Transitional housing is temporary (six months to two years) housing for an individual or
family transitioning to permanent housing. State housing law (SB2) requires that jurisdictions
designate at least one zoning district that allows emergency shelters, transitional housing, and
single-room occupancy (SRO) units as permitted uses by right. These uses may only be subject
to fees and review processes applied to residential or commercial development in the zones
where they are allowed. Under the law, the City may apply written objective standards to these
types of uses (e.g. maximum number of beds, length of stay, proximity to other emergency
shelters). Program 19 is proposed to comply with State law.
                                                                                                            59

        General Plan
        The City of King General Plan was adopted in 1998. The Land Use Element of the General
        Plan designates the following land use types: residential, commercial, industrial and other.
        Agricultural land uses are included in the other category.
        Residential uses are allowed in 4 residential land use designations, planned development, and
        one commercial land use designation. Table 6.4 lists the General Plan Land Use Designations
        allowing housing. The residential densities described below are in dwelling units per net acre
        (except Planned Development). A net acre is the actual area of a given property, exclusive of
        streets rights-of-way.

6.2 Development Processing Fees and Procedures
Government policies and ordinances regulating development affect the availability and cost
of new housing. Although land use controls have the greatest direct impact, development
approval procedures and fees can affect housing costs as well.
Permit processing requirements have increased at all levels of government in recent years.
The City of King has a number of procedures developers are required to follow. Although the
permit approval process must conform to the Permit Streamlining Act (Government Code §
65920 et. seq.), housing proposed in the City of King is subject to one or more of the following
discretionary review processes: conditional use permit review, environmental review, specific
plan review, subdivision review, architectural review, and building permit approval.
As required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the City’s permit processing
procedures include an assessment of the potential environmental impacts of the proposed
projects. If a project requires an environmental impact report, additional processing and time is
required. Many of these environmental regulations have protected the public from significant
environmental degradation and the location of certain developments on inappropriate sites
and have given the public an opportunity to comment on project impacts. This process does,
however, increase the time and cost of project approval.
Permit and Development Fees:
The City collects fees to help cover the costs of permit processing, inspections, and environmental
review. Fees charged for building permits are based on the construction values prescribed by
the California Building Code. The City also collects development impact fees in accordance with
California Government Code § 66000-66025 for the provision of services such as roads, signals,
and storm drains. These fees are generally assessed on the number of units in a residential
development and collected at the beginning of the approval process. Fees collected by the City
do not exceed the City’s costs for providing these services.
Tables 6.5 and 6.6 show current Community Development and Building and Safety permit fees
for residential development. The City additionally charges impact fees for service connection
of $2,554 per unit for single-family residential and $2,129 per unit for multi-family residential.
Total impact fees are about $12,079 per single-family unit and $2,844 per multi-family unit.
The Transportation Agency for Monterey County (TAMC) recently established a Regional
Development Impact Fee program, which applies to any new development project within the
County of Monterey. As of March 2010 no TAMC fees have been applied to any development
projects in the City of King.
                                                                                                            61

Regional Development Impact Fees
As of 2006, the Transportation Agency for Monterey County (TAMC), implemented Regional
Development Impact Fees. The program is designed to collect impact fees based on the
number of vehicle trips generated by new residential developments. The fees will be used for
transportation improvements. Fee distribution is separated according to districts within the
County: North County, Greater Salinas, Peninsula/S. Coast, and South County.
Guidelines are provided by TAMC and include instructions for calculating reduced impact fees
for affordable housing. In order to quality for the affordable housing impact fee designation,
the development must meet the definition of affordable housing set by the State Department
of Housing and Community Development on housing affordability for Monterey County -
in addition to requiring the project to be located within a half-mile radius of transportation
services. To date, there have been no TAMC fees applied to residential development permits.
Planning Permit Procedures:
Procedures for processing permits vary based on the permits involved. The following procedures
are common to the permitting process:
a)	     Pre-application meeting with the Director or Staff
b)	     Filing of application and fees
c)	     Initial application review – completeness check
d)	     Environmental Review
e)	     Staff Report and recommendation
f )	    Permit approval or disapproval
                                                                                                       63

        Inclusionary Housing Ordinance:
        The City adopted an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance in 2003 (Zoning Ordinance Section 17.19),
        requiring residential developments to construct units affordable to low- and moderate-income
        households. The intent of this regulation is to promote voluntary private efforts to develop
        affordable housing by offering public incentives for this production.
        The key aspects of the ordinance are listed below:
             •	  Developments of thirty or more housing units shall make at least fifteen percent of the
                 units affordable for low to moderate-income households.
             •	  Developments of less than thirty housing units shall provide:
                      ºº One affordable unit for projects from seven to 10 units.
                      ºº Two affordable units for projects from 11 to 20 units.
                      ºº Three affordable units for projects from 21 to 29 units.
             •	  The ordinance does not specify the levels of affordability (e.g. how many units should
                 be very low, low, or moderate).
        In consideration of developer participation, the city may offer incentives as it deems appropriate
        to developers of low or moderate income housing in the City. For example, the City may
        encourage developer participation or may offset the costs of developer participation, through
        density increases, non-general fund subsidies, mortgage revenue bonds, and waivers of fees
        or requirements or other such incentives in support of the construction of low-to-moderate
        income housing. The ordinance does discuss specifics in terms of the amount of subsidies,
        available fee waivers, or reductions of other requirements.
        The City of King has been successful in implementing this ordinance. In 2004, Creekbridge
        Homes was approved with a requirement of 60 affordable units at buildout. Thirty two of these
        units have been built. The Mills Ranch Development was also approved in 2004 and will provide
        40 affordable units at buildout (none of these units have been constructed). A pending project,
        the Downtown Addition (650 total units), will provide approximately 98 units affordable to
        low, very low, and moderate-income households. Considering that the Downtown Addition is
        moving forward in the current economic climate with the affordable housing component, the
        City does not feel that the ordinance unduly impacts housing production and supply.
        To provide more incentives to developers for building affordable housing, the City has proposed
        to adopt a Density Bonus housing ordinance through Housing Program 6 that would comply
        with State law requirements.

Architectural Review:
Architectural review is required for any building or structure in eight zoning districts in the
City of King. Those allowing residential development are the R-3, R-4, and P-D districts. Projects
proposed in these districts must submit architecturally detailed plans along with a fee to the
Community Development Department. The plans include architectural drawings or sketches,
showing the elevations of the property building or structure and site plans showing proposed
landscape or other treatment of the grounds around such building or structure. These plans
are reviewed by the Planning Commission for consistency with neighborhood character and to
ensure that the project is not “detrimental to the orderly and harmonious development of the
City, or to impair the desirability of investment or occupation in the neighborhood.“
The architectural review process does not exceed the requirements of other jurisdictions and
typically takes eight to ten weeks for approval. If an affordable housing development were
proposed in the City, staff would expedite application processing. In addition, applicants
for projects for multi-family and apartment complexes in R-3 and R-4 zones are provided
an architectural feature checklist to complete and submit with the application. Based on an
analysis of evidence and documentation, the City’s architectural review process does not act as
a constraint to the development of affordable housing.
6.3 On and Offsite Improvement Standards
On and Off Site Improvement Requirements:
The City of King requires the installation of certain on site and off site improvements to ensure
the safety and livability of its residential neighborhoods. On site improvements are regulated
by the Subdivision Ordinance and through conditions and standards established during the
site plan review process. On site improvements typically include required off-street parking,
curbs, and utilities, as well as amenities such as landscaping, fencing, streetlights, and park
facilities. Off site improvements typically include the following (some of which are regulated
by other agencies):
         a) Road improvements, including construction of sections of roadways,
            medians, bridges, sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and lighting.
         b) Drainage improvements, including improvement to sections of
            channel, culverts, swales, and pond areas.
         c) Wastewater collection and treatment.
         d) Water systems improvements, including lines, storage tanks,
            and treatment plants.
                                                                                                         67

Chapter 6. Constraints
                 e) Public facilities for fire (the City of King Fire Department), schools (the City of
                     King Union School District), and recreation (The City of King
                     Recreation Department).
        Generally, the developer passes on site and off site improvement costs to the homebuyer as
        part of the final cost of the home. To reduce housing costs, the City attempts to require only
        those improvements that are deemed necessary to maintain public health, safety, and welfare.
        Parking:
        Table 6.9 lists applicable parking space requirements for residential developments.
         Table 6.9 Parking Requirements by Land Use
         Land Use Type: Residential Uses                       Vehicle Spaces Required

         2 Bedroom second unit                                 2 spaces per unit
         Senior second units                                   1 space per unit
         0 Bedroom and bachelor apartments                     1.5 spaces per unit*
        Off-street disabled/handicapped parking is required in compliance with the Title 24 of the
        California Administrative Code.
        6.4 Building and Housing Codes
        While local regulations and fees increase housing costs, some building and housing regulations
        and fees are mandated by State law to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community or
        to protect existing residents from financial or environmental impacts. The City of King enforces
        the 2007 California Building Code, which sets standards for residential and other structures.
        No local amendments have been made to the codes that would significantly increase housing
        costs. Building codes are enforced on a per complaint basis.
        6.5 Housing for Persons with Disabilities
        Governmental Constraints on Housing Production for Persons with Disabilities:
        As part of the governmental constraints analysis, State law calls for the analysis of potential
        and actual constraints upon the development, maintenance and improvement of housing
        for persons with disabilities. In addition, State law requires establishment of reasonable
        accommodation procedures by the City. Table 6.10 reviews not only the Zoning Ordinance, but
        also land use policies, permitting practices, and building codes to ensure compliance with State
        and federal fair housing laws. Where necessary, the City proposes new policies or programs to
        remove constraints.

                                                                                       Chapter 6. Constraints
The City of King has not adopted a reasonable accommodation procedure for housing designed
for persons with disabilities. Program 22 establishes this procedure for the City of King. The
City is also proposing Program 23 to promote the incorporation of universal design in new
construction.

Chapter 6. Constraints
        6.6 Non-governmental Constraints
        The availability and cost of housing is strongly influenced by market factors over which local
        governments have little or no control. Nonetheless, State law requires that the Housing Element
        contain a general assessment of these constraints. This assessment can serve as the basis for
        actions to offset the effects of such constraints. The primary non-governmental constraints to
        the development of new housing in the City of King are land costs, construction costs, and
        environmental constraints.
        Land Costs:
        Costs associated with the acquisition of land include both the market price of raw land and the
        cost of holding the property throughout the development process. These costs can account
        for over half of the final sales prices of new homes in very small developments and in areas
        where land is scarce. Among the variables affecting the cost of land are its location, amenities,
        the availability and proximity of public services, and financing arrangements. According to
        local real estate sources, as of January 2009, unimproved land that is suitable for single-family
        development in the City of King costs approximately $287,000 for a 10,000 square foot lot.
        However, there are very few vacant lots available for sale within the City limits. Moreover, the
        residual land value is close to zero due to the drop in housing prices and the cost of construction.
        The majority of suitable lots available for residential development are outside the City limits
        and are constrained by inadequate infrastructure and agricultural activities.
        Construction Costs:
        Construction costs vary widely depending on the type, size, and amenities of the development.
        Construction costs for typical single-family residential buildings range from approximately
        $100 to $150 per square foot; however, construction costs can run more than $200 per square
        foot depending on the quality of Construction and on-site environmental constraints.
        Environmental Constraints:
        The following potential physical and environmental constraints may affect development
        regulated by the City of King by limiting the development potential and/or adding mitigation
        costs to a project:
        Agricultural Land
        The City of King is surrounded predominantly by “prime farmland,” broadly defined as land
        with the best combination of physical and chemical properties able to sustain long-term
        production of agricultural crops. Recognizing the importance of agricultural resources, the
        City’s General Plan sets forth “agricultural resources” goals in the Conservation, Open Space,
        and Safety Element. According to Goal 1.2, ”The City shall conserve agricultural resources for
        future generations and preserve viable, prime agricultural lands in the Planning Area which are
        not required for future urban growth.”

In recent years, the Monterey County Agricultural and Historical Land Conservancy, the American
Farmland Trust, local landowners, the City, and the County have created farmland security
perimeters through agricultural easements. The agricultural easements, which include viable
farmlands to the south and north of the City of King, allow farming in perpetuity. In addition,
the Williamson Act of 1965 allows farmers to enter into land conservation contracts with the
County, typically for 20 years, enabling them to have reduced property taxes in exchange for
maintaining their lot in agricultural production. Williamson Act contracts include much of the
developable land located north and south of the City of King.
Natural and Manmade Hazards
The San Lorenzo Creek and Salinas River floodplains are the greatest potential hazard, bordering
the southwestern portion of the City and traversing the City in a northeasterly direction to
intersect the Salinas River. The City and County regulate development within the floodplain.
Few buildings or homes are in the floodplain today that would be endangered by a 100-year
flood. There are no areas known to be subject to seismic hazard or to soils or geologic failure in
the City of King. No known faults are situated within the City of King planning area. Moreover,
none of the soil types within the City of King are known to be subject to liquefaction, except
river soils along the Salinas River and San Lorenzo Creek.

                        Clarify Section 17.48.120 of the Zoning Code to facilitate housing
                        access for disabled persons. The City will also continue to conduct a
                        SB520 analysis, and, if additional constraints are found, initiate actions
                        to remove constraints.

Chapter 8
Goals, Policies, & Programs
California State law requires that the Housing Element contain a “statement of the community’s
goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative to the maintenance, improvement, and
development of housing.” This section describes the proposed goals, policies, implementation
programs, and objectives of the Housing Element for the City of King.
Goals are general statements of purpose and indicate the direction the City will take with
respect to housing problems. Policies are statements of the City’s position regarding the various
housing issues identified and provide a link between the goals. Programs are steps to be taken
to implement the policies. Some of the programs contain quantified objectives, which refer to
the number of housing units that are expected to be constructed, conserved or rehabilitated
through implementation of the program during the time frame of the Housing Element. The
quantified objectives represent measurable outcomes, which can be used to evaluate the
success of the Housing Element in the future.
This Housing Element includes several new policies, programs, and institutional changes
intended to increase the amount of affordable housing and housing rehabilitation in the City.
While most of the new efforts will be initiated shortly after adoption of the Housing Element,
full implementation and the intended results will take much longer to realize.
                                                                                                             89

Chapter 8. Goals, Policies, & Programs
        The City will annually evaluate the progress and effectiveness of these efforts in accordance
        with State law. Programs that prove effective for the City of King will be reinforced, while those
        that do not work may be discontinued, so that resources can be directed to other housing
        ideas. The City’s efforts to increase affordable housing should be viewed as long term, ongoing,
        and dynamic.
        Housing Goals and Policies
        HOUSING AVAILABILITY AND SERVICES
        Goal 1: To provide new housing units accessible to all members of the community in
        accordance with the regional fair share housing goals.
                  Policy 1.1 Encourage the development of a range of housing types and prices to
                  facilitate housing production commensurate with the City’s regional share and address
                  the City’s job-based housing demand.
                  Policy 1.2 Regulate the development of large tracts through the Specific Plan process
                  as a means to ensure quality projects and provide for a range in types and prices of
                  housing.
                  Policy 1.3 Promote innovative development plans (e.g., planned development, cluster
                  development, zero-lot-line housing concepts, etc.) that will help to increase the number
                  of affordable housing units.
                  Policy 1.4 Provide rental and homeownership assistance to expand housing
                  opportunities and encourage neighborhood stability.
                  Policy 1.5 Offer regulatory incentives and concessions for affordable housing, such
                  as relief from development standards, density bonuses, or fee waivers where deemed
                  appropriate.
                  Policy 1.6 Encourage the construction of housing on underutilized lots to assist in
                  revitalizing the downtown and older neighborhoods.
                  Policy 1.7 Ensure the provision of adequate infrastructure, public services, and facilities
                  needed to support new housing units.
                  Policy 1.8 Regulate land uses and housing design to minimize the consumption of
                  water and energy usage and encourage the design and construction of high quality
                  housing products.

HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOOD CONSERVATION
Goal 2: To preserve and rehabilitate the existing housing stock to meet health and safety
requirements and to improve the quality of life of residents.
        Policy 2.1 Continue to monitor and enforce building and property maintenance code
        standards in residential neighborhoods.

        Policy 2.3 Implement Community Development agency plans to improve economic
        opportunities, revitalize neighborhoods, and help ensure and improve quality of life for
        the City of King residents.
SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
Goal 3: To meet the housing needs of special groups of City residents, including a growing
senior population, large families, single mothers, farmworkers, homeless, seniors and the
disabled.
        Policy 4.1 The City shall encourage the development of housing for seniors, including
        congregate care facilities.
        Policy 3.2 City policies, programs, and ordinances shall provide opportunities for
        handicapped persons to reside in all neighborhoods.
        Policy 3.3 The City will reduce the parking requirements for special needs housing if a
        proponent can demonstrate a reduced parking need and not affect public health and
        safety.
        Policy 3.4 The City will work with the County and nearby cities to provide adequate
        homeless shelters and services in the South County area.
FAIR AND EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY
Goal 4: To ensure fair and equal housing opportunity for all, regardless of race, age, marital
status, ethnicity, sex, religion, household type, or other protected status or special needs
households.
        Policy 4.1 Support fair housing services to ensure that residents are aware of their rights
        and responsibilities with respect to fair housing.
                                                                                                              91
Chapter 8. Goals, Policies, & Programs
                  Policy 4.2 Discourage discrimination in either the sale or rental of housing on the basis
                  of State or federal protected classes.
                  Policy 4.3 Encourage housing opportunities for those residents who have special
                  housing needs, such as farm workers, large families, elderly, disabled persons, and other
                  identified special needs groups.
                  Policy 4.4 Assist agencies and organizations that serve residents with special housing
                  needs, including seniors, disabled, single-parents and the homeless.
        Energy Conservation
        Goal 5: To increase the efficiency of energy use in new and existing homes, with a concurrent
        reduction in housing costs.
                  Policy 5.1 All new dwelling units shall be required to meet current State requirements
                  for energy efficiency. The retrofitting of existing units shall be encouraged.
                  Policy 5.2 New land use patterns should encourage energy efficiency, to the extent
                  feasible.
        Housing Availability and Services
        1) Provision of Future Sites
        Large tracts that require specific plans for development (and in some cases annexation)
        represent the community’s greatest opportunity for providing housing. The City will continue
        to work with potential developers, the Monterey County Local Agency Formation Commission,
        Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments, and regional water and service providers to
        ensure that sufficient land for residential development is available, agricultural land is preserved,
        and infrastructure and services are able to meet the City’s future housing needs. This includes
        prezoning and annexing land suitable for residential use.
        Funding Source: 	           General Fund
        Responsible Agency: 	Community Development Department
        Timeframe: 		               On-going
        Objective: 		               Cooperate with project proponents to develop a variety of housing
        			                         types and prices. Coordinate consultation meetings during the
        			                         conceptual stage to facilitate project approval.

2) Infill Development
Underutilized lots within the City boundaries represent an opportunity for the development
of housing. Infill housing can be less costly than developing raw land, because much of the
existing infrastructure and public services are already in place. In addition, improving sites can
be an effective tool for eliminating blight particularly in redevelopment project areas. Finally,
higher density infill housing may be appropriate in neighborhoods where existing patterns of
development are mixed. In order to promote infill, the City will:
•	   Keep a current inventory of potential development sites particularly in the redevelopment
     project area.
•	   Allow and encourage mixed-use.
•	   Allow and promote small and irregular size lot development. The City is in the process of
     developing more flexible development standards for small lots downtown (the City recently
     received two grants from Caltrans for planning and code amendments).
•	   Consider increasing height limits to allow three stories in multifamily and commercial
     zones.
•	   Offer development incentives (e.g. fee waivers and below market-rate financing) negotiated
     through development agreements to increase multi-family housing.
•	   Work with water and sewer providers to prioritize services and ensure that adequate
     capacity is available to accommodate housing needs, especially housing for lower income
     households (Government Code §65589.7).
Funding Source: 	       Set-aside and other funds
Responsible Agency: 	Community Development Department
Timeframe: 		           On-going
Objective: 		           The City will continue to encourage the development of
			                     underutilized parcels in City limits. The City will conduct an
			                     underutilized land survey to identify other suitable parcels as a first
			                     step in the process.
Units: 			              25
3) Adequate Sites
In order to meet State law requirements (Government Code Section 65583(c)(1) (A) and 65583(c)
(1) (B) to address the 2007 - 2014 RHNA, the City shall amend the General Plan and the Zoning
Ordinance to provide adequate sites at a minimum of 20 dwelling units per acre “by right” on
certain sites or in certain zones. At least half (50%) of these sites shall be zoned for residential
uses only. The applications can be subject to design review as long as the project does not
trigger the CEQA review process.
The City has identified a 33 acre opportunity site near Highway 101 and First Avenue (APN
235-051-010) that could be rezoned to meet the State requirements and to accommodate the
remaining 146 very low- and low-income units allocated for this planning period (see Chapter 5
                                                                                                                 93

Chapter 8. Goals, Policies, & Programs
        for further discussion). This site or another equally attractive site (e.g. Creek Bridge, Mills Ranch,
        or the Downtown Addition Specific Plan- see Sections 5.2 and 5.3) will be eligible to meet the
        State adequate sites requirement. To meet the remaining RHNA (146 units), the City will rezone
        at least 7.3 acres.
        Funding Source: 	           General Fund
        Responsible Agency: 	Community Development Department
        Timeframe: 		               One year after adoption of the Housing Element
        Objective: 		               Encourage higher density residential development and meet State law 	
        			                         requirements for the 2007 - 2014 extremely low, very low, and
        			                         low-income RHNA
        Units: 			                  146
        4) Partner with the Development Community
        The City will continue to leverage financial resources and partner with the development
        community to support affordable housing, diversify the housing stock, and write down
        development costs. A particular emphasis will be placed on pursuing development programs
        and funds that meet extremely low, very low, and low-income needs. As opportunities arise,
        developments that include units for extremely low-income households will be prioritized. This
        will be accomplished by working with appropriate non-profit organizations, such as CHISPA
        and the Monterey County Housing Authority, to identify funding opportunities. Specifically,
        the City will:
        •	   Contact potential affordable housing developers.
        •	   Identify funding opportunities and pursue financing, such as Community Development
             Block Grant (CDBG) Funds, BEGIN Program (down payment assistance for first-time
             homebuyers), Self Help Housing (CalHome Program), Joe Serna Farmworker Grants, and
             HOME funding.
        •	   Assist in preparing applications for funds.
        •	   Work with housing sponsors to help with scores for readiness and neighborhood
             revitalization.
        •	   Provide regulatory concessions and incentives, as necessary, to encourage and facilitate the
             construction of affordable housing.

        			                         affordable housing. Coordinate efforts to match potential
        			                         developers and sites with funding resources.

5) Community Development Agency Assistance
The City of King has a history of facilitating and encouraging the production of qualified housing
projects. In the 1990s, the City often used redevelopment funds to finance the construction of
infrastructure in return for deed restricting affordable units. The City provided funds for the
Royal Coach subdivision to help finance storm sewer and circulation improvements. More
recently, the City provided $700,000 in set-aside funds for recreational improvements. In return,
145 single-family units were sold as affordable to lower and moderate-income households. The
City’s Community Development Agency will continue to leverage State funds and evaluate
appropriate projects and programs for receiving financial assistance, including:
•	  Subsidizing development and impact fees for affordable and senior housing.
•	  Creating a mixed-use overlay zone to promote the revitalization of the downtown area by
    increasing options of future development.
•	  Creating a first-time home buyer program (See also Program 9).
•	  When feasible, prioritizing funding for projects that include units for extremely low-income
    households.
Funding Source: 	       Redevelopment Funds
Responsible Agency:     Community Development Agency and
			                     Community Development Department
Timeframe: 		           Decide whether to create a mixed-use overlay zone and first-time 	
			                     homebuyer program by end of 2011, seek out funding for extremely 	
			                     low- income projects annually, and ongoing.
Objective: 		           Continue to evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, the provision
			                     of redevelopment funds to encourage the production of
			                     extremely low, very low, and low- income units.
Units: 			              15
6) Density Bonus Program
The City will adopt a density bonus ordinance in compliance with California Government Code
§ 65915 and develop an outreach program to ensure its successful implementation.
Funding Source: 	       General Fund
Responsible Agency: 	Community Development Department
Timeframe: 		           End of 2011
Objective: 		           Adopt density bonus housing ordinance to assist in the creation
			                     of affordable housing. Promote the financial feasibility of development
			                     of affordable housing using density bonuses and developer incentives 	
			                     and concessions. Develop program brochures or other material to
			                     be made available at the public counter.

        7) Limitations on Multi-family housing
        The City will amend the General Plan Land Use Element and remove restriction on multi-family
        housing. Currently, the General Plan has several policies in place, which restrict the types of
        housing in annexed areas. General Plan Land Use Element Policy 6.1.2 states that “the Specific
        Plan for an Urban reserve/ Agriculture area shall not designate additional “R-4” High-Density
        nor “R-3” Medium-High Density residential land for areas larger than 2.5 acres, nor any “R-2”
        Medium-Density residential land for areas larger than 4 acres. This policy ensures that the
        majority of new housing in the City of King will be single-family detached homes, but also
        constrains the production of multi-family housing.

        8) Housing Choice Voucher Program
        The Monterey County Housing Authority administers the Housing Choice Voucher Program for
        the City of King. The Program offers a voucher that pays the difference between the current fair
        market rents established by HUD and what a tenant can afford to pay (i.e. 30% of household
        income). The City will work with the County and potential landlords to promote the Housing
        Choice Voucher Program.

        9) Homeownership Program
        The City of King has provided a significant amount of financial assistance for low and moderate
        first-time homebuyers. The City used redevelopment set-aside funds to provide grants to 96
        households as part of the Royal Coach Project and 45 households as part of the Riverview
        Gardens project. The City of King recognizes that low and moderate-income households need
        assistance in purchasing their first home. As such, the City will continue to provide financial
        assistance to specific projects to encourage home ownership and will consider creating a first-

The City shall encourage the systematic use of its redevelopment tax increment funds and
other resources to rehabilitate the City’s existing low and moderate-income housing. In
particular, many homes within the City’s older residential neighborhoods and in the downtown
area have been identified by the City’s redevelopment plan as needing substantial repairs
and rehabilitation. To improve the condition of the community’s housing stock, the City will
provide deferred loans of up to $50,000 for low and moderate homeowners for exterior repairs,
accessibility improvements, and innovations. Advertising for the program will be through PG&E
electric bills.

        farmworker housing do not conflict with Health and Safety Code Sections 17021.5, which
        states that farmworker housing for six or fewer employees should be “deemed a single-family
        structure with a residential land use designation”, and 17021.6 which states that “no conditional
        use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance shall be required of employee housing
        that serves 12 or fewer employees and if it is not required of any other agricultural activity in
        the same zone”. The City shall also ensure that such procedures encourage and facilitate the

        The City of King has a nominal number of homeless persons. However, the City of King Zoning
        Ordinance does not directly address transitional housing and emergency shelters. The City
        of King will amend the Zoning Ordinance and permit procedures to encourage and facilitate
        emergency shelters in compliance with State law (SB 2). This means that sufficient capacity must
        be identified to accommodate at least one year-round shelter by right, without discretionary
        approval. The City will also amend the Zoning Ordinance to permit transitional and supportive
        housing as a residential use subject to the same standards and requirements that apply to other
        residential uses. The City has identified several potential areas with available vacant acreage for
        a homeless shelter, which include the industrial area (1.68 vacant acres), vacant opportunity
        site (APN 235-051-010) (33.7 acres), and the fairgrounds (18.76 vacant acres).

        Quantified Objectives
        It is the City’s goal to further the provision of affordable, safe, efficient, and accessible housing to
        its residents during the time period planned for in this Housing Element Update. This includes
        providing affordable housing to extremely low-, very low-, low- and moderate-income persons
        and households who experience housing cost burdens, live in deteriorated units, or require
        services to maintain a satisfactory lifestyle.
        Implementation of the housing programs is anticipated to result in the construction,
        rehabilitation and conservation of the numbers and types of units shown in Table 8.1.
        T he total number of new units contained in Table 8.1 falls below the new construction target
        number for the City as projected in the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) which is
        addressed in Chapter 4 of the Housing Element. However, the City’s quantified objectives are
        based on resources and an assumed growth rate that can easily change as a result of a highly
        volatile housing market. If the market dictates, the RHNA target can be met.
