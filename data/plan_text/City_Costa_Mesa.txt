Land Use Element
          Introduction
          The Land Use Element is the keystone element of the Costa Mesa General
          Plan. This Element unifies the other elements by providing an overall policy
          context for future physical change. Goals and policies define the community’s
          desired balance among social, environmental, and economic considerations,
          while maintaining those characteristics of the community that reinforce
          quality neighborhoods and viable business districts.
          As Costa Mesa implements this General Plan, the City aspires to keep Costa
          Mesa an eclectic community with welcoming public spaces; attractive,
          walkable residential neighborhoods; exceptional parks and community
          services; and, a diverse economy that meets the needs of local residents while
          also attracting investment from regional and international markets.

Land Use Element
Purpose
The Land Use Element shapes new physical development in the City and its
sphere of influence and provides strategies to preserve, protect, and enhance
established neighborhoods and districts consistent with the community’s
vision. Through implementation of the Land Use Element, the City seeks to
accomplish the following:
        Target new development opportunities at key locations while
         ensuring compatibility with established neighborhoods
        Increase homeownership opportunities in the City
        Establish and maintain an orderly pattern of development in the City
        Establish a land use classification system that implements land use
         policies
        Identify acceptable land uses and their general locations
        Promote consistency with standards for residential density and non-
         residential building intensity for existing and future development
        Accommodate a diversity of businesses to provide a solid tax base and
         ample employment opportunities, to attract visitor/tourist spending,
         and to hedge against periodic downturns in business sectors
        Provide open space, park areas, and public spaces where residents
         can enjoy passive and active recreational pursuits
        Ensure that new development is economically and environmentally
         sustainable
The Land Use Element serves as the long-range planning guide for
development in the City by indicating the location and extent of development
to be allowed. More than any other element, the Land Use Element will have
a major impact on the form and character of Costa Mesa over the next 20
years. The Land Use Element applies to all properties within the corporate City
limits, as well as properties within Costa Mesa’s sphere of influence, as
established by the Orange County Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO). Together, these areas comprise the “planning area.” Figure LU-1
illustrates the planning area boundaries in Chapter 1, Introduction.

Land Use Context-2015
The City has implemented strategic efforts over the years to provide a
sustainable balance of residential, commercial, industrial, and public and
institutional uses. Land use planning ensures that compatible and
complementary uses are arranged in patterns that achieve efficiencies for
projected growth, mobility, and commerce. This Land Use section describes
the general location, type, and intensity of development throughout Costa
Mesa in baseline year 2015.
Planning Context
Development History
Costa Mesa’s incorporated city limits encompass approximately 10,143 acres,
or approximately 15.8 square miles. The City lies on an elevated mesa
landform less than one mile from the Pacific Ocean. The Spanish name Costa
Mesa means coastal tableland. Like throughout much of Southern California,
the earliest settlers were Native Americans who fished and farmed. Spanish
land grants in the 1800s brought Europeans into the area, with additional
growth facilitated by extension of the railroad and, later, discovery of oil. Until
the 1950s, agriculture remained the most important economic component of
Orange County, and Costa Mesa was home to thousands of acres of sweet
potato, corn, tomato, and strawberry crops. Remnants of this agricultural
heritage remains through 2015 on properties north of Interstate 405, amid
the urban development of South Coast Plaza and the Segerstrom Center for
the Arts.
During World War II, the U.S. military established a number of bases in Orange
County, including the Santa Ana Army Air Base in Costa Mesa (now the Orange
County Fairgrounds). In the years following World War II, the surge in
population and demand for affordable housing soared as returning veterans
with new families looked to buy homes. The accelerated demand for
suburban homes resulted in the conversion of thousands of agricultural land
to large single-family housing tracts. Today, single family homes remain the
predominant use in Costa Mesa.

                                                                                      Land Use Element
                                  From the 1970s through 1990s, Costa Mesa experienced significant growth in
                                  retail and office development, with development of regional shopping malls
                                  and high-rise office buildings north of I-405. Investment in the industrial
                                  district south of West 19th Street included a substantial presence of surfing
                                  and similar action sports businesses, several of which have grown to be multi-
                                  million dollar international brands.
                                  Established Land Uses (2015)
                                  Costa Mesa is 99 percent built out, with the largest vacant parcels located in
                                  the North Costa Mesa area. The two largest available properties are; the 31-
                                  acre Segerstrom Home Ranch and the 33-acre Sakioka Lot 2 site: both are
                                  currently in agriculture production, as of 2015, and lie north of I-405. The
                                  North Costa Mesa Specific Plan regulates land uses on these properties.
                                  Residential
                                  As of 2015, approximately 46.2 percent of land in the planning area consisted
                                  of residential neighborhoods. Single-family neighborhoods cover
                                  approximately 30 percent of the land in the City. There are a greater number
                                  of multi-family units (28,413 units) than single-family units (14,210 units).
                                  Costa Mesa contains a number of distinct residential neighborhoods,
                                  including:
                                   1) Eastside        5) North Costa Mesa/Mesa Del Mar/Halecrest Hall of Fame
                                   2) Westside        6) Bristol/Paularino
                                   3) Mesa Verde 7) South Coast/Wimbledon Village
                                   4) College Park
        Mesa Verde residential
neighborhood with a mixture of
 single-family and multi-family
     units, as well as parks and
                         schools.
                                                              Costa Mesa General Plan | LU-5
Land Use Element
Opportunity for new large-scale, single-family development is limited due to
the built-out nature of the City’s residential areas and limited acreage of
vacant land. The accelerated demand for suburban homes experienced in the
mid-1950s and 1960s resulted in the conversion of thousands of agricultural
acres to large single-family housing tracts. Single-family residential
construction primarily consists of infill development, particularly in Eastside
and Westside Costa Mesa. From 2012 to 2016, new small lot subdivisions
have been approved in multi-family zones in Eastside Costa Mesa. Medium-
and High-Density Residential land uses account for 17 percent of the net
acreage. Medium-Density Residential areas are distributed throughout the
City. High-Density neighborhoods are clustered around Orange Coast College,
along Mesa Verde Drive East, along Adams Avenue, around Vanguard
University, in the northeast portion of the South Coast Metro area, in
Downtown, and in the southeast portion of the City.
Because many residential units were constructed prior to City incorporation,
particularly on the Eastside, existing residential densities in the Medium- and
High-Density land use designations may exceed the currently allowed number
of dwelling units per acre.
Commercial Uses
Costa Mesa contains seven commercial corridors: 1) South Coast Corridor 2)
Bristol Street Corridor, 3) Harbor Boulevard Corridor, 4) East 17th Street
Corridor, 5) North Newport Boulevard Corridor, 6) South Newport Boulevard
Corridor, and 7) West 19th Street Corridor. Established commercial land uses
encompass 9.6 percent of the land area, or 770 acres.
                                                                                Costa Mesa Downtown and
                                                                                The Triangle consists of a
                                                                                mixture of neighborhood and
                                                                                community-serving commercial
                                                                                uses.

                                                      Land Use Element
South Coast Plaza, located along the Bristol Street Corridor, contains the
largest single concentration of retail uses in the City and accounts for 30
percent of the commercial square footage; the adjacent Town Center area
accounts for nearly 20 percent of the area planned for office space
throughout the City.
The Harbor Boulevard commercial corridor accounts for almost one-third of
the City’s commercial land. Businesses along the boulevard account for 40
percent of the City’s total retail sales, indicating that Harbor Boulevard’s trade
area is of a regional scale. The major factor for this is the concentration of
auto dealerships on Harbor Boulevard.
The 92-acre East 17th Street commercial corridor contains a variety of
commercial uses, including retail, service, and office. The area generally serves
local residences and businesses.
Major retail centers other than South Coast Plaza include the CAMP, the LAB
Anti-Mall, South Coast Collection (SOCO), Metro Pointe, and The Triangle.
Each offers its own unique mix of shopping and dining experiences, as well as
entertainment for the residents of Costa Mesa and Orange County at large.
Industrial Uses
Established industrial land uses encompass approximately 10.5 percent of
land and are primarily concentrated in three major districts: The Westside
District, the Airport Industrial/Business Park District, and the Harbor Gateway
District.
The Westside District is the City’s oldest industrial area; it covers
approximately 312 acres and represents 82.5 percent of land area designated
for Light Industrial. The remaining 17.5 percent of Light Industrial uses are
located in areas along Baker Street. Light Industrial uses consist of small
manufacturing and service industries, as well as larger industrial operations.
The Westside District contains several large manufacturing firms and a high
percentage of smaller industrial operations, frequently in multi-tenant
structures. The Southwest District is one of Costa Mesa’s major employment
centers, providing about one-fourth of all local manufacturing-related jobs.
The 390-acre Airport Industrial Area is a component of the much larger Irvine
Business and Industrial Complex, which extends into the cities of Irvine and

Tustin. This area is characterized by large parcels and wide landscaped
building setbacks. Several firms have located their main or regional
headquarters in the area and are often the single tenants in large structures.

                                                                                    a concentration of industrial,
                                                                                    office, and commercial uses.
Industrial space directly adjacent to John Wayne Airport provides
opportunities to airport-related industries. Some of these properties include
hangars with access to the runway.
The 323-acre Harbor Gateway District is an Industrial/Business Park located
within the north part of Costa Mesa, northeast of I-405 and the Santa Ana
River. This district is a part of a larger industrial area extending northward into
the city of Santa Ana. The primary users of this industrial area are large single-
tenant manufacturing firms and corporate offices. Included within this district
is a 14.5-acre portion of the Home Ranch area property and the unique
“lifestyle” South Coast Collection (SOCO) shopping center. SOCO includes over
300,000 square feet of design showrooms, creative studios, specialty retail
and food stores, a weekly farmers’ market, and outdoor gathering spaces. The
OC Mix, located in SOCO, is a marketplace for gourmet foods, coffee, wine,
and over 30 owner-operated retail and specialty shops under one roof.
Public/Institutional, Golf Course, and Fairground Uses
The Public/Institutional designation applies to publicly and privately owned
properties that provide recreation, open space, health, and educational
opportunities, as well as uses that provide a service to the public.
A major land acquisition by the State in 1950 was responsible for the public
ownership of the Costa Mesa Golf Course and Country Club and Fairview Park.
In 1950, 750 acres were acquired for a State institution. In 2015, the Fairview

                                Developmental Center occupied 114 acres of the original 750-acre site.
                                Acquisitions by the City and County have expanded this area to include the
                                County’s Talbert Regional Park adjacent to the Santa Ana River and the City’s
                                adjoining Canyon Park. See Table LU-1: Public and Institutional Land
                                Acquisitions, for various public and institution uses government land
                                acquisitions.
                                A total of 1,263.4 acres are designated Public/Institutional. When combined
                                with the Costa Mesa Golf Course and Orange County Fair & Event Center,
                                these uses constitute 25 percent of the planning area. This high percentage of
                                land area designated for public and institutional use primarily reflects past
                                and current use by various governmental agencies: The Santa Ana Army Air
                                Base during World War II, the original 750-acre land acquisition by the State of
                                California, and land acquisitions by the City and Orange County.
Orange Coast College, founded
      in 1947, includes over 80
  academic program areas and
   over 50 career and technical
                     programs.
                                The golf course designation includes the Mesa Verde and Santa Ana Country
                                Clubs (both private) and the City-owned Costa Mesa Golf Course and Country
                                Club. The Fairgrounds property includes the 150-acre Orange County Fair &
                                Event Center, which is owned by the 32nd District Agricultural Association, a

Orange Coast College Vision 2020 Facilities Master Plan
Costa Mesa is home to Orange Coast College, which is one of three colleges in
the Coast Community College District. Orange Coast College is located at 2701
Fairview Road in the central portion of Costa Mesa. The District has been
involved in preparing the Orange Coast College Vision 2020 Facilities Master
Plan, which involves construction of new academic, administrative,
residential, and parking facilities on the campus. In November 2015, the Coast
Community College District Board of Trustees approved the Final Orange
Coast College Vision 2020 Facilities Master Plan Program EIR.
The proposed Master Plan involves following improvements:
         Renovation of two existing buildings, totaling approximately 54,000
          assignable square feet (ASF) and demolition of approximately 200,900
          ASF.
         A new planetarium and an 818-bed student housing project would be
          added to the campus; the proposed project would also involve
          improvements to the pedestrian circulation network in and around
          campus, and the enhancement of open-space areas through
          landscape and pedestrian plaza improvements.
         Reconfiguration of existing parking lots and vehicular entryways, and
          the addition of a parking structure in the Adams Avenue parking lot
          on campus.

Jobs/Housing Relationship
The variety and distribution of land uses in Costa Mesa enable people to live
near their jobs, to shop within a reasonable distance from their homes or
work, to use the City’s parks and recreational facilities, and to carry out other
daily activities conveniently. Information from the 2010 Census indicates that
32 percent of residents work in the City. Fifty-one percent work within 20
minutes of their homes. The City recognizes the importance of providing both
job and housing opportunities to reduce vehicle trips and overall, create a
higher quality of life.

Costa Mesa’s population, number of housing units, and employment

Key Land Use Issues
Residential Neighborhood Compatibility
Early subdivisions in Costa Mesa established patterns that markedly affect the
design of current developments. Prior to the City’s incorporation, residential
development—particularly in the Eastside and Westside neighborhoods—
consisted of subdivisions with long, narrow lots. As residential development
occurred, construction on these narrow, deep lots often took the form of
subdivisions usually consisting of a row of detached or attached residential
units on one side of the parcel and the driveway access for the residential
units on the opposite side.
In 2013, the Small Lot Ordinance was adopted to promote affordable
ownership housing by providing more flexible development standards and
maintenance mechanisms for underutilized multi-family residential lots within
the densities allowed by the General Plan. The Small Lot Ordinance allowed
new homeownership opportunities in the form of detached single-family
residential development on small lots with a maximum of 15 dwelling units.
Promotion of Home Ownership
According to the 2010 Census data, Costa Mesa’s renter-occupied units
consisted of 58 percent of the total occupied units, whereas owner-occupied
units consisted of 42 percent of the total occupied units, a difference of nearly
16 percent. Most owner-occupied units consist of single-family homes and
condominiums, and the majority of renter-occupied residences consist of
apartments. The City strives to improve the balance of owner-occupied and
renter-occupied units to create more stability in terms of property
maintenance and residents’ social investment in their neighborhoods and the
community.
Revitalization of Commercial Districts
Although most of the issues experienced with small parcels and narrow, deep
parcels are related to residential development, several commercial districts
face similar constraints. While large retail developments like the Triangle have
resulted from lot consolidation, smaller commercial lots along Newport
Boulevard and 19th Street, for example, pose challenges for new businesses
due to substandard parking facilities. Along the east side of Newport
Boulevard, many small parcels retain the original residential structures that

have been converted to commercial use. Additionally, along Newport
Boulevard, north of 19th Street, commercial uses have more limited exposure
and visibility due to the one-way traffic flow and wide separation from land
uses to the west. Newport Boulevard’s one-way traffic flow, diversity of
ownership patterns, and eclectic mix of uses contribute to its lack of unity and
identity, which in turn makes it difficult to attract new development proposals
and/or businesses. The City will need to continue to monitor activity on
Newport Boulevard, Harbor Boulevard, and other commercial districts with
similar challenging circumstances to determine if additional adjustments to
land use policy and zoning regulations are needed to incentivize reinvestment.
Live/Work Development in Industrial Areas
The Westside has long supported an intertwined mix of industrial,
commercial, and residential uses. Industrial uses have predominated in this
southwest corner of the City, including many that once supported the marine
industry. In 2005, the City adopted a mixed-use overlay zones within the
Westside and SoBECA Urban Plans. The Urban Plans do not promote any
major intensification of land uses. The emphasis is on improving the Urban
Plan area by providing visual enhancement and encouraging the development
of live/work units or residential lots with the plan area, thereby revitalizing
marginal properties and creating opportunities for home ownership. The
objectives of the Urban Plans include:
        Encourage the construction of Live/Work Units that combine
         residential and nonresidential uses in the same unit without
         exceeding the development capacity of the General Plan
         transportation system.
        Attract more residents and merchants by allowing mixed-use
         development in the form of a live/work loft, which offers first-floor
         retail/office uses and upper story living spaces in the same unit.
        Encourage adaptive reuse of existing industrial or commercial
         structures, which would result in rehabilitated buildings with unique
         architecture and a wider array of complementary uses.
        Stimulate improvement in the Urban Plan area through well-designed
         and integrated urban residential development that is nontraditional in
         form and designed with flexible open floor plans and which
         complements the surrounding existing development.

         population comprised of artists, designers, craftspeople,
         professionals, and small-business entrepreneurs.
        Promote new type of urban housing that would be target-marketed to
         people seeking alternative housing choices in an industrial area. An
         urban loft would be an alternative to a traditional single-family
         residence, tract home, or small-lot subdivision.
Costa Mesa values the opportunities the Westside provides to support
enterprising industry and entrepreneurs. Land use regulations need to be
crafted in a way that furthers economic development and business support
while allowing residential development in the right locations in the Westside.
Mixed-Use Districts
The Westside and South Bristol Entertainment and Cultural Arts (SoBECA)
areas contain eclectic uses that have emerged organically. In other areas of
Costa Mesa, including Planned Development Commercial areas and the
Harbor Mixed-Use Overlay District, the City encourages mixed-use urban
environments that include purposeful combinations of entertainment, retail,
office, hospitality, and residential uses. Mixed-use development creates a
productive use of space that adds vitality to urban areas and conserves land
resources by allowing for shared parking and public spaces.
Airport Considerations
Both the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Airport Land Use
Commission for Orange County have concern for the safety of air navigation
around John Wayne Airport. Under Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(FAR), the FAA requires notice of proposed construction in excess of certain
heights which may affect the safety of aircraft operations. The authority of the
FAA in these matters extends only as far as issuing a notice of hazard to air
navigation; the FAA does not have jurisdiction to prohibit construction. The
issuance of a hazard notice, however, may adversely affect the ability of a
developer to obtain financing and insurance.
 The FAA standard that is of most concern in Costa Mesa is the horizontal
surface around John Wayne Airport. This surface is 206 feet above mean sea
level and extends nearly two miles from the airport.
LU-16 | Costa Mesa General Plan

                                                     Land Use Element
The South Coast Plaza Town Center Master Plan (the area east of Bristol
Street and north of the I-405) was approved subject to the condition that
building height be limited to that specified by FAR Part 77 unless evidence is
presented that the structure will not pose a hazard to air navigation nor
interfere with instrument guidance systems. Evidence may be in the form of
an FAA determination of no hazard. A number of Town Center structures and
proposed mid-rise and high-rise residential buildings have received City
approval although they encroach beyond the established horizontal surface
elevation. In all cases obstruction lighting was required and, in some cases,
minor adjustments to seldom-used flight patterns were necessitated, but the
safety of aircraft operations in the airport vicinity has not been compromised.
The horizontal surface established by the FAA places restrictions on future
development proposals similar in scale to the Town Center buildings. These
developments will also be required to provide mitigation for potential hazards
to air safety. The California Public Utilities Code provides for creation of
countywide commissions to work towards achieving compatible land uses in
the vicinity of airports. Commissions are required to formulate comprehensive
land use plans which may include acceptable uses, height restrictions, and
other building standards, such as noise insulation. The Airport Land Use
Commission for Orange County (ALUC) has established a planning area
surrounding John Wayne Airport which sets forth standards for acceptable
land uses and provides for review of development plans for properties within
its planning area. The Airport Environs Land Use Plan (AELUP), adopted by the
Airport Land Use Commission, specifies acceptable uses proximate to the
airport. These are defined as uses that will not subject people to adverse
noise impacts, will not concentrate people in areas with high potential for
aircraft accidents, and will not adversely affect navigable airspace or aircraft
operations.
The AELUP for Heliports establishes regulations and restrictions for the siting
of heliports and helipads/helistops. The purpose of the AELUP for Heliports is
to protect the public from the adverse effects of aircraft noise by ensuring
that heliports/helipads are sited in areas of compatible land use.
A heliport is a small airport suitable only for use by helicopters, typically
containing one or more helipads. A helipad or helistop is a designated area,
including any buildings or facilities, intended to be used for the landing and
                           Costa Mesa General Plan | LU-17
Land Use Element
takeoff of helicopters. Helipads/helistops may or may not be located within
heliports. Refueling and overnight maintenance of helicopters are permitted
on heliports but prohibited on helipads/helistops.
The City will ensure that each applicant seeking a conditional use permit or
similar approval for the construction or operation of a heliport or helistop
complies fully with the State permit procedure provided by law and with all
conditions of approval imposed or recommended by the FAA, by the Airport
Land Use Commission for Orange County (ALUC), and by Caltrans/Division of
Aeronautics. This requirement shall be in addition to all other City
development requirements.
The City will also ensure that development proposals including the
construction or alteration of a structure more than 200 feet above ground
level, reference North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAV88), must fully
comply with procedures provided by Federal and State law, including with the
referral requirements of the ALUC, and filing a Notice of Construction and
Alteration (Form7460-I). This requirement shall be in addition to all other City
development requirements.
Land Availability
As of 2015, of the 8,042 net acres in the City of Costa Mesa, only 87.1 acres—
or 1.1 percent—were either vacant or support agricultural production. The
agricultural uses are temporary, as the lands are entitled for development by
the North Costa Mesa Specific Plan. Thus, new development will take the form
of infill development, particularly on underutilized sites. The primary
challenge for land use planning will be to determine the best use and
development approach for remaining infill properties. A second challenge will
be to guide re-use of aging commercial properties for long-term community
and property owner benefit.
Sustainable Development Practices
Costa Mesa residents recognize the relationship between the use of resources
to fuel a vibrant community (energy, water, air, and land) and unsustainable
energy consumption can have long-term environmental consequences. Both
the federal and State governments have established laws aimed at
environmental protection and enhancement, and many of these regulations
are being implemented through development practices that are far more
sustainable than practices of a generation ago. The Orange County region

historically has had an imbalance of land uses (availability of high paying jobs,
but shortfall of affordable housing1) and roadway infrastructure primarily
dedicated to the automobile.
These historical development patterns and practices have adversely affected
Costa Mesa in terms of traffic congestion, high housing costs, increased air
pollution, and disproportional impacts on the young, elderly, and disabled.
While many laws require the City to adopt new ways of planning and
conducting day-to-day operations—such as the Global Warming Solutions Act
of 2006 (AB 32) and Executive Order S-3-052—the City has broad latitude to
establish local procedures and practices for addressing sustainability.

Land Use Element
Land Use Plan
The Land Use Policy Map (Figure LU-3) presents a pictorial representation of
the land use and development policies set forth in this element. The colored
land use designations indicate the type and nature of development allowed
on all properties within the City of Costa Mesa and its sphere of influence. The
map shows 16 land use designations and six overlays that largely reflect long-
established land use patterns and development intensities, with the overlays
indicating where targeted efforts are planned to encourage reuse and
revitalization. The City will use the land use designation descriptions and the
trip budget limitations described below—together with the Land Use Element
Goals, Objectives, and Policies—to evaluate proposed development and land
use projects. General Plan users are advised to refer to all components when
evaluating proposed development and improvement projects.
Density/Intensity and Trip Budgets
Density and intensity are quantitative measures used to describe how much
development may occur on a property. The City will use both density/intensity
and the trip budget metric to determine the carrying capacity of each
individual property or group of properties.
Density
The term density applies to residential uses and refers to the development
and population capacity of residential land. Density is described in terms of
dwelling units per acre of land (du/ac).
Floor-area Ratio
For nonresidential land use categories, the term intensity is used.
Development intensity refers to the amount of development on a parcel of
land or lot based on building characteristics such as building height, bulk,
floor-area ratio, and/or percent of lot coverage. The development intensity
standard used for most non-residential development is floor-area ratio (FAR),
which is the ratio of the total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot to the
total area of the lot. For example, a 21,780-square-foot building on a 43,560-
square-foot lot (one acre) yields an FAR of 0.50. A 0.50 FAR allows a single-
story building, which covers half the lot, or a two-story building with reduced
lot coverage. Figure LU-2 illustrates an example of density and FAR.
LU-20 | Costa Mesa General Plan

Figure LU-2: Density and Floor-area Ratio
(FAR)
The determination of development density or intensity at which a proposed
project can occur is a function of: 1) General Plan policies intended to
maximize public safety, achieve high-quality site planning and design, retain
significant natural resources, and ensure compatibility between uses; and 2)
development standards contained in the Zoning Code, public works standards,
and other regulations.
Trip Budgets
Building intensity can also be measured by the traffic impacts generated by a
particular development. Because of the potential for significant traffic
generation from major site developments, trip budgets are established to
regulate development in terms of both building intensities and trip
generation. Proposed development intensity with traffic generation allows the
allocation of development based on current and planned roadway
improvements and capacity.
The trip budget is expressed in terms of morning (A.M.) and afternoon (P.M.)
peak-hour traffic volumes. The trip budget for each of the major land use
designations is based upon the land use trip rates and FAR standard used in
the Costa Mesa Traffic Model.
                          Costa Mesa General Plan | LU-21
Land Use Element
The allowable FAR and trip budget are applied on a project-planning rather
than parcel-specific basis. This approach allows for consideration of multi-
phased or multi-lot projects as a whole development rather than individual
pieces of the whole. Graduated FAR standards divide nonresidential uses into
four broad categories based upon traffic generation characteristics, as shown
in Table LU-5: Nonresidential Maximum Floor-area Ratios.
Trip Budget Transfers
The trip budgets established at the Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ)3 level in the
Costa Mesa Traffic Model can be combined or transferred between TAZs in a
specified area of the City and under certain conditions to account for large
planned developments which contain multiple TAZs. Likewise, trips can be
combined or transferred between individual parcels within single TAZs.
Combinations and/or transfers shall only be allowed for projects which meet
the following conditions:
          The combination and/or transfer of trips shall only be allowed in the
           area of the City that is north of I-405 and east of Harbor Boulevard,
           and shall be limited to parcels within a one-mile radius of each other.
          Trip budget transfers shall be evaluated in the review and approval of
           a planned development or master plan projects. Sufficient conditions
           of approval shall be applied to the master plan or development plan
           to ensure long-range control over subsequent phases of development.
          The combination and/or transfer of trips shall not result in any greater
           impacts on the surrounding circulation system than would occur if
           each Traffic Analysis Zone was developed independently.
          For the combination and/or transfer of trips between TAZs, such
           combination and/or transfer of trips shall not exceed the total trip
           budget of all parcels involved if each were developed independently
           according to the floor-area ratio and trip generation rates provided
           herein.

Notes:
 1. For commercial designations, high traffic uses generate more than 75 daily trip ends
      per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area. For industrial designations, high traffic uses
      generate more than 15 daily trip ends per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area.
 2. For commercial designations, moderate traffic uses generate between 20 and 75 daily
      trip ends per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area. For industrial designations, moderate
      traffic uses generate between 8 and 15 daily trip ends per 1,000 square feet of gross
      floor area.
 3. For commercial designations, low traffic uses generate between three and 20 daily trip
      ends per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area. For industrial designations, low traffic
      uses generate between three and eight daily trip ends per 1,000 square feet of gross
      floor area.
 4. For commercial and industrial designations, very low traffic uses generate less than
      three daily trip ends per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area.

Land Use Designations
The Land Use Policy Map (Figure LU-3) graphically represents General Plan
goals and policies. The following land use designations correspond to the
categories shown on the Land Use Policy Map. See Table 6: Land Use Density
and Intensity Summary, for a summary of the land use residential densities
and commercial intensities. The Land Use Element contains 16 land use
designations and six overlays as follows.
Residential Designations
Costa Mesa's residential designations are divided into Low-Density, Medium-
Density, and High-Density Residential.
Low-Density Residential
Low-Density Residential areas are intended to accommodate detached single-
family residences. Other housing types include attached housing that provide
a greater portion of recreation or open space than typically found in multi-
family developments and clustered housing which affords the retention of
significant open space. Low-Density Residential areas are intended to
accommodate outdoor living activities (front yards and backyards) in open
space adjacent to dwellings. To avoid land use conflicts, these areas should be
located away from or protected from the more intense nonresidential areas
and major travel corridors.

Land Use Element
Costa Mesa contains seven distinct residential neighborhoods: 1) Eastside, 2)
Westside, 3) Mesa Verde, 4) College Park, 5) North Costa Mesa/Mesa Del
Mar/Halecrest Hall of Fame, 6) Bristol/Paularino, and 7) South
Coast/Wimbledon Village. These existing, stable single-family neighborhoods
should be preserved and maintained. The establishment of attached or
clustered housing through the planned development concept can be allowed
in appropriate Low-Density Residential areas as a means to encourage the
consolidation of parcels or to make more efficient use of larger parcels.
Nonresidential uses that complement and serve the surrounding residential
neighborhood are also appropriate within this designation. These uses
typically include schools, parks, religious institutions, libraries, and other
public facilities.
Medium-Density Residential
The Medium-Density Residential designation is intended to support single-and
multi-family developments with a density of up to 12 units to the acre. The 12
units to the acre standard can be exceeded for legal, nonconforming Medium-
Density Residential lots between 6,000 and 7,260 square feet in size that
existed as of March 16, 1992.
The 12 dwelling units per acre standard is exceeded by approximately 53
percent of the existing Medium-Density development. Existing nonconforming
units that are voluntarily demolished may be rebuilt to the same existing
density, subject to other standards of the zoning code and the following: The
allowable density or number of units to be redeveloped is limited to the
General Plan density plus a 25 percent density incentive bonus or the existing
number of units, whichever is less. Because of the location and intensity of
development, Medium-Density Residential areas are also appropriate for
quasi-residential uses such as convalescent hospitals and private residential
care. Schools, religious institutions, parks, libraries, and related public facilities
are also appropriate.
Complementary commercial uses within this designation may be allowed in
planned development projects, provided the commercial uses will have FARs
that are the same as the Neighborhood Commercial land use designation.
LU-28 | Costa Mesa General Plan
                                                    Land Use Element
High-Density Residential
Areas designated as High-Density Residential are intended for residential
development with a density of up to 20 units to the acre with some
exceptions, as described in this section. Density bonuses shall be granted by
the City when a project is designed to provide housing for individuals and
families with specialized requirements (e.g., senior citizens, disabled, very-
low, low-income, and moderate income households with needs not
sufficiently accommodated by conventional housing) or provide other
facilities or land as required by State law. The City may also grant additional
incentives or concessions pursuant to State law.
Sakioka Lot 2, a 41-acre parcel located in the Town Center area of the City
adjacent to Anton Boulevard (Area 8 of the North Costa Mesa Specific Plan),
has an overall density limit 20 du/acre with a total number of 660 units.
The two-acre property at 580 Anton Boulevard in the Lakes Area (Area 5 of
the North Costa Mesa Specific Plan) has a site-specific density of 125
units/acre. This equates to a maximum of 250 units on the site, with an
approximate building height of 26 stories. Additionally, a resident-serving
commercial/retail use component is permitted, provided that minimal traffic-
generation characteristics of this retail component can be demonstrated in
review and approval of a master plan. Additional development standards for
this planned development are contained in the North Costa Mesa Specific
Plan.
A three-acre property at 3350 Avenue of the Arts is located north of Anton
Boulevard along the east side of Avenue of the Arts in The Lakes area (Area 5
of the North Costa Mesa Specific Plan). The following standards have been
established: (1) A site-specific density of a maximum 44 units/acre for a
mixed-use development comprised of a boutique hotel and high-rise
residential building and (2) a maximum nonresidential mixed use FAR of 2.12,
which includes the hotel use and ancillary commercial uses. However, subject
to comparable traffic generation characteristics, the North Costa Mesa
Specific Plan contains provisions allowing development flexibility related to
the maximum overall development of dwelling units, hotel rooms, and
resident-serving retail/commercial uses. Additional development standards
for this planned development, including maximum allowable building height
                            Costa Mesa General Plan | LU-29
Land Use Element
and mix of dwelling units and hotel rooms, are contained in the North Costa
Mesa Specific Plan.
In 2014, a site-specific density of 58 units/acre and site-specific building height
of five and six stories were established for a 4.17-acre site at 125 East Baker
Street. The project featured a five-story, 240-unit apartment building and six-
story parking structure.
In 2015, a 224-unit apartment building on a 4.15-acre property at 2277 Harbor
Boulevard was approved. The project involved: (1) Change of the land use
designation from General Commercial to High Density Residential; (2) site-
specific base density of 40 du/acre with a development incentive for an
additional 58 dwelling units, for an overall site-specific density of 54 du/acre;
(3) site-specific building height for a five-level parking structure. The density
incentive program involved a proposed base density of 166 units (40 du/acre)
with a density incentive for an additional 58 dwelling units. The density
incentive was justified by provision of 20 affordable units for moderate-
income households, a complete demolition of the Costa Mesa Motor Inn, and
revitalization of a marginal property. Rezone R-14-04 from C1 (Local Business
District) to PDR-HD (Planned Development Residential – High Density) was
also approved.
In order to encourage the development of additional residential ownership
opportunities in the Westside, the City Council designated an overlay area by
adoption of the Mesa West Residential Ownership urban plan. For existing
developments that exceed 20 dwelling units per acre, the Mesa West
Residential Ownership urban plan may allow redevelopment of residential
projects to existing densities, provided that certain development standards
are met for encouraging ownership housing.
In the High-Density Residential designation, existing non-conforming
developments that are voluntarily destroyed may be rebuilt to the original
density subject to other standards of the zoning code and the following: The
allowable density or number of units to be redeveloped would be limited to
the General Plan density plus a 50 percent density incentive bonus or the
existing number of units, whichever is less.
High-density areas should be located in proximity to transportation routes,
especially those served by public transit, and also within convenient distances
LU-30 | Costa Mesa General Plan

                                                    Land Use Element
to shopping and employment centers. Although proximity to the above uses
and transportation routes often results in a residential development being
subject to adverse impacts, High-Density Residential development can be less
susceptible to impacts than lower densities if visual and acoustical shielding
techniques are incorporated into the project.
In addition to the above locational preferences, viable high density
development is also dependent upon site characteristics. A site should be of
appropriate size and dimension before the higher densities within this
designation are allowed.
Because of their location and intensity of development, High-Density
Residential areas are also appropriate for quasi-residential uses (e.g.,
convalescent hospitals). Schools, religious institutions, parks, libraries, and
related public facilities are also appropriate.
Complementary commercial uses within this designation may be allowed in
planned development projects, provided that the commercial uses will have
FARs that are the same as the Neighborhood Commercial land use
designation.
Mixed-use development projects are intended to provide additional housing
opportunities in the City by combining residential and nonresidential uses in
an integrated development. Additionally, this type of development is
intended to revitalize areas of the City (such as the Westside) without
exceeding the capacity of the General Plan transportation system. Mixed-use
developments shall be implemented through an adopted urban plan (such as
the 19 West Urban Plan) and shall be identified on the Zoning Map by
designating either the R2-HD and R-3 base zoning districts with the mixed-use
overlay district. The mix of uses can occur in either a vertical or horizontal
design, up to four stories in height. Product types shall be identified in the
applicable urban plan and may include live/work units and commercial/
residential units where the residential uses are located above or adjacent to
the nonresidential component. Nonresidential uses may include office, retail,
business services, personal service, public spaces and uses, and other
community amenities. In conjunction with areas that are designated with the
mixed-use zoning overlay district, the maximum FAR is 1.0. An increase to
1.25 FAR may be allowed for mixed-use plans exhibiting design excellence. In
                            Costa Mesa General Plan | LU-31
Land Use Element
a mixed-use overlay district area, this FAR includes both residential and
nonresidential components, and the maximum number of stories is four.
Major high-density neighborhoods are clustered around Orange Coast
College, along Mesa Verde Drive East, between Adams and Harbor, around
Vanguard University, in the northeast portion of the South Coast Metro area,
in the Downtown Redevelopment area, and in the southeast portion of the
City.
Commercial Designations
Seven commercial land use designations are established. These designations
vary in location and intensity to accommodate the full range of commercial
activity present and desired in Costa Mesa. Development intensity potential is
measured using FAR in relation to the amount of traffic expected (see Table
LU-7, Commercial Floor-Area Ratio).
Commercial-Residential
The Commercial-Residential designation is intended to be applied to a limited
area on the eastside of Newport Boulevard between East 19th Street and Mesa
Drive. It is the intent of this land use designation to allow a complementary
mix of commercial and residential zoning along Newport Boulevard. It is
anticipated that individual parcels will be developed as either a commercial or
residential use. A mix of both commercial and residential uses on one parcel
should only be allowed as a Planned Development.
Residential development is encouraged, provided that certain development
standards are met pursuant to the adopted Newport Boulevard Specific Plan.
Residential density ranges from 12 units per acre to 17.4 units per acre,
except where the Residential Overlay applies. It will be necessary to ensure
adequate buffering between the residential development and non-residential
uses.
Allowable floor area ratios are 0.20 for high-traffic-generating uses, 0.30 for
moderate-traffic-generating uses, and 0.40 for low-traffic-generating uses, as
shown on Table LU-7. Residential and nonresidential uses may be integrated
into a single development through the Planned Development process.
Residential densities in planned development projects shall not exceed 17.4
units per acre pursuant to the development standards in the Newport
LU-32 | Costa Mesa General Plan

Boulevard Specific Plan. Noncommercial uses would be subject to the same
floor area standards as commercial uses in this designation.
Institutional uses are also appropriate in this designation, provided that land
use compatibility and traffic issues have been addressed. Institutional uses
would require discretionary approval.

         3.   Los Angeles Times Site has a 0.54 (commercial) to 0.64 (office) FAR.
Neighborhood Commercial
The Neighborhood Commercial designation is intended to serve convenience
shopping and service needs of local residents. Appropriate uses include
markets, drug stores, retail shops, financial institutions, service
establishments, and support office uses. Restaurants, hotels, and motels may
be appropriate if properly located, designed, and operated to avoid adverse
impacts to surrounding uses. Since Neighborhood Commercial uses are
intended to serve nearby residential neighborhoods, the uses permitted
should be among the least intense of the commercial uses.
                            Costa Mesa General Plan | LU-33
Land Use Element
General Commercial
The General Commercial designation is intended to permit a wide range of
commercial uses that serve both local and regional needs. These areas should
have exposure and access to major transportation routes since significant
traffic can be generated. General Commercial areas should be insulated from
the most sensitive land uses either through buffers of less-sensitive uses or
on-site design features. The most intense commercial uses should be
encouraged to locate on sites of adequate size to avoid compatibility issues
with surrounding uses. Appropriate uses include those found in the
Neighborhood Commercial designation, plus smaller retail stores, theaters,
restaurants, hotels and motels, and automobile sales and service
establishments.
In areas designated General Commercial, development typically will result in
combinations of one- and two-story commercial buildings. Buildings in excess
of two stories may be permitted in select zoning areas via discretionary
approval where the additional height would not impact surrounding uses.
As complementary uses, residential and other noncommercial uses may be
allowed through the Planned Development process. Residential densities in
planned development projects shall not exceed 20 dwelling units per acre.
Noncommercial uses would be subject to the same FAR standards as
commercial uses.
Institutional uses are also appropriate in the General Commercial designation,
provided that land use compatibility and traffic issues have been addressed.
Institutional uses would require discretionary approval.
For a 4.4-acre site at 1626/1640 Newport Boulevard, a site-specific FAR of
0.40 and trip budget of 186 A.M. peak hour trips and 281 P.M. peak hour trips
was established. These two standards allowed the development of medical
office uses or similar moderate-traffic-generating uses, provided that the site-
specific trip budget is not exceeded.
Commercial Center
The Commercial Center designation is intended for large areas with a
concentration of diverse or intense commercial uses serving local and regional
needs. Appropriate uses include a wide variety and scale of retail stores,
LU-34 | Costa Mesa General Plan
                                                     Land Use Element
professional offices, restaurants, hotels, and theaters. Intense service uses,
such as automobile repair and service, should be discouraged.
Development within this designation is intended for a variety of intensities
ranging from one- to four-story buildings. The allowable FARs are 0.25 for
high-traffic-generating uses, 0.35 for moderate-traffic-generating uses, 0.45
for low-traffic-generating uses, and 0.75 for very-low-traffic-generating uses.
Because of the large service area, direct access to major transportation
corridors is essential.
In conjunction with areas that are designated with the mixed-use zoning
overlay district, the maximum FAR is 1.0. An increase to 1.25 FAR may be
allowed for mixed-use plans exhibiting design excellence. In a mixed-use
overlay district area, this FAR includes both residential and non-residential
components, and the maximum number of stories is four.
Mixed-use development projects are intended to provide additional housing
opportunities in the City (such as the Westside) by combining residential and
nonresidential uses in an integrated development. Additionally, this type of
development is intended to revitalize areas of the City without exceeding the
capacity of the General Plan transportation system. Mixed-use developments
shall be implemented through an adopted urban plan (such as the 19 West
Urban Plan and Harbor Boulevard Mixed-Use Overlay) and shall be identified
on the Zoning Map by designating either the CL, C1, and/or C2 base zoning
districts with the mixed-use overlay district. The mix of uses can occur in
either a vertical or horizontal design, up to four stories in height. Product
types shall be identified in the applicable urban plan and may include
live/work units and commercial/residential units where the residential uses
are located above or adjacent to the nonresidential component.
Nonresidential uses may include office, retail, business services, personal
service, public spaces and uses, and other community amenities.
Institutional uses are also appropriate in this commercial designation,
provided that land use compatibility and traffic issues have been addressed.
Institutional uses require discretionary approval.
As complementary uses, residential and other noncommercial uses may be
allowed through the Planned Development process. Residential densities in
planned development projects should not exceed 20 dwelling units per acre.

The corresponding population density range is up to 50 persons per acre. A
site-specific residential density of 40 du/ac was approved for 1901 Newport
Boulevard. The corresponding density range for the project is 100 persons per
acre.
A site-specific FAR of 0.70 and a site-specific density of 40 units/acre was
established for the property located at 1901 Newport Boulevard, a 7.79-acre
site located on the northwest corner of West 19th Street and Newport
Boulevard. The General Plan amendment recognized the existing
development intensity of the 1901 Newport Plaza commercial building
(127,500 square feet) and allowed additional development of 145 multi-family
units with a site-specific building height allowed for a five-level parking
structure.
Segerstrom Home Ranch
The Segerstrom Home Ranch is a 93.34-acre located at 3315 Fairview Road. It
has a base land use designation of Commercial Center and is a part of the
North Costa Mesa Specific Plan. In conjunction with approval of Home Ranch
Alternative A, a site-specific FAR of 0.41 was established for the 17.2-acre
IKEA site. (IKEA is a large retail/warehouse use.) This property is located at
the southeast corner of South Coast Drive and Harbor Boulevard. A maximum
allowable FAR of 0.40 for office uses was established for the 14.5-acre
Industrial Park parcel located to the north of South Coast Drive.
In 2016, a specific-site FAR allowed a maximum of 0.64 FAR on the 44-acre
subarea of Segerstrom Home Ranch located south of South Coast Drive.
Maximum building height varies from two stories to five stories/75 feet within
this subarea. Although the Planned Development Commercial zoning may
allow mixed-use development (i.e., housing as a complementary use), housing
is not permitted on this property due to its location. The established trip
budgets for this subarea of Home Ranch is 1,860 A.M. and 1,788 P.M. See
Table LU-7 and Figure LU-4.

Regional Commercial
The Regional Commercial designation is intended to apply to large
concentrated shopping centers of regional scale and importance. The
intended uses within this designation include major department stores,
specialty retail outlets, restaurants, offices, hotels, and other complementary
uses.
Application of the Regional Commercial designation is limited to the existing
South Coast Plaza sites. This includes the original 97-acre site between Bristol
and Bear Street and the additional 18-acre site located west of Bear Street.
This designation and locational criteria recognizes the evolution of South
Coast Plaza as a regionally significant retail trade center served by major
regional transportation facilities and services.
The Costa Mesa General Plan assigns a trip budget for the original South Coast
Plaza site of 1,166 A.M. peak hour trips and 5,036 P.M. peak hour trips. The
trip budget for the site west of Bear Street is 293 A.M. peak hour trips and
1,264 P.M. peak hour trips.
Complementary residential uses within this designation are allowed through
the Planned Development process. The maximum allowable residential
density shall be 20 dwelling units per acre. The trip budget for South Coast
Plaza is identified in Table LU-10, and in the North Costa Mesa Specific Plan.

Urban Center Commercial
The Urban Center Commercial designation is intended to allow high-intensity
mixed-use commercial development within a limited area. Developments
within this designation can range from one- and two-story office and retail
LU-40 | Costa Mesa General Plan
                                                     Land Use Element
buildings to mid- and high-rise buildings of four to approximately 25 stories,
provided the maximum building height set forth in the North Costa Mesa
Specific Plan is not exceeded. Appropriate uses include offices, retail shops,
restaurants, residential, and hotels.
For mixed-use projects that include separate or distinct components, the
nonresidential FAR standard and the residential density standard shall apply
to each of the respective components, not the entire project site. For mixed-
use projects that do not include distinct elements or include mixed-use
buildings, the overall level of intensity shall be governed by the allowable
nonresidential FAR and the maximum number of residential units identified in
this designation for a specific project site. Developments shall also comply
with the established trip budget standards and comply with the most
restrictive standard.
Complementary residential uses within this designation may be allowed
through the Planned Development zone process. The maximum allowable
residential density within this designation shall be 20 dwelling units per acre,
unless otherwise specified in the North Costa Mesa Specific Plan.
The Urban Center Commercial designation includes the following major
developments:
        Automobile Club of Southern California
        Metro Pointe
        South Coast Metro Center/Experian
        Sakioka Lot 2 (as of 2015, unbuilt)
All of these four properties had development agreements with the City of
Costa Mesa that vested maximum development square footages, floor area
ratios, trip budgets, and allowed uses. Provided in Table LU-11: Urban Center
Major Developments, is a summary of the various land use standards that
apply to these major developments. Please refer to the North Costa Mesa
Specific Plan for additional information related to these properties. See Figure

Land Use Element
Automobile Club of Southern California Processing Center
This 39.2-acre site consists of two parcels and is located on the southwest
corner of Sunflower Avenue and Fairview Road. The primary site contains
29.5 acres and is located west of Fairview Road, between South Coast Drive
and Sunflower Avenue. The second parcel contains approximately 9.7 acres
and is located across the adjacent flood control channel to the west, just
north of South Coast Drive. As of 2000, the site was developed with 717,000
square feet of office and support service uses. An additional 250,000 square
feet of development is allowed pursuant to a development agreement for a
total of 967,000 square feet; the resultant maximum FAR is 0.56. Future
construction will be developed in phases during the 30-year term of the
agreement.
Metro Pointe
Metro Pointe includes two office building sites located north of South Coast
Drive at its intersection with Greenbrook Drive and approximately 28.5 acres
of land located south of South Coast Drive along the San Diego Freeway. A
development agreement approved in 1994 addresses the site south of South
Coast Drive. The development agreement vests the property owner with the
ability to construct 592,287 square feet of office and commercial uses with a
resultant floor area ratio of 0.48. This property is also located in the North
Costa Mesa Specific Plan area.
South Coast Metro Center/Experian
The 44.72-acre South Coast Metro Center/Experian sites are located south of
Anton Boulevard and east of Avenue of the Arts. Upon completion, the site
will include nearly 1,546,180 square feet of office and commercial
development. A site-specific FAR of 0.79 was established for the combined
South Coast Metro Center and Experian sites.
In 2006, a site-specific residential density increase for a 4.86-acre site portion
of this development was approved as an optional development scenario for
this property. The maximum density allowed is 100 units/acre with integrated
ancillary retail uses. This equates to a maximum density of 100 units/acre, or a
total of 484 high-rise units. The residential development option results in a
corresponding decrease in the maximum allowable FAR and building square
footages for non-residential buildings in order to be similar to the A.M. and
P.M. trip budgets established for the South Coast Metro Center/Experian sites
LU-44 | Costa Mesa General Plan
                                                     Land Use Element
with strictly nonresidential development. In 2014, an alternative development
option for 393 apartment units was approved. This scenario also results in
decrease in trip budget. The North Costa Mesa Specific Plan provides further
detail for these properties.
Sakioka Lot 2
The 33-acre Sakioka Lot 2 is located south and east of Anton Boulevard. This
site is undeveloped except for farmhouses and farm operation facilities.
Pursuant to a development agreement, the maximum allowable building
square footage is of 863,000 square feet. A maximum 1.0 FAR shall be applied
for nonresidential development.
The maximum residential density shall be 28 dwelling units per acre for the
residential component of a mixed-use development (see “Mixed-Use”
discussion in the Specific Plan) or a maximum of 80 dwelling units per acre if
an independent parcel is developed as residential community including
affordable housing (see “Affordable Housing/Density Bonus discussion in the
Specific Plan).
Future development on Sakioka Lot 2 is subject to the trip budget limitation,
applicable development standards of the PDC zone, and consistency with the
both the North Costa Mesa Specific Plan and the General Plan.
Cultural Arts Center
The Cultural Arts Center designation is applied to the 57.3 acres, including
private streets, that comprise South Coast Plaza Town Center. This area is
generally bounded by Sunflower Avenue to the north, Bristol Street to the
west, Avenue of the Arts to the east, and the San Diego Freeway to the south.
This designation is limited to this geographical area, and it is not intended to
be applied to other locations in the City.
The Cultural Arts Center designation allows intensely developed mixed
commercial and cultural uses within a limited area. The intended uses within
this designation include mid- to high-rise offices, hotels, restaurants, retail,
and cultural uses (theater, art museum or academy, etc.), as well as mid- to
high-rise residential units in limited areas that are defined in the North Costa
Mesa Specific Plan. It serves as the cultural center of the community and
provides a focus to the arts-related uses, with the complement of nearby
employment and shopping opportunities.
                          Costa Mesa General Plan | LU-45

Land Use Element
The overall allowable FAR standard for this designation is 1.77. Included in
this FAR calculation is the land dedicated or reserved in 2000 for the Avenue
of the Arts off-ramp and associated flood control channel improvements. The
1.77 FAR may be exceeded on individual parcels within South Coast Plaza
Town Center, provided that over the entire 54-acre site the 1.77 FAR is not
exceeded. Further delineation of the allocation within South Coast Plaza
Town Center of the FAR and trip budget is provided in the North Costa Mesa
Specific Plan.
In 2006, a high-rise residential development option for each of the three sub-
areas in South Coast Plaza Town Center was approved. The maximum number
of residential units allowed in the entire South Coast Plaza Town Center is 535
units. The high-rise residential development option is further detailed in the
North Costa Mesa Specific Plan. As shown in Table LU-12, this scenario results
in a corresponding decrease in the maximum allowable FAR and building
square footages for non-residential buildings in order to maintain the A.M. and
P.M. trip budgets established for the South Coast Plaza Town Center.

Industrial Designations
Two industrial land use designations apply to over 1,000 acres. These
designations accommodate a variety of industrial and compatible office uses,
as well as limited and supportive commercial uses. Development intensity
potential is measured using FAR in relation to the amount of traffic expected,
as shown in Table LU-13: Industrial Floor-Area Ratio.

Note:        1. With an application of the mixed-use overlay district, the FAR may
             range from 1.0 to 1.25. Refer to Mixed-Use discussion and Table LU-15:
             Overlay and Urban Plan Residential Density.
Light Industry
The Light Industry designation applies to areas intended for a variety of light
and general industrial uses. Uses are limited to small manufacturing and
service industries, as well as larger industrial operations that can demonstrate
design features or restricted operations that limit disruptions to surrounding
uses. Although the uses within Light Industry areas are intended to be less
intense than those allowed in Industrial Parks, the frequent lack of a physical
separation between Light Industry areas and residential development
necessitates design features that limit disturbances between uses. Access to
industrial areas should be provided in a manner that directs industrial traffic
away from more sensitive uses.
Development within this designation would be characterized by a
combination of one- and two-story buildings. Because of the location of Light
Industry areas and their proximity to residential uses, taller buildings should
be restricted to areas that will not disrupt the surrounding residential uses.
Certain commercial uses may be allowed, provided that the commercial use is
determined to be complementary to the industrial area. Commercial
recreational uses may also be appropriate under the same condition.
                             Costa Mesa General Plan | LU-47
Land Use Element
Institutional uses may also be appropriate, provided that land use
compatibility and traffic issues have been addressed. Institutional uses would
require discretionary review.
Combinations of residential, institutional, and commercial uses may be
allowed through the Planned Development process. FARs and population
densities for commercial projects would be similar to the Neighborhood
Commercial land use designation. Residential densities in Planned
Development projects are not to exceed 20 dwelling units per acre.
Mixed-use development projects in overlay zones are intended to provide
additional housing opportunities in the City (such as the Westside) by
combining residential and nonresidential uses in an integrated development.
Additionally, this type of development is intended to revitalize areas of the
City without exceeding the capacity of the General Plan transportation
system. Mixed-use developments shall be implemented through an adopted
urban plan (such as the 19 West and Mesa West Bluff Urban Plan) and will be
identified on the Zoning Map by designating the MG base zoning district with
the mixed-use overlay district. The mix of uses can occur in either a vertical or
horizontal design, up to four stories in height. Product types will be identified
in the applicable urban plans and may include live/work units and
commercial/residential units where the residential uses are located above or
adjacent to the nonresidential component. Nonresidential uses may include
office, retail, business services, personal service, public spaces and uses, and
other community amenities. Residential development may be allowed in
conjunction with the mixed-use overlay district for Mesa West Bluff Urban
Plan area at density that does not exceed 13 units per acre. The required
Mesa West Bluff Urban Plan shall include development standards to ensure
compatibility with surrounding land uses.
Industrial Park
The Industrial Park designation is intended to apply to large districts that
contain a variety of industrial and compatible office and support commercial
uses. Industrial parks are characterized by large parcels and landscaped
setbacks that create a campus-like environment. Industrial parks must have
proximity to freeways and other major transportation routes to provide the
accessibility they require. An internal circulation system consisting of lesser
highways is also necessary to accommodate the vehicle demands created.
LU-48 | Costa Mesa General Plan
                                                    Land Use Element
Industrial parks have major physical separations from areas designated for
other uses to maintain their distinctiveness and avoid potential land use
incompatibilities.
Development within this designation would consist of one- and two-story
buildings. Additional height may be permitted when compatible with adjacent
development and provided uses are consistent with other constraints, such as
height limits and use restrictions within John Wayne Airport influence area, as
identified in the Safety Element. The Industrial Park portion of the Home
Ranch site may include buildings up to five stories in height near the center of
the development. The North Costa Mesa Specific Plan provides specific
building height information for the Segerstrom Home Ranch (Area 1).
Commercial uses may be allowed, provided that the use is determined to be
complementary to the industrial area. Commercial recreational uses may also
be appropriate under the same condition. Institutional uses may also be
appropriate, provided that land use compatibility and traffic issues have been
addressed. Institutional uses will require discretionary approval.
Proposed industrial development must be analyzed for potential significant
impacts to air quality, aesthetics, land use, and other environmental issues.
Combinations of residential, institutional, and commercial uses may be
allowed through the Planned Development process. FARs and population
densities for commercial projects would be similar to the Neighborhood
Commercial land use designation. Residential densities in planned
development projects shall not exceed 20 dwelling units per acre.
Institutional and Open Space
Costa Mesa has thousands of acres of land set aside for public, semi-public,
and open space type uses, all identified by one of these three land use
designations: Public/Institutional, Golf Course, and Fairgrounds, and Multi-Use
Center.
Public/Institutional
The Public/Institutional designation applies to both publicly and privately
owned land that provides recreation, open space, health, and educational
opportunities, as well as uses that provide a service to the public. Since this
                           Costa Mesa General Plan | LU-49
Land Use Element
designation includes many different types of land uses, the Land Use Plan is
labeled to identify the individual uses.
Areas included in this designation are park sites, health care facilities,
educational institutions, religious facilities, fairgrounds, and public facilities.
Since many of the uses are recreational and open space in nature, levels of
building intensity are minimal.
Golf Course
Three golf courses are located within the City's planning area. Two of these,
the Costa Mesa Golf Course and Mesa Verde Country Club, lie within City
limits. Santa Ana Country Club is in the unincorporated area east of Newport
Boulevard. Because of the large area devoted to open space, the building
intensity for this designation is 0.01 FAR.
Fairgrounds
The Fairgrounds land use designation is applicable to only one property
known as the Orange County Fair & Event Center (OCFEC) in the City of Costa
Mesa. The Fairgrounds is a 150-acre site located at 88 Fair Drive. This
designation is intended to:
        Ensure continued development of the property as an integrated
         complex that is composed of recreational, agriculture-related
         educational institutions, open space, farmland, equestrian, and
         commercial uses; and
        Promote the continued and sustained use of the property for the
         annual Orange County Fair in recognition of its value as a regionally
         significant resource in the City of Costa Mesa.
Home to the annual Orange County Fair since 1949, the site is bounded by
Arlington Drive (north boundary), Fair Drive (south), Fairview Road (west), and
Newport Boulevard (east). Regional access is primarily provided to the site by
State Route 55 at the interchanges of Fair Drive/Del Mar Avenue and 22nd
Street/Victoria Street. Access from Interstate 405, which is approximately
one-mile north of the Fairgrounds, is provided via interchanges at Bristol
Street, Fairview Road, and Harbor Boulevard. See Figure LU-7.
The site was formerly a portion of the Santa Ana Army Air Base, and in 1949
the California 32nd District Agricultural Association (DAA) acquired the

Land Use Element
property from the federal government. Since that time, the annual Orange
County Fair has occurred at this location. Through the years the 32nd DAA has
expanded the use of the property into a year-round exhibition, conference,
equestrian, activity, and event center; these uses collectively the OCFEC.
The 32nd DAA Fair Board adopted the current OCFEC Master Plan in 2003.
Given that the 32nd DAA is a State entity for administration of the Orange
County Fair, Costa Mesa has limited land use and permitting authority over
the property while it is controlled by the State.
In the future, if the State no longer controls the property, any proposed new
development or change of use shall be subject to review for consistency with
the City’s General Plan and zoning regulations. The new property
owner/operator may continue to operate the Fairgrounds as it existed at the
time of sale as a legal nonconforming use and development. The property’s
legal nonconforming status will remain in effect until such time as the
property owner submits and receives approval of a master plan by Costa
Mesa.
The Fairgrounds site contains approximately 400,000 square feet of buildings,
including:
        Pacific Amphitheater
        Arlington Theater
        Grandstand Arena
        Equestrian center
        Exhibit and administration buildings
        Concession and restaurant buildings
        Memorial Gardens
        Centennial Farms
        Livestock barns
The Fairgrounds designation recognizes the existing fairground and event
center uses associated with this site. The General Plan traffic model does not
take into account the trip generation from the annual OC Fair or
weeknight/weekend special event uses (i.e., Orange County Marketplace)
because peak vehicle trips to the site occur outside normal business
timeframes. However, further development of the Fairgrounds will need to

                                                      Land Use Element
be balanced with the development capacity of the City’s transportation
system and with the protection of surrounding neighborhoods.
Permitted uses include ancillary office uses, exposition/conference uses,
equestrian uses, agricultural/livestock activities, restaurants, temporary
specialty retail sales (including vehicle sales), outdoor marketplace,
emergency operational uses, and concerts/live entertainment uses.
Complementary uses to the fairground and event center uses may include
botanical gardens, animal exhibits, museum, art/historical artifacts gallery,
and performance art theaters that are supportive of the fairground uses.
Uses that are not supportive of fairground and event center uses are expressly
prohibited. Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to, casinos/gambling
venues, shopping centers, hotel/motels, residential uses, self-storage
facilities, hospitals, and medical uses. In addition, exclusive use or dedicated
athletic sports facilities and educational uses that are unrelated to the OCFEC
are prohibited.
As a State-owned property, the Fairgrounds is not normally subject to the
City’s Noise Ordinance. However, pursuant to a 1990 Court Order (Case Nos.
42 07 28 and 55 65 08), exterior noise standards comparable to the City’s
noise regulations have been applied to the property. Noise sensitive uses
include neighboring residences, Davis Intermediate School, and Costa Mesa
High School. The court-ordered noise restrictions apply to the operation of
the Pacific Amphitheater. Development within the Fairgrounds designation is
intended for buildings ranging from one- to four-story structures. The
maximum allowable FAR for this designation shall be 0.10.
Multi-Use Center
Fairview Developmental Center
On January 5, 1959, the Fairview Developmental Center opened as a State
hospital originally occupying 750 acres. Fairview Developmental Center had an
initial bed capacity of 2,622 and was intended to house some 4,125 residents.
The population at the facilities peaked in 1967 and has been declining since. In
2015, the current population was 275 persons, and the downward trend is
expected to continue due to the restructuring of the State of California's
approach to providing institutionalized care for the developmentally disabled.
The State has been focusing on residential care options (as opposed to
institutional care) for these disabled individuals.
                            Costa Mesa General Plan | LU-53

Land Use Element
A large portion of the original land was transferred in 1979 to the City of Costa
Mesa and now encompasses Fairview Park and the golf course. In 1985, the
City granted a General Plan amendment and rezone of 54 acres of surplus
land immediately to the north of the hospital facilities for high-density
residential uses. In 1987 and 2005, other parcels were converted to
residential uses. These areas are planned developments with one-story,
single-family residences, a two-story, small-lot residential subdivision, and
two-story apartment buildings (Harbor Village Apartments).
In February 2016, the State of California Department of Development Services
initiated the process for closure of Fairview Developmental Center.
Multi-use refers to the integration of a variety of land uses and intensities.
This land use category includes uses which are low to moderate intensity and
urban in character. The Multi-Use Center designation is applicable only to the
Fairview Developmental Center property at 2501 Harbor Boulevard. The
compatible zoning district is Institutional & Recreational - Multi-Use District
(I&R-MLT). The allowable land uses are as follows:
        0.25 FAR Institutional and Recreational uses
        25 percent minimum requirement for park and open space purposes
         (approximately 25.6 acres)
        Maximum cap of 582 dwelling units for the entire site within the
         limitations described below
In anticipation of the future closure of the Fairview Development Center, this
property is assigned a unique General Plan land use plan designation. The
Multi-Use Center designation is comprised of a variety of residential, open
space, and institutional uses.
These multi-uses are to be complementary to the Costa Mesa Golf Course and
surrounding residential neighborhoods. The maximum number of 250 single-
family residential units at 6 dwelling units an acre and 332 multi-family
residential units may be allowed at the Shannon Mountain's site within the
Fairview Developmental Center at 40 dwelling unit an acre. Under these
density limitations, the overall cap in total housing buildout shall not exceed
582 units for the entire Fairview Developmental Center site. Additional
housing units may be built, as long as they meet the density bonus provisions
pursuant to State law (Government Code Section 65915- 65918). At least 25
percent of the site shall be dedicated to open space. A maximum 0.25 FAR for
institutional/recreational uses would be allowed for undeveloped area not

assigned to housing or permanent open space. See Table LU-14: Multi-Use
Center Designation. Permitted uses include:
        Institutional uses, such as public and private recreational facilities,
         dedicated athletic fields, athletic complex, sports parks, community
         centers, and public facilities
        Hospital, medical, dental, physical therapy, in-patient care, psychiatric
         facilities, administrative offices and facilities for the developmentally
         disabled
        Residential uses, such single-family detached housing, apartments,
         condominiums, and townhouses
        Open space uses, such as active play fields, recreational areas,
         parkland, and botanical gardens
Uses that are industrial or commercial in nature are expressly prohibited.
Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to, corporate office parks,
casinos/gambling venues, shopping centers, concerts/entertainment venues,
hotel/motels, exposition/conference uses, shopping center, and swap meets.
The maximum 0.25 FAR for institutional development within the Multi-Use
Center designation is intended for buildings ranging from one- to four-story
structures. Residential uses shall also be limited to a maximum height of four
stories.
The Multi-Use Center General Plan land use designation (and corresponding
Zoning District) will require a Master Plan for any future development project,
whether or not the State retains the property or sells to a private entity. A
Master Plan is required to be approved by the City Council if the property is
owned by a non-State entity or if the State elects to participate in the City's
planning process for Master Plan adoption.
The City will require the dedicated parkland component in order to activate a
master plan for new development. The 25 percent open space requirement
would apply and, therefore, future development would need to include a
specific acreage of active park uses for sports fields or the master plan cannot
be considered in conformance with this unique General Plan land use
designation.

Land Use Overlays and Urban Plans
The City has adopted land use overlays that are intended to encourage reuse
and revitalization of underutilized properties. The incentives provided expand
land uses, provide development flexibility, stimulate economic growth, and
create integrated areas complementary to the surrounding environs. Refer to
Figure LU-9 for the location of the Overlay and Urban Plan boundaries.
Mixed-Use Overlay Zone/Urban Plan Areas
Mixed-use development projects are intended to provide additional housing
opportunities in the City by combining residential and nonresidential uses in
an integrated development. Additionally, this type of development is intended
to revitalize areas of the City without exceeding the capacity of the General
Plan transportation system. Mixed-use developments shall be implemented
through an adopted urban plan and shall be identified on the Zoning Map with
the mixed-use overlay district. The mix of uses can occur in either a vertical or
horizontal design.

                             are located above or adjacent to the nonresidential component.
                             Nonresidential uses may include office, retail, business services, personal
                             service, public spaces and uses, and other community amenities.
                             In conjunction with areas that are designated with the mixed-use zoning
                             overlay district, the maximum FAR is 1.0. An increase to 1.25 FAR may be
                             allowed for mixed-use plans exhibiting design excellence. In a mixed-use
                             overlay district area, the FAR includes both residential and non-residential
                             components. Table LU-15: Overlay and Urban Plan Residential Density, lists

Residential Incentive Overlay
The Residential Incentive Overlay creates opportunities for residential
development at strategic locations along Harbor Boulevard and Newport
Boulevard. This designation allows for new higher-density residential uses in
areas where limited residential with lower densities are allowed. Small-lot
single-family subdivisions would be appropriate as well. The Residential
Incentive Overlay also expands development opportunities on commercial
properties not developed to their full potential or supporting outdated
buildings and underperforming uses.
Maximum building height is four stories, provided privacy concerns of
adjacent established residential neighborhoods are adequately addressed
through the setback of upper stories or other design approaches. Housing
within the Residential Incentive Overlay is limited to a maximum density of 40
units per acre. See Table LU-16: Residential Incentive Overlay and Figures LU-
10 and LU-11.

Permitted development approaches are mixed-use development that
combines residential and commercial uses, as well as stand-alone commercial
and residential uses. This designation emphasizes commercial uses and aims
to expand the established innovative, eclectic, and unique uses that support
homegrown and incubator-type businesses important to the local economy.
The integration of innovative public spaces and “hangout” areas for special
events are highly encouraged.
The maximum residential density within the SoBECA overlay is 40 units per
acre. A maximum 1.25 FAR applies to mixed-use buildings that integrate
residential and commercial uses. Stand-alone commercial or industrial
buildings have a maximum 1.0 FAR. The maximum building height for all
projects is four stories. The maximum number of residential units allowed

Harbor Mixed-Use Overlay
The Harbor Mixed-Use Overlay applies to select areas along Harbor Boulevard,
between Wilson Street and 19th Street. The intent is to introduce a diverse mix
of uses, with the objective of creating a much more integrated, walkable, and
complementary balance of creative residential and retail spaces,
neighborhood-serving retail and commercial services, and residential uses
along the southern portion of Harbor Boulevard that intersects with 19th
Street. The designation allows residential development at up to 20 dwelling
units per acre. A maximum 1.25 FAR applies to projects that consist of both
residential and commercial mixed uses; maximum building height is four

Urban Plan. Development proposed within the Westside Urban Plans requires
approval of a Master Plan pursuant to the City of Costa Mesa Municipal Code.
19 West Urban Plan
The 19 West Urban Plan provides commercial and residential mixed-use
opportunities primarily along West 19th Street and Harbor Boulevard, at a
cluster of properties between Newport Boulevard and Superior Avenue, and
at the south side of Victoria Street and Placentia Avenue. This mixed-use
overlay zone (over the Commercial and Industrial base districts) is intended to
promote commercial/residential mixed-use development, encourage adaptive
reuse, stimulate private investments and improvements, promote new

housing types, and meet housing demand. Development is subject to the trip
budget established in the Zoning Code.
Mesa West Bluffs Urban Plan
The Mesa West Bluffs Urban Plan encompasses approximately 277 acres and
was adopted to provide an overlay zone encouraging the development of
live/work units or residential development, with the goal of revitalizing and
providing new high-quality residences. The Mesa West Bluffs Urban Plan
applies to industrial properties predominantly south of 18th Street, north of
16th Street, and along Placentia Avenue. The Urban Plan intends to stimulate
live/work and residential development without exceeding the development
capacity of the General Plan transportation system. With regard to industrial
uses, established industrial uses may continue and expand. New residential
development must recognize long-established industrial uses and be designed
to minimize conflicts. New creative industrial workspace is permitted,
provided that activities limit or confine noise, dust, and vibration impacts.
Mesa West Residential Ownership Urban Plan
The Mesa West Residential Ownership Urban Plan encompasses
approximately 238 acres located between Victoria Street and 17th Street, west
of SR-55. The objective of the Mesa West Residential Ownership Urban Plan is
to promote economic viability in existing medium-density and high-density
residential areas, encourage the conversion of existing rental apartments to
residential common-interest development (i.e., condominiums, planned unit
developments), and encourage new residential common-interest
development to improve the balance between rental and ownership
opportunities.
The Mesa West Residential Ownership Urban Plan provides flexible
development regulations to create additional incentives for new
development.

Housing and Employment
Projections
Providing a land use arrangement that encourages a correlation of
employment and housing opportunities is a local and regional responsibility.
Providing sufficient commercial land to support residential development is
primarily a local responsibility, although commercial uses serving regional
needs are provided as well. Sufficient land must also be established to meet
the recreational needs of the local community, although regional needs are
often accommodated by land within individual cities. Table LU-20: General
Plan Land Use 2035, identifies the projected future growth and implications of
the Land Use Plan.

Goals, Objectives, and Policies
Maintaining and enhancing the great quality of life in Costa Mesa is the
foundation of this General Plan. The City will look towards focusing future
change within targeted growth areas. Some of these areas already have a mix
of commercial, office, hotel, and residential uses, and are located along
roadways that will be enhanced with “Complete Streets” features (see
Circulation Element), improved landscaping, and expanded public spaces
(such as parks and plazas). In turn, the City will also protect and enhance
neighborhoods throughout Costa Mesa to ensure these largely residential
areas continue to provide value to residents and the community as whole.
Foremost, attention will be given to protecting the character and quality of
residential neighborhoods, including those features that distinguish an area,
such as building scale, historical structures, well-maintained rental housing,
mature vegetation, and attractive streetscapes.
Goal LU-1: A Balanced Community with a
Mix of Land Uses to Meet Resident and
Business Needs
Objective LU-1A.     Establish and maintain a balance of land uses
                     throughout the community to preserve the residential
                     character of the City at a level no greater than can be
                     supported by the infrastructure.
Policy LU-1.1        Provide for the development of a mix and balance of
                     housing opportunities, commercial goods and services,
                     and employment opportunities in consideration of the
                     needs of the business and residential segments of the
                     community.
Policy LU-1.2        Balance economic gains from new development while
                     preserving the character and densities of residential
                     neighborhoods.
Policy LU-1.3        Strongly encourage the development of residential uses
                     and owner-occupied housing (single-family detached
                     residences, condominiums, townhouses) where feasible

Land Use Element
                 to improve the balance between rental and ownership
                 housing opportunities.
Policy LU-1.4    Promote housing and employment opportunities within
                 planned development areas to the extent feasible.
Policy LU-1.5    Maintain a land use structure that strives to balance jobs
                 and housing with available infrastructure and public and
                 human services.
Goal LU-2: Preserve and Protect
Residential Neighborhoods
Objective LU-2A. Promote land use patterns and development that
                 contribute to community and neighborhood identity.
Policy LU-2.1    In the event of damage or destruction, allow any legal
                 conforming use in existence at the time of adoption of the
                 General Plan that is located in a nonconforming
                 development to be rebuilt to its original building intensity,
                 as long as any such rebuilding would not increase the
                 development's nonconformity, and the damage or
                 destruction was in no way brought about by intentional
                 acts of any owner of such use or property.
Policy LU-2.2    Pursue maximum use of utility company funds and
                 resources in undergrounding existing overhead lines, and
                 encourage undergrounding of utilities in the public right-
                 of-way for residential development consisting of five units
                 or more, to the extent feasible and practical.
Policy LU-2.3    Develop standards, policies, and other methods to
                 encourage the grouping of individual parcels to eliminate
                 obsolete subdivision patterns and to provide improved
                 living environments while being consistent with the
                 neighborhood character of the surrounding community.
Policy LU-2.4    Do not allow "rounding up" when calculating the number
                 of permitted residential units, except for lots existing as of
                 March 16, 1992, zoned R2-MD that have less than 7,260
                 square feet in area, and no less than 6,000 square feet,
                 where density calculation fractions of 1.65 or greater may
                 be rounded up to two units.

                                                Land Use Element
Policy LU-2.5  Allow creation of parcels without street frontage if
               sufficient easements are provided for planned
               developments or common-interest developments
               consistent with the neighborhood character. This policy
               does not apply to small lot subdivisions.
Policy LU-2.6  Encourage increased private market investment in
               declining or deteriorating neighborhoods.
Policy LU-2.7  Permit the construction of buildings over two stories or
               30 feet only when it can be shown that the construction
               of such structures will not adversely impact surrounding
               developments and deprive existing land uses of adequate
               light, air, privacy, and solar access.
Policy LU-2.8  Limit building height to four stories above grade south of
               the I-405 Freeway, except for special purpose housing
               such as elderly, affordable, or student housing, unless
               otherwise approved by a General Plan amendment. (A
               four-story/five-level parking structure with roof deck
               parking on the fifth level is considered a four-story
               structure.)
Policy LU-2.9  Require appropriate building setbacks, structure
               orientation, and placement windows to consider the
               privacy of adjacent residential structures within the same
               project and on adjacent properties.
Policy LU-2.10 Promote lot consolidation of residential properties to the
               extent feasible and practical, including the creation of
               larger single-family residential lots that exceed the
               minimum 6,000-square-foot requirement in
               neighborhoods where the prevailing residential
               subdivision pattern features larger-sized residential lots.
Policy LU-2.11 Ensure adequate noise attenuation in urban design, such
               as walls for sound attenuation, development of
               landscaped greenbelts, provision of landscape berms, etc.

Goal LU-3: Development that Maintains
Neighborhood Integrity and Character
Objective LU-3A. Establish policies, standards, and procedures to minimize
                 blighting influences, and maintain the integrity of stable
                 neighborhoods.
Policy LU-3.1    Protect existing stabilized residential neighborhoods,
                 including mobile home parks (and manufactured housing
                 parks), from the encroachment of incompatible or
                 potentially disruptive land uses and/or activities.
Policy LU-3.2    Actively enforce existing regulations regarding derelict or
                 abandoned vehicles, outdoor storage, and substandard or
                 illegal buildings, and establish regulations to abate weed-
                 filled yards when any of the above are deemed to
                 constitute a health, safety, or fire hazard.
Policy LU-3.3    Continue code enforcement as a high priority with regard
                 to the regulation of property maintenance standards
                 citywide.
Policy LU-3.4    Ensure that residential densities can be supported by the
                 infrastructure and are compatible with existing residential
                 neighborhoods in the surrounding area.
Policy LU-3.5    Provide opportunities for the development of well-
                 planned and designed projects which, through vertical or
                 horizontal integration, provide for the development of
                 compatible residential, commercial, industrial,
                 institutional, or public uses within a single project or
                 neighborhood.
Policy LU-3.6    Facilitate revitalization of aging commercial centers by
                 working with property owners, developers, local
                 businesses, and other community organizations to
                 coordinate efforts.
Policy LU-3.7    Promote development/design flexibility that encourages
                 older or poorly maintained high-density residential uses
                 to be rehabilitated.
Policy LU-3.8    Ensure that new development reflects existing design
                 standards, qualities, and features that are in context with
LU-76 | Costa Mesa General Plan
                                               Land Use Element
               nearby development and surrounding residential
               neighborhoods.
Policy LU-3.9  Locate high-intensity developments or high-traffic-
               generating uses away from low-density residential in
               order to buffer the more sensitive land uses from the
               potentially adverse impacts of the more intense
               development or uses.
Policy LU-3.10 Minimize effects of new development on the privacy and
               character of surrounding neighborhoods.
Policy LU-3.11 Promote small-lot residential development on long,
               narrow, single parcels or combined residential lots.
Policy LU-3.12 Ensure that new development reflects existing design
               standards, qualities, and features that are in context with
               nearby development.
Policy LU-3.13 Prohibit construction of buildings which would present a
               hazard to air navigation, as determined by the Federal
               Aviation Administration (FAA).
Policy LU-3.14 Certain development proposals which may include the
               construction or alteration of structures more than 200
               feet above ground level may require filing with the
               Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Airport Land
               Use Commission (ALUC) pursuant to federal and State
               law. If a filing requirement is determined to be necessary
               in accordance with the procedures provided by
               State/federal agencies, the filing of a Notice of Proposed
               Construction or Alteration (FAA Form 7460-1) shall be
               required prior to review and consideration of the

           most road systems in Southern California established long ago—has been
           designed primarily for automobiles. This Circulation Element changes the
           paradigm for transportation planning by giving equal attention to planning
           and building systems that accommodate all mobility means, including on foot,
           by bicycle, and via transit.
           This element includes goals, objectives, and policies that the City will use to
           make decisions regarding transportation improvements that significantly
                                         Costa Mesa General Plan | C-1

Circulation Element
expand bicycle and pedestrian travel capabilities, manage the established
roadway system efficiently and effectively, enhance transit facilities, and
implement “complete street” strategies that ensure all users and mobility
options are addressed in future street improvements.
Purpose
Costa Mesa will pursue strategies and programs that not only address
relieving vehicular congestion but also create local conditions that emphasize
active transportation. With its mild climate and flat terrain, Costa Mesa
should be a place where people can easily bike and walk. The transportation
system described in this element is a balanced multimodal transportation
network that meets the needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways for
safe and convenient travel. Those users include children, cyclists of all ages,
pedestrians, persons with disabilities, motorists, movers of commercial goods,
transit riders, and seniors. The City’s aim is to balance the ability of this varied
circulation network to accommodate planned growth in a manner that
minimizes delay, creates efficiencies, and supports the community’s
environmental and economic goals.
The Circulation Element establishes policies governing the system of
roadways, intersections, bike paths, pedestrian ways, and other components
of the circulations system, which collectively provide for the movement of
persons and goods throughout Costa Mesa. Most significantly, the element:
        Applies “Complete Streets” strategies for street improvements
        Defines active transportation improvements that will create improved
         conditions for walking and cycling
        Coordinates land use planning and transportation improvements to
         effectively manage and improve the established roadway system
        Identifies linkages and connectivity among all transportation modes.

Established Roadways
Regional Transportation
Costa Mesa is centrally located in Orange County near the Pacific Coast and is
well served by the regional freeway system consisting of:
         San Diego Freeway (I-405), which traverses east-west across the
          northern portion of the City
         Corona del Mar Freeway (SR-73), which begins at I-405 between
          Fairview Road and Bear Street and extends southeast, where it
          becomes the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor
         Costa Mesa Freeway (SR-55), which enters at the northeast corner of
          the City and extends southwest, transitioning into Newport Boulevard
          south of 19th Street
These freeways provide regional access throughout Orange County and points
beyond, which is convenient but also can be severely congested during
weekday and weekend peak-hour periods, placing additional burden on
parallel streets.
Street System
North/south arterial roadways serving the City include Harbor Boulevard,
Fairview Road, Bear Street, and Bristol Street, all of which are six-lane
facilities; and Placentia Avenue and Red Hill Avenue, both of which are four-
lane facilities. East-west arterial roadways serving the City include Anton
Boulevard and Adams Avenue, which are six-lane facilities; Sunflower Avenue,
which is a six-lane facility east of Bear Street and a four-lane facility west of
Bear Street; and South Coast Drive, Baker Street, Fair Drive, Victoria Street,
West 19th Street, and East 17th Street, all four-lane facilities.

East-west access to Costa Mesa is constrained by the Santa Ana River on the
west and on the east by John Wayne Airport and Upper Newport Bay. The
Santa Ana River runs along the entire western City boundary, with crossings
only at Adams Avenue, Victoria Street, and MacArthur Boulevard. Besides I-
405, these roadways represent the only locations where Costa Mesa residents
can travel to Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley. Although a crossing had
one time been planned via West 19th Street, the Orange County
Transportation Authority (OCTA) amended its Master Plan of Arterial
Highways1 in 2014 to remove this connection. To the east, the airport and
Upper Newport Bay entirely constrain surface street connections extending
east, except via Pacific Coast Highway to the south, Bristol Street parallel to
SR-73, and MacArthur Boulevard north of I-405.
The circulation system layout is notable for its two grid patterns. Streets east
of and including Newport Boulevard were constructed at approximately 45
degree angles from the traditional north/south streets in north Orange
County. This results in odd-angled intersections along Newport Boulevard;
west of Newport Boulevard, the streets are generally in a more traditional grid
pattern.

  Cities throughout Orange County must ensure that their own circulation master
plans are consistent with OCTA’s Master Plan of Arterial Highways to remain eligible
for M2 funds, as described later in this element.

                         In 2015, I-405 through Orange County carried as many as 370,000 vehicles per
                         day, making it one of the busiest roadways in the nation. OCTA, in
                         cooperation with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans),
                         plans to widen the 16-mile length of I-405 between I-605 and SR-73 to handle
                         forecasted vehicle volumes and to address ongoing congestion challenges.
                         Project improvements include widening the freeway to include a general
                         purpose lane and an express lane, improved overcrossings at Fairview Road
                         and Santa Ana River, and a new bridge that will connect I-405 and SR-73.
                         Several freeway ramps will be reconstructed; adjacent roads will be
                         configured to accommodate the widening; and new sound walls will be built
                         where necessary.

                         One of the keystone projects for alleviating congestion are the planned
                         improvements for SR-55/Newport Boulevard. In 2015, close to 100,000
                         vehicles passed through the terminus of the Costa Mesa Freeway at 19th
                         Street every day. OCTA has examined several alternatives of a freeway
                         extension of SR-55 to address congestion resulting from the terminus of SR-55
                         at 19th Street in Costa Mesa. Alternatives include transportation systems
                         management and traffic synchronization, construction of a single lane
                         elevated structure at 17th Street, and a cut-and-cover tunnel that would run
                         below SR-55/Newport Boulevard from 19th Street to Industrial Way. The cut-
                         and-cover strategy offers the most benefits to Costa Mesa; in addition to

Circulation Element
completely removing freeway traffic from the local road network, it would
allow the City to repurpose Newport Boulevard, including possibly using
excess right-of-way for enhancing the downtown experience by adding
landscaping and facilities that support other modes of transportation.
This General Plan assumes that the cut-and-cover approach, which the City
supports, will not occur within the year 2035 planning horizon due to the
significant costs and planning required.
Key Issues
Freeway Congestion
Interstate 405, between I-605 and SR-73, is one of the most congested
freeways in Southern California during commute hours. In addition to
particularly heavy traffic volumes, I-405 suffers from a lack of alternative
routes plus closely spaced on- and off-ramps that interfere with smoothly
flowing vehicle movements. The congestion impacts Costa Mesa by pushing
non-local trips onto City streets and hindering easy access to commercial
districts.
Traffic congestion at the terminus of SR-55 is caused by local and regional
commuters. Through trips to Newport Beach and other coastal areas use
capacity that would better serve local residents and businesses; these trips
also clog intersections that affect east-west travel within the City.
Local Traffic Conditions
Residents cite congestion on local streets as a key concern. Due to the City’s
geographic location, accessibility from freeways, proximity to Orange County
beaches, and popular attractions and destinations, many local streets
experience frequent heavy traffic loads.
Need for a Comprehensive Bicycle System
While Costa Mesa has long had several Class I bicycle paths such as the Santa
Ana River Trail, Banning Channel Trail, Victoria Street path, and the Joann
Street Bike Trail, connectivity has been limited. Gaps in the bicycle network
create challenges for cross-town travel and easy access to major activity areas
and residential neighborhoods. While Costa Mesa’s weather and terrain make
for great biking, the lack of efficient and safe bike routes and supporting bike

                                                Circulation Element
infrastructure have made it difficult for bicycling to be a good alternative
mode of travel.
Accommodating Pedestrians
Many residential neighborhoods in Costa Mesa are near shopping districts,
schools, and parks. Pedestrian access improvements including attractive
streetscape and landscape features, lighting, decorative crosswalks, enhanced
traffic signal timing, and other amenities will attract higher use of pedestrian
facilities.
Neighborhood Cut-Through Traffic
Three major freeways and several regional arterials provide access to the City
and adjacent jurisdictions. As a result, some neighborhood streets are
affected by cut-through traffic, resulting in higher than normal traffic volumes
at higher speeds. Additionally, due to limited vehicle access routes over the
Santa Ana River, a significant number of vehicles converge along Adams
Avenue and Victoria Street to get to Huntington Beach. Many neighborhood
streets in proximity to these streets are affected by cut-through traffic,
especially by vehicles attempting quicker routes via Costa Mesa streets.
Mobile technologies such as smart phone apps that alert motorists of
congested streets and suggest alternative routes through residential
neighborhoods compound the issue.

Circulation Element
Circulation Plan
Efficient movement within and through Costa Mesa and the region will be
facilitated by developing and maintaining a well-designed and integrated
multimodal transportation network for all users. Easy and convenient access
to transit, pedestrian, and bicycle options within the City are essential to an
efficient network.
Streets are the backbone of Costa Mesa’s circulation system. They lend
identity to our neighborhoods and have always served as a determining force
in the shape, form, and function of the City. Streets should be considered as
places with many functions beyond moving people and goods, such as
connecting neighborhoods, providing social spaces, and serving as statements
of civic pride.
Master Plan of Streets and Highways (MPSH)
The City of Costa Mesa MPSH defines the existing and future roadway system
in the City. One of the objectives of the MPSH is to maintain consistency with
the Orange County Master Plan of Arterial Highways (MPAH). OCTA
administers the MPAH, including the review and approval of amendments
requested by local agencies. In order for Costa Mesa to receive funding from
Orange County M2 funds for planned local road network improvements, the
City’s MPSH must be consistent with the County’s MPAH.
Roadway Classifications
Roadway classifications are designated on the MPSH as a general guideline for
arterial highway right-of-way requirements. Additional right-of-way beyond
the typical sections may be required for any classification when an arterial
highway coincides with an adopted route for an additional public facility (e.g.,
special transit facilities, bikeways, wider landscaped parkways, wider
sidewalks, or riding and hiking trails), or a scenic highway. Figure C-1 shows
typical cross-sections for the arterial roadway designations on the MPSH, and
Table C-1 lists the daily number of vehicles that can be accommodated by
each type of arterial roadway.

Major Arterial
A Major Arterial highway is a six-lane divided (raised or painted median)
roadway. A Major Arterial may be designed with emphasis for automobile,
goods movement, and/or transit. Major Arterials carry a large volume of
regional through traffic not handled by the freeway system.
Primary Arterial
A Primary Arterial highway is a four-lane divided (raised or painted median)
roadway. A Primary Arterial may be designed with emphasis for automobile,
goods movement, transit, and/or bicycle. A Primary Arterial's function is
similar to that of a Major Arterial. The principal difference between the two
classifications is capacity.
Secondary Arterial
A Secondary Arterial highway is a four-lane undivided (no median) roadway. A
Secondary Arterial may be designed with emphasis for automobile and/or
bicycle. A Secondary Arterial serves as a connector, distributing traffic
between local streets and Major and Primary Arterials. Although some
Secondary Arterials serve as through routes, most provide direct access to
surrounding land uses.
Divided Collector Arterial
A Divided Collector Arterial is a modified Secondary Arterial with a
reallocation of pavement width to emphasize bicycle and pedestrian use. It
provides one bicycle lane per direction on bicycle corridors and one through
vehicle lane per direction. The two directions of travel are divided by a
continuous two-way left-turn lane.

A Collector Arterial is a two-lane undivided (no median), unrestricted access
roadway. Collector Arterials differ from local collector streets in their ability to
handle through traffic movements between two arterials.
Roadway Plan
The Costa Mesa MPSH is shown in Figure C-2. Prior traffic studies and the
General Plan analysis evaluated a number of potential modifications that are
now either included in the MPSH or could be considered based on
coordination with OCTA. Those modifications are discussed below.
Santa Ana River Crossings
A cooperative study was carried out by the cities of Costa Mesa, Newport
Beach, Fountain Valley, and Huntington Beach and OCTA to support OCTA’s
amendment to the Orange County MPAH to downgrade the Gisler
Avenue/Garfield Avenue crossing of the Santa Ana River to a “Right-of-Way
Reserve” status and to delete the West 19th Street crossing of the Santa Ana
River from the MPAH. To maintain consistency with the amended MPAH, the
cities of Costa Mesa, Fountain Valley, and Huntington Beach have
subsequently changed the designation of the Gisler Avenue/Garfield Avenue
crossing to “Right-of-Way Reserve” status in their respective General Plan
Circulation Element roadway systems, including the Costa Mesa MPSH
presented here. The City of Huntington Beach has subsequently deleted the
West 19th Street crossing from its General Plan circulation system. With this
deletion, there is no possible connection for a vehicular bridge from Costa
Mesa towards Huntington Beach. The Costa Mesa General Plan traffic study
concluded that the future traffic demand in Costa Mesa can be adequately
served without the West 19th Street crossing. Therefore, the West 19th Street
crossing over the Santa Ana River has been deleted from the Costa Mesa
MPSH.

West 19th Street Downgrade
West 19th Street west of Placentia Avenue could be downgraded from a
Primary Arterial to a Divided Collector Arterial on the MPSH, a downgrade
that is supported by the results of the General Plan traffic study. This
roadway is designated as a Primary Arterial on the Orange County MPAH. To
maintain consistency with the MPAH, the City of Costa Mesa will initiate an
MPAH amendment process with OCTA to downgrade this roadway to a
Divided Collector Arterial.
West 17th Street Downgrade
West 17th Street west of Placentia Avenue could be downgraded from a
Secondary Arterial to a Divided Collector Arterial on the MPSH, a downgrade
that is supported by the results of the General Plan traffic study. This
roadway is designated as a Secondary Arterial on the Orange County MPAH.
To maintain consistency with the MPAH, the City of Costa Mesa will initiate an
MPAH amendment process with OCTA to downgrade this roadway to a
Divided Collector Arterial on the MPAH.
East 22nd Street Downgrade
East 22nd Street between northbound Newport Boulevard and Orange Avenue
has been downgraded from a Secondary Arterial to a Collector Arterial on the
MPSH. This downgrade is supported by earlier studies as well as the General
Plan traffic study, and the Orange County MPAH has been amended by OCTA
to incorporate this downgrade.
Baker Street Downgrade
Baker Street between Mesa Verde Drive East and Royal Palm Drive could be
downgraded from a Secondary Arterial to a Collector Arterial on the MPSH, a
downgrade that is supported by the results of the General Plan traffic study.
This roadway is designated as a Secondary Arterial on the Orange County
MPAH. To maintain consistency with the MPAH, Costa Mesa will initiate an
MPAH amendment process with OCTA to downgrade this roadway to a
Collector Arterial on the MPAH.
Bluff Road Deletion
The previous Costa Mesa MPSH included Bluff Road between Victoria Street
and West 19th Street as a Major Arterial. The General Plan traffic study
concluded that the future traffic demand in Costa Mesa can be adequately
                            Costa Mesa General Plan | C-13

served without this roadway. Therefore, Bluff Road between Victoria Street
and West 19th Street could be deleted from the MPSH. To maintain
consistency with the MPAH, Costa Mesa will initiate an MPAH amendment
process with OCTA to delete this roadway from the MPAH.
Balanced Approach to Complete Streets
The California Complete Streets Act (2008) places the planning, designing, and
building of “Complete Streets” into the larger planning framework of the
General Plan by requiring jurisdictions to plan for multimodal transportation
networks. Complete Streets are designed and operated to enable safe access
for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, the disabled, motorists, seniors,
users of public transportation, and movers of commercial goods. These
networks allow people to effectively travel to key destinations within their
community and the larger region. In addition, all transportation projects
should be evaluated as to their ability to improve safety, access, and mobility
for all travelers and to recognize pedestrian, bicycle, and transit modes as
integral elements of their transportation system.
Costa Mesa has already begun the work of reviewing the existing street
network and looking for opportunities to improve alternative modes of
transportation through the construction of bike paths, such as the Joann
Street Bicycle Trail. The goals, objectives, and policies in this element continue
the work of making enhancements to the transportation network to
accommodate all modes of mobility.
Active Transportation
“Active transportation” refers to non-motorized travel modes such as walking,
biking, or skateboarding. Because everyone uses a mode of active
transportation at some point in a trip, such as walking to a bus stop or from a
parking lot to work or school, active transportation is a critical component of a
Complete Streets network. The Active Transportation Plan—divided in this
element into a bicycle component and pedestrian component—responds to
direct comments from residents for more active transportation facilities and
increased connectivity throughout Costa Mesa and regional destinations.

Bicycle Master Plan
A transportation system that incorporates a well-designed bicycle network
results in fewer motorized vehicle trips and miles of vehicle travel (and related
pollutant emissions) while providing an option for healthful physical activity.
Costa Mesa is committed to improving the bicycle experience with
implementation of the comprehensive Bicycle Master Plan. The Conceptual
Bicycle Master Plan is shown in Figure C-3. Following a detailed analysis and
public review of the proposed facilities, a final Bicycle Master Plan will be
incorporated into the Circulation Element. New bicycle facilities and
amenities will be added to complement the established bicycle network.
Costa Mesa follows Caltrans’ standards and recognizes four classes of bicycle
facilities: Class I – Bike Paths or Bike Trails, Class II - Bike Lanes, Class III - Bike
Routes (On-Street), and Class IV - Protected Bike Lanes. Figures C-4 and C-5
illustrate typical cross sections for each bicycle classification.
Class I: Off-Street Paved Bike Paths
This class provides a pathway exclusive to bicycles and other active
transportation modes, with no motor vehicle use of the roadway. Costa Mesa
has extensive Class I bike routes within and adjacent to the City boundaries.
Examples of Class I trails include Joann Street Bicycle Trail, Harbor Boulevard
Bicycle Trail, Victoria Street Bicycle Trail, Fairview Channel Trail, Santa Ana
River Trail, Greenville-Banning Channel Bikeway, and Back Bay Trail.
Class II: On-Street Striped and Signed Bicycle Lanes
Most of the functional bicycle trips in Costa Mesa are on Class II bicycle lanes
on many of the arterial and collector streets in the City. The lanes are striped
and signed for exclusive use of bicycles and are located adjacent to curb. The
lanes use existing rights-of-way and share roadways with motor vehicles.
Class II can be found along Placentia Avenue, Newport Boulevard, Santa Ana
Avenue, Fairview Road, and South Coast Drive.
Class III: On-Street Shared-Lane Signed Bicycle Routes
Similar to Class II bicycle lanes, Class III routes are multimodal but generally
are located on low-traffic residential streets; they are identified as bikeways
through signage only. On these routes, several short-distance “Bicycle
Boulevards” are planned to connect the eastside and westside Class II bike
lanes.

Bicycle Boulevards are achieved mostly through signage, pavement markings,
landscaping, and other vehicular traffic-calming measures to optimize bicycle
travel. They never require widening of streets or removal of curb parking.
Santa Ana Avenue between 22nd Street and 21st Street is a Class III bicycle
facility.
Class IV: Protected Bike Lanes (Cycle Tracks) - On-Street and
Separated Bike Lanes
A cycle track is marked out by a separate bike lane, or multidirectional bike
lane, that protects it from other traffic—vehicular, transit, and pedestrian—by
a physical barrier such as a curb, planters, or parked cars. Cycle tracks can be
configured either for one-way travel (with a lane on each side of the street) or
for two-way travel (with each lane on one side of the street). The lane is for
exclusive use by bicycles.
Physical separation can also be vertical, with the bike lane raised above
ground (i.e., bicycle freeway). When cycle tracks are built, they tend to attract
even more bicycle riders, as they are perceived to be safer. In this manner,
cycle tracks can increase cycling as a share of the overall mode of travel and
address roadway safety by minimizing collisions between vehicles and cyclists.
No Class IV facilities are currently located in Costa Mesa.
Framework Bicycle Facilities
The Conceptual Bicycle Master Plan builds upon long-established bicycle
assets in Costa Mesa, including the Santa Ana River Bicycle Trail, Greenville-
Banning Channel Bikeway, Joann Street Bicycle Trail, and Victoria Street
Bicycle Trail.
Santa Ana River Bicycle Trail and Banning Channel Bikeway
The Santa Ana River Trail is a dedicated bike path along the banks of the Santa
Ana River. As a segment of the OC Loop, the Santa Ana River Trail provides
bicycle access to Orange County beaches, as well as to Fairview Park, Talbert
Nature Preserve, and Talbert Regional Park. A bridge over the Santa Ana River
near Fairview Park and Talbert Nature Preserve provides pedestrian and
bicycle access to both sides of the Santa Ana River Trail and the Banning
Channel Bikeway.

Circulation Element
The Greenville-Banning Channel Bikeway is located on the eastern bank of the
Santa Ana River and merges into the Santa Ana River Trail just south of Adams
Avenue.
Joann Street Bike Trail
The Joann Street Bike Trail is a Class I bike path located along the southern
edge of the Costa Mesa Golf Course and the western side of Harbor
Boulevard. The trail connects Placentia Avenue and Tanager Drive.
Victoria Street Bike Trail
The Victoria Street Bike Trail is a Class I bike path located along the northern
side of Victoria Street, between Canyon Drive and Placentia Avenue.
Bicycle Infrastructure to Increase Bicycling
This Circulation Element recognizes that a complete bicycle network must
include infrastructure improvements and amenities for bicyclists that add
comfort and convenience for commuters and recreational bicyclists.
Recommendations to implement Safe Routes to School programs, provide
bike lockers, require new developments to provide adequate bicycle parking,
and implement a bicycle sharing system will all contribute to the
infrastructure needed to complete Costa Mesa’s planned comprehensive
bicycle network.

                         Bicycle Parking Facilities
                         Safe and convenient bike parking is an essential component of a
                         comprehensive bicycle network. Bike racks are required to be provided in
                         most new development projects. However, larger bicycle parking facilities
                         should be located at schools and colleges, major activity centers and venues,
                         parks and community centers, office complexes, and major shopping centers.
                         Examples of bicycle parking facilities can include:
                                  Bike racks, lockers, and shelters. A bicycle rack is a device to which
                                   bicycles can be securely attached for parking purposes. A bike rack
                                   may be attached to the ground or some stationary object such as a
                                   building. A bicycle locker is a box in which a single bicycle can be
                                   placed and locked in. They are usually provided at places where
                                   numerous cyclists need bike parking for extended times, yet where
                                   the bikes might otherwise get damaged or stolen. Bicycle shelters
                                   typically include bike racks that are covered by a permanent structure
                                   to protect against the elements.
                                  Secure bicycle parking areas. Secure bicycle parking areas are
                                   enclosures for storing bicycles. They are commonly located in larger
   Bike racks: from the            residential complexes or at colleges. They typically include 24-hour

                                   rentals, professional bike repair, classes, and events.
                         Bicycle Boulevards
                         Bicycle boulevards are low-traffic streets that have been optimized for use by
                         cyclists. A variety of traffic-calming elements and signage are used to reduce
                         car volumes and speeds, thus fostering a safe bicycling environment. Bicycle
                         boulevards often include features that allow cyclists to travel farther without
                         stop controls or intersection treatments that allow cyclists to continue
                         through intersections, while cars are forced to turn. Bike boulevards often
                         make use of “sharrows”— shared-lane markings—that communicate the
                         presence of bicyclists to drivers.

Circulation Element
Colored Bicycle Lanes and Boxes
Bike boxes, painted at intersections, allow cyclists to move in front of the
travel lane in order to be more visible to cars and avoid turning conflicts.
Bicycle lanes are another technique to provide dedicated space in the street
for cyclists and to increase driver awareness to the presence of cyclists.
Increasingly, cities are using colored pavement treatments to designate bike
lanes, either by coloring the beginning of the lane or the entire lane.
                                                                                     Example of a painted bicycle

Bicycle Programs
Developing a healthy bicycling environment and culture is an important part
of supporting good bicycle access. Building a strong and lasting bicycling
constituency requires a multifaceted approach that provides required
infrastructure and makes cyclists feel they are part of a broad and growing
community.
Safety Campaigns
Bicycle safety campaigns and programs are critical to creating a bicycle-
friendly culture. Safe travels by bicyclists can be actively integrated into traffic
safety programs such as training law enforcement officers on bicyclists’ rights
and responsibilities, promoting efficient reporting mechanisms for behaviors
that endanger bicyclists, employing traffic safety officers to educate, and
correcting bicyclists’ traffic violations.
Celebrating Bicycling
Programs and activities can stimulate community spirit toward cycling, such as
events that celebrate those who ride or allow families to ride safely together.
Common events include organized and supported rides, where local streets

                            Walkability, access, and connections are essential components of a circulation
                            system that accommodates pedestrians. Walkability includes design features
                            such as wide sidewalks, safe street crossings, treatments that encourage
                            cautious driving, and comfortable and safe walking environments.
                            Comfortable sidewalks, well-designed pedestrian crossings, pathways, and
                            pedestrian shortcuts allow people to get from one destination point to
                            another with ease.
                            The City supports the integration of pedestrian-oriented improvements and
                            amenities within the circulation system to improve walkability. Figure C-6

Sidewalks and Sidewalk Zones
Sidewalks are not merely places for pedestrians to move about. As public
spaces, sidewalks serve as the front steps to the City, activating streets
socially and economically. Safe, accessible, and well-maintained sidewalks can
enhance general public health and create vibrant social settings. In districts
with heavy pedestrian activity—such as in the Westside, SoBECA and South
Coast Plaza/Orange County Performing Arts districts—sidewalks should have
several zones that accommodate pedestrians. The zones should include a
frontage zone, pedestrian-through zone, street furniture zone, and
enhancement/buffer zone. Figure C-7: Sidewalk Zones, provides an example.

Crosswalks and Markings
Properly designed, marked, and signed crossings improve motorist courtesy
toward pedestrians. The City supports the provision of marked crosswalks at
protected (signalized or stop-controlled) intersections if their presence
minimizes pedestrian-auto conflicts. The City has prioritized improving
intersections near schools to create pedestrian-friendly environments under
the suggested Safe Routes to School program. Figure C-6: Pedestrian
Opportunity Zones, identifies areas where the City will pursue street
enhancements to create pedestrian-friendly environments. Table C-2: Street
and Intersection for Pedestrian Safety, outlines the types of design
improvements that create safer streets and intersections for pedestrians.

HAWK – High Intensity Activated Crosswalk is a pedestrian hybrid beacon that is used at busy
crosswalks. The beacon is activated to solid red followed by flashing red when the pedestrian button
is pushed.
RRFB – Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacons are used at mid-block pedestrian crossings to increase driver
awareness of potential pedestrian conflicts. They use irregular flash patterns when activated by
pedestrians to get driver attention.
Costa Mesa has approved several projects under its Capital Improvement
Programs that invest in all neighborhoods with proven methods to enhance
pedestrian safety, including:
          Implementation of traffic-calming devices
          Illuminated crosswalks
          New landscaped parkways and medians to both address pedestrian-
           orientation and provide effective visual cue to slow traffic

Transit Services
Transit services—which includes buses, trains, commuter shuttles, paratransit,
and emerging forms of multi-passenger transport—offer a mobility alternative
for residents, employees, students, and visitors who either do not have access
to, or prefer not to use, a car. OCTA provides local bus and paratransit services
within Orange County, with several routes in Costa Mesa.
One of the primary goals of this element is to make transit use a more viable
option for both work and non-work trips. Accomplishing this goal will require
an improved transit system capable of providing faster and more frequent
trips while maintaining safe, clean, and dependable service. As OCTA and the
City continue to enhance public transit, the City will also prioritize these
activities, particularly when it comes to improvements and investments made
in street design and land uses that take into account transit transportation.
Figure C-8 identifies Transit Corridors in Costa Mesa that will receive focused
transit improvement attention. Transit Corridors feature improvements such
as enhanced signal coordination, transit amenities, bicycle accommodations,
and an improved pedestrian experience.
Limited-Stop Bus Service: Bravo!
A limited-stop bus service route is a service that stops less frequently than
local service. OCTA operates Bravo!, a limited-stop bus route (Route 543)
along Harbor Boulevard, with buses making stops every 10 to 15 minutes.
Bravo! extends from the Fullerton Transportation Center through Anaheim,
Garden Grove and Santa Ana, ending at MacArthur Boulevard at the Costa
Mesa city limit.

Paratransit
Through OCTA’s Senior Mobility Program and ACCESS, the City supports
discounted bus fares to seniors and flexible paratransit shuttles. ACCESS is
OCTA's shared-ride service for people who are unable to use the regular fixed-
route bus service because of functional limitations caused by a disability.
OCTA's Senior Mobility Program is designed to fill the gap between local fixed-
route buses and ADA paratransit by providing local transportation services to
seniors.
Improving Vehicular Travel
Traffic congestion impacts many of Costa Mesa’s roadways. This results in
driver frustration, added pollution from idling vehicles, and residents
constrained as they try to get to work, school, and other local destinations.
Costa Mesa is committed to improving local traffic conditions both to address
the harmful effects of congestion and to support of the Orange County
Congestion Management Plan (CMP) goals of:
    1. Achieving regional mobility and air quality objectives
    2. Providing a mechanism for coordinating land use and development
         decisions that support the regional economy
    3. Determining gas tax fund eligibility
In 2013, Senate Bill 743, a law that introduced Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) as
the replacement to Level of Service (LOS) as the primary metric of
C-30 | Costa Mesa General Plan

                                                Circulation Element
transportation system performance. The law requires that the new metric be
used when analyzing the impacts of a project under the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and will go into effect in 2017 when new
CEQA guidelines are adopted.
While the law specifies that VMT will be the baseline metric for future CEQA
analysis, it allows the local agencies to continue using LOS for purposes of
long-term transportation planning. Consistent with current State law, Costa
Mesa continues to use LOS as the performance metric for land use and
circulation planning, although the City supports policies that would reduce
VMTs primarily through the implementation of a transportation demand
management and the active transportation and transit strategies. Overall, the
City’s goal is to prevent the deterioration of LOS at key intersections within
the City. The City will pursue a broad array of projects that will help maintain
and improve of LOS for vehicular travel.
Concurrent with the project-specific transportation system LOS
improvements, the City will:
        Complete and annually maintain a needs assessment for traffic service
         levels and traffic safety
        Develop and annually update a priority list of improvement projects
        Regularly assess peak-hour traffic volumes at critical intersections
        Minimize circulation improvements that will necessitate the taking of
         developed private property
        Pursue programs that reduce vehicle speeds and cut-through traffic
         on local streets
        Develop a program to regularly evaluate traffic collision data
Transportation Demand Management
Transportation Demand Management, or TDM, is a general term for strategies
that promote the efficient use of transportation systems without adding
physical capacity (additional lanes or widening) on the roadway system. TDM
strategies can help address a variety of traffic problems and provide
secondary economic, social, and environmental benefits. When all are
considered, TDM strategies are often the most cost-effective way to improve
transportation. Examples of TDM include:
                              Costa Mesa General Plan | C-31

Circulation Element
        Telecommuting
        Bike/Transit Integration
        Carpool/Vanpool
        Pedestrian Facility Improvements
        Transit Improvements/Transit Pass Subsidy
        Encouraging Walking and Cycling
        Parking Management and Pricing
        Bicycle Parking/Facilities
        Alternative Work Schedules
        Flexible Work Hours
To implement these strategies and support regional air quality objectives, the
City has adopted a Transportation Demand Management Ordinance. The City
will continue to work with major employers to implement TDM strategies.
Neighborhood Traffic Management
Managing traffic in neighborhoods that are most affected by congestion and
cars traveling at unsafe speeds requires the multiple-prong approach that
Costa Mesa has practiced for many years, such as installing traffic-calming
infrastructure, reclassifying minor streets, and deploying Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS). The added strategy of implementing Complete
Streets plans will augment past and ongoing efforts to protect residential
neighborhoods from the ill effects of cut-through traffic.

Chapter 4:
Growth Managment Element
           Introduction
           In 1990, Orange County voters approved Measure M to fund regional
           transportation improvements. The initiative included a requirement for cities
           to adopt Growth Management Elements to illustrate how they would regulate
           growth consistent with Measure M plans for mobility improvements. With
           the sunset of Measure M in 2011, Measure M2 took its place, authorizing
           continuance of the program through 2041. While Measure M2 no longer
           requires cities to maintain Growth Management Elements, Costa Mesa
           provides this element to exhibit its commitment to balance physical growth
           with the ability of the local road network to support it, as well as goals on how
           to account for continual growth, both physical and economic, with minimum
           impact on existing infrastructure.
           Also, the City’s goal is to participate in on-going county-wide efforts
           addressing regional traffic issues and sensible growth.
                                        Costa Mesa General Plan | GM-1

Growth Management Element
Relationship to Other Elements
The Circulation and Land Use Elements provide most of the foundation for the
Growth Management Element. The Circulation Element establishes the City’s
goals, objectives, and policies regarding the transportation network, foremost
by using a “Complete Streets” approach to mobility planning and regional
coordination. The Land Use Element establishes the City’s goals, objectives,
and policies regarding the use of property, foremost by ensuring that
compatible, if not synergistic, relationships exist between properties that have
significant physical, visual, or proximity relationships.
The major goal of the Growth Management Element is to ensure that the
planning, management, and implementation of traffic improvements and
infrastructure meet the current and projected needs of the City. While this
goal is a high priority, it must be achieved while maintaining internal
consistency among the other elements of the General Plan, as required by
State law. Therefore, the Growth Management Element does not replace or
supersede any of the other General Plan elements; instead, the Growth
Management Element addresses, amplifies, and supports traffic level of
service and public facility standards included in the other General Plan
elements and establishes new standards, where necessary.
Related Plans and Programs
Various federal, State, regional, and Orange County plans and laws affect
growth management:

GM-2 | Costa Mesa General Plan

                                   Growth Management Element
Orange County Growth Management Element
The stated purpose of the Orange County Growth Management Element is to
ensure that planning, management, and implementation of traffic
improvements and public facilities are adequate to meet the current and
projected needs of Orange County. The plan sets forth goals, objectives,
policies, and implementation programs for growth management. The goals of
the plan are summarized as follows:
“… to reduce traffic congestion, ensure that adequate transportation facilities,
public facilities, equipment and services are provided for existing and future
residents and to protect the natural environment of Orange County.”
Of the seven major policies in the Plan (Development Phasing, Balanced
Community Development, Traffic Level of Service, Traffic Improvement
Programs, Public Facilities Plan, Transition Areas for Rural Communities, and
Buffer Zones), , the following five apply to Costa Mesa:
        Development Phasing: Development will be phased according to
         Comprehensive Phasing Plans adopted by the County. Phasing will be
         linked to roadway and public facility capacities.
        Balanced Community Development: Development will be balanced to
         encourage employment of local residents in employment and
         employee housing, in the County generally.
        Traffic Level of Service: This policy requires developers to make
         improvements to intersections significantly impacted by
         development. A Level of Service “D” must be attained at affected
         intersections. A “significant impact” is generally defined in terms of
         increases in intersection capacity utilization and levels of service. The
         policy also establishes a “deficient intersections list” and establishes a
         developer fee program to pay for improving affected intersections on
         pro-rata basis.
        Traffic Improvement Programs: The Plan provides for the
         establishment of a comprehensive traffic improvement program to
         ensure that all new development provides necessary transportation
         facilities and intersection improvements as a condition of
         development approval.
                             Costa Mesa General Plan | GM-3

Growth Management Element
        Public Facility Plans: The Plan requires comprehensive public facility
         plans for fire, sheriff/police, and library services. New development is
         required to participate on a pro-rata basis.
The Orange County Growth Management Plan further provides that additional
implementation programs may be developed as deemed necessary by the
County.
Southern California Association of Government (SCAG)
Growth Management Plan
The SCAG Growth Management Plan recommends ways to redirect the
region’s growth to minimize congestion and protect the environment. While
SCAG has no authority to mandate implementation of its Growth
Management Plan, some of the Plan’s principal goals (such as improved
jobs/housing balance) are implemented through the Air Quality Management
Plan (AQMP) under the authority of the South Coast Air Quality Management
District (SCAQMD).
Regional Transportation Plan and Sustainable Community
Strategy
The 2016-2040 Regional Transportation Plan and Sustainable Community
Strategy/(RTP/SCS) blends the primary goal of enhancing mobility for the
region’s residents and visitors with a commitment to reduce emissions from
transportation sources to comply with SB 375, improve public health, and
meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards established by the federal
Clean Air Act. This document recognizes the crucial linkages and
interrelationships between the economy, the regional transportation system,
and land use. The 2016 RTP/SCS has the following major themes: Integrating
strategies for land use and transportation, increasing capacity through
improved system management, giving people more transportation choices,
leveraging technology, responding to demographic and housing market
changes, supporting commerce and economic growth, striving for
sustainability, and protecting and preserving transportation infrastructure.
South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Air
Quality Management Plan (AQMP)
The AQMP mandates a variety of measures to reduce traffic congestion and
improve air quality. Each iteration of the plan is an update of the previous
GM-4 | Costa Mesa General Plan

                                   Growth Management Element
plan and has a 20-year horizon. The 1997 Air Quality Management Plan was
adopted by the Governing Board on November 15, 1996, and represents the
current policy for achieving clean air objectives. A 2003 Draft Air Quality
Management Plan is currently under review. The City is subject to all AQMD
requirements for local jurisdictions.
State Assembly Bill 471
Assembly Bill (AB) 471, as subsequently modified by Assembly Bill 1791,
requires every urbanized city and county with a population of 50,000 or more
to adopt a Congestion Management Plan (CMP) to reduce traffic congestion. A
city or county that does not comply with the CMP requirement will lose
gasoline sales tax revenues to which it would otherwise be entitled.
The CMP requirements include traffic level of service (LOS) standards, a trip
reduction program, and a seven-year capital improvement program for traffic
and transit. Many of the AB 471 requirements are the same as or similar to
the requirements of Measure M2 (discussed below). The County has
attempted to reconcile overlapping requirements through the Measure M2
implementation guidelines in the County-wide Growth Management Program
Revised Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Ordinance
Implementation Manual.
Measure M2 (Orange County)
Measure M2 is a renewal of Measure M, Orange County’s half-cent sales tax
for transportation improvements. Initially approved in 1990 for a 20-year
period, the renewal was approved by the voters in 2006 for another 30 years.
The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) administers Measure
M2, adopting the M2020 plan in 2011 to delineate how to meet goals such as
freeway improvements, expansion of roadway capacity, protection of
pavement conditions, traffic signal synchronization, expanding and improving
rail facilities, funding fixed-guideway connections to Metrolink, expanding
mobility choices for seniors and the disabled, stabilizing bus fares,
encouraging local community transit services, and improving streets and road
conditions.

Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32)
In response to these concerns, California Assembly Bill enacted AB 32, the
California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. The law seeks to reverse
climate change through a comprehensive program reducing Green House Gas
(GHG) emissions for virtually all sources statewide. The California Air
Resources Board (CARB) is responsible for implementation of AB32. Nine
discrete early action measures and 35 additional measures were adopted in
October 2007 and are now enforceable. The discrete early actions include a
low carbon fuel standard, landfill methane capture regulations, reductions in
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) from mobile air conditioning systems, fluorinated
gas emissions from semiconductor manufacturing, sulfur hexafluoride from
some industrial processes, high Global Warming Potential (GWP) gases in
consumer products and emissions from diesel auxiliary engines on ships at
California Ports, improved fuel efficiency in heavy-duty diesel vehicles, and
new tire pressure regulations. The early action programs form part of
California’s comprehensive strategy for achieving the GHG reduction targets.
AB 32 requires CARB to develop regulations and market mechanisms to
achieve technologically feasible and cost-effective measures that will reduce
emissions to 1990 levels by 2020—a 25 percent reduction statewide. In 2008,
CARB approved a comprehensive “Scoping Plan” which is to be updated every
five years. The first update was approved in 2014.

                                 Growth Management Element
Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of
2008 (SB 375)
Senate Bill (SB) 375, the Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act
of 2008, provides key support to achieve the goals of AB 32. SB 375 is
intended to encourage regional planning that integrates land use and
transportation policy in a way that reduces GHG emissions from passenger
vehicles. This legislation endeavors to control the emissions by curbing sprawl
(the unplanned, uncontrolled spread of urban development). The legislation
encourages compact development patterns that reduce the need to drive,
thereby reducing air pollution from car exhaust, conserving water, and
protecting habitat, among other benefits. To achieve these goals, this law is
designed to align regional land use, housing, and transportation plans with
greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2020 and 2035.
SB 375 tasks CARB to set greenhouse gas reduction targets for each of
California’s 18 regional Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs). Each
MPO is required to prepare a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) as part
of their Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). In August 2010, CARB released
the proposed GHG reduction targets for the MPOs to be adopted in
September 2010. The proposed reduction targets for the SCAG region were
eight percent by year 2020 and 13 percent by year 2035.
Complete Streets Act of 2008
In 2008, the State of California passed a law requiring that, as of January 1,
2011, any substantive revision of the circulation element of the General Plan,
undertaken by any county or city, include a plan for a balanced, multimodal
transportation network that meets the needs of and provides safe access for
all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, transit vehicles, truckers, and
motorists. Each complete street can look different, according to its context,
community preference, the types of road users, and their needs.

Growth Management Element
 Key Issues
 With Costa Mesa essentially in a built-out condition, the City’s objective is
 to continue to balance land use changes with infrastructure capacity. A
 significant portion of transportation problems in Orange County stem from
 the inability of the freeway system to service peak-period travel demands.
 Given the City’s location amid a network of freeway interchanges—and
 most significantly, the termination of SR-55 at 19th Street—residents of
 Costa Mesa feel the effects of regional vehicular traffic on a daily basis.
 While arterial highways such as Harbor and Newport Boulevard are
 intended to handle the majority of intra-regional traffic and complement
 the freeway system, residents expect that they should be able to move
 easily about their city during most times of day. In addition to vehicular
 traffic, Costa Mesa needs to improve alternative modes of transportation
 such as transit and bikeways.
 With this key concern in mind, priority will be placed on:
          Maintaining and enforcing standards (e.g., level of service, trip
           budgets) to ensure that the necessary transportation infrastructure
           is adequately provided
          Appropriately phasing transportation infrastructure enhancements
           with the timing of new development
          Ensuring that transportation infrastructure is adequately funded
          Monitoring and evaluating the progress of population,
           employment, and development to ensure that adequate
           development patterns occur within the timing of the General Plan
GM-8 | Costa Mesa General Plan

                                   Growth Management Element
Creating Synergy Between Land
Use and Circulation
Given that less than two percent of developable land in Costa Mesa is vacant,
the predominant issue when dealing with future growth is not quantity but
quality and tactical placement of development and uses within the City.
Future growth must be directed by the strategic placement of development or
land uses to minimize the impact of growth on our circulation system. This
includes but is not limited to approving development projects and uses that
create a synergistic relationship with the neighboring developments and uses
so that additional demand on the circulation system is reduced. Development
decisions need to look for a balance of uses within the individual
neighborhood communities of Costa Mesa to minimize length of trips
traveled, or cluster complementary uses to condense multiple trips into one.
Future development and uses must be connected and provide easy access to
multiple modes of transportation and/or off-set hours of neighboring uses to
maximize the efficiency of land used for parking spaces.
Development Phasing and
Performance Monitoring Program
The City has prepared a development phasing and performance monitoring
program based on Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA)
timetables. This program establishes a system for periodic evaluation of
compliance with newly approved development phasing allocations. Under this
program, roadway and other transportation facility improvements or funding
must actually be provided in order for new development to continue. The
program provides a periodic evaluation of the maintenance of transportation
service levels. Periodic traffic reports prepared under this program will
continue to utilize data collected within three months of preparation of the
report. In the event that the program identifies one or more service level
deficiencies, measures will be implemented to correct identified deficiencies.

                    This allows the City to anticipate the impacts of large
                    projects prior to development of any portion and permits
                    more time to plan for public services and facilities needed
                    to support the project.

Policy GM-2.2:   Coordinate with State, county, and local agencies for
                 planning and construction of public utilities to minimize
                 negative impacts on the circulation system.
Policy GM-2.3:   Use the Development Phasing and Performance
                 Monitoring Program to assess the impact of existing and
                 new development on the circulation system.
Policy GM-2.4:   Support uses and development which create synergistic
                 relationships with neighboring uses and development,
                 especially those whose addition does not create mutually
                 exclusive additional vehicular trips but adds to the value
                 of the destination by any potential visitor.
Policy GM-2.5:   Support creative and flexible solutions that provide for
                 additional economic or physical growth within the City
                 but does not place greater impact on the circulation
                 system. These would include shared parking agreements,
                 offset hours of operation, and clustering of harmonious

Chapter 6:
Conservation Element
           Introduction
           Costa Mesa residents benefit from the City’s favorable location, with cool ocean
           breezes and coastal bluffs that provide a diversity of natural habitats. Costa
           Mesa’s natural resources include the Santa Ana River, which provides flood
           control and open space connectivity, and Fairview Park and Talbert Regional
           Park, which support wildlife diversity.
           Purpose
           The purpose of the Conservation Element is to preserve, protect, and replenish
           the limited natural resources in the City, including water, open space, and
           sensitive habitats. In addition, this element addresses the management of energy
           resources and opportunities to integrate sustainability considerations into City
           policies. This element establishes a policy framework that:
                                         Costa Mesa General Plan | CON-1

Conservation Element
        Identifies areas in Costa Mesa with substantial natural resources that
         the City is committed to manage and prevent from waste, destruction,
         and neglect
        Provides for programs aimed at resource conservation for the benefit of
         future generations
The Conservation Element meets the requirements of State law, which declares
that Conservation Elements must address the protection and maintenance of
California’s natural resources. In Costa Mesa, natural resources of concern are:
        Air quality
        Biological resources
        Energy
        Water resources
        Wastewater
        Water quality
        Water management
Baseline Conditions-2015
The City has actively pursued improving natural conditions through conservation
and protection programs since the early 2000s. Substantial progress has been
made both to educate the community and achieve measurable results. To
provide a baseline to gauge future progress, this section provides a snapshot of
environmental conditions in 2015.
Coastal Wildlife Habitat Areas
Santa Ana River Parks and Riparian Areas
The Santa Ana River and riparian areas are important to local wildlife, not only
for the habitat they provide but for the open space connectivity they create
between isolated areas where animals live and forage, as well as for migration
corridors. Riparian areas, such as the Fairview Park wetlands and riparian habitat
area, play an important role in the ecosystem by sorting and filtering sediment,
recharging groundwater aquifers, and reducing flood potential. For residents,
these systems provide valuable connections to natural areas and create
opportunities for recreation, education, and awareness. One such area is a
portion of the Santa Ana River lowlands that has been preserved as a multi-use

                                   regional park, Talbert Regional Park/Nature Preserve, which is owned and
                                   maintained by the County of Orange. Public recreation amenities at the park
                                   include hiking and running trails, and bird-watching areas. In addition, sensitive
                                   wetlands and paleontological resources within the park provide opportunities for
                                   education.
                                   Fairview Park
                                   The City’s Fairview Park lies immediately adjacent to Talbert Regional Park and is
                                   linked with the Santa Ana River system of trails and parks. Fairview Park includes
                                   open space consisting of bluffs, vernal pools, trails, native plant communities,
                                   and wildlife. Within the park, the City has pursued riparian habitat restoration
                                   through a system of wetland ponds and streams with riparian and coastal plants,
                                   native habitat plantings, and an irrigation system. The creation of wetlands and
                                   riparian habitat provides many benefits. Dry weather urban runoff and
                                   stormwater are diverted from flood control to the wetlands, where plants and
                                   ultraviolet rays naturally remove impurities, thus reducing the amount of
                                   pollutants from reaching the ocean or having to be otherwise treated. The
                                   restored wetlands create a wildlife recreational area in an urban setting, where
                                   local residents and visitors can observe wildlife and learn about the broader
                                   ecosystem. Fairview Park is part of the larger natural open space/habitat
                                   preservation system immediately adjacent to the Orange County Central/Coastal
                                   Subregional Natural Communities Conservation Plan and Habitat Conservation

  Fairview Park Wetlands and
      Riparian Habitat Project
      includes nearly 23 acres of
     native riparian habitat and
 wetland ponds within the north
   section of Fairview Park. The
 project also educates the public
 on the benefits of wetlands and
their contribution to the ecology
              of the coastal area.
                                   Within the upper mesa of Fairview Park are several vernal pools, which are
                                   seasonal pools of water that provide habitat for distinctive plants and animals.
                                   Vernal pools are considered dynamic micro-ecosystems. They are considered to

be a distinctive type of wetland usually devoid of fish, and thus allow the safe
development of natal amphibian, such as the San Diego fairy shrimp
(Branchinecta sandiegonensis) and insect species. Vernal pools are protected by
State and federal laws.
Talbert Regional Park/Nature Preserve
Talbert Regional Park encompasses approximately 180 acres on Victoria Street
between Pacific Avenue and the Santa Ana River, see Figure CON-1: Biological
Resources. Within this compact area, the park supports six distinct introduced
and native plant zones that respond to changing conditions along the river. The
introduced zones are intended to accommodate more active human use and
provide a visual screen. Native zones include the "Coastal Strand," which consists
of gentle slopes and dunes, a habitat now largely absent due to urbanization. The
"Native Grassland" zone is the largest zone in the park and provides wildlife
habitat. The "Alluvial Woodland" zone contains a wide variety of plant and
animal life and is the most secluded area in the park. Finally, the "Wetland Zone"
consists of the southern 14.8 acres of the park and contains elements of riparian
woodland and mulefat scrub.
Talbert Regional Park/Nature Preserve has been identified as an area providing
important biodiversity habitat and is part of the open space and natural habitat
reserve system of the Orange County Central/Coastal NCCP/HCP. The 37,000-
acre reserve system permanently protects a broad range of plant and animal
populations that are within the Central and Coastal Subregion. The Nature
Reserve of Orange County, a nonprofit corporation, manages the Orange County
Central/Coastal NCCP/HCP and coordinates land management activities,
conducts wildlife and habitat research and monitoring, and restores disturbed
habitats within the reserve system.
Orange Coast River Park, Inc.
The Orange Coast River Park, Inc., a nonprofit committee founded by the Friends
of Harbors, Beaches & Parks, manages projects across multiple boundaries to
help coordinate a mosaic of more than 1,000 acres of open space along the Santa
Ana River, including the Talbert Nature Preserve and Fairview Park. The
organization’s mission is to realize a master plan of parks and open space that
meets the diverse needs of the urban population and provides seamless
passageways from inland to the coast while also allowing for conservation and
preservation of valuable habitats.

Coastal Plants and Wildlife
Prior to development of Costa Mesa, the natural landscape consisted of native
grasses, sage scrub, and riparian plant life. Examples of these habitats are extant
in the City, primarily within Talbert and Fairview Parks (Figure CON-1, Biological
Resources). The grasslands generally can be found at lower elevations that have a
deep layer of clay-bearing soil. Sage scrub communities occur at elevations lower
than 3,000 feet on foothills and coastal bluffs, and in canyons. Riparian
vegetation is found around springs, streams, seeps, and ponds.
The remaining natural habitats support diverse plant species, including several
sensitive species listed as threatened or endangered according to federal and
State criteria. Whether or not specific species are present in particular habitats is
determined through site-focused studies. However, sensitive or protected
species of concern within the planning area may include:
             San Diego button-celery (Eryngium aristulatum var. parishii)
             Big-leaved crownbeard (Verbesina dissita)
             Gambel's water cress (Nasturtium gambelii)
             Ventura Marsh milk-vetch (Astragalus pycnostachyus var.
              lanosissimus)
             Salt marsh bird's-beak (Chloropyron maritimum ssp. Maritimum)
             California Orcutt grass (Orcuttia californica)
             Santa Ana River woollystar (Eriastrum densifolium ssp. Sanctorum)1

Conservation Element
In prehistoric times, wildlife roaming Orange County included bison, jaguars,
camels, wolves, ground sloths, bears, saber-tooth cats, and shrews. Today,
wildlife is much smaller and less threatening, with species consisting of those
that have adapted to close human contact, such as squirrels, voles, white-tail
kites, red-tail hawks, and coyotes. Some species of special interest that inhabit
open spaces within the City include the burrowing owl (Speotyto cuniculara), an
indigenous species that uses abandoned rodent burrows for nests; the San Diego
fairy shrimp (Branchinecta sandiegonensis) which occupies vernal pools in
Fairview Park; the Belding’s savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis
beldingi) which resides year-round in coastal salt marshes of Southern California,
and the Least Bell’s vireo (Vireo bellii pusillus) which inhabits riparian and
terrestrial fields, shrubland, chaparral, and woodlands.
Coastal Zone Management
California’s coastal zone generally extends 1,000 yards inland from the mean high
tide line. In significant coastal estuarine habitat and recreational areas, the zone
extends inland to the first major ridgeline or five miles from the mean high tide
line, whichever is less. Subsequent to the City’s 1979 request to remove 13 acres,
the coastal zone in Costa Mesa encompasses the Santa Ana River lowlands and
Talbert Regional Park south of Victoria Street, approximately 76 percent of
Canyon Park, and 0.23 acres of Tract 12067 (see Figure CON-2: Coastal Zones).
Santa Ana River Lowlands
The coastal zone encompasses the central segment of the Santa Ana River
lowlands, which extends inland from the coastline to the northern boundary of
Fairview Park in Costa Mesa and includes the City of Newport Beach and the
County of Orange. Costa Mesa's Local Coastal Plan (LCP) is coordinated with both
jurisdictions for the lowland properties to the south and with the City of
Huntington Beach due to the close proximity and the interrelationship of coastal
issues. All of the river lowlands between Pacific Coast Highway and Fairview
Regional Park are included in the Santa Ana River/Santiago Creek Greenbelt
Corridor. The Greenbelt Implementation Plan designates this area as a Water-
Related Recreation and Conservation Area. Although the implementation plan
does not propose a specific use for these properties, it does require recreational
use to be compatible with the overall greenbelt and provide access to the river
trails network.

Parks and Open Space within the Coastal Zone
As described above, the County of Orange operates Talbert Regional Park;
approximately 97 acres lie within the coastal zone. The land use designation for
the park is Open Space Reserve (OSR). The OSR designation applies to lands of
scenic and natural attraction and areas of ecological, cultural, historical, and
recreational significance permanently preserved as and restricted to open space
and compatible uses.
Canyon Park is City-owned and designated Public/Institutional. This designation
applies to publicly and privately owned lands that provide recreation, open
space, health and educational opportunities, and uses that provide a service to
the public. Approximately 27 acres of the 36-acre Canyon Park are within the
coastal zone.
                                                                                 Talbert Regional Park

Tract 12067
The coastal zone also encompasses the northerly 0.23 acres of a 2.3-acre
privately owned residential condominium development built in 1986 (known as
Tract 12067). The property is zoned PDR-LD and designated Low Density
Residential.
Local Coastal Program (LCP)
The California Coastal Act of 1976 is the permanent enacting law approved by
the State legislature. The Coastal Act establishes policies, boundary lines, and
permitting procedures. Further, it provides for the transfer of permitting
authority, with certain limitations reserved for the State, to local governments
through adoption and certification of Local Coastal Programs (LCP) by the Coastal
Commission. All local governments in the coastal zone must prepare LCPs.
Development in the coastal zone must be evaluated through a permit review
process for consistency with the LCPs where they are certified, or the Coastal Act
where the Commission retains permitting jurisdiction. This portion of the General
Plan fulfills the City’s responsibilities to address and protect its coastal resources
and integrates the necessary coastal policies and programs. Chapter 3 of the
Coastal Act contains policies regarding future development in the coastal zone
that must be addressed in the LCP process.
Key Coastal Wildlife Habitat Area Issues
Loss of Coastal Habitat to Support Wildlife
The City commits to preserving and protecting, to the greatest extent possible,
open space areas devoted to the preservation of natural resources, sensitive
habitat and wildlife species, managed production of resources, outdoor
recreation, and open space buffer areas for public health and safety. There are
no plans to convert any of the open spaces identified in the General Plan.
Protection of Sensitive Species
Sensitive habitat areas, such as the vernal pools and wetland areas at Fairview
Park, are threatened by human impact, household pets, storm runoff, pollution
and trash, and herbicides and pesticides. The limited natural habitat areas in
Costa Mesa are critical, as they are home to sensitive plant and wildlife species.

Environmental Sustainability
Energy Resources
Southern California Edison is the primary supplier of electricity in Costa Mesa,
and the Southern California Gas Company supplies natural gas.
Land Use and Transportation Planning
A reduction in automobile usage and vehicle miles traveled will lower energy
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, thus producing further public health
benefits. Costa Mesa has adopted land use and transportation policies and
practices that recognize the importance of coordinating land use, housing,
economic development, and transportation planning. Refer to both Chapters 2
(Land Use Element) and 3 (Circulation Element).
Energy Efficiency
California residents and institutions have many years of experience practicing
energy efficiency. While national per capita energy consumption has increased
50 percent over the past 30 years, per capita consumption in California has
remained the same over this period. This is due to many factors, including
efficiency and conservation campaigns conducted by private citizens, businesses,
and utility companies, and regulations adopted by State and local governments.
Because the City of Costa Mesa does not operate any local energy-related utility,
it does not directly influence local energy use practices (other than leading by
example). However, the City is a committed partner to energy providers,
supports local small energy systems such as solar and wind, and promulgates
sustainable practices through local regulations.
Renewable Energy Resources
Renewable energy sources capture energy from natural processes such as
sunlight, wind, flowing water, biological processes, and geothermal heat flows.
Renewable energy resources may be used directly or used to create other, more
convenient forms of energy. Examples of direct use include passive solar design
for heating. Examples of indirect use are electricity generation through
photovoltaic cells (solar panels) and wind turbines, or the production of fuels
such as ethanol from biomass. To encourage the use of renewable energy
sources, the City initiated the “Go Green Program,” which waives the permit fees
for residential solar installations and electric vehicle charging stations.

Conservation Element
Green and Sustainable Building Practices
In 2007, the City of Costa Mesa implemented a voluntary “green building”
program that expedited the permitting process and waived certain fees for LEED2
certification, and became the first city in California to require that all new
municipal construction be LEED Gold certified. Additionally, green building
standards are encouraged with project applications. “Green building” is a design
approach that focuses on minimizing a building’s negative impacts on both the
environment and building occupants. Green buildings provide many tangible
benefits, including improved worker productivity, recruitment, and retention;
minimized energy and water costs during both construction and operations;
waste minimization; and pollution prevention. This integrated, interdisciplinary
approach to design and construction promotes investments in resource-efficient
materials, technology, and the use of low-emitting and recycled content
materials. Green building practices include the following:
        Healthy buildings and sustainable building design aim to create
         buildings that are not harmful to occupants or the environment and help
         improve employee productivity. An important emphasis is on indoor
         environmental quality, especially indoor air quality.
        Low-impact materials are used, such as non-toxic, sustainably produced,
         and recycled building and construction materials that require little
         energy to process.
        Quality and durability are valued, leading to longer-lasting and better-
         functioning products that require less-frequent replacement, thus
         reducing the impacts of producing replacements.
        A life-cycle assessment approach is used by building operators when
         making design and purchasing decisions.
        Local, regional, or sustainably managed renewable sources are used
         and, whenever possible, composted at the end of their useful lives.
Green Building Strategy
In 1978, California established the Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and
Nonresidential Buildings (Title 24, Part 6 of the California Code of Regulations) in
response to a legislative mandate to reduce California's energy consumption. The
2
  LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is a building certification
program run under the auspices of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). LEED
concentrates its efforts on improving performance across five key areas of environmental
and human health: energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality, materials selection,
sustainable site development and water savings.

                                                Conservation Element
State updates these standards approximately every three years to allow
consideration and possible incorporation of new energy efficiency technologies
and methods. For example, the 2013 energy standards were projected to save 25
percent more energy relative to the 2008 Building Energy Efficiency Standards.
The standards apply to newly constructed buildings, as well as additions and
alterations for existing buildings. All standards in Title 24, Part 6 must be
followed as part of the City’s building permit process. The City encourages
applying green building standards beyond what is required in Title 24 for all new
development projects.
Waste Management and Recycling
Residential trash and recycling collection services are designated functions of the
Costa Mesa Sanitary District. The Costa Mesa Sanitary District has developed
innovative programs and processes to reduce the waste stream heading to
landfills. One example is the Organics Recycling Program, which allows residents
to deposit yard and kitchen waste into the organics cart, where these materials
will be transported to an anaerobic digestion facility and converted into
fertilizers and natural gas. Other recycling programs include the Large Item
Collection Program; Electronic and Universal Waste; Sharps Disposal Recycling
Program; and Residential Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG) Recycling Program. The
Costa Mesa Sanitary District continues to pursue innovative reduction, reuse, and
recycling strategies that allow Costa Mesa residents to make responsible choices
in disposal of waste products, but to also protect the environment. The Costa
Mesa Sanitary District and the City of Costa Mesa also continue to collaborate in
providing quality services to their customers and residents.
Key Environmental Sustainability Issues
Energy Consumption
In addition to promoting sustainable practices, reduced energy consumption and
associated lower costs benefit local residents and businesses. As energy demand
grows over time and nonrenewable energy resources become more limited,
more aggressive conservation measures and increased use of innovative new
technologies will be of greater necessity.

Conservation Element
Encouraging More Green Building Practices
Builders are sometimes reluctant to integrate green building strategies within
their project, mostly due to upfront costs associated with the design and
technologies. “Green” is often viewed as an add-on to current building practices.
However, what builders do not often consider is what can be changed, modified,
improved, or eliminated from the typical building practices and replaced with
better, proven technologies and practices, typically resulting in lower overall cost
of construction, as well as savings in long-term operation and maintenance costs.
Recycling and Waste Management
Convenient landfill space will diminish in Southern California, and costs to haul
waste greater distances for disposal will drive efforts for increased waste
reduction, reuse, recycling, and composting. The City should continue efforts to
expand recycling and source reduction programs to minimize the volume of trash
entering landfills, conserve resources, and protect the environment from the
negative impacts associated with landfills such as contaminating the
groundwater and aquifers, contaminating the soil, and producing methane.
Water Resources
Water Supply
Domestic water service to Costa Mesa residents and businesses is provided by
two agencies: Mesa Water District (MWD) and Irvine Ranch Water District
(IRWD). MWD service area encompasses approximately 18 square miles,
covering most of Costa Mesa, part of Newport Beach, and John Wayne Airport,
(see Figure CON-4, Water Districts). IRWD has an approximate 181-square-mile
service area and includes a portion of properties in Costa Mesa located southeast
of Newport Boulevard (between 23rd Street and Bristol Street), as well as all of
the city of Irvine and portions of Tustin, Santa Ana, Orange, Lake Forest, Newport
Beach, and unincorporated areas in Orange County.

Costa Mesa General Plan | CON-19
Conservation Element
Natural water supplies in Orange County are limited to groundwater, surface
flows in the Santa Ana River (which originate in the San Bernardino Mountains),
and local precipitation. Since the demand for water generally exceeds the rate of
replenishment of these natural water sources, the majority of communities in
Orange County are dependent upon water imported from sources outside
Orange County. The two primary sources for imported water are the Colorado
River Aqueduct and the State Water Project. The Colorado River Aqueduct
transports water from Lake Havasu (in Nevada) to Lake Mathews (in Riverside
County), and then to points in Orange County. The State Water Project carries
water from the Upper Feather River in Northern California to Lake Castaic (in Los
Angeles County). From Lake Castaic, water is transported and distributed to
customers in Orange County.
In Costa Mesa, groundwater collects in underground aquifers that are
approximately 2,500 feet beneath the ground surface. MWD owns and operates
eight groundwater production wells that pump water from the Orange County
Groundwater Basin, which underlies north-central Orange County from Irvine to
the Los Angeles County border and from Yorba Linda to the Pacific Ocean (see
Figure CON-5, Groundwater Basins). This groundwater basin is managed by the
Orange County Water District (OCWD) and is replenished in three ways: 1) by
water from the Santa Ana River, 2) from imported water from Metropolitan
Water District of Southern California (Metropolitan) through the Municipal
Water District of Orange County (MWDOC), and 3) via a groundwater
replenishment program that injects purified sewer water into two of OCWD’s
recharge basins in the City of Anaheim. The eight wells have a total design
capacity of approximately 14,000 gallons per minute (as of 2015). However, since
Costa Mesa depends upon imported water for a portion of its water supply, the
potential impacts of water supply and demand extend beyond the boundaries of
the City and its two serving agencies. The availability of imported water is directly
related to the water supply conditions in the source watersheds, as well as
demand for water throughout the State. Recurring dry years can also significantly
affect Southern California's water allotment.

Mesa Water District
In 1986, MWD introduced a Master Plan designed to meet the long-term growing
needs of its customers. The plan defined ways to improve water delivery
systems, create additional local storage facilities, drought-proof the service area,
and develop new sources of water. One of MWD’s primary focuses is to decrease
dependence on high cost imported water by upgrading the Mesa Water
Reliability water treatment facility’s filtration treatment technology and expand
the water filtration capacity. Subsequent to completion of the Mesa Water
Reliability Facility Improvement Project, MWD’s water supply mix is comprised of
94 percent groundwater and six percent recycled water, with no imported water
needed.
Irvine Ranch Water District
IRWD prepares two planning documents to guide water supply decision-making:
The Water Resources Master Plan (WRMP) and the Urban Water Management
Plan (UWMP). The WRMP is a comprehensive document that IRWD uses for its
planning needs. The UWMP is based on the WRMP; it examines historic and
current water use projections and compares water supplies with demands over
the next 20 years. These plans identify the imported and local water supplies that
will meet future demand—including groundwater recovery and water recycling—
as well as IRWD's planned conservation measures to ensure a reliable supply of
high-quality water.
For many years, IRWD received almost all of its water from imported sources. To
alleviate the dependency on costly imported water, in the late 1970s IRWD
began building a network of groundwater wells. Today, approximately 50 percent
of IRWD water supply comes from groundwater wells located within the Orange
County Groundwater Basin. IRWD meets approximately 23 percent of its total
demands with recycled water and the remaining 27 percent with potable water
imported through MWD.
To further reduce reliance upon imported water and ultimately increase supply
reliability and water quality, IRWD has creatively partnered with the Rosedale-
Rio Bravo Water Storage District to construct 502 acres of groundwater recharge
ponds in Kern County. This arrangement allows available surface water to
percolate into distant groundwater basins for later use during dry periods to
offset potential reductions in supply from its normal sources. IRWD's partnership

with Rosedale provides long-term equity ownership of water banking capacity of
up to 50,000 acre-feet of water.
Water Resources Master Plan
Per the California Urban Water Management Planning Act of 1983, all urban
water suppliers must prepare an updated UWMP every five years for review by
the California Department of Water Resources. The purpose of UWMPs is to
ensure that urban water suppliers have adequate water supplies for existing and
future demands. Plans must identify and discuss various factors affecting current
and projected water supplies and demand, and must identify steps to ensure the
availability and reliability of future supplies. Furthermore, effective 2010,
UWMPs were required to incorporate the Water Conservation Act of 2009 (SBx7-
7), which established even stricter reduction targets. With the continued drought
years during the 2000s, additional reduction targets were mandated by Executive
Order B-29-15 in 2015.
As retail water suppliers, MWD and IRWD have the option of complying with
SBx7-7 individually or through participation in a Regional Alliance. Both districts
have chosen to participate in a Regional Alliance with the Metropolitan Water
District of Orange County (MWDOC). In the event that the region does not
comply with the regional target, an agency may still be in compliance if it meets
its own individual target.
Water Conservation
The importance of water conservation has been highlighted during several
periods of extended drought in California. In response, MWD and IRWD have
adopted water conservation policies, as has the City of Costa Mesa, which
require new development projects to incorporate water conservation measures.
The water agencies and the City continually evaluate policies and programs to
maximize water savings and integrate the latest water efficient technologies and
practices in their policies. The City, in cooperation with MWD and IRWD,
educates homeowners and business owners of the importance of installing
water-conserving fixtures and appliances, repairing leaking fixtures, planting
drought-tolerant landscaping, and avoiding unnecessary water use. In addition,
the City enforces its Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance consistent with the
State requirements to maximize use of drought tolerant plants, improve
irrigation efficiency, and minimize use of turf.

Water Quality and Urban and Stormwater Runoff
The quality of water in our natural and domestic water systems affects the health of
wildlife, habitat, and people. Most water pollution comes from untreated storm
flows and urban runoff that runs across streets, yards, and parking lots before
draining into creeks, marshes, and the ocean. This untreated water can contain a
variety of pollutants harmful to the environment, including heavy metals, excessive
sediment, petroleum hydrocarbons, domestic sewage, pesticides, and trash. Urban
runoff is the result of human-caused activities, such as the overwatering of lawns or
the washing of vehicles in driveways. Stormwater runoff refers to water generated
during storm events, particularly with an initial rain event as water pollution entering
storm drains in areas with high proportions of impervious surfaces is typically more
concentrated of toxic materials compared to the remainder of the storm.
    Federal, State, and local regulations set standards to protect water quality. In
    particular, the State Regional Water Quality Control Board mandates control of
    urban runoff to reduce the percolation of pollutants from surface runoff into
    groundwater supplies. At the local level, Costa Mesa implements regulations
    consistent with federal and State requirements, most notably through the
    National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program.
                                                                         Bioswales were included in the

    Wastewater/Recycled Water
    Recycled water has become an important resource for Costa Mesa and will
    become increasingly important as other sources of water become less reliable
    and more costly. Recycled water is wastewater (sewage) that has been treated to
    remove solids and certain impurities, and is available for non-potable water uses.
    The use of recycled water extends potable water supplies, reduces the need for
    CON-24 | Costa Mesa General Plan
                                               Conservation Element
additional potable water facilities, reduces the amount of treated wastewater
discharged into the ocean, reduces reliance on costly imported water supplies,
and increases Costa Mesa’s water supply reliability. The Orange County
Sanitation District (OCSD) processes over 200 million gallons of collected
wastewater daily at treatment plants in Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach.
As described above, millions of gallons of treated effluent are injected into the
groundwater basins or are used for irrigation, and actually results in improved
basin water quality due to the high treatment standards required of the recycled
water.
Key Water Resources Issues
Water Supply and Reoccurring Droughts
Water is an essential resource. A stable and reliable water supply must be
identified if the community desires growth. With drought conditions ever present
in California, even during relatively wet periods, the City recognizes that
conservation measures and education put in place today will have long-lasting
effects. In 2010, the City adopted the State-mandated Model Water Efficient
Landscaping Ordinance. As a response to the ongoing drought, the State revised
the Model Water Efficient Landscaping Ordinance with Costa Mesa adopting the
revised ordinance in 2016. Working with MWD and IRWD, the City must
continually advance programs and measures that promote wise water use and
ensure continued recharge of local groundwater basins.
Water Quality and Storm Runoff
Urban runoff from streets, sidewalks, parking lots, and roofs washes urban-based
pollutants into the watershed system and into the Santa Ana River, Upper
Newport Bay, and ultimately to the Pacific Ocean. Consistent with federal and
State law, Costa Mesa must take local actions to protect the quality of the
regional water supply.
Atmosphere and Climate
Air Quality
Costa Mesa is located in the South Coast Air Basin, which is an approximately
6,600-square mile area bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west; the San
Gabriel, San Bernardino, and San Jacinto Mountains to the north and east; and
                            Costa Mesa General Plan | CON-25

Conservation Element
the San Diego County line to the south. The Basin includes all of Orange County
and the non-desert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino
Counties. Basin air quality is influenced by stationary (point source), area-wide,
and mobile sources that generate pollutants which contribute to the formation
of smog and other poor air quality conditions. Point sources are emission sources
located at a single location, while area-wide sources are many smaller point
sources that are widely distributed. Examples of point and area-wide sources
include manufacturing plants, lawnmowers, fireplaces, and painting operations.
Mobile sources, as their name implies, are not stationary: they are motor
vehicles, trains, and aircrafts.
The climate within the Basin varies considerably from the coastal zone to the
inland valleys, mountain areas, and deserts. Most of the Basin is relatively arid,
with very little rainfall and abundant sunshine during the summer months.
Factors such as wind, sunlight, and temperature all affect the accumulation
and/or dispersion of pollutants throughout the Basin. The extent and severity of
the air pollution problem is a function of the area's natural physical
characteristics and as well as human-caused influences, e.g., development
patterns and lifestyle.
Wind
One of the most important factors affecting climate in the Basin is the direction
and intensity of the prevailing winds. The Basin has a limited capability to
disperse air contaminants due to light average wind speeds. Winds generally
blow from the coast inland, where temperature inversions (and the mountains)
trap pollutants. As a result, the movement or stagnation of air during the
morning and evening hours determines the pollution level on any given day.
Costa Mesa’s coastal location provides for relatively good air quality due to wind
patterns. However, the highest pollution levels in Costa Mesa are often
associated with Santa Ana wind conditions that reverse the dominant wind
patterns.

Sunlight
The presence and intensity of sunlight is another important factor that results in
the formation of smog in the Basin. Due to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight,
primary pollutants (mainly reactive hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen) react to
form secondary pollutants (e.g., oxidants). Since this process is time-dependent,
secondary pollutants can be formed many miles downwind from the emission
sources. As a result of the prevailing daytime winds and time-delayed nature of
smog, oxidant concentrations are highest in the inland areas of Southern
California. However, smog can settle in the City on days with early morning
easterly winds.
Temperature Inversions
Temperature inversion is a reversal in the decrease of temperature as altitude
increases. In most parts of the United States, air near ground level is warmer
than the air above it. However, Southern California's daily summertime sunshine
and high barometric pressure reverse that pattern, creating warmer air at higher
elevations. As a result, temperature inversion traps pollutants by preventing
cooler air from rising to the upper atmosphere. Although temperature inversion
can occur throughout the year, the summer months of July, August, and
September generally account for higher occurrences of this phenomenon.

Conservation Element
Ambient Air Quality Standards
Ambient air quality standards are the levels of air pollutant concentration
considered “safe” with regard to public health and welfare. The federal Clean Air
Act (CAA) establishes the framework for regulating national air quality standards
and the means to achieve them. The United States Environmental Protection
Agency (U.S. EPA) is responsible for enforcing the Federal CAA and for
establishing the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). California has
adopted more stringent regulations under the California CAA, which are
administered by the California Air Resources Board (CARB).
The CARB, which is part of the California Environmental Protection Agency, is
responsible for meeting the State requirements of the federal CAA, administering
the California CAA, and establishing the California Ambient Air Quality Standards
(CAAQS). Both State and federal ambient air quality standards have been
established for the following six pollutants: ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM10
and PM2.5), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2),
and lead (Pb). The CAAQS generally are more stringent than the corresponding
federal standards and incorporate additional standards for sulfates, hydrogen
sulfide, vinyl chloride, and visibility reducing particles.
Ozone (O3), a key ingredient of smog, is a highly reactive and unstable gas
capable of damaging the linings of the respiratory tract. This pollutant forms in
the atmosphere through complex reactions between chemicals directly emitted
from vehicles, industrial plants, and many other sources.
PM2.5 and PM10 are particles that easily penetrate into the airways and lungs
where they may produce harmful health effects such as the worsening of heart
and lung diseases. The risk of these health effects is greatest in the elderly and
the very young. Exposure to elevated concentrations of PM is also associated
with increased hospital and doctor visits and increased numbers of premature
deaths.
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas. It results from the incomplete
combustion of carbon-containing fuels such as gasoline or wood, and is emitted
by a wide variety of combustion sources.
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a reactive, oxidizing gas capable of damaging cells
lining the respiratory tract. This pollutant is also an essential ingredient in the
formation of ground-level ozone pollution. NO2 is one of the nitrogen oxides

                                                 Conservation Element
emitted from high-temperature combustion processes, such as those occurring in
trucks, cars, and power plants. In the presence of sunlight, complex reactions of
nitrogen oxides with ozone and other air pollutants produce the majority of NO2
in the atmosphere. Indoors, home heaters and gas stoves also produce
substantial amounts of NO2.
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a gaseous compound of sulfur and oxygen. SO2 is formed
when sulfur-containing fuel is burned by mobile sources, such as locomotives,
ships, and off-road diesel equipment.
Lead (Pb) is a relatively soft and chemically resistant metal. Lead forms
compounds with both organic and inorganic substances. As an air pollutant, lead
is present in small particles. Sources of lead emissions in California include a
variety of industrial activities. Because it was emitted in large amounts from
vehicles when leaded gasoline was used, lead is present in many soils (especially
urban soils) and can be reintroduced into the air by grading activities.
Sulfates (SO42) are the fully oxidized ionic form of sulfur. Sulfates occur in
combination with metal and/or hydrogen ions. In California, emissions of sulfur
compounds occur primarily from the combustion of petroleum-derived fuels
(e.g., gasoline and diesel fuel) that contain sulfur. This sulfur is oxidized to sulfur
dioxide (SO2) during the combustion process and subsequently converted to
sulfate compounds in the atmosphere. The conversion of SO2 to sulfates takes
place comparatively rapidly and completely in urban areas of California due to
regional meteorological features.
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a colorless gas with the odor of rotten eggs. It is formed
during bacterial decomposition of sulfur-containing organic substances. Also,
hydrogen sulfide can be present in sewer gas and some natural gas, and can be
emitted as the result of geothermal energy exploitation.
Vinyl chloride (chloroethene), a chlorinated hydrocarbon, is a colorless gas with
a mild, sweet odor. Vinyl chloride largely is used to make polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
plastic and vinyl products. Vinyl chloride has been detected near landfills, sewage
plants, and hazardous waste sites due to microbial breakdown of chlorinated
solvents.
Visibility-reducing particles consist of suspended particulate matter, which is a
complex mixture of tiny particles that consists of dry solid fragments, solid cores
                            Costa Mesa General Plan | CON-29
Conservation Element
with liquid coatings, and small droplets of liquid. These particles vary greatly in
shape, size, and chemical composition, and can be made up of many different
materials such as metals, soot, soil, dust, and salt.
Areas that do not violate ambient air quality standards are considered to have
attained the standards. Violations of ambient air quality standards are based on
air pollutant monitoring data and are judged for each air pollutant.
The clean air effort still has a long way to go. In 2005, the federal one-hour ozone
standard was replaced by a stricter eight-hour standard that was further
strengthened in 2008. Even though air quality continues to improve in South
Coast Air Basin, pollutant levels in the Basin persistently exceed the federal eight-
hour standard for ozone almost one-third of the year. Due to tougher federal air
quality standards for particulates and ozone issued in 2006 and 2008, the South
Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) estimates it will take until at
least 2020 to meet the 24-hour average particulate standard and until 2030 to
meet the eight-hour ozone standard. The status of attainment for the criteria
pollutants discussed above for the Basin in year 2014 is presented in Table CON-
4. Air Basin Attainment Status.

locations throughout the four-county area. Costa Mesa is located within Source

Climate Change
Global climate change is an increasingly acknowledged environmental problem
caused as greenhouse gases (GHGs) are released into the atmosphere faster than
the Earth’s natural systems can reabsorb them. The primary GHGs emitted into
the atmosphere are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6),
and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Collectively, these gases trap heat in the
atmosphere and intensify the natural greenhouse effect, thus causing the global
average surface temperature to rise, which in turn affects global climate
patterns. Other compounds—including some aerosols—can also have a strong
heat-forcing effect on the atmosphere. This includes black carbon, which consists
of microscopic particles emitted from the incomplete combustion of biomass and
fossil fuels.
In response to these concerns, California enacted AB 32, the California Global
Warming Solutions Act of 2006. The law seeks to reverse climate change through
a comprehensive program reducing GHG emissions for virtually all sources
statewide. AB 32 requires CARB to develop regulations and market mechanisms
to achieve technologically feasible and cost-effective measures that will reduce
emissions to 1990 levels by 2020—a 25 percent reduction statewide. In 2008,
CARB approved a comprehensive “Scoping Plan” which is to be updated every
five years. The first update was approved in 2014.
Senate Bill (SB) 375, the Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of
2008, provides key support to achieve the goals of AB 32. SB 375 is intended to
encourage regional planning that integrates land use and transportation policy in
a way that reduces GHG emissions from passenger vehicles. This legislation
endeavors to control the emissions by curbing sprawl (the unplanned,
uncontrolled spread of urban development). The legislation encourages compact
development patterns that reduce the need to drive, thereby reducing air
pollution from car exhaust, conserving water, and protecting habitat, among
                           Costa Mesa General Plan | CON-31

other benefits. To achieve these goals, this law is designed to align regional land
use, housing, and transportation plans with greenhouse gas reduction targets for
2020 and 2035.
The City recognizes the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
enhancing our environment and economic sustainability, and preserving a high
quality of life and safety for generations to come. Many actions undertaken by
the City directly or indirectly improve air quality. These include implementing the
Build Green Incentive Program, pursuing mixed-use development and live-work
housing that will reduce vehicle miles traveled, implementing energy efficiency
programs, supporting transit use, developing bicycle routes and trails, minimizing
landfill waste, and supporting the use of alternative fuel vehicles in the City’s
fleet and in the community. Considering air quality issues in the decision-making
process will ensure that new development minimizes new emissions.
Key Atmosphere and Climate Condition Issues
Air Pollution
Breathing polluted air can cause eye irritation and nose burn, and long-term
effects including chronic respiratory ailments. Air pollution can irritate throats
and make breathing difficult. In fact, pollutants like tiny airborne particles and
ground level ozone can trigger respiratory problems, especially for people with
asthma. Air pollution can also be damaging to the natural environment by
impacting trees, plants, water bodies, and wildlife.
Greenhouse Gases
Within Costa Mesa, as in most urban areas, fossil fuels are the number one
source of energy consumed by residents, government, industry, and commercial
activities, thus leading to increases in greenhouse gases. Vehicles are the single
largest consumer of fossil fuels, followed by buildings that use large amounts of
energy for heating and cooling. These activities have contributed to the elevated
concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, in turn, this is causing the
Earth’s temperature to rise. A warmer Earth may lead to changes in rainfall
patterns, smaller polar ice caps, a rise in sea level, and a wide range of impacts
on plants, wildlife, and humans.

Chapter 7:
Noise Element
           Introduction
           Costa Mesa residents enjoy the diversity of their neighborhoods. With the
           pleasant, ocean-influenced climate, they find many reasons to spend time
           outdoors. While some level of noise is part of the urban environment—with
           noise conditions varying depending upon the type and density of
           development—residents desire to keep Costa Mesa a relatively quiet place.
           This Noise Element establishes goals focused on creating a local noise
           environment that contributes to positive community health and minimizes
           exposure of residents to adverse noise conditions.
           Federal and State statutes define noise to be an environmental pollutant that
           can affect the quality of life and human health by causing annoyance and
           disrupting everyday activities. Many laws are in place to protect individuals
           from excessive noise at their workplaces and in their homes. In Costa Mesa,
           significant noise sources include I-405, SR-73 and SR-55, major arterials such
           as Harbor Boulevard and 17th Street, the Orange County Fairgrounds and
                                           Costa Mesa General Plan | N-1

Noise Element
Pacific Amphitheater, John Wayne Airport, and the activities of local industrial
businesses. While the City does not have jurisdiction to control how most of
these noise sources affects the community, it can direct land use policy and
work with responsible agencies to minimize noise impacts on residents.
Purpose
The purpose of the Noise Element is to identify noise sources in Costa Mesa
and define strategies for reducing the negative impact of noise on the
community. The Noise Element identifies baseline and projected noise levels
so that this information can guide future land use decisions in a manner that
limit noises and its effect on the community.
Legal Requirement
State Law (Section 65302[f] of the California Government Code) requires that
general plans include a Noise Element that identifies and appraises noise
problems in the community. The Noise Element follows the revised State
guidelines in Section 46050.1 of the Health and Safety Code that require the
Element analyze and quantify—to the extent practical—baseline and
projected noise levels for the following sources:
        Highways and freeways
        Primary arterials and major local streets
        Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid
         transit systems
        Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, military airport
         operations, aircraft overflights, jet engine test stands, and all other
         ground facilities and maintenance functions related to airport
         operation
        Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad
         classification yards
        Other ground stationary noise sources identified by local agencies as
         contributing to the community noise environment
State law is fairly specific as to how local noise conditions are presented. The
24-hour noise environment typically is expressed in terms of noise contour
maps, which display average noise levels over a 24-hour period. They
resemble topographic maps, which illustrate varying ground elevations. The

                                                         Noise Element
noise contour maps indicate an aggregation of noise from all sources, and
state the noise levels in terms of Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) or
Day-Night Average Level (Ldn); these terms are described below. The noise
contours establish a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses in the Land
Use Element to minimize exposure of residents to excessive noise. State law
specifies that the Noise Element is to include implementation measures to
address existing and foreseeable noise problems and, importantly, to serve as
a guideline for compliance with the State’s noise insulation standards.
Noise Metrics
Noise—in its most simplistic terms—is defined as unwanted sound. While
sound can be defined easily using scientific standards, noise has qualities that
require more complex treatment. Sound is measured and expressed by
decibels (dB), with an adjustment referred to as the A-weighted measure
(dBA) to correct for the relative frequency response of the human ear.
Decibels are measured on a logarithmic scale, representing points on a
sharply rising curve. For example, a sound level of 10 decibels is 10 times
more intense than one decibel, 20 decibels represent a noise 100 times more
intense, and 30 decibels reflects a condition 1,000 times more intense. A
sound as soft as human breathing is about 10 times greater than a zero
decibel level.
The decibel system of measuring sound gives a rough connection between the
physical intensity of sound and its perceived loudness to the human ear. A
10-decibel increase is perceived by the human ear as only doubling of the
loudness. Ambient sounds in the urban environment generally range from 30
dBA (very quiet) to 100 dBA (very loud), as indicated in Table N-1: Typical
Sound Levels.
Because people generally are more sensitive to noise intrusions during the
evening and night hours, State law requires, for planning purposes, use of
such metrics as the CNEL or Ldn. These metrics add an artificial decibel
increment to quiet time noise levels in a 24-hour noise descriptor to account
for increased sensitivity during late hours. The CNEL descriptor requires that
an artificial increment of five dBA be added to the actual noise level for the
hours from 7:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M., and 10 dBA for the 10:00 P.M.to 7:00 A.M.

  increment is added to the hours between 7:00 A.M. and 10:00 P.M.

  Both descriptors yield roughly the same 24-hour level, with the CNEL being
  only slightly more restrictive (that is, higher).
  The discussion of noise requires the use of a number of technical terms.
  Some of the key noise-related terms used in this element include:
          Decibel (dB). A decibel is a unit of measurement which indicates the
           relative amplitude of a sound. The zero on the decibel scale is based
           on the lowest sound level that the healthy, unimpaired human ear
           can detect. Sound levels in decibels are calculated on a logarithmic
  N-4 | Costa Mesa General Plan

                                                          Noise Element
        basis. Each 10 decibel increase in sound level is perceived as
        approximately a doubling of loudness over a fairly wide range of
        intensities.
       A-weighted sound level (dBA). The A-weighted sound level is the
        most common method to characterize sound in California. This scale
        gives greater weight to the frequencies of sound to which the human
        ear is most sensitive. All sound levels in this chapter are A-weighted,
        unless reported otherwise.
       Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). CNEL is the energy
        average of the A-weighted sound levels occurring during a 24-hour
        period, with 10 dB added to the A-weighted sound levels occurring
        between 10:00 P.M. and 7:00 A.M. and five dB added to the A-
        weighted sound levels occurring between 7:00 P.M. and 10:00 P.M.
       Energy-equivalent sound/noise level (Leq). Leq describes the average
        level that has the same acoustical energy as the summation of all the
        time-varying events. This descriptor is useful because sound levels
        can vary markedly over a short period of time. The most common
        averaging period for Leq is hourly, but it can be of any duration.
       Day/night average sound level (Ldn). Ldn is a measure over a 24-hour
        period at a given location, with a 10 dB added to the A-weighted
        sound levels occurring between 10:00 P.M. and 7:00 A.M.
Noise Standards
While primary responsibility for control of noise rests with State and local
governments, the United States Noise Control Act of 1972 and the Quiet
Community Act of 1978 recognized the role of the federal government in
addressing major commercial noise sources to provide uniform treatment of
such sources. The federal government specifically preempts local control of
noise emissions from aircraft, railroad, and interstate highways.
The State of California’s noise insulation standards are codified in the
California Code of Regulations, Title 24, Building Standards Administrative

construction for providing suitable interior noise environments. The
regulations specify that acoustical studies must be prepared when noise-

sensitive structures, such as residential buildings, schools, or hospitals, are
located near major transportation noise sources, and where such noise
sources create an exterior noise level of 60 dBA CNEL or higher. Acoustical
studies that accompany building plans must demonstrate that structures have
been designed to limit interior noise in habitable rooms to acceptable noise
levels. For new residential buildings, schools, and hospitals, the acceptable
interior noise limit for new construction is 45 dBA CNEL.
Costa Mesa has a comprehensive Noise Ordinance within the Municipal Code
(Chapter XIII-Noise Control) that sets standards for noise levels citywide and
provides the means to enforce the reduction of offensive noises. The noise
standards in Table N-2: Residential Exterior and Interior Standards, apply to
both indoor and outdoor residential areas. Between the hours of 11:00 P.M.
and 7:00 A.M., the noise standards are five dBA more stringent for exterior
areas and 10 dBA more stringent for indoor areas. The Noise Ordinance
further specifies that residential exterior areas such as private balconies, roof
decks, and internal courtyards in a Mixed-Use Overlay District for live/work
and multi-family residential development that are approved pursuant to a
Master Plan, and subject to the land use regulations of an Urban Plan, are
exempt from the residential exterior noise standards. A similar exemption
also applies to high-rise residential development in the North Costa Mesa
Specific Plan.

Note:     These represent the basic standards applicable for time periods exceeding
          15 minutes each hour. Higher levels may be generated for specified shorter
          time periods.

Noise Conditions and Compatibility Standards
Two types of noise sources are considered in the community noise inventory:
mobile sources and stationary sources. Mobile noise sources refer to cars,
trucks, motorcycles, buses, aircraft, and trains. Stationary sources include
industrial and construction activities (including truck loading), playgrounds,
outdoor sports facilities, landscape maintenance equipment, construction
activities, and the typical sounds heard in a residential neighborhood (power
tools, barking dogs, etc.).
Table N-3: Noise and Land Use Compatibility Matrix presents the guidelines
promulgated by federal and State agencies, modified to meet local conditions
and Costa Mesa’s needs. This table represents the primary tool the City will
use to ensure integrated planning compatibility between land uses and
outdoor noise.
Costa Mesa’s noise environment is dominated by vehicular traffic and aircraft
operations at John Wayne Airport. To provide a description of the baseline
2015 noise environment in Costa Mesa, noise contours were obtained from
the Orange County Airport Land Use Commission and quantified for highway
and local street traffic.
Vehicular Noise
Traffic noise levels can be reliably predicted using formulas that take into
account traffic volume, speed, and the percentage of trucks. Baseline 2015
noise contours were calculated for all the City’s primary and major arterials,
as well as the three freeways (I-405, SR-55, SR-73) that traverse the City. In
addition, a number of secondary and commuter streets were modeled. Noise
generation for each roadway segment was calculated, and the distance to the
60, 65, and 70 dBA CNEL contours was determined (A noise contour is a line
behind which the noise level does not exceed a certain value. For instance,
the 60 dBA CNEL contour indicates that the CNEL between the street and the
contour line is equal to, or greater than 60 dB; the CNEL beyond the contour
line—away from the street—is less than 60 dB).

Aircraft Noise
The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has established
guidelines in the California State Noise Standard to control residential area
noise levels produced by aircraft operations that use the State’s airports.
Under these guidelines, residential noise sensitive areas exposed to an
average CNEL of greater than the 65 dBA define the noise impact area.
John Wayne Airport
John Wayne Airport, operated by the County of Orange, abuts industrial and
commercial properties at the northeast corner of Costa Mesa. A small portion
of Costa Mesa lies within the 65 dBA CNEL contour of John Wayne Airport.
The northeast corner of Costa Mesa is impacted by noise from the airport.
However, the majority of this area is developed with industrial uses.
Approximately 107 dwelling units within the City’s sphere of influence lie
within the 65 dBA CNEL noise impact area south of the runway.
Noise contours resulting from operations at John Wayne Airport, indicated on
Figure N-1, John Wayne Airport Noise Contours, are those on file with the
County of Orange Office of Noise Abatement and the Orange County Airport
Land Use Commission (ALUC).
The 2008 Airport Environs Land Use Plan (AELUP) adopted by the Airport Land
Use Commission specifies acceptable uses proximate to the airport. These are
defined as uses that will not subject people to adverse noise impacts. John
Wayne Airport, primarily through the General Aviation Noise Ordinance
(GANO), has ongoing programs of noise reduction that include limits on the
number of commercial airline flights, noise abatement arrival and departure
procedures, admonishment of noisy operators (including private aircraft),
curfew, and take-off weight limitations.
The Orange County Board of Supervisors approved a master plan for the
airport in February, 1985. Settlement of lawsuits concerning airport
expansion were reached in December 1985 between the County, City of
Newport Beach, and two community organizations. In 2003, the settlement
agreement was amended which extended the agreement until 2015, allowed
an increase in passengers served from 8.4 million annual passengers to 10.8
million annual passengers, allowed an increase in regular Class A flights to 85
average daily departures, and allowed facility improvements.

In 2014, the Board of Supervisors authorized an increase in operational
capacity and extended the terms of the settlement agreement through
December 31, 2030, with no change to curfew until December 31, 2035.
Additionally, beginning on January 1, 2021, the approval allows a gradual
increase in passenger count from 8.4 million average passengers to 11.8
million average passengers and 95 average daily departures. Further, on
January 1, 2026, the number passengers would again be allowed to increase,
up to 12.5 million average passengers, depending upon the actual service
levels in the preceding five years.
Despite the increase in air traffic from John Wayne Airport, the ultimate CNEL
noise contours are considerably less than the noise contour contained in the
2008 AELUP due to updated technology creating quieter fleets of commercial
aircrafts.
Helicopter Services
The City of Costa Mesa contracts with Huntington Beach for police helicopter
services on a case-by-case basis. Depending on altitude and speed, noise
levels generated by the craft under normal conditions range from 61 to 65
dBA. As of 2015, four heliports were located in Costa Mesa at the following
locations:
        Costa Mesa Police Department, 99 Fair Drive
        Former Los Angeles Times building, 1375 West Sunflower Avenue
        South Coast Metro Center, 555 Anton Boulevard
        Tridair Helicopter, 3000 Airway Avenue
The AELUP for Heliports establishes regulations and restrictions for the siting
of heliports/helipads. The purpose of the AELUP for Heliports is to protect the
public from the adverse effects of aircraft noise by ensuring that
heliports/helipads are sited in areas of compatible land use. The City
regulates the siting of helipads through a conditional use permit. The City
requires an analysis to identify potential noise impacts and the City may
regulate the hours of operation and arrival, departure/arrival routes, and type
of helicopters which may use the heliport in order to minimize impacts to
sensitive land uses. Heliports and helistops must comply with the all
conditions of approval imposed or recommended by the Federal Aviation
Administration, Orange County ALUC, and Caltrans/Division of Aeronautics.

OC Fair & Event Center
The OC Fair & Event Center (OCFEC) has existed at its location across from the
Civic Center for over 65 years and has become a year-round exhibition,
conference, and event center. The primary function of the OCFEC is to host
the annual summer fair, which includes rides, exhibits, theater, the centennial
farm area, equestrian center, and amphitheater for concerts. Over 1.3 million
people attend the fair during its summer run.
Several noise sources exist within the fairgrounds property. A majority of the
on-site stationary noise is due to the weekly Orange County Market Place,
Farmers Market, Centennial Farm, and Food Truck Fare Wednesday, as well as
annual events such as the OC Home and Garden Show, Orange County Fair,
and concerts at the Pacific Amphitheater. Parking lot activity during various
fairground events also generates noise.
In 1980, a stricter, modified Noise Ordinance for fairground operations was
established in an agreement between the 32nd District Agricultural Association
and the City of Costa Mesa (“1980 Settlement Agreement”). Table N-4,
Orange County Fairgrounds Modified Noise Ordinance, applies to the activities
within the Orange County Fairgrounds, with the exception of the events at the
Pacific Amphitheater.

Orange County Fair
The Orange County Fair operates for four weeks annually during the summer
months. Noise sources during the fair events include a public address system,
carnival rides, and several sound reinforcement systems used for concerts and
carnival rides. Noise levels in the activity areas of a typical fair are in the
range of 65 to75 dBA.
Pacific Amphitheater
The 8,200-seat Pacific Amphitheater is owned and managed by the OC Fair &
Event Center and provides year-round events. Prior to 1990, noise levels
generated by concert events at Pacific Amphitheater exceeded the Costa
Mesa Noise Ordinance, impacting surrounding residential neighborhoods. In
1990, a permanent injunction (“1990 Order”) was entered against the former
operators of the Amphitheater and the order set the current noise level
established in Table N-5. The order specifically stated that the City’s Noise
Ordinance does not apply to the Pacific Amphitheatre. The amphitheater
closed in 1997, but reopened in 2003 and remains subject to the noise
restrictions of the 1990 Order outlined in Table N-5.

Stationary Noise Sources
Stationary noise sources in Costa Mesa include restaurants, bars,
entertainment establishments, mixed-use structures, mechanical equipment,
outdoor industrial and commercial activities, and use of recreational facilities.
                             Costa Mesa General Plan | N-13

Noise Element
Delivery trucks, air compressors, generators, outdoor loudspeakers, and gas
venting cause the primary noise sources associated with these facilities.
Other significant stationary noise sources include construction activity, street
sweepers, and gas-powered leaf blowers. Residential land uses and areas
identified as noise-sensitive must be protected from excessive noise from
stationary sources including commercial and industrial centers. These impacts
are best controlled through effective land use planning and the application of
the Noise Ordinance.
Ambient Noise
To describe the ambient or background noise level throughout the City,
several noise measurement samples were taken in 2015. Noise sensitive land
uses include schools, residences, churches, hospitals, and similar facilities.
The locations included a mix of public schools, preschools (childcare centers),
hospitals, convalescent homes and a senior housing development. The
locations shown in Figure N-1: Noise Monitoring Locations, were distributed
throughout the City to provide an overall understanding of the noise
environment.
The noise measurement locations also functioned as noise-sensitive
indicators. These noise-sensitive indicators are uses, such as schools and
hospitals, that have a lower tolerance for noise than do industrial and
commercial activities or normal residential uses. Noise levels measured at
these locations are reported in Table N-6: Field Noise Measurements.

Citywide Noise Environment
Existing Noise Environment (2015)
Figure N-2: Existing Noise Contours - 2015, illustrates the existing (2015) CNEL
noise contours along many of the City's major roadways in the City. CNEL
contours are found by calculating distances to the 55, 60, 65, and 70 CNEL
contours. Figure N-2 also depicts John Wayne Airport’s CNEL noise contours
prepared in 2013.
Future Noise Environment (2035)
The noise environment in Costa Mesa is not expected to change as a result of
implementation of the General Plan. Vehicular traffic noise—the dominant
source citywide—is not anticipated to change substantially along local streets
or major through routes, including I-405, SR-73 and SR-55, major arterials.
Aircraft noise from John Wayne Airport, noise from events at the OC
Fairground & Event Center, and non-transportation noise similarly are not
anticipated to increase in the community.
The projected noise exposure contours for year 2035 are indicated in Figure
N-3: Future Noise Contours - 2035. The future noise contours should be
considered as a guide to identifying potential land use/noise compatibility
issues and will be used to determine the requirement for project specific
noise studies and mitigation. Future noise CNEL for John Wayne Airport are
also shown in Figure N-3, which reflect the airport’s 1985 Master Plan future
noise conditions.
In comparison to the 2015 noise contours presented in Figure N-2, future
noise levels will increase only modestly.

Key Noise Issues
The key noise issues in Costa Mesa are:
John Wayne Airport
John Wayne Airport, a very busy airport, has some of the most restrictions
related to noise in the United States. Noise from operations at John Wayne
Airport affects primarily industrial and commercial properties in northeast
Costa Mesa (Figures N-2 and N-3). Departures from the airport were
amended in 2011 under STREL, which directed departure flights away from
residences and over Newport Bay. STREL is the name provided by the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) to describe the Area Navigation (RNAV)
departure procedure implemented in 2011, and replaced the flight departure
pattern called DUUKE ONE/TWO.
The County’s General Aviation Noise Ordinance regulates the hours of
operation and the maximum permitted noise levels associated with general
aviation projects. General aviation flights are allowed, as long as aircraft
comply with the General Aviation Noise Ordinance. The County has installed
10 noise-monitoring stations along the main designated departure and arrival
flight routes; no noise monitoring station was located in Costa Mesa as of
2015.
The FAA, under its Next Generation Air Transportation System program, also
known as Southern California Metroplex project, seeks to optimize flight
patterns departing out of the airport; it may affect the flight paths over Costa
Mesa over the long term.
Construction Noise
Construction noise could occur in almost any part of the City. However,
Section 13-279 of the Costa Mesa Municipal Code limits construction activity
as follows:
  Allowable Hours          Applicable Days
  7:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M. Mondays through Fridays
  9:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.   Saturdays
Construction is prohibited all hours on Sundays and on the following specified
federal holidays: New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor
Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.
                            Costa Mesa General Plan | N-19

Noise Element
Helicopter Noise
Because of the nature of their operations, police helicopter noise may impact
any location in the City at any time between 10:00 A.M. and 3:00 A.M.
Overflights are usually brief, lasting only a few seconds. Noise exposure of
several minutes may occur when circling a crime scene. Although helicopter
noise levels are not extremely high in either case, they may be sufficient to
cause sleep interruption during nighttime hours. The FAA does not have
minimum altitude requirements for helicopters when weather, safety, and
other air traffic permit.
Roadway Traffic Noise
Roadway traffic noise has the greatest impact on the noise environment of
Costa Mesa’s residential properties. Between 55 and 60 dBA CNEL contours
are common along collector streets; freeways and major streets expose
adjacent areas to levels of 65 dBA CNEL or greater.
Figures N-2 and N-3 show baseline 2015 and projected 2035 noise contours
along many of the City's major and primary arterials and the three freeways
that traverse the City. Noise contours for selected secondary and commuter
streets are also included. The figures display the average daily traffic volume
noise levels at 100 feet from the roadway centerline and the distance from
the roadway centerline to the 70, 65 and 60 dBA CNEL contours. The
improvements on the I-405, SR-55, and SR-73 would produce noise impacts on
immediately adjacent Costa Mesa properties.
Noise/Land Use Compatibility Conflicts
A great proportion of mixed-use developments, typically multi-family
residential or live/work units atop a leasable commercial space or loft studio,
are located in the Westside. The Mixed-Use Overlay District encompasses
three urban plans that govern almost all of the Westside of Costa Mesa—19
West, Mesa West Bluffs, and Mesa West Residential Ownership. In addition,
the SoBECA Urban Plan allows for mixed-use development. Residents in
Westside neighborhoods have expressed some concern regarding the
operational ambient noise emanating from industrial activities from truck
traffic, heavy machinery, materials processing, and general worker activity. In
addition, the commercial spaces below the residential portions of buildings
could also generate noise. The SoBECA district has additional noise issues
associated with the proximity of the SR-55 and SR-73 freeways.
Land use development process within the context of these urban plans take
into consideration noise impacts. A project application is required to include a
N-20 | Costa Mesa General Plan

                                                          Noise Element
noise study to show how compliance with noise standards will be achieved.
Furthermore, as part of conditions of project approval, the required
Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs) must disclose the existing
noise environment within and surrounding the mixed-use development.
Proper design that attenuates the impact of noise is embedded in the urban
plans. The plans recommend noise-reduction building design approaches
such as double-pane windows, wall and ceiling insulation, and the limitation
on commercial operations to minimize interaction between noise-generating
business activities such as deliveries and loading.
Noise Plan
Typical Noise Attenuation Techniques
Noise impacts can be mitigated in three ways: 1) by reducing the sound level
of the noise generator, 2) by increasing the distance between the source and
receiver, and 3) by insulating the receiver. Noise reduction can be
accomplished by placement of walls, landscaped berms, or a combination of
the two between the noise source and the receiver.
Generally, effective noise shielding requires a solid barrier with a mass of at
least four pounds per square-foot of surface area, which is large enough to
block the line of sight between source and receiver. Variations may be
appropriate in individual cases based on distance, nature and orientation of
buildings behind the barrier, and a number of other factors. Garages or other
buildings may be used to shield dwelling units and outdoor living areas from
traffic noise. In addition to site design techniques, noise insulation can be
accomplished through proper design of buildings. Nearby noise generators
should be recognized in determining the location of doors, windows and vent
openings. Sound-rated windows (extra thick or multi-paned) and wall
insulation are also effective.
However, none of these noise mitigation measures can realize their full
potential unless care is taken in actual construction: doors and windows fitted
properly, openings sealed, joints caulked, plumbing adequately insulated from
structural members, and sound-rated doors and windows will have little effect
                             Costa Mesa General Plan | N-21
Noise Element
if left open. This may require installation of air conditioning for adequate
ventilation.
Noise impacts can be reduced by insulating noise-sensitive uses, such as
residences, schools, libraries, hospitals, nursing homes, and some types of
commercial activities. Perhaps a more efficient approach involves limiting the
level of noise generation at the source. State and federal statutes have largely
preempted local control over vehicular noise emissions, but commercial and
industrial operations and certain residential activities provide opportunities
for the City to assist in noise abatement.
Although vehicular noise emissions standards are established at the State and
federal levels, Costa Mesa can play a significant part in reducing traffic noise
by controlling traffic volume and congestion. Traffic noise is greatest at
intersections due to acceleration, deceleration, and gear shifting. Measures
such as signal synchronization can help to reduce this problem. Likewise,
reduction of congestion aids in reduction of noise. This can be accomplished
through the application of traffic engineering techniques such as
channelization of turning movements, parking restrictions, separation of
modes (bus, auto, bicycle, pedestrian), and restrictions on truck traffic. Noise
reduction through reduction of traffic volumes can also be accomplished with
incentive programs for use of public transit facilities and high-occupancy
vehicles, staggering of work hours, and land use controls. Vehicle trips can be
turned into pedestrian trips with integration of housing and employment into
the same project or area, construction of high-density, affordable housing in
proximity to employment, shopping, public transit facilities, and other
techniques.

Goals, Objectives, and Policies
Goal N-1: Noise Hazards and Conditions
The City of Costa Mesa aims to protect residents, local workers, and property
from injury, damage, or destruction from noise hazards and to work toward
improved noise abatement.
Objective N-1A:     Control noise levels within the City for the protection of
                    residential areas, park areas, and other sensitive land
                    uses from excessive and unhealthful noise.
Policy N-1.1:       Enforce the maximum acceptable exterior noise levels for
                    residential areas at 65 CNEL.
Policy N-1.2:       Give full consideration to the existing and projected noise
                    environment when considering alterations to the City's
                    circulation system and Master Plan of Highways.
Policy N-1.3:       Encourage Caltrans to construct noise attenuation
                    barriers along I-405, SR-55, and SR-73 where these
                    freeways adjoin residential and other noise-sensitive
                    areas.
Policy N-1.4:       Ensure that appropriate site design measures are
                    incorporated into residential developments, when
                    required by an acoustical study, to obtain appropriate
                    exterior and interior noise levels.
                    When necessary, require field testing at the time of
                    project completion to demonstrate compliance.
Policy N-1.5:       Apply the standards contained in Title 24 of the California
                    Code of Regulations as applicable to the construction of

Policy N-2.2:        Require, as a part of the environmental review process,
                     that full consideration be given to the existing and
                     projected noise environment.
Policy N-2.3:        Consider alternative noise level standards for mixed-use
                     projects that take into consideration the interaction of
                     industrial operation noise impacts and the mixed-use
                     developments planned for the Westside and SoBeca.
Policy N-2.4:        Require that all proposed projects are compatible with
                     adopted noise/land use compatibility criteria
Policy N-2.5:        Enforce applicable interior and exterior noise standards.

                     projects in existing residential areas adjacent to major
                     arterials if it can be shown that there are no feasible
                     mechanisms to meet the exterior noise levels. The interior
                     standard of 45 dBA CNEL shall be enforced for any new
                     residential project.

Chapter 8:
Safety Element
           Introduction
           The City of Costa Mesa emphasizes community safety as a foundation for
           quality neighborhoods, strong business investment, and inviting public spaces.
           The City fosters safe and secure environments by recognizing potential
           hazards and developing plans that guard against disruption and threats to the
           public welfare.
           Purpose
           The Safety Element identifies and evaluates public health and safety hazards,
           and provides measures that can reduce unreasonable risks and minimize
           potential losses in the event of natural or human-caused disasters. The Safety
           Element addresses emergency preparedness and coordinated response,
           police and fire protection, and emergency services by:
                                         Costa Mesa General Plan | S-1
Safety Element
       Reviewing the regulatory framework that guides public safety
        planning efforts
       Highlighting key findings and recommendations based on assessed
        conditions
       Establishing goals with respect to public safety and welfare
       Defining the policies and implementing actions to address public
        safety issues
       Identifying lead responsibilities for each implementation action
Legal Requirements
Section 65302(g) of the California Government Code requires that General
Plans include a Safety Element for the protection of the community from any
unreasonable risks associated with wildland and urban fires, flooding, and
known geologic hazards. Geologic risks are defined as those associated with
geologic hazards such as seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking,
ground failure, tsunamis, seiches and dam failure, and slope instability leading
to mudslides, landslides, and subsidence. Importantly, the law requires that
the Safety Element address emergency response and preparedness, including
evacuation routes, operations associated with military installations, peak load
water supply requirements, minimum road widths, and clearance around
structures.
Baseline Conditions-2015
Like most coast-adjacent urban communities in California, Costa Mesa is
exposed to many natural and human-caused hazards that require attention in
the planning process. The City lies approximately one mile from the Pacific
Ocean and thus is susceptible to flooding from tsunamis. The Santa Ana River,
which runs along the eastern boundary, also presents potential flooding
hazards. Additionally, Costa Mesa is exposed to earthquakes and other
seismic hazards. Human activities such as the transport and manufacturing of
hazardous materials create conditions that require attention.

Geology
Geologic Structure
Costa Mesa lies adjacent to the Downey and Tustin portion of the Coastal
Plain, where sedimentary and volcanic rocks in the subsurface attain great
thickness. These deposits are composed mainly of volcanic, marine and non-
marine sedimentary rocks overlying a basement complex of granitic and
metamorphic rock. The plain is immediately underlain by a thick sequence of
alluvial sediments, which overlie the older sedimentary and volcanic rocks.
The main development of Costa Mesa is primarily on an uplifted mesa
(Newport Mesa) bounded on the west, south, and east by steep cliffs (refer to
Figure S-1, Geologic Units). Newport Mesa slopes gently northward from an
elevation of 80 to 110 feet above sea level at the southern crest of the mesa
to less than 40 feet above sea level at the northern boundary of the City.
Approximately 80 percent of the City is located on this mesa.
Newport Mesa is the most southerly of a series of discontinuous low hills and
plains that extend along the Newport-Inglewood structural zone from the
Santa Monica Mountains southeast to Newport Beach. These topographic
features are inferred from both physiographic and stratigraphic evidence to
be essentially contemporaneous segments of the Sangamon Age (120,000
years Before Present) deformed lower terrace of the Palos Verdes Hills.
Soils
Soils within Costa Mesa are variable, ranging from a predominance of clay
with some silty sand in the northern half of the City to a predominance of silty
sand with some sand and clay in the southern half (refer to Figure S-2 Soil
Types). These generalized units were derived from a more detailed soils map
contained in the soil survey of Orange County.

Mineral Resources
Oil
Portions of Costa Mesa overlay the West Newport Oil Field, which is located
west of Placentia Avenue, along the City’s western boundary (refer to Figure
S-1, Geologic Map).
Currently the only active oil wells in Costa Mesa operate in the West Newport
Field west of Whittier Avenue between 17th and 19th Streets. These wells
produce a relatively low quality crude oil and remained in operation through
the mid-1990s.
Peat Deposits
Peat deposits are located adjacent to the Santa Ana River and in the vicinity of
Upper Newport Bay. The size of the deposits in Costa Mesa is not sufficient to
justify extraction. However, peat does provide an unstable base for
construction and must be removed prior to development.
Seismic Hazards
Costa Mesa is in the vicinity of several known active and potentially active
earthquake faults, including most notably the Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone
and the San Joaquin Hills Fault Zone. Other faults such as the San Andreas,
Whittier, Elsinore, Palos Verdes, and Puente Hills Faults are predicted to affect
Costa Mesa with strong shaking but light damage. An earthquake along these
faults may have more indirect impacts such as the need to provide mutual aid,
an infusion of those seeking housing, and other mass care or sheltering
services.
Ground Shaking
Ground shaking is the phenomenon most often associated with seismic
activity. The intensity of ground shaking and relative earthquake damage are
heightened with earthquake magnitude, proximity to faults, and the presence
of deeper soft soils below the ground surface. The intensity of earthquakes is
measured, or expressed, in terms of two scales: the Richter scale and the
Modified Mercalli Intensity scale. The Richter scale measures the strength of
an earthquake and assigns it a magnitude number using a base-10 logarithmic
scale. For example, a magnitude 5.0 earthquake would result in 10 times the
level of ground shaking as a magnitude 4.0 earthquake. The Modified Mercalli
Intensity scale describes the intensity of an earthquake in terms of observable
S-6 | Costa Mesa General Plan

                                                         Safety Element
impacts, ranging from I (Not Felt) to XII (Extreme). The effects of ground
shaking in Costa Mesa will vary considerably depending upon the distance of a
seismic event relative to the city. Ground shaking from distant events (more
than 40 miles away) will be of a different nature than events that occur within
10 miles. Also, the duration of strong ground shaking is another important
factor related to seismic activity.
Five regional major faults—the Newport-Inglewood, San Joaquin Hills,
Whittier, San Andreas, and San Jacinto—present a seismic hazards to the City.
In addition, the El Modeno, Norwalk, Palos Verdes, 4-S Ranch, and Aliso fault
pose lesser seismic hazards due to their localized extent. Figure S-3, Regional
Faults, locates the fault zones of concern, and the descriptions below provide
details about each fault.
         Newport-Inglewood Fault. The Newport-Inglewood Fault extends
         approximately 47 miles south from the Santa Monica Mountains to
         Newport Beach and traverses Costa Mesa. The fault, considered the
         most active in California, roughly parallels the coastline from the
         Santa Monica Mountains until just south of Newport Bay, where it
         heads offshore for an unknown distance.
        Newport-Inglewood – Rose Canyon Fault Zone. The fault is
         seismically active and is approximately 3.5 miles wide within the City.
         The largest earthquake triggered by the fault zone was the 1933 Long
         Beach earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.3 (Richter scale). The
         earthquake resulted in strong ground shaking in Costa Mesa, as well
         as in other portions of Southern California.
        San Joaquin Hills Fault. The San Joaquin Hills Fault is a recently
         discovered southwest-dipping blind thrust fault originating near the
         southern end of the Newport-Inglewood Fault near Huntington Beach
         at the western margins of the San Joaquin Hills. Rupture of the entire
         area of this blind thrust fault could generate an earthquake as large as
         M 7.3. In addition, a minimum average recurrence interval of
         between about 1,650 and 3,100 years has been estimated for
         moderate-sized earthquakes on this fault.

       Whittier Fault. The Whittier Fault extends approximately 20 miles
        from the Whittier Narrows (near Whittier) to the southeast of the
        Santa Ana River. The fault is located approximately 20 miles
        northeast of Costa Mesa. The most notable seismic event associated
        with the Whittier Fault was the 1987 Whittier Narrows quake,
        measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale. While significant damage
        occurred in the San Gabriel Valley near the epicenter, properties in
        Costa Mesa did not experience substantial adverse effects.
       San Andreas Fault. The 745-mile San Andreas Fault is the best known
        among all California faults due to its historic seismic activity and
        destructive capabilities. The fault is expected to produce a probable
        magnitude of M 6.8-8.0. The center section of the fault ruptured the
        ground surface during the 1857 Fort Tejon Earthquake and caused
        considerable damage over thousands of square miles. The fault is
        located on the northeastern flank of the San Bernardino Mountains
        approximately 48 miles from Costa Mesa. It is possible that the future
        movements along the San Andreas Fault Zone will produce
        simultaneous ruptures or “double earthquakes.” A major earthquake
        occurs on this zone once every 145 years, and 2002 marked 145 years
        after the Fort Tejon Earthquake.
       San Jacinto Fault. The San Jacinto Fault extends over 180 miles from
        its junction with the San Andreas Fault in San Bernardino County. It
        has produced several damaging earthquakes over recorded history.
        The most notable is the 1940 Imperial County Earthquake. The fault is
        located approximately 44 miles from the City.
Differential Compaction or Settlement
Differential ground settlement is caused by earthquake ground shaking and is
potentially damaging to structures and underground utilities. Differential
settlement may occur in sediments where differences in densities in adjacent
materials lead to different degrees of compaction during ground shaking.
Post-earthquake differential settlement may occur within the known peat
deposits located in the City.
Liquefaction
Liquefaction describes a condition whereby saturated, loose, fine-grained
sediment assumes a fluid-like state when subjected to intense ground shaking
                              Costa Mesa General Plan | S-9

Safety Element
or other disruptive seismic events. Like landslides and mudflows, liquefaction
is a form of ground failure. It can occur when susceptible soils strength and
their stiffness decreases during an earthquake, which reduces the soil’s ability
to support foundations for buildings, bridges, or other structures. Even though
Costa Mesa has been subject to strong ground shaking in the past, historical
records do not confirm an instance of liquefaction occurring in the City.
However, failure due to liquefaction has been reported in the nearby cities of
Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. As a result, the potential exists for
liquefaction to occur in localized sections within the northwest and western
portions of the City, as shown in Figure S-4, Local Seismic Hazards.
Ground Cracking, Ground Lurching, Lateral Spreading, and Slope
Stability
Most often associated with liquefaction, ground lurching and cracking are
caused by moderate to strong ground shaking. Typically, the potential for
ground cracking exists within areas of Costa Mesa that have a moderate to
high potential for liquefaction and in regions of known peat deposits. The
conditions for ground lurching and lateral spreading may be present along the
bluffs adjacent to the Santa Ana River and Newport Bay.
Slope stability hazards include landslides, rock falls, mudslides, and
avalanches. Since local topography consists of generally flat to gently sloping
terrain, the potential for these hazards is minimal. However, the potential
exists for earth movement during strong ground shaking along the bluffs along
the southern portion of the City.
Surface Faulting
Surface faulting is the rupture of the ground surface along a fault. The only
active fault that traverses Costa Mesa is the Newport-Inglewood Fault.
Although this fault is defined as active, surface rupture does not appear to be
a significant potential hazard since no historic such event has been observed.
Tsunamis
Costa Mesa is three-quarters of a mile inland from the Pacific Ocean at
elevations ranging between 30 to 100 feet above sea level. The southern
portion of the City sits on bluffs overlooking Newport Beach. Consequently,
the potential for tsunamis affecting Costa Mesa is negligible.

 Costa Mesa General Plan | S-11
Safety Element
However, areas located along the Santa Ana River Channel may be susceptible
to the effects of tsunamis that travel up river.
Seiches
The absence of any large bodies of water within Costa Mesa and the location
of high bluffs adjacent to Newport Bay reduce the possibility of damage from
seiche effects.
Key Seismic Hazards Issues
Seismic Hazards
Regional and local fault zones pose significant ground shaking, ground
cracking, ground lurching, lateral spreading, differential compaction, and
settlement hazards that could result in widespread upset in Costa Mesa in the
event of a major earthquake. Properties near the bluffs and Santa Ana River
are exposed to seismically induced slope failure and instability.
Liquefaction
Although there is no historical evidence of structural damage to buildings as a
result of liquefaction, there have been some recorded events that have
occurred in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. Liquefaction-induced
structural damage is more likely to occur in buildings that place heavy loads
on their foundations, such as high-rise office or multi-family buildings.
Buildings with only lightly loaded foundations, such as single-family homes, or
those that spread the load over a larger area, are less susceptible to damage.
Liquefaction hazards can be reduced through soil mitigation and structural
strengthening. A site-specific liquefaction assessment, performed by a
geotechnical engineer or engineering geologist, can address the actual
liquefaction potential of the soils.
Seismically Induced Water Waves
If a seismic event were to trigger a tsunami, low-lying areas along the Santa
Ana River may be subject to flooding. The amount of flooding would be
dependent on the size of the earthquake and strength of the tsunami.

Hydrology/Drainage
Flood Hazards
Costa Mesa sits alongside the Santa Ana River. This regional water feature
presents a potential flooding hazard, as it drains Southern California’s largest
watershed, originating in the San Bernardino Mountains and draining over
3,000 square miles. Significant flood control improvements have been
installed along the river course, with the goal of protecting properties along
its route from flooding hazards. The Flood Insurance Rate Maps prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identify areas located
within the City that are susceptible to 100-year and 500-year floods. In the
event of a 500-year flood, the northern and western boundaries of Costa
Mesa would be susceptible to flooding, as shown in Figure S-5, Local Flooding
Hazards. In the event of a 100-year flood, minimal flooding is expected to
occur within the flood channels adjacent to the Talbert Nature Preserve.
Dam Inundation
The Santiago Creek Dam and Prado Dam provide flood protection for
numerous cities within Orange County, including Costa Mesa. Prado Dam is
located at the border of Orange and Riverside Counties, approximately 30
miles from Costa Mesa. Dam construction was completed in 1941, and the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continues to make phased improvements on the
structure. The height of Prado Dam has been raised to 28 feet, and a new
intake tower and outlet have been added. Those improvements added
140,000 acre-feet to the basin and increased the dam’s level of protection to
190 years.
The Santiago Creek Dam, located near Irvine, is approximately 15 miles from
the City. Dam construction occurred in 1931. In the event of a failure at either
dam, portions of Costa Mesa are susceptible to potential flooding. These dam
inundation areas are primarily located in the northern and western portions
of the City, as shown in Figure S-6, Dam Inundation Areas.
Drainage Facilities
Local drainage facilities—storm drains, channels, and retention and detention
basins—are designed to control and manage storm water and urban runoff
and to protect properties from flooding. Engineers size and design local and
regional drainage facilities based on historical flooding data and an
understanding of how urban development affects storm flows.

Safety Element
Master plans identify any existing and future system deficiencies, and define
improvements needed to provide a high level of flood protection. The City’s
Master Drainage Plan identifies numerous specific projects that will improve
the storm drain system. Continued implementation of the plan provides the
City with appropriate control and management over local drainage concerns.
Sea Level Rise
Scientific data strongly suggests that long-term changes in the Earth’s climate
over the next century and beyond will lead to the possibility of rises in sea
levels around the world. In Southern California, sea level rise could result in
increased flooding in low-lying areas along the shoreline, water infiltration
into sanitary sewer and storm drain systems that outlet into or near the
Pacific Ocean, and an increase in storm drain back-ups. All of these effects
could result in more frequent and extensive flooding. Given Costa Mesa’s
location near the coast and along the Santa Ana River, the City could be
expected to experience the effects of sea level rise. As shown in Figure S-7,
Tsunami and Sea Level Rise Hazard Areas, by 2100 areas along the Santa Ana
River may be inundated by unimpeded Pacific Ocean water.
Key Hydrology/Drainage Issues
Localized Flooding
Localized flooding issues are largely addressed through the City’s Master
Drainage Plan. Local agencies, including Costa Mesa Public Works and the
County of Orange Flood Division, must formulate disaster preparedness plans
to guard against and respond to large storms that could bring widespread
flooding related issues.
Santa Ana River Flood Hazards and Sea Level Rise
Properties along the Santa Ana River are exposed to flood hazards associated
with major storm events, possible tsunamis, and longer-term effects of
unmitigated sea level rise.
Dam Inundation
Properties in the northern and western portions of the City lie within the
inundation paths of Santiago Creek and Prado Dams. The likelihood of dam
failure is very low, but cannot be discounted.

Aviation Hazards
John Wayne Airport, an international airport owned and operated by the
County of Orange, borders Costa Mesa on the east, between SR-73 and I-405.
The airport has two runways for commercial and private aircraft. In 2015, the
airport served 9,386,033 passengers and 269,189 aircraft movements.
Section 21675 of the Public Utilities Code requires that counties establish an
Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) to develop a comprehensive land use
plan for areas surrounding airports. These plans are to contain provisions
focused on protecting the public from the adverse effects of aircraft noise,
ensuring that people and facilities are not concentrated in areas with aircraft
accident potential, and ensuring that structures or activities do not adversely
affect navigable airspace. To fulfill the purpose of this plan, the Orange
County ALUC has adopted aircraft noise, ground safety, and height restriction
policies for land uses in the planning areas contained within the Airport
Environs Land Use Plan (AELUP) for John Wayne Airport. Per the AELUP, most
land uses and all buildings intended for human habitation are prohibited
within the Runway Protection Zone due to severe potential for loss of life and
property from accidents and aircraft operations. No portion of the City of
Costa Mesa lies within the Runway Protection Zone.
The Airport Safety Zone Reference Map, Figure S-8, John Wayne Airport Safety
Zones, establishes compatibility zones for different land uses and
development patterns, as described in Table S-1, Airport Basic Safety
Compatibility Qualities.
Key Aviation Hazards Issue
John Wayne Airport Safety and Emergency Response
As required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, the John
Wayne Airport must maintain plans for evacuation, handling of hazardous
materials, and emergency response. Infrastructure (e.g., fire stations and
sheriff substation) and personnel are all located onsite to serve this need. In
the event of an aviation hazard, pilots are instructed to navigate along
Newport Bay, away from residential or developed area. In the event of an
accident, response operations coordination of all available emergency services
personnel is to occur.

Emergency Protection and Response
Fire Protection
The Costa Mesa Fire Department operates six fire stations housing almost 100
professional and civilian members. The City’s fire stations are located at the
following addresses, as shown on Figure S-9, Public Safety Facilities and
Emergency Evacuation Routes:
        2803 Royal Palm Drive
        2300 Placentia Avenue
        800 Baker Street
        2450 Vanguard Way
        1865 Park Avenue
        3350 Sakioka Drive
The City’s Fire Department is responsible for community risk reduction, fire
prevention and education, enforcement of fire protection laws, fire
suppression, rescue, emergency medical services, hazardous materials
response, and weed abatement. The Fire Department seeks to balance
these various services through use of built-in fire protection, such as early
warning and detection systems, automatic fire sprinklers, fire-resistive design
of structures and materials, fire prevention inspections, and public education.
In addition, the Fire Department utilizes a variety of emergency planning and
preparation strategies to ensure the efficiency of fire and emergency services.
The Fire Department also participates in the Orange County emergency
warning system.

Safety Element
Wildland and Urban Fires
The fire hazard severity of an area is determined based on the type and
amount of vegetation (termed “fuel loading”), slope gradient, and weather.
Fire hazards increase in the summer and fall when the weather is hot and
dry—and especially when Santa Ana wind conditions occur. Areas identified as
having a fire hazard are referred to as State Responsibility Areas (SRAs)
because the State has the primary financial responsibility of preventing and
suppressing fires. The agency responsible for suppressing fires in SRAs is the
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). No part of Costa Mesa
is listed as an SRA or located within the Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone.
Thus, urban and grassland fires within open space areas (such as Talbert
Regional Park) represent the only fire risks in the City.
Emergency Medical Services
In addition to fire suppression, rescue, and community risk reduction duties,
the Fire Department provides emergency medical services to the community.
All fire engines in Costa Mesa double as paramedic engines and provide
advanced life support. The ladder trucks are staffed with emergency medical
technicians trained to provide basic life support. The program strives to satisfy
the goal of responding to 80 percent of emergency calls for service requests
within five minutes.
Police Protection
The primary responsibilities of the Costa Mesa Police Department are crime
prevention, field patrol, crime investigation, and traffic enforcement. Police
Department staff includes sworn officers and civilian support personnel. As of
2014, the ratio of police officers to civilians in Costa Mesa was one police
officer for every 1,000 persons.
The Police Department maintains headquarters at 99 Fair Drive in the Civic
Center and two substations located at:
         South Coast Plaza
         567 West 18th Street
The Police Department currently contracts with the Huntington Beach Police
Department for airborne law enforcement patrols and related services.

Emergency Response and Operations
The Costa Mesa Disaster Plan serves as the community’s Emergency
Operations Plan (EOP), which provides guidance during emergency situations
and natural disasters. The plan addresses potential large-scale disasters that
require a coordinated and immediate response.
The EOP identifies key personnel and agencies in the Costa Mesa Emergency
Management Organization that are organized to protect life and property
in the community. The EOP also identifies sources of outside support that
may be provided by State and federal agencies, the private sector, and
through mutual aid by other jurisdictions. In addition, the EOP specifies
emergency operations to be implemented during an emergency, assigns
responsibilities, and provides an explanation of how the plan is to be
administered. These activities involve a number of City departments and
facilities, including the Police Department, Fire Department, public health
officials, and care and shelter operations. The City’s emergency evacuation
routes are shown in Figure S-7, Public Facility Facilities and Emergency
Evacuation Routes.
The Police Chief coordinates all emergency evacuation activities and issues
evacuation orders based on information gathered from emergency experts.
Evacuation operations are also managed by law enforcement agencies,
highway/road/street departments, and public and private transportation
providers.
Terrorism/National Security Emergency
Since the terrorist incidents of September 11, 2001, and subsequent terrorist
events on U.S. soil, public concern regarding terrorist acts in the United States
has understandably increased. The State and federal governments have
established protocols and programs for dealing with the aftermath of a
terrorist act. In 2001, the State of California published the California Terrorism
Response Plan, which identifies and describes how the State and local
governments are to plan for and respond to terrorism incidents. The tasks
and responsibilities of emergency management are based on two terms: Crisis
Management and Consequence Management. Crisis Management refers to
the response to people committing an act of terrorism. Consequence
Management refers to the response to the potential or actual effects of
terrorism. According to the California Terrorism Response Plan, local
                              Costa Mesa General Plan | S-23

Safety Element
governments have primary responsibility for responding to an incident to
protect public health and safety (Consequence Management). The Costa
Mesa EOP is the City’s plan to ensure the most effective and economical
allocation of resources for the maximum benefit and protection of the civilian
population in time of emergency.
Key Emergency Protection and Response
Issues
Crime Prevention and Response
Costa Mesa has set high standards for public safety and protection. As a
result, it is one of the safest cities of its size in the nation. To maintain these
high levels of public safety, it will be important to continue to evaluate
programs, meet response time goals, and support crime prevention through
education and sensible project design practices.
City leaders have recognized that particular land uses and poorly maintained
properties create conditions conducive to criminal activity. By developing and
implementing targeted efforts among all City departments to address
problem properties and uses, the City can continue to demonstrate its
commitment to maintain community safety standards.
Fire and Medical Safety
The Costa Mesa Fire Department is the first responder to medical
emergencies. The request for emergency medical services is the most
common response made by the Fire Department, and service demands have
increased over time. As the City’s population ages and new residents and
employees locate in the City, adequate emergency medical response funding,
staffing, and station locations will continue to require focused attention.
Emergency and Disaster Preparedness
The City excels in preparing for emergency or natural disaster by having clear,
up-to-date plans to expedite response, together with ongoing public outreach
and education regarding emergency preparedness. Continuing these efforts
will mitigate adverse effects associated with natural and human-caused
catastrophes.

Hazardous Materials
Hazardous materials and chemicals are used daily by industries, businesses,
and residents. Hazardous material sources include service stations, medical
labs, drycleaners, and photo processing centers. Certain businesses may
generate larger quantities of hazardous waste, such as chemical
manufacturers and electroplating companies. In addition, commonly used
household products such as paints, cleaners, oils, batteries, and pesticides
contain potentially hazardous materials. Accidental spills or leaks, illegal
dumping of hazardous waste, illegal storage, or a transportation accident also
could release hazardous materials into the community.
The federal government and State of California require all businesses that
store hazardous materials in excess of specified quantities to report their
chemical inventories in a Hazardous Materials Management Plan. Businesses
are required to report releases of toxic chemicals into the air, water, and land,
as well as off-site transfers of waste to another location. Facilities that store
hazardous materials are also required to report on pollution prevention
activities and chemical recycling. All of these businesses operate under
stringent regulations governing the storage, use, manufacturing, and handling
of hazardous materials.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maintains and publishes a
database of properties that handle or produce hazardous materials. The EPA
defines a small quantity waste generator as one that produces between 100
and 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste per month. Small businesses like
drycleaners, auto repair shops, hospitals, and metal plating shops usually are
defined as generators of small quantities of hazardous waste. As of 2014,
approximately 245 small quantity generators operated in Costa Mesa. The
EPA defines a large quantity generator as a business that produces over 1,000
kilograms of hazardous waste per month. Large quantity generators include
large manufacturing facilities and businesses like chemical manufacturers. As
of 2014, 28 large quantity generators were located in Costa Mesa. In addition,
the City has four registered transporters of hazardous waste, five leaking
underground storage tanks, and one incident listed on the EPA’s Toxic Release
Inventory database.

Safety Element
Hazardous Waste Management
The Costa Mesa Fire Department is the first responder for any hazardous
material emergencies in the community. However, the City contracts with the
County of Orange Hazardous Materials Team to respond to major hazardous
materials emergencies. The City participates in a countywide interagency
coalition to better utilize the expertise and equipment that exists within all
participating fire districts. The City also adopted the Orange County
Hazardous Waste Management Plan to respond to chemical emergencies, and
utilizes collection centers operated by the County for residents to drop off
household hazardous waste items.
The Orange County Hazardous Waste Management Plan provides policy
direction and action programs to address hazardous waste management
issues that require local responsibility. The plan analyzes long-term hazardous
waste generation and focuses on the development of programs to equitably
site needed hazardous waste management facilities. The plan promotes on-
site resource reduction, treatment, and recycling of hazardous materials; and
provides for the collection and treatment of small quantity hazardous waste
generators. Another important plan component is the monitoring of
hazardous waste management facilities to ensure compliance with federal and
State regulations.
Key Hazardous Materials Issues
Release of Hazards Materials
The release of explosive, reactive, corrosive, toxic, and flammable materials
poses a hazard to life and property and may necessitate evacuations. Federal,
State, and local laws, plans, and programs are well in place to guard against
upset. Emergency plans and trained personnel provide the most appropriate
response to hazardous materials emergencies.

Chapter 9:
Community Design Element
           Introduction
           Costa Mesa understands the value of promoting and creating a cohesive
           community and unique civic identity. Costa Mesa supports and nurtures
           smaller communities and districts within the City that seek to establish and
           retain their unique sense of place. This is accomplished by establishing a
           policy framework for design standards and guidelines the City will use to
           review development applications, as well as standards the City will set for the
           public realm. These policy directives will ensure that continued investment in
           our community will enhance vitality, context, form, and function.
           In Costa Mesa, the public realm is characterized by streetscapes (trees,
           medians, parkways, benches, lights, signage, etc.). The private realm refers to
           building architecture, site planning, private landscaping, and business signage.
           The positive identity, functionality, and aesthetic of the City and its
                                       Costa Mesa General Plan | CD-1
Community Design Element
constituent communities are elevated by interweaving the design of the
public and private realms.
Purpose
The Community Design Element promotes quality design for every aspect of a
community, such as buildings, structures, paths, corridors, districts, nodes,
landmarks, natural features, and significant landscaping. It ensures each
development in the private or public realm enhances the sense of place for
the City, district, and the site itself. The goals, objectives, and policies in this
element aim to express the City’s parameters for quality design and
development. While this element does not dictate specific design guidelines,
it does provide policies to ensure projects meet the community’s expectations
for quality design and development.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The policies of the Community Design Element relate primarily to the policies
in the Land Use and Open Space and Recreation Elements. Foremost, this
element establishes the three-dimensional built form projection of land use
objectives.
Baseline Conditions-2015
The main elements of Costa Mesa’s physical environment include major paths
and corridors; districts; entries, internal, and activity nodes; destination and
landmarks; and edges. These elements contribute to the urban form and
character of the City. They identify how visitors observe information about
the City and understand their physical surroundings.
Paths and Corridors
Paths are passages (streets and sidewalks) that people use to get from one
place to another. A path provides for vehicular and pedestrian movement
within the community. Costa Mesa has three major types of paths: Primary
Paths, Secondary Paths, and Corridors. Primary Paths are the circulation
CD-2 | Costa Mesa General Plan

                                    Community Design Element
passages that carry large volumes of traffic and typically cross community
boundaries. Secondary Paths carry reduced traffic volumes and often
originate or terminate within the City limits. Corridors are paths or sections of
paths that have a concentration of a special use or activity. Figure CD-1
identifies the location of Primary and Secondary Paths. The specific corridors
are discussed below and presented in Figure CD-2.
Harbor Boulevard Corridor
Harbor Boulevard, which extends from Costa Mesa to the City of Anaheim,
serves as a primary commercial corridor, with a mix of vehicle-oriented uses,
auto dealerships, neighborhood commercial centers, entertainment uses, and
residences. The Land Use Element provides for the south end of the Harbor
Boulevard corridor to transition to a mixed-use district.
East 17th Street Corridor
The East 17th Street corridor, while auto oriented, has a distinctive
neighborhood feel. This corridor is characterized by small businesses and
multi-tenant retail centers, restaurants, and offices that largely serve local
residents.
North Newport Boulevard Corridor
This section of Newport Boulevard parallels SR-55 from I-405 south to where
SR-55 ends at 19th Street. Prior to construction of SR-55, Newport Boulevard
was the primary corridor leading through Costa Mesa into Newport Beach,
and its historic character as a tourist-oriented travel route is evident in the
motels and auto-oriented uses lining the corridor. While residential uses have
been developed as infill with extension of SR-55, the predominant character is
that of a commercial corridor.
South Newport Boulevard Corridor
Newport Boulevard continues south from 19th Street to 15th Street into
Newport Beach. This section of Newport Boulevard has a strong pedestrian
scale and commercial character, with retail frontage on the east side of
Newport Boulevard directly abutting the sidewalk and the larger shopping
centers on the west side of Newport Boulevard providing extensive
infrastructure for the accommodation and movement of pedestrians on and
off, and through the sites. Despite the breadth of Newport Boulevard and the
volume this arterial supports, the collection of businesses creates a strong
concentration of active uses.

Bristol Street Corridor
Bristol Street stretches between the Sunflower Avenue and SR-55. Located in
this corridor are two unique shopping and entertainment centers: The CAMP
and the LAB, which the developer/operator has defined as “anti-mall” venues.
These unique centers provide small retail and restaurant spaces for start-up
and edgy businesses, together with indoor-outdoor social areas. The CAMP
has a central green gathering area surrounded by shopping, dining, and styling
businesses. The operators regularly host art, film, and music events.
Anton Boulevard Corridor
Anton Boulevard extends from Sunflower Avenue to Bristol Street, with an
entrance to South Coast Plaza. This corridor is a fusion of luxury apartments
and hotels, combined with professional headquarters and multi-tenant office
spaces in mid-rise settings. This includes the Experian Headquarters, Metro
Center at South Coast Office complex, Plaza Tower, the Enclave Apartments,
the Westin South Coast Plaza, and Costa Mesa Marriott Hotel. To the north of
this corridor, the 3400 Avenue of the Arts apartment complex and Wyndham
Hotel are within walking distance to these major regional shopping and
business destinations. The Noguchi Garden (a 1.6-acre public art project) sits
to the south of the corridor. A new, 250-unit luxury apartment complex is
under construction within this corridor that will provide additional housing.
John Wayne Airport Industrial Corridor
This corridor runs through the industrial district that abuts John Wayne
Airport. While this district contains multiple secondary businesses that
support the airport, the center of this corridor supports a much wider
collection of industrial and offices uses. The scale is predominantly vehicular.
Major uses include educational and religious institutions, wholesale and
specialty service for automobiles, small, light industrial spaces for startup
businesses, boutique manufacturing, and supporting services.
Placentia Industrial Corridor
This is the major industrial corridor within the Westside district of the City,
which encompasses Placentia Avenue south of Victoria Street and north of
West 16th Street. This corridor historically was an enclave for yacht
manufacturing. While this industry and automobile service still have a
presence, new tenants along the corridor are that of action sports
development and manufacturing. Development of live/work units for the
CD-6 | Costa Mesa General Plan

                                    Community Design Element
creatives who find this edgy environment and its proximity to industry
suitable for their business and lifestyles has added new vibrancy. While this
location will remain an industrial center, the boutique manufacturing,
entrepreneurial environment, and action sports industry niches make it a
unique corridor.
Fairview Park Corridor
As Placentia Avenue continues north of Victoria Street, this industrial corridor
transitions into a residential one. The corridor provides access to several
residential communities, as well as access to Estancia High School, Fairview
Park, and Estancia Park, which is home of the oldest building in Costa Mesa,
the Diego Sepulveda Adobe. Along this stretch of Placentia Avenue, residential
and institutional uses represent the only development types from Victoria
Street to Adams Avenue.
West 19th Street Corridor
This corridor supports a diverse mix of uses that include destination locations
(public parks, amenities, and the Senior Center) and an array of local services
to meet the needs of residential communities around this corridor. West 19th
Street includes an eclectic collection of commercial uses which predominantly
address the corridor at a pedestrian scale. Mixed-use development would
continue the character and vision of this central commercial corridor, which
will continue to transition.
Civic Center Corridor
Fair Drive from Newport Boulevard to Fairview Road and Fairview Road from
Fair Drive to Adams Avenue accommodate one of the densest collections of
civic, institutional, and educational uses in Orange County. Within a mere 1.5
miles, you find Orange Coast Community College, Costa Mesa High School, the
Orange County Fair & Event Center, Vanguard University, Civic Center Park,
the Jack R. Hammett Sports Complex, and the Civic Center. This corridor
provides a collection of uses of great civic pride that benefit students who
attend one of the many educational facilities along the corridor.
South Coast Corridor
This corridor spans from the South Coast Plaza on the east to the South Coast
Collection on the west. It links two major commercial destinations and
provides access to Metro Pointe at South Coast Plaza. This location has
                             Costa Mesa General Plan | CD-7
Community Design Element
opportunity for further growth and development, as it abuts several of the
few remaining large, vacant lots in Costa Mesa.
Santa Ana Residential Corridor
Santa Ana Avenue is a residential corridor that runs through the Eastside
District; development along this corridor consists largely of low- and medium-
density housing, with a few traditional single-family subdivisions taking direct
access. The grid-like and elongated spatial layout of the Eastside District
makes Santa Ana Avenue a major path of travel for various modes of
transportation heading north or south. This residential corridor remains
residential all the way into Newport Beach.
Districts
Districts are those areas of Costa Mesa that have an identifiable character due
to building architecture, neighborhood design, streetscape, and land use. A
district is an integral part of a larger urban area, with common characteristics
that make it unique from other areas of the community. Distinguishing
features may include building type, use, activity, and/or topography. Figure
CD-3: Districts illustrates these districts’ fuzzy boundaries. Specific
descriptions of these districts are provided below.
Eastside
The district contains a mix of single-family and multifamily homes on large
lots. Many neighborhoods have experienced substantial private
redevelopment, with the original homes replaced by larger homes. In other
areas, developers have purchased properties, torn down the original
residence(s), and built townhomes or small-lot developments. The Land Use
Element discusses issues associated with this district related to the typical
narrow, deep lots and lot consolidation.
Westside
This area is characterized by a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial
uses. The Westside District is also the origin and home for the action sports
industry which incubated and matured within Costa Mesa. This district
includes a variety of traditional housing, as well as non-traditional live/work
developments that support the edgy creatives who desire to live in this
confluence of production, design, and manufacturing uses.

Mesa Verde
Mesa Verde has an eclectic mix of residential densities and housing types.
Homes closer to the Mesa Verde Golf Course are much larger and at lower
residential densities than those closer to Harbor Boulevard and I-405. The
commercial uses along Adams Avenue and Harbor Boulevard provide the
personal service uses and retail and food spaces for residents living in this
district.
College Park
The homes within this district are a mix of residential densities and
architectural types. The majority of the units are higher residential density
complexes located along Newport Boulevard, Wilson Street, and Victoria
Street. This district also includes College Park, an older single-family
residential tract.
Mesa del Mar
This district contains mostly single-family residential tracts, with higher
residential densities near arterial roadways. Pockets of commercial uses have
been developed along Baker Street.
SoBECA
This district consists of programmatic spaces that allow for experiential
shopping and dining activities at the LAB and the CAMP. It is a unique area in
transition, with a variety of residential housing options encircling multiple
destination locations, including microbreweries, nightclubs, “anti-malls”,
hotels, and artisanal restaurants.
North Costa Mesa
This district is the major economic heart of the City. South Coast Plaza and
other commercial and office establishments provide shopping, entertainment,
hospitality, and high-rise office space that serve local, regional, national, and
international markets. Key developments include Plaza Tower, Center Tower,
South Coast Metro Center, South Coast Metro Pointe, South Coast Repertory,
and the Segerstrom Center for the Arts. This district is Costa Mesa’s primary
commercial and cultural center. The residential areas in this district include
mostly single-family residential neighborhoods, with some multi-family
developments as well.

                                                                      Community Design Element
                                 Theatre Arts District
                                 This well-defined district exhibits a collection of the finest theatrical venues in
                                 Orange County. This rare clustering of art venues consists of the South Coast
                                 Repertory Theater, as well as the Segerstrom Center for the Arts, which
                                 consist of five venues: Renee and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall, Samueli
                                 Theater, Segerstrom Hall, Judy Morr Theater, and the Arts Plaza. The Theater
                                 Arts District provides access to art with art installations throughout the
                                 district, including the Noguchi Garden and the Orange County Museum of Art.
                                 Supporting uses include several professional office towers such as the Center
                                 Tower and Plaza Tower, the two tallest buildings in Costa Mesa.
South Coast Plaza is located in
  the North Costa Mesa district.
                                 Downtown/Triangle
                                 The Triangle is located at one of the busiest intersections in Costa Mesa,
                                 where Newport Boulevard and Harbor Boulevard intersect. The Triangle is an
                                 activity hub intended to draw both local and regional visitors. It sits in the
                                 heart of Costa Mesa’s downtown, which runs along Newport Boulevard and
                                 19th Street. This area includes a variety of pedestrian scale retail spaces, fine
                                 restaurants, a movie theatre, and nightclubs.
                                 Harbor Gateway
                                 This district is characterized by large-sized industrial and office buildings,
                                 including the Automobile Club and Whittier Law School. It is vehicular in scale
                                 and has an office park character, with ample landscaping and large multi-story
                                 building complexes. In 2015, Vans acquired an office building in this district to
                                 become the corporate headquarters of one of the nation’s top lifestyle
                                 retailers.

Airport Industrial/Business Park
John Wayne Airport is located in unincorporated Orange County, just east of
Costa Mesa. Given the presence of the airport and abutting freeways, this
location provides industrial and office space with excellent access and
circulation. Land uses within this area are industrial, office, and commercial in
nature, housed in low-scale buildings due to the presence of the airport.
Civic Center District
This area is the primary cultural, educational, and civic center district of Costa
Mesa. The OC Fair & Event Center, which includes the OC Fairgrounds, Pacific
Amphitheatre, OC Marketplace, and Centennial Farm in addition to the Civic
Center and Orange Coast College, represents major institutional uses that
encompass significant open spaces and active recreation area. Vanguard
University, adjacent to the Civic Center, includes private open spaces on the
campus.
Nodes
A “node” is an important point where people gather and/or where paths
converge, thus providing higher-than-typical levels of activity. Costa Mesa has
three classifications of nodes:
    1) Entry nodes, which function as focal points of identity between Costa
         Mesa and adjacent cities
CD-12 | Costa Mesa General Plan

                                    Community Design Element
     2)   Internal nodes, which identify locations of two major converging
         paths and destinations
     3) Activity nodes, which are focal points of highest activity, provide
         immediate access to destination locations, and/or have a
         concentration of specialty uses
All of these nodes are identified and displayed on Figure CD-4: Nodes.
Destinations and Landmarks
A “destination” is a particular use which generates special purpose trips and
increases regional attraction. A destination can be a successful retail cluster or
rare specialty use. Destination locations are shown on Figure CD-5:
Destinations and Landmarks.
A “landmark” is a physical element that provides a point of reference or
serves as a community identity marker. A landmark can be a structure, space,

Edges
Edges are linear elements that serve as a visual or physical boundary, barrier,
or transition between districts and that define the boundaries of a place.
Elements such as freeways, flood channels, natural features and landforms
may be considered edges (See Figure CD-6: Edges). Edges within or abutting
Costa Mesa include:
         Santa Ana River
         San Diego Freeway (I-405)

Public Realm Focus
The public realm focuses on the physical features and design that occurs on
public rights-of-way, including public streets, sidewalks, medians, parks, and
other public spaces. These spaces provide efficient and aesthetically pleasing
paths and corridors, create context for existing districts, soften existing edges,
provide access to destinations and landmarks, and enrich all nodes
throughout the City. The City has adopted streetscape and median
development standards designed to build a public realm that is aesthetically
pleasing and creates efficient paths throughout the City. This also includes the
development and maintenance of welcoming signs at entry nodes and way-
finding signs at internal and activity nodes.

                                Pacific Ocean, the coastline creates a distinctive visual background.
                                Views of the Pacific coast enhance the visual quality of districts within
                                the viewshed.
                               Talbert Regional Park and its extensive natural areas provide an
                                important visual reminder of the local landscape prior to urbanization
                                and create a soft western edge of the City.
                               Fairview Park works together with Talbert Regional Park to soften the
                                urban landscape. The park’s trails and recreational facilities are a
                                community strength.
Fairview Park includes
 expansive open spaces
    accessible by trails.
                               Neighborhood parks and the golf courses provide open spaces and
                                recreational opportunities.
                               South Coast Plaza, The Triangle, and the OC Fair & Event Center are
                                major visual landmarks.
                               The Segerstrom Center for the Arts and South Coast Repertory
                                provide focal points for the local performing arts community and
                                serve as a major culture and arts hub for all of Orange County.
                               The Santa Ana River’s strength is a potential enhanced water
                                resource. It offers recreation along the multiuse trail that extends
                                along the western edge of the City.

Design Opportunities
     Streetscape enhancements in the public realm can contribute
      significantly to improving and maintaining the visual quality of major
      arterial and secondary arterial streets through implementation of the
      City’s Streetscape and Median Development Guidelines. The
      Guidelines include a comprehensive street tree palette and
      development standards.
     Improve the design of signs along major corridors and the public
      realm by adopting sign design guidelines and putting in place
      incentives for the removal of nonconforming signs.
     Continue to add new gateway treatments at City entry nodes.
     Continue to implement adopted specific plans, urban plans, design
      guidelines, and other policy documents that contribute to the design
      quality of new development.
     Consider preparation of design guidelines for new developments
      along major corridors and the public realm to ensure that such
      development contribute to the overall enhancement of Costa Mesa’s
      image.

                                     Community Design Element
Key Issues
Lack of Visual Interest
Overall, Costa Mesa lacks a strong visual image in terms of definition as a
distinct place. Some of the districts lack a clear identity that distinguishes
them from other areas in the City. Districts should be unified through design
approaches. Paths are challenged by sign clutter, blank walls, and absence of
streetscape amenities. Commercial paths should have a unified identity that
promotes a positive image of the City. More emphasis should be given to
enhancing the image of neighborhoods that lack sufficient visual interest in
building elevations, massing, landscaping, and lighting. Natural viewsheds are
not optimized.
Residential Transition and Neighborhood Character
Within the Eastside Residential District, the transition of properties from
single-story homes on large lots (with architectural styles dating to the 1950s
and ‘60s) to two-story houses, as well as townhome developments, has
changed the character of many neighborhoods. Some long-time residents
have remarked that residential densities, building architecture, and massing
that define the overall character of the district should be preserved.
Lack of Corridor Continuity
Harbor Boulevard lacks continuity of visual quality and has multiple identities.
The commercial path is fragmented and contains a mix of land uses with no
identifiable character. Even though new landscape medians have been
installed, in several areas in the City, landscaping remains substandard along
many stretches. Along many of the City’s commercial corridors, inconsistent
sign styles, colors, and sizes create visual obstructions and clutter.
Entry Nodes
The multiple entry nodes to Costa Mesa do not effectively announce arrival
into Costa Mesa. The City’s signage needs a conceptual redesign and
evaluation of the most effective approach to entrance signage into the City.
Entry nodes in need of signage enhancement include Newport Boulevard/15th
Street, Bristol Street/Sunflower Avenue, and East 17th Street/Irvine Avenue.
Industrial Properties
Industrial uses, particularly on the west side of the City, occupy prominent
locations with proximity to the coast. Some industrial uses are adequately
                           Costa Mesa General Plan | CD-21

Community Design Element
maintained or participate in valued industrial niches like the Westside’s action
sports industry. These businesses require this proximity to effectively conduct
business. Screening and rehabilitation should be implemented in a strategic
manor so as to not negatively impact this area’s successful industrial niches
and continue to support the maturing trend of creative enhancement to
industrial districts.

Goals, Objectives, and Policies
Physical elements such as landscaping, architecture, signs, streets, and open
spaces collectively form Costa Mesa’s visual environment and character.
Through the implementation of these goals, objectives, and policies, the City
aims to gradually improve the visual environment and character of Costa
Mesa to achieve the high level of quality desired.

                        pilasters, masonry, or wrought iron, and should
                        integrate tiered plantings to soften their appearance.
Policy CD-1.4           Promote a consistent landscape character along City
                        streets to reinforce the unique qualities of each
                        corridor and district, including the development of
                        landscaped medians. Support implementation of the
                        recommended street tree palette for each City street,
                        as identified in the City of Costa Mesa Streetscape
                        and Median Development Guidelines.
Policy CD-1.5           Encourage electric and communication lines to be
                        placed underground and electrical substations and
                        telephone facilities to be screened to minimize visual
                        impacts from sidewalks, streets, and adjacent
                        properties. Support utility undergrounding through
                        conditions of project approval, preparation of
                        undergrounding plans, and the formation of
                        assessment districts.
Objective CD-1B.        Encourage clear connections between districts within
                        the City.
Policy CD-1.6           Promote linkages between separate districts using
                        bike trails, pedestrian paths, common medians or
                        parkway landscaping, and other location-appropriate
                        physical improvements. Through conditions of
                        approval, public improvement projects, and other
                        measures, support development of new connections

                         designed in architectural styles that reflect the City’s
                         eclectic quality, yet are compatible in scale and
                         character with existing buildings and the natural
                         surroundings within residential neighborhoods.
                         Continue to update and maintain the Costa Mesa

Policy CD-7.2            Preserve the character and scale of Costa Mesa’s
                         established residential neighborhoods where
                         possible; when new residential development is
                         proposed, encourage that the new structures are
                         consistent with the prevailing character of existing
                         development in the immediate vicinity, and that new
                         development does not have a substantial adverse
                         impact on adjacent areas.
Objective CD-7B.         Encourage the use of native plant palettes in the
                         creation of landscaping plans used to establish a
                         sense of place in neighborhood identification efforts.
Policy CD-7.3            Ensure that California native plants are used to
                         support the local ecology and save water. Develop
                         landscaping guidelines that reflect the local
                         community.
Goal CD-8: Quality Commercial
Development
Achieve a high level of design quality for commercial development.
Objective CD-8A.         Encourage a high level of architectural and site
                         design quality.
Policy CD-8.1            Require that new and remodeled commercial
                         development be designed to reflect architectural
                         diversity, yet be compatible with the scale and
                         character of the district.
Policy CD-8.2            Use distinctive commercial architectural styles to
                         reinforce a positive sense of place. Commercial
                         architectural design elements and materials must be
                         of high quality and style as well as suitable for long-
                         term maintenance. Consistent architectural design

                              areas. Promote pedestrian amenities.
                Policy CD-8.4 Ensure that common areas, walkways, driveways, and
                              parking spaces be landscaped consistent with
                              landscaping standards contained in the Planning,
                              Zoning, and Development Code. Utilize landscaping to

                              equipment areas. Landscaped areas generally should
                              incorporate planting utilizing a three-tiered system: 1)
                              grasses and ground covers, 2) shrubs and vines, and 3)
                              trees.
                Policy CD-8.5 Ensure that site access, parking, and circulation for
                              commercial uses are designed in a logical, safe
                              manner. Parking should not dominate the site in areas
                              adjacent to street, and should be well landscaped
                              with a clear hierarchy of circulation. Wherever
                              possible, parking lots should be divided into a series
                              of connected smaller lots utilizing walkways and
                              raised landscape strips. Parking lots should also
                              include landscaping that accents the importance of
                              driveways from the street, frames the major
                              circulation aisles, and highlights pedestrian pathways.

Policy CD-8.6   Require that areas for outside equipment, trash
                receptacles, storage, and loading areas be located in
                the least conspicuous part of the site. Utility and
                mechanical equipment (e.g. electric and gas meters,
                electrical panels, and junction boxes) should be
                concealed from view from public streets, neighboring
                properties, and nearby higher buildings. Trash
                enclosures should be architecturally compatible with
                the project. Landscaping should be incorporated into
                the design of trash enclosures to deter graffiti.
Policy CD-8.7   Encourage decorative paving treatments to be
                incorporated throughout commercial developments,
                including driveway entries, pedestrian walkways,
                plazas, and other areas. The design, materials, and
                colors of decorative paving treatments (e.g., stamped
                concrete, stone, brick or granite pavers, exposed
                aggregate, or colored concrete) should complement
                the architectural style of the primary buildings and
                make a positive contribution to the aesthetic and
                function of the site.
Policy CD-8.8   Require that exterior lighting on commercial
                properties be consistent with the architectural style of
                the commercial building. On each commercial site, all
                lighting fixtures should be from the same family of
                fixtures with respect to design, materials, color,
                fixture, and color of light. Lighting sources should be
                shielded, diffused or indirect to avoid spillover on
                adjacent properties, nighttime sky light pollution, and
                glare to pedestrians and motorists. To minimize the
                total number of freestanding light standards, wall-
                mounted and pathway lights should be utilized to the
                greatest extent possible.
Objective CD-8B Preserve the scale and character of established
                neighborhoods near commercial uses.
Policy CD-8.9   Ensure that new commercial development utilize site
                planning and design features that optimize
                compatibility with adjacent residential
                neighborhoods. The following guidance should be
                considered:

                       When adjacent residential and nonresidential uses
                        can mutually benefit from connection, appropriate
                        linkages (e.g., walkways, common landscape areas,
                        and building orientation) are encouraged. Successful
                        interaction between commercial and residential uses
                        may be achieved through adequate setbacks,
                        landscape buffers, screening, decorative masonry
                        walls, berms, building orientation, and limitations of
                        commercial activities.
                       Loading areas, access and circulation driveways, trash
                        and storage areas, and rooftop equipment should be
                        located as far as possible from adjacent residences.
                       Building orientation and landscaping of commercial
                        buildings should minimize direct lines of sight into
                        adjacent residential private open space.
Goal CD-9: Mixed Use
Promote development of mixed-use projects that seamlessly integrate
multiple uses both functionally and aesthetically.
Objective CD-9A         Design mixed use development projects to achieve a
                        high quality character.
Policy CD-9.1           Require that mixed-use development projects be
                        designed to mitigate potential conflicts between uses.
                        Consider noise, lighting, and security.
Policy CD-9.2           Provide adequate parking, open space and
                        recreational facilities to serve residents in mixed-use
                        development projects. Design parking and other areas
                        to acknowledge different users (residents versus
                        shoppers) and to be compatible with the architectural
                        character of the building(s).

                           uses.
Policy CD-9.4         Encourage the development of mixed-use urban villages
                      along specified areas of West 17th Street, West 19th
                      Street, and Superior Avenue that integrates residential
                      with office, retail, business services, personal services,
                      public spaces and uses, and other community amenities in
                      a single building (vertical mixed-use development) or in
                      proximity on the same site (horizontal mixed-use

Policy CD-9.5         Promote new types of urban housing that could be target-
                      marketed to people seeking alternative housing choices in
                      proximity to a major commercial area.
Policy CD-9.6         Support efforts to mix compatible uses and activities.
                      Encourage the siting of community-oriented services,
                      businesses, and amenities in and near mixed-use
                      neighborhoods, including schools, libraries, open space,
                      and parks.
Goal CD-10: Industrial and Business Parks
Promote quality design approaches for the redevelopment of existing
industrial buildings, encourage the design to incorporate or provide flexibility
for the needs of emerging types of industrial uses, and strive to match design
with overall character of nodes, corridors, or districts if applicable.
Objective CD-10A           Require that industrial and business park projects
                           meet high-quality design standards.
Policy CD-10.1             Require that industrial projects be designed to convey
                           visual interest and a positive image. Architectural
                           qualities and design elements encouraged for
                           industrial uses are:
                                 Building modulation indentations and
                                  architectural details

Community Design Element
                       Landscaping to soften building exteriors and to
                        serve as a buffer between uses
Policy CD-10.2   Encourage that the design of industrial buildings
                 considers the visual and physical relationship to
                 adjacent uses. An industrial structure which
                 dominates its surrounding environment by its relative
                 size shall generally be discouraged.
Policy CD-10.3   Encourage adaptive reuse of existing industrial
                 structures which results in rehabilitated buildings with
                 distinctive and attractive architecture.
Policy CD-10.4   Promote the use of materials and colors that produce
                 diversity and visual interest in industrial buildings. The
                 use of various siding materials (i.e., masonry, concrete
                 texturing, cement, or plaster) can produce effects of
                 texture and relief that provide architectural interest.
Policy CD-10.5   Require that landscaping be used to define areas such
                 as entrances to industrial buildings and parking lots;
                 define the edges of developments; provide transition
                 between neighboring properties; and provide
                 screening for outdoor storage, loading, and
                 equipment areas. Landscaping should be in scale with
                 adjacent buildings and be of an appropriate size at
                 maturity to accomplish its intended purpose.
Policy CD-10.6   Require that the design of lighting fixtures and their
                 structural support be of a scale and architectural
                 design compatible with on-site industrial buildings.
                 Large areas should be illuminated to minimize the
                 visual impact and amount of spillover light onto
                 surrounding projects.
Objective CD-10B Ensure that the development of industrial projects
                 are positive additions to the City’s community setting
                 and do not result in adverse impacts with adjacent
                 uses.
Policy CD-10.7   Require industrial projects to incorporate landscape
                 setbacks, screening walls, and/or other elements that
                 mitigate negative impacts with adjacent uses.
Policy CD-10.8   Protect transitional areas between industrial and
                 other uses.

Goal CD-11: Attractive Signs that Reflect
Costa Mesa
Ensure that signs contribute positively to Costa Mesa’s image and overall
economic development.
Objective CD-11A         Facilitate the installation of signs that contribute to
                         a positive image of the public realm.
Policy CD-11.1           Encourage homeowners' associations and
                         neighborhoods to maintain housing tract entrance
                         signs in an attractive condition, and encourage the
                         placement of such signs at the entrance of major
                         developments which do not have such identification.
Policy CD-11.2           Encourage the use of common design elements in
                         signs for commercial and industrial centers through
                         the development of planned sign programs to
                         improve center identity by publicizing the benefits of
                         such programs to developers and local business
                         operators.
Policy CD-11.3           Encourage citywide sign design guidelines that
                         promote creativity and flexibility while upholding
                         design quality. Design guidelines could include the
                         design and placement of business signs, public street
                         graphics, street signs, locational and directional signs,
                         traffic signs, etc.
Policy CD-11.4           Introduce distinctive entry signage within the Costa
                         Mesa Streetscape and Median Development
                         Guidelines which effectively announces arrival to
                         unique districts and neighborhoods.
Policy CD-11.5           Develop and design signage that helps with way-
                         finding throughout the City so visitors and residents
                         can easily access destination locations and identify
                         landmarks.

Open Space and Recreation
Element
            Introduction
            Open spaces, recreation programs, and cultural arts contribute significantly to
            the quality of life in Costa Mesa. With its high-quality park facilities and
            comprehensive community service programs, Costa Mesa offers many
            opportunities for residents and visitors to practice healthy living and engage
            in community-building activities.
            Parks and community-serving facilities enhance the quality of life for residents
            and are important components of complete and sustainable neighborhoods.
            Accessible parks provide places to play, exercise, spend time with friends and
            neighbors, or just relax and reflect. This Open Space and Recreation Element
            provides the policy framework to ensure that open space and recreation
                                       Costa Mesa General Plan | OSR-1
Open Space and Recreation Element
resources in the City are preserved and maintained. Open space in Costa
Mesa includes neighborhood and community parks, County-owned regional
recreation facilities, institutional land uses, and golf courses.
Purpose
The purpose of the Open Space and Recreation Element is to sustain the
network of open space and recreation resources for today’s residents and
future generations. The goals, policies, and objectives contained in this
element aim to protect, maintain, and enhance open spaces for all purposes
and to meet recreation needs. This also describes how Costa Mesa can
promote the City’s identity as a “City of the Arts”.
Recreational Sites and Facilities
Costa Mesa’s inventory of open space and recreation resources includes a
diversity of facilities, ranging from highly developed, active recreation sites to
low-activity, passive open spaces. The existing network of open space and
recreation facilities is illustrated in Figure OSR-1, Recreational Sites and
Facilities, and inventoried in Table OSR-1, Parks and Open Space Inventory.

Neighborhood and Community Parks
The neighborhood and community park system represents the foundation of
Costa Mesa’s open space and recreation network. Approximately 415 acres of
developed neighborhood and community parks provide places for residents
and visitors to enjoy themselves. As shown in Table OSR-2, Neighborhood and
Community Parks Inventory, Costa Mesa has 25 neighborhood parks and
seven community parks. These parks are shown on Figure OSR-1. The largest
City-owned park is Fairview Park, encompassing approximately 210 acres. The
smallest park is 0.18-acre Shalimar Park. Parks within the City are classified
based on size. The classification system is as follows.
        Neighborhood Parks. Neighborhood parks are 10 acres or smaller in
         size and are intended to serve the daily recreational needs of
         residents in the immediate park vicinity. Primary uses include passive
         and active open space, tot lots, and picnic facilities. Community
         gardens are also included under this classification.
        Community Parks. Community parks are 10 acres or larger in size and
         are intended to provide a wide variety of recreation amenities,
         including lighted athletic fields and courts and other wide-serving
         recreational uses.
Fairview Park
Fairview Park is the largest park in the City encompassing approximately 210
acres. This passive open space consists of bluffs, vernal pools, trails, native
plant communities, and wildlife. Park visitors can also enjoy special events
that occur at the park, as well as take a train ride on the Goat Hill Junction
Model Railroad.
In 1998, the City Council approved the Fairview Park Master Plan. Pursuant to
the Master Plan, a series of improvements to wetland and riparian habitats
were accomplished consisting of enhancement of 17 acres of riparian habitat,
rehabilitation of ponds and streams, and installation of a new irrigation
system. In 2013, the City restored six acres of wetland ponds, five acres of
native grasslands, three acres of native oak trees, and nine acres of coastal
sage scrub habitat.

                                                        Open Space and Recreation Element
    Fairview Park encompasses
    over 200 acres of open space
           and passive park areas
consisting of bluffs, vernal pools,
trails, native plant communities,
   and wildlife. Park visitors also
 can enjoy community events, fly
  model aircrafts, or take a train
         ride at Goat Hill Junction
                 Railroad Station.
                                    In April 2013, the Costa Mesa City Council voted to reconvene the Fairview
                                    Park Citizens Advisory Committee (FPAC) to examine several issues regarding
                                    the park, and to evaluate the Fairview Park Master Plan relative to the City’s
                                    needs. Based on those needs, the FPAC will recommend the addition,
                                    reduction, elimination, and modification of park uses and master-planned
                                    elements. As part of the citywide Open Space Master Plan of Parks and
                                    Recreation initiated in 2015, the community will be engaged in further
                                    discussion of improvement plans for Fairview Park.
                                    Costa Mesa Community Gardens
                                    Community gardens provide opportunities for Costa Mesa residents to
                                    nurture their physical and social health. As of 2015, the City managed two
                                    community gardens. The Del Mar Community Garden has 60 plots, each
                                    measuring 15 feet by 15 feet. Hamilton Community Garden has 42 plots with
                                    the same dimensions. The City rents garden plots to residents to grow
                                    vegetables, flowers, fruits, and plants for personal consumption. Both
                                    community gardens are immensely popular and have long waiting lists for
                                    new urban farmers to participate.

Institutional Uses
Costa Mesa is home to many public schools, a community college, and a
private university—as well as the OC Fair & Event Center—that have open
space and recreational facilities. While not all facilities are available for public
recreational use, the inventory of institutional uses is considerable. These
facilities contribute substantially to the citywide open space and recreation
inventory, and can augment open space provided by the neighborhood and
community park system. Although not a party to the use-agreements
between schools and sports leagues, the City does provide support to
community organizations seeking joint-use agreements and improvements to
school sites. Table OSR-3, School Recreational Facilities, identifies institutional
facilities located within the City, operated by the Newport-Mesa Unified
School District (NMUSD).
As of 2015, the Newport-Mesa Unified School District facilities included 32
utility fields and 18 baseball/softball diamonds. The City utilizes NMUSD
elementary and middle school facilities for after-school programs, and all
elementary, middle, and high school athletic fields, with the exception of Jim
Scott Stadium, for youth and adult sports programming.

OC Fair & Event Center
In the late 1940s, the State of California obtained the current fairgrounds
property, formerly occupied by the Santa Ana Army Air Base, and used the
fairgrounds for over 60 years. In 2010, the County of Orange acquired the site
from the State, with the core objective to preserve and promote the
fairground and event uses. The OC Fair & Event Center is a major
entertainment, recreational, cultural, and educational asset to Orange
County. In addition to the OC Fair, which occurs every summer, over 100
events occur every year supporting cultural and nonprofit organizations, and
attracting over 4.1 million visitors annually.
                                                                               Centennial Farm is a three-acre

Costa Mesa Tennis Center
The Costa Mesa Tennis Center is located in TeWinkle Park at 880 Junipero
Drive. This special use facility includes twelve lighted courts, fifty-five parking
spaces, landscaped walkways, and a pro-shop with professional tennis staff.
The Costa Mesa Tennis Center offers lessons, tournaments, leagues, open
play, and monthly classes and activities to participants of all ages.
Costa Mesa Skate Park
Built in 2005, the Costa Mesa Skate Park is open daily to skate boarders and
inline skaters of all ages. The 15,000 square foot facility is free to the public,
although all participants are required to wear their own helmet and pads. This
specialty facility is located inside of TeWinkle Park. It features street
elements, a kidney-shaped pool, and a bowl. Finally, the facility also hosts the
City’s Parks and Community Services Department skateboarding classes.
Park Level of Service
Level of Service is a method used to calculate the level of service standards for
parks and recreation to determine if it meets the City’s needs and
expectations.
With a changing population, the City must continually assess how park
facilities satisfy the needs of a changing demographic. Park standards
determine how many parkland acres the City should develop based on
population levels, locations of parks, and existing parks. The City’s goal is to
attain and maintain a park standard of 4.26 acres of parkland for every 1,000
OSR-12 | Costa Mesa General Plan

                     Open Space and Recreation Element
residents. Pursuant to State law (State Government Code Section 66477), the
City may collect up to 3.0 acres of parkland or in-lieu fees from new
residential subdivisions for every 1,000 residents. Accordingly, the City
adopted a Local Park Ordinance to implement its park and recreational land
dedication requirements (Title 13, Chapter XI, Article 5 – Park and Recreation
Dedications). However, to reach the goal of 4.26 acres per 1,000 residents,
the City must pursue alternative funding sources for the additional park
acreage and/or park improvements that exceed the State standard.
Alternative funding sources include general fund revenues, development
impact fees, federal and State grants, user group contributions, and school
district joint-use contributions. Other methods for supplementing the City’s
park system include encouraging the development of private open space and
recreational amenities (beyond public park requirements) within large
residential projects, and pursuing the joint use (or ultimate use) of utility
district lands, such as those owned by County of Orange Flood Control District,
for parks and open space.
As of 2015, the City had an estimated population of 111,276 residents. Based
on the City’s park standard goal of 4.26 acres for every 1,000 persons,
approximately 474 acres of parkland are required to meet the City’s goal.
Assuming a build-out population of 134,984 residents, 575 acres would be
required to achieve the goal.
This total does not include private open space and recreation facilities, golf
courses, the OC Fair & Event Center, or joint use of facilities at school sites.
The City’s policies and implementation actions emphasize the need to pursue
all means to expand and maximize benefits of the parks and recreation
system.
Neighborhood and Community Park Accessibility
Figure OSR-2, Park Access, utilizes the street network system to identify areas
within a one-quarter-mile and one-half-mile walking distance to park
pedestrian-access points (service area). The figure identifies areas within
neighborhoods that do not have ready access to City parks and thus helps
assist in the strategic approach to identify and prioritize locations for parkland
to meet the community goals and objectives.

Park Level of Service and Accessibility by Planning Area
An estimate of population to park ratios has been conducted by “Planning
Areas” to evaluate deficiencies in the City’s allocation of parkland. Table OSR-
4, 2015 Park /Population Ratios, indicates these estimated ratios. Planning
Area 2 exceeds the park-to-population standard of parkland, but includes
some areas that lacks park accessibility. Planning Area 3 is the area with the
most deficient neighborhood parkland with a ratio of 0.62 acres of parkland,
for every 1,000 persons. Figure OSR-3 identifies the Planning Areas.

Planning Area 1
Planning Area 1 is unique in a number of ways. First, it is the location of major
public open space features, including Canyon Community Park and the Talbert
Regional Park and it is in close proximity to Fairview Community Park.
However, these facilities are located along the easternmost boundary of the
planning area, creating an uneven distribution of neighborhood park service.
Secondly, the area is the most densely populated and highly developed in the
City, leaving very limited opportunities for sites to fulfill this service
deficiency. There are several park priority areas within the Westside
neighborhood, just south of Victoria Street.

Planning Area 2
Planning Area 2 is well served and exceeds the park-to-population standard
for neighborhood and community. Nearly 250 acres of parkland are provided
in this Planning Area. However, the Mesa Verde neighborhood around Gisler
Avenue still lacks park accessibility as it is located more than a one-half mile
from a park. The Westside neighborhood north of Victoria Street is also
identified as being farther than one-half mile walking distance from a park.
Planning Area 3
Planning Area 3 is similar to Area 1 in that it is an older neighborhood which is
nearly fully developed without an adequate neighborhood park system. One
advantage that the Eastside neighborhood has is the availability of operating
school sites and surplus school sites to augment the local park network.
Regarding park access, the neighborhood area east of Downtown and along
19th Street is identified as being located beyond a one-half-mile walking
distance from a park. This planning area is deficient by both park-to-
population standards and accessibility standards.
Planning Area 4
Planning Area 4, although it does not meet the park-to-population standard
for parks, it is generally well served by City parks. The acquisition of the Jack
R. Hammett Sports Complex helped improve the park deficiency within the
entire Planning Area. However, the Halecrest and College Park
neighborhoods lie beyond the desired one-half mile.
Planning Area 5
Planning Area 5 is identified as park deficient. Several residential complexes
are served by private on-site recreation facilities and open space easements.
However, with the development of the Sakioka Farms residential site, this
area is expected to have the potential for new residential development that
could include new public (or private) park space.
Planning Area 6
Planning Area 6, which consists of the Bristol and Paularino neighborhoods, is
identified as park deficient in terms of the park-to-population standard. Park
accessibility is generally good to Shiffer Park and Del Mesa Park by
surrounding residential neighborhoods. Large residential complexes that are
not within a one-half-mile walking distance to a public park generally have
                         Costa Mesa General Plan | OSR-17
Open Space and Recreation Element
private park facilities dedicated to their residents. New residential
development associated with the SoBECA Urban Plan will also increase the
current population in this Planning Area and the need for additional public
parks.
Key Park System Issues
Limited Availability of Park Sites
Costa Mesa is a mature, well-developed city with very little land available for
new parkland. Few vacant parcels exist, and those that do may not be useful
in terms of size, location, or other factors. The few remaining large vacant
lands are located north of I-405 and planned for urban-intensity development,
as outlined in the North Costa Mesa Specific Plan. As part of any master
planning process, the City has the ability to require provision of public open
space for parks and similar purposes.
The other major potential site for parkland is the Fairview Development
Center, which the State may choose to downsize or relocate, thus making
these public lands possibly available for transfer to the City. Any new parks
the City acquires within established neighborhoods will be small infill parks.
Several contiguous sites will need to be acquired to provide an active sports
park facility to meet the community’s recreational needs.
Further, the demands on capital funds are highly competitive, potentially
creating further limitations for acquisition of new City parkland.
Balance of Passive and Active Recreation
As the population in the City continues to changes, the demand for parks and
open spaces will increase and change based on the population’s composition.
In response, the City may find it necessary to repurpose current parks and
open spaces to accommodate residents’ needs. As a result, preserving the
established uses of parks and open spaces and balancing between passive and
active recreation use may become a challenge. However, a balance between
passive and active open space opportunities will continue to be a key
consideration.
OSR-18 | Costa Mesa General Plan

                      Open Space and Recreation Element
Demand for Sports Field
Organized sports programs have created a demand for more baseball,
softball, and soccer fields. Many neighborhood parks provide space for
organized sports but typically have insufficient parking, lighting, and facilities
to meet this demand. Sports parks within neighborhoods require a balancing
act for the City to meet the needs of private athletic organizations and
neighborhood residents. Residents often express concerns regarding parking
spillover into neighborhoods, lighting, noise, and the general unavailability of
facilities to residents.
Adequate Space for Community Gardens
Costa Mesa owns and operates two community garden sites in the City. As of
2015, long waiting lists to lease garden parcels to community members
prevented many residents from having garden plots. As the population and
popularity of gardening continues to grow, the demand for community
gardens will grow as well.
Park Level of Service
As of 2015, Costa Mesa had 3.66 acres of parkland per 1,000 persons (based
on population of 111,276 and 415.19 park acres), well under the 4.26 acres
per 1,000 persons this element identifies as the minimum parkland ratio. With
the planned population growth identified in the Land Use Element, demand
per the standard will increase to 575 park acres per 1,000 persons, again
below the threshold identified in this element. The City of Costa Mesa will
have to acquire additional park acres to meet the citywide goal of 4.26 acres
per 1,000 persons.
Park Accessibility
Several residential neighborhoods in Costa Mesa are more than one-quarter
and one-half-mile pedestrian walking distance to public neighborhood and
community parks. These neighborhoods include the Westside residential
district generally along Victoria Street and Placentia Avenue, the Eastside
residential district along 19th and 20th Streets, the residential area northeast of
the Mesa Verde Country Club, and the Halecrest residential neighborhood.
The Halecrest area does include a private park, Halecrest Park, which requires
a membership to access the recreation facilities. These areas should be
considered priorities areas for future parks. Other small underserved areas
                         Costa Mesa General Plan | OSR-19
Open Space and Recreation Element
should also be considered as well. Additionally, large apartment and
condominium complexes provide private recreational facilities for their
residents and are maintained under management groups or homeowner
associations.
Recreational Facilities and
Programs
Community Facilities
The City operates and maintains four community centers: Balearic Community
Center, Downtown Recreation Center, Neighborhood Community Center, and
Costa Mesa Senior Center. Each facility provides recreational activities and
room rentals.
       Balearic Community Center. Located at 1975 Balearic Drive, the
        facility comprises two rental rooms that can accommodate up to 100
        people. Year round, these rooms are used for the City's Day Camp
        Program, Recreation on Campus for Kids (ROCK) program, and Early
        Childhood Program. Adjacent to the center is Balearic Park, which
        features a fenced playground with play equipment, playground,
        basketball courts, and a large athletic field.
       Downtown Recreation Center. Located at 1860 Anaheim Avenue, this
        center includes an indoor gymnasium, gymnastics room, a 25-yard
        outdoor pool, and a designated room and office for the Childs-Pace
        day-care program. The facility offers a multipurpose room equipped
        with a kitchen, and provides open gym time for youth and adult
        basketball. During the summer, the multipurpose room is also used as
        a ROCKS program site.
       Neighborhood Community Center. Located at 1845 Park Avenue, this
        24,000-square-foot facility consists of a large multipurpose hall, stage,
        dance floor, and full-service kitchen. Three smaller meeting and
        conference rooms are available for meetings and classes. In 2015, the
        City approved a $34.5 million plan to build a new library building to
        house the new Donald Dungan Library, renovate the existing Donald

                     Open Space and Recreation Element
         Dungan library to serve as the new Neighborhood Community Center
         (NCC), demolish the old NCC, and propose parking and landscape
         developments in several phases. A community-driven process has
         guided design and service plans.
        Costa Mesa Senior Center. Located at 695 West 19th Street, the senior
         center provides a day facility for Costa Mesa’s older residents to
         gather and participate in social, recreational, and personal
         development programs. The facility also provides seniors access to
         free transportation for medical-related appointments and other
         transportation needs.
Community Services Programs
Community Services programs encompass the diverse recreational and social
services activities provided by the City to residents. These programs can be
classified in one of the following categories:
        Recreational and Physical Activities
        Action Sports
        Cultural and Performing Arts
        Youth Programs
        Human Services
        Older Adult Programs and Services
The City provides a diverse selection of recreational and sports activities,
programs, and services that utilize the extensive network of parks and
recreation facilities. A number of nonprofit organizations within the
community also provide programs and services, including the Newport-Mesa
Family YMCA, Costa Mesa United, and youth sports organizations such as
AYSO, Little League Baseball, and Pop Warner Football. The City facilitates the
use of its recreational facilities and outdoor school grounds by these groups.
Youth Programs
The City offers a variety of recreation programs for local youth, including
gymnastics, basketball, soccer, tee-ball, skateboarding, martial arts, and
horseback riding. The programs aim to provide children and teenagers with
effective tools to learn and grow through well-planned curriculum, activities,
                         Costa Mesa General Plan | OSR-21

Open Space and Recreation Element
field trips, and socialization. Youth and teen programs include the Costa Mesa
Day Camp, Early Childhood Program, Recreation on Campus for Kids
(R.O.C.K.S), Recreation Leadership Training Program, and Teen Camp.
Human Services
Human services programs provide social and financial aid to community
members, and can enhance quality of life, promote civic involvement and
volunteerism, foster partnerships with private organizations, and create a
sense of belonging. The City coordinates with a variety of human services
providers such as the Orange County Rescue Mission and the Orange County
Interfaith Shelter to assist residents and their families.
                                                                                 Costa Mesa’s Community
                                                                                 Services Department provides
                                                                                 a wide range of programs and
                                                                                 activities for youth and teens.
Older Adult Programs and Services
Residents over age 50 represent a growing demographic in Costa Mesa. As a
result, the City’s services and programs need to address the growing demands
of residents who are 50+ by providing social events, expressive arts, nutrition,
fitness, and educational and recreational classes that focus on health and
wellness. Older residents who face mobility, economic, and medical care
challenges can find support and referrals through the programs, services, and
classes held at the Costa Mesa Senior Center. The Costa Mesa Senior Center
also organizes activities, trips, and special events throughout the year.

Issue
Adequate Community Services to Serve Changing
Community
Historically, the City has provided high levels of recreation, community, youth
and family, and older adult services that meet changing community needs.
Maintaining and improving this level of service may be challenging given
limited funding resources and demographic changes.
Open Space
Open space land, as defined by California Government Code Section 65560, is
any parcel or area of land or water that is essentially unimproved and devoted
to an open-space use, including open space for the:
        Preservation of natural resources
        Managed production of resources
        Outdoor recreation
        Public health and safety
Preservation of open space resources, including habitat areas, wildlife, and
water resources are addressed in the Conservation Element.
Costa Mesa Open Spaces
Canyon Park
Canyon Park’s name refers to its location within a canyon just north of 19th
Street. This approximately 36-acre natural open space park includes
meandering trails which connect to several surrounding neighborhoods, a
small playground and picnic green-space, and Talbert Regional Park.
Talbert Regional Park
The County of Orange preserves and maintains the 211-acre Talbert Regional
Park, which encompasses the Talbert Nature Preserve. This open space is
located in the southwest portion of the City, north and south of Victoria Street

along the Santa Ana River lowlands, and provides passive recreation
opportunities, including walking, picnicking, and hiking. The trail system
allows for observation of natural resources and links to other parks along the
Santa Ana River. Group use within the habitat areas is permitted by guided
walks, and individual use is facilitated by interpretive signage. When
combined, Canyon Park, Fairview Park, and Talbert Regional Park provide
almost 490 acres of restored and enhanced natural open space.
Santa Ana River
The Santa Ana River forms the western boundary of Costa Mesa. Although not
included in the open space inventory, the Santa Ana River Trail provides a
major recreation and circulation element that extends from the Pacific Ocean
to the Inland Empire. The bikeway has been designated by Congress as a
“National Recreational Trail.” OC Parks owns and manages the nearly one mile
of the mouth of the Santa Ana River, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
controls the river area above the mouth.
                                                                               Santa Ana River Open Space

Open Spaces Adjacent to Costa Mesa
Newport Banning Ranch
Newport Banning Ranch is an approximately 401-acre site partially located in
unincorporated Orange County and partially within the City of Newport

                     Open Space and Recreation Element
Beach, adjacent to Costa Mesa. Plans for the property include approximately
174 acres of permanent open space to be reserved and protected for lowland
and upland habitat, a nature center, vernal pool interpretive area, and a
diverse system of public interpretive trails connecting to the Talbert Nature
Preserve and Santa Ana River Trail in Costa Mesa.
Upper Newport Bay
Upper Newport Bay is located just east of Costa Mesa in the City of Newport
Beach. It is the largest of only a few remaining natural estuaries in Southern
California. An estuary is a coastal wetland where saltwater from the ocean
mixes with nutrient-rich fresh water from inland sources to provide a fertile
feeding area for birds, fish, and other animals. The Upper Bay is a recreational
and educational resource for the area, with a multipurpose trail and many
wildlife viewing stations.
Open Space Conservation Efforts
Orange Coast River Park, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit independent
organization originally founded as a committee by the Friends of Harbors,
Beaches, and Parks (FHBP). Orange Coast River Park’s mission is to facilitate
coordination among stakeholders, agencies, landowners, and the public to
create a 1,000-acre Open Space Master Plan at the mouth of the Santa Ana
River between the Mesa Verde residential community in Costa Mesa and the
Pacific Ocean. The organization’s major goals are to “restore the historic
ecological staircase, extend a seamless passageway to the coast from inland,
and create access for residents and visitors to an oasis of tranquility.”
Key Open Space Issues
Open Space Preservation and Management
Open space lands within Fairview Park, Canyon Park, and Talbert Regional
Park need to be managed to prevent impacts to sensitive habitat and wildlife.
Wetlands, vernal pools, and other sensitive habitats need to be protected
from human activity and accidental and intended damage. Invasive plant and
wildlife species and hazardous material from pesticides, pollution, trash, and
other toxic materials need to be controlled and/or restricted to prevent
                         Costa Mesa General Plan | OSR-25

Open Space and Recreation Element
severe damage to these resources. Unauthorized trails by bicyclists and hikers
can also damage sensitive habitat areas. Public agencies need to continue to
provide and enforce management and educational strategies to protect,
preserve, and steward these limited resources.
Open Space Acquisition
As a built-out community, Costa Mesa will face challenges acquiring new open
space land due to high land costs and the limited availability of land.
Open Space Access
Open spaces in Costa Mesa are primarily located along the Santa Ana River.
Adjoining residential neighborhoods can easily access the Santa Ana River
Trail and Banning Channel Bikeway. Eastside Costa Mesa neighborhoods may
encounter difficulties in accessing these open spaces through the City’s
established bikeway system. Talbert Regional Park is primarily accessed by
surrounding residential neighborhoods; it can also be accessed through trail
connections and access points. Careful consideration must be given to
increase access to open spaces while protecting sensitive habitat.
Cultural Arts Resources
Costa Mesa's motto is "City of the Arts.” Over the past decades, regionally and
nationally recognized organizations have established the City as their home,
and they continue to grow. The Segerstrom Center for the Arts, South Coast
Repertory Theater, Arts Plaza, and Noguchi Sculpture Gardens are some of the
significant cultural resources based in Costa Mesa. The Costa Mesa Playhouse
also thrives in the City, along with a wide array of art galleries and a
contemporary music scene.
Costa Mesa Theater and Arts District Plan
The 57.3-acre Costa Mesa Theater and Arts District includes high-rise office
buildings, internationally recognized cultural facilities, hotels, restaurants, and
high-end commercial uses. Located along the Avenue of the Arts and with
ready access to I-405, the district attracts visitors from throughout Southern
California and beyond. To guide the coordinated development of the district,
in 2004 the City the Costa Mesa Theater & Arts District Plan was established.

                                 Public art refers to works of art in any media located in a public setting, with
                                 the purpose of beautifying public spaces and buildings, drawing attention to
                                 the message the artwork may communicate, and educating the public. Public
                                 art can increase the intrinsic and monetary values of the places it graces; and
                                 it can express a civic and corporate pride. Many of Costa Mesa’s public art
                                 pieces are located at the Segerstrom Center of the Arts, which has limited
                                 public access.

Goals, Objectives, and Policies
These goals, objectives, and policies guide policy decisions regarding open
space and recreation in Costa Mesa, and allow for the continued expansion,
improvement, and maintenance of community facilities and services for the
enjoyment of current and future residents. Additional opportunities include
integrating public art throughout the community to highlight predominant
themes in Costa Mesa’s history.
Goal OSR-1: Balanced and Accessible
System of Parks and Open Spaces
Provide a high-quality environment through the development of recreation
resources and preservation of open space that meets community needs in
Costa Mesa.
Objective OSR-1A: Maintain and preserve existing parks, and strive to
                     provide additional parks, public spaces, and recreation
                     facilities that meet the community’s evolving needs.
Adequate Neighborhood and Community Park Recreational Facilities
Policy OSR-1.1:      Maintain a system of Neighborhood and Community
                     Parks that provide a variety of active and passive
                     recreational opportunities throughout the City.
Policy OSR-1.2:      Provide parks and recreation facilities appropriate for the
                     individual neighborhoods in which they are located and
                     reflective of the needs and interests of the population
                     they serve.
Acquisition of New Parkland
Policy OSR-1.3:      Pursue the acquisition and development of pocket and

Resources Element
            Introduction
            Costa Mesa’s historical and cultural resources are woven into the fabric of the
            community and offer a window into the City’s rich and colorful past. These
            resources provide tangible reminders of a past, including the original
            indigenous inhabitants, early Spanish explorers and settlers, American
            pioneers and City builders, and the World War II home-front efforts in Costa
            Mesa. The Historical and Cultural Resources Element identifies the historical
            and cultural resources that celebrate Costa Mesa’s story and have fostered its
            vibrant ethnic and cultural diversity.

Historical Context: Costa
Mesa’s Past
Costa Mesa’s historical resources are physical reminders of a history dating
back thousands of years, from Native American settlement, to periods when
the region was under the flags of Spain and Mexico, to the World War II era.
Native Americans inhabited the region for thousands of years. The location
along the Santa Ana River and near the Pacific Ocean provided abundant food
and other resources for Native Americans for millennia. During California’s
colonial era, the region became one of Southern California’s great ranchos
and agricultural producing areas for growing sweet potatoes, corn, tomatoes,
strawberries, and apples. The convergence of water and rail transportation at
the end of the 19th century led to an industrial boom in the early 20th century.
During World War II, Costa Mesa became the site of the Santa Ana Army Air
Base. The following summarizes significant periods in Costa Mesa’s social,
physical, cultural, and economic evolution. The summary also describes some
of the historical sites, structures, and landmarks associated with each period.
Native Americans and Early Spanish Settlers
Located on the "coastal tableland" above Newport Beach, Costa Mesa's first
inhabitants were Native Americans who settled on the mesa near the banks of
the Santa Ana River. Discovered artifacts, including discarded shells and
ceremonial and household artifacts, indicate that the riverbanks were a part
of the village once known as Lukup. In 1776, Spanish explorers established
Mission San Juan Capistrano approximately 22 miles southeast of present-day
Costa Mesa. Occasionally, the padres from the mission would visit Lukup.
In the early 1800s, when the Capistrano cattle grazed in the Costa Mesa area,
provisions had to be made to shelter the herdsmen. Three adobes were built
along the bluffs of Costa Mesa overlooking the Santa Ana River. The first
adobe, known as the Polloreno (or Banning Adobe), was located
approximately one-third of a mile south along the bluffs near Adams Avenue.
The adobe fell to ruin between 1903 and 1906 after treasure hunters dug
around the building looking for hidden gold. Between 1820 and 1823, the
second adobe, known as the Gabe Allen Adobe (or the Estancia), was
constructed. This structure still stands today. It was restored by the City and
                            Costa Mesa General Plan | HCR-3

Historical and Cultural Resources Element
now serves as a museum at 1900 Adams Avenue in Estancia Park. The third
adobe, called the Rice Adobe, was located just north of Gisler Avenue. In
1919, this adobe was torn down by the owner of the property of the time,
Edward Pomeroy, to keep treasure hunters off of the property.
Early City Settlements
The history of Costa Mesa is the story of three communities: an old
boomtown called Fairview, the small farming village of Paularino, and the
town of Harper, which would later be renamed Costa Mesa. The growth and
blending of these communities played a significant role in the history of
Orange County and California.
Town of Fairview
Between the fall of 1887 and summer of 1888, the town of Fairview was
established. The town was centered near the present-day intersection of
Adams Avenue and Harbor Boulevard. In October 1887, a syndicate of local
businessmen formed to purchase and develop various tracts within the
Newport District. Over the next few years, development of Fairview grew at a
rapid pace. It was during this time that the Fairview Post Office was
established and the Santa Ana, Fairview, and Pacific (SF&P) Railroad was
founded. In addition, the discovery of hot mineral water springs in the area
led to the construction of the three-story Hotel Fairview.
By the spring of 1889 the town began to collapse as rapidly as it had
appeared, despite attempts to promote the continuing development of
Fairview. During that same year, the land boom of Southern California also
declined, with many of the land transactions throughout the region falling
through. In March of 1889, a severe rainstorm washed out a section of the
SF&P Railroad tracks and the roadbed midway between Fairview and Santa
Ana, next to the Santa Ana River. As a result, many residents began to leave
the town, including the editor and owner of the local paper, town physician,
butcher, and local sign painter.
By 1911, all that remained of Fairview was the schoolhouse, the hotel, and a
few houses. The schoolhouse closed in 1915, and the hotel was demolished in
1920. The few remaining houses located in Fairview eventually were

                                destroyed by fire or removed to make way for new development beginning in
                                the 1930s.
                                Farming Communities
                                Paularino
                                Paularino was a typical farming community that consisted of approximately
                                800 acres generally bounded by the present-day location of Fairview Road to
                                the west, Newport Boulevard to the east, I-405 to the north, and Baker Street
                                to the south. The Paularino community did not amount to more than a name
                                with a few scattered farmhouses, a schoolhouse, and a railroad siding. The
                                lack of growth of Paularino eventually led to its abandonment.
  Harper-Fairview Grammar
School, formerly located at the
northwest corner of 19th Street
 and Newport Boulevard in the
                   early 1920s.
                                Harper
                                Harper was named after a rancher who came to the area after the Fairview
                                land boom. The area experienced its first oil boom, with three oil wells
                                installed in 1906 just south of the present-day location of Newport Harbor
                                High School. In 1907, several more wells were installed on the northern end of
                                the Newport Heights Tract. The oil boom was short lived; within three years,
                                the wells were abandoned.
                                In 1920, the farming community of Harper was renamed Costa Mesa, which
                                means coastal tableland in Spanish. In the summer of that same year, the
                                Wayside Market (located on Newport Boulevard) opened. During 1921,
                                several more store buildings were constructed along Newport Boulevard,
                                including a garage shop, blacksmith shop, barber shop, and soda fountain.

Development continued to increase throughout Costa Mesa until January 21,
1932, when the Costa Mesa Branch of the Bank of Balboa closed. A year later,
the Southern Pacific Railroad’s branch line that ran along Newport Boulevard
was abandoned, and the 1933 Long Beach Earthquake shook the town,
damaging businesses and other structures.
                                                                                Newport Boulevard

                                                                                businesses, as well as Ford
                                                                                Model T automobiles parked
                                                                                along the street, circa 1927.
After the Great Depression, the town began to grow again with the opening of
several commercial stores, including Sprouse-Reitz Variety (located at 1830
Newport Boulevard), Myers and Myers Department Store (located at 1816
Newport Boulevard), and the post office (located at 1809 Newport
Boulevard). Costa Mesa continued to be recognized as a small town until
World War II.
Costa Mesa and the Santa Ana Army Air Base
In response to increasing world conflicts in the 1930s and ‘40s, military
installations were planned throughout the country. One of these military
installations was the United States Air Corps Replacement Training Center,
which was redesignated the Santa Ana Army Air Base (SAAAB) in 1942. The
base encompassed 1,337 acres between Newport Boulevard and Harbor
Boulevard and consisted of three schools: the Air Force Classification Center,
the Air Force Pre-Flight School for pilots, and the Air Force Pre-Flight School
for bombardiers and navigators.
In 1946, the War Department announced that the SAAAB was for sale to any
educational institution for the price of one dollar. That same year, the War
Assets Administration sold a portion of the base to the Orange Coast Junior

                             College District, which would later become the campus for Orange Coast
                             College. Two years later, the Southern California Assemblies of God Churches
                             purchased 126 acres of the base for a future campus, the Southern California
                             Bible College. This would eventually be renamed Vanguard University. The
                             remaining portions of the base would later be occupied by Costa Mesa High
                             School, Davis Elementary School, the City of Costa Mesa Civic Center, Air

                             Fairgrounds, TeWinkle Park, and several commercial and residential areas.
                             Today, all that remains of the base are a few buildings preserved within the
                             Orange County Fairgrounds, including the 1.4-acre Memorial Garden and Bird

                             On June 29, 1953, the City of Costa Mesa was incorporated. At the time, the
                             new city encompassed approximately 3.5 square miles and had a population
                             of 16,840. By 2010, Costa Mesa had expanded to cover approximately 17
                             square miles, and the population had grown to 109,960. Today, Costa Mesa is
                             a major commercial and industrial center of Orange County. The City formally
                             adopted the slogan "The City of the Arts” in 1999, reflecting the concentration
                             of major regional arts venues and the presence of the Pacific Symphony and
                             South Coast Repertory Theater. The 3,000-seat Segerstrom Center for the Arts
                             (previously known as Orange County Performing Arts Center) was completed
                             in 1986. In 2006, the 2,000-seat Renee and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall
                             and the 500-seat Samueli Theater opened.

Historical and Cultural Resources Element
Historical, Archaeological, and
Paleontological Resources
Historical, archaeological, and paleontological resources provide knowledge of
California’s past. These resources also contribute to the character of Costa
Mesa. Activities that result in the loss of historical, archaeological, and/or
paleontological resources can result in the loss of cultural identity; loss of
unique engineering, architectural, or artistic works; and loss of unique
irreplaceable components that help create a sense of place and help foster
the cultural environment. Costa Mesa boasts locally significant assets, as well
as multiple sites eligible for national recognition. Costa Mesa’s early
settlement patterns and contributions to the wartime effort are recalled
through these unique historical places and features, reflecting the diverse
culture and people who have made Costa Mesa their home over the years. For
these reasons, historical, archaeological, and paleontological resources should
be protected and preserved.
Historical Resources Inventory
Historical resources include, but are not limited to, buildings, structures,
roads, features, and objects that are built prior to 1954or listed in or
determined to be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Properties, the California Register of Historical Resources, a local register, or
otherwise designated as having historical significance by a lead agency
(supported by substantial evidence as required by the California
Environmental Quality Act). Costa Mesa is home to 31 historical properties,
built environments, and landmarks that have been determined eligible for
listing in the City’s Local Register of Historic Places (see Table HCR-1: Historical
Resources Eligibility Inventory). Five of these historical properties have been
determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places and in
the California Register of Historical Resources. It is anticipated that the City’s
inventory of eligible listed historical properties, buildings, and structures will
increase as time and resources become available to evaluate and nominate
additional properties.
As of 2015, the Fairview Indian Site is the only site listed on the National
Register of Historic Places. Figure HCR-1, Historical Eligibility Sites, identifies

Archaeological Resources Inventory
Archaeological resources are the physical remains of past human activities,
and can be either prehistorical or historical in origin. Archaeological sites are
locations that contain evidence of human activity. Generally, a site is defined
by a significant accumulation, or presence, of one or more of the following:
food remains, waste from the manufacturing of tools, concentrations or
alignments of stones, modification of rock surfaces, unusual discoloration or
accumulation of soil, or human skeletal remains.
Costa Mesa has a rich prehistoric past. The Gabrielinos (Tongva or Kizh) were
the City’s first settlers prior to 1,500 B.C. The Gabrielinos are Takic-speakers
who lived in domed, circular shaped structures, constructed from tree
branches and thatched with tule, fern, or carrizo. Villages were located near
fresh water and raw material resources. Evidence, or artifacts of their
occupation, have been found both on the surface and subsurface, and have
included stone and bone tools, shell middens, pottery shards, and human
burials.
A comprehensive cultural resources assessment was conducted on the
undeveloped areas of the City of Costa Mesa. The assessment included a
records search at the California Historical Resources Information System,
which involved review of all previously conducted cultural resource studies, as
well as recorded archaeological and historical resources located within the
undeveloped portions of the City. Furthermore, an intensive pedestrian
survey was undertaken to determine the presence or absence of exposed
surficial cultural artifacts.
The results of the cultural resources assessment indicate that within City limits
are seven previously recorded prehistorical archaeological sites and nine
potential prehistorical sites requiring additional fieldwork within the City
limits. The seven archaeological sites are identified as:
        CA-ORA-76 (shell midden)
        CA-ORA-163 (shell midden)
        CA-ORA-165 (lithic scatter and shell midden)
        CA-ORA-297 (stone tools and debris)
        CA-ORA-506/58 (habitation complex)
                          Costa Mesa General Plan | HCR-13

Historical and Cultural Resources Element
        CA-ORA-687 (habitation complex with human burials) and were
         located on or near the bluffs overlooking the Santa Ana River and the
         Upper Newport Bay
Of these seven archaeological sites, CA-ORA-506/58, known as the “Fairview
Indian Site,” is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and on the
California Register Historical Resources. Since much of the City has been
urbanized by past development, it is anticipated that future development
could increase the potential for discovery of archaeological and historical
resources within soil depths not previously disturbed by existing or past
development.
Paleontological Resources Inventory
Paleontological resources include fossilized remains of organisms from
prehistorical environments found in geologic strata, providing evidence of
pre-human activity. These resources are valued for the information they yield
about the history of the earth and its past ecological settings. There are two
types of resources, vertebrate and invertebrate, and they are generally found
in geologic strata conducive to preservation, typically sedimentary formations.
Often they are simply small outcroppings visible on the surface or sites
encountered during grading. Geologic formations are the most important
indicator of paleontological resources, since they may contain important
fossils.
A comprehensive paleontological assessment of Orange County, which
included the City of Costa Mesa, was undertaken in 1980. The geology of
Costa Mesa was mapped out as part of the countywide assessment. The
geology of Costa Mesa was determined to be part of the Palos Verdes
Formation, a collection of sand and gravel deposits approximately 100,000
years old. These deposits were formed during the time when Costa Mesa was
covered by the Pacific Ocean. Often referred to as the Palos Verdes Sand,
these deposits contain evidence of the kinds of marine life that inhabited the
area prior to the ocean receding, exposing the current terrestrial landmass of
Costa Mesa.
The results of the paleontological assessment identified eight unique
paleontological sites consisting of a variety of gastropods (e.g., marine snails)
and bivalves (e.g., clams, oysters, and mussels). These sites were singled out
HCR-14 | Costa Mesa General Plan

          Historical and Cultural Resources Element
due to encroaching development, which could cause significant impacts to the
site if left unattended. The ten paleontological sites have been classified as:
         F-91 (Partial skeleton of a mastodon)
         A-3129 (Mollusks); LACM-3267 (Mastodon or mammoth)
         LACM-4219 (Mollusks, Fish, Birds, Sharks, Sea lions and Seals)
         JDC-CM-1 (Bivalve, Gastropods, and Mollusks); JDC-CM-2 (Mollusks);
          JDC-CM-2A (Oyster shells and Mollusks)
         JDC-CM-3 (Bay-type Sea shells)
         JDC-CM-4 (Marine shells
          VAC-CM-4 (Mollusks)
 In addition, the assessment identified more than 500 species of marine
invertebrate fossils, as well as significant numbers of non-marine vertebrate
fossils including, birds, sea, and land mammals.
Preservation Framework
The City is committed to recognizing and preserving local historical and
cultural resources using available programs, such as those described below.
Historical Preservation Programs
National Register of Historic Places
The National Register of Historic Places is the official list of the nation's
historic places worthy of preservation. To be eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places, a district, site, building, structure, or
object must possess one of the following characteristics:
         The project is associated with events that have made a significant
          contribution to the broad patterns of American history.
         The project is associated with the lives of persons significant in the
          past.
         The project embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period,
          or method of construction, or represents the work of a master, or
          possesses high artistic values, or represents a significant and
          distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
          distinction.
                          Costa Mesa General Plan | HCR-15

Historical and Cultural Resources Element
        The project has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information
         important in prehistory or history.
California Register of Historical Resources
The California Register of Historical Resources program has been crafted to
allow the State and local agencies, private groups, and citizens to identify,
evaluate, register, and protect historical resources. It is also the authoritative
guide to the State's significant historical and archeological resources. The
California Register of Historical Resources includes buildings, structures,
objects, sites, and districts significant in the architectural, engineering,
scientific, economic, agricultural, educational, social, political, military, or
cultural annals of California. As of 2015, no properties located in Costa Mesa
were included in the California Register of Historical Resources. However, the
City contains one property designated as a California Historical Landmark:
1900 Adams Avenue – Diego Sepulveda Adobe. The Santa Ana Army Air Base
site at 88 Fair Drive has been designated a California Point of Historical
Interest.
Mills Act
In 1972, California State Senator James Mills introduced a bill, known as the
Mills Act, to grant property tax relief to owners of qualified historical
properties. The Mills Act is a preservation tool created by the California
Legislature to encourage the preservation and restoration of historical
properties. The Mills Act enables cities to enter into property agreements with
owners of qualifying historical properties, which results in a reduction to the
owner’s property taxes. The agreements also provide a benefit to cities in that
they ensure preservation, guarantee authentic rehabilitations, and provide a
higher level of maintenance of cultural resources that are important to
communities. One property in Costa Mesa utilizes the Mills Act.
Local Program: Historic Preservation Ordinance
In 1999, the City adopted its Historic Preservation Ordinance (Article 14 of the
Municipal Code) to preserve designated historical and cultural resources.
Pursuant to the ordinance, a local historical resource is any building, structure,
natural feature, site, landscape, object, or improvement that is of significance
to the people of the City, the State, or the nation. To be designated a local
landmark, a historical resource must be over 50 years of age, or in special

circumstances under 50 years of age, and meet one or more of the following
requirements:
      Exemplifies or reflects special elements of the City’s cultural, social,
       economic, political, aesthetic, engineering, architectural, or natural
       history; or
      Is identified with persons or events significant in local, state, or
       natural history; or
      Embodies distinctive characteristics of a style, type, period, or method

      Contributes to the significance of a historical area, being a
       geographically definable area possessing a concentration of historical
       or scenic properties, or thematically related grouping of properties,
       which contribute to each other and are unified aesthetically by plan or
       physical development; or
      Has a unique location or singular physical characteristics or is a view
       or vista representing an established and familiar visual feature of a
       neighborhood community or of the City; or
      Embodies elements of architectural design, detail, materials, or
       craftsmanship that represents a significant structural or architectural

         significance.
As of 2015, the Huscroft House (located at 546 Bernard Street) was the only
resource listed on the City’s Local Register of Historic Places. In addition, 30
other properties have been evaluated as eligible to be included (see Table
HCR-1 for list of these properties).
Historical Districts and Neighborhood Character Areas
To recognize historical communities in Costa Mesa and groupings of historical
resources and places of interest, General Plan policies allow City staff to
explore the creation of historical districts and/or neighborhood character
areas.
A historical district is a definable and unified geographic area that possesses a
significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures,
or objects united historically or aesthetically by plan or physical development.
It can also be distinguished from surrounding areas and present the same
constraints and opportunities as individually listed properties. Historical
districts can be designated at the national, State, and/or local level, and each
level of designation has its own specific criteria. In addition, each level of
designation entails a different level of protection, triggers different levels of
review, and designates the property(ies) as potentially eligible for various
preservation incentives.
                                                                                   Huscroft House, officially listed as
                                                                                   a local historical resource is a
                                                                                   Craftsman-styled house built in
                                                                                   the early 1920s and moved to

                                                                                   1954.

         Historical and Cultural Resources Element
A neighborhood character area, also commonly referred to as a conservation
district, is a tool used to define a group of significant historical resources that
do not retain adequate integrity to qualify as a historical district but still
maintain important levels of cultural, historical, or architectural significance.
The focus of a neighborhood character area includes maintaining basic
community character, but not necessarily specific historical details of
buildings or landscapes. Neighborhood character areas are designated as a
zoning overlay, which geographically cover a neighborhood and may be
coupled with other regulations. Conceptually, a neighborhood character area
creates “buffer zones” to transition from historical districts to surrounding
development.
Historical Preservation Committee
The Historical Preservation Committee works with the City Council to preserve
the history of Costa Mesa and with the Costa Mesa Historical Society to
educate the general public about the rich history of the community. The
Committee’s overarching goal is to work to preserve and promote the
historical heritage of the City of Costa Mesa through special projects,
outreach, and community events.
Key Historical Preservation Issues
Loss of Historical Buildings
Historical resources can be subject to decay and disrepair. As a result,
continuing to develop a comprehensive preservation program implemented
through the Historical Preservation Ordinance is essential to preserving the
City’s historical and cultural resources. As part of implementation of the
preservation program, the City will update its historical resources survey to
identify and inventory historical and cultural resources. The survey should be
prepared and maintained periodically and be consistent with State and
federal preservation standards. Through implementation of a historical
resources survey, greater protection and community awareness of the
resources can be achieved.
New Development Compatibility and Potential Impacts
Costa Mesa’s historical neighborhoods have developed over many decades
with a significant amount of residential neighborhoods built in the mid 1950s
                          Costa Mesa General Plan | HCR-19

Historical and Cultural Resources Element
and 1960s, post-World War II. These residential neighborhoods established
subdivision patterns and architectural design styles that are characteristic of
the era. The City’s “Residential Design Guidelines,” last updated in 2013,
promote architectural design styles that will be compatible with the character
of the affected neighborhoods. As Costa Mesa continues to grow and
becomes more intensely urbanized, the potential impacts from new
development can create significant issues, including density, land use
compatibility, scale, mass, noise, and development patterns.
With sensitive and thoughtful design and development, new construction,
rehabilitation, and adaptive reuse projects can enhance the historical
character of the City while still meeting its contemporary needs.
Preservation of Post-World War II Historical Resources
Costa Mesa is home to post-World War II buildings and tract housing
developments that have become old enough and/or developed sufficient
significance to be considered historical resources. As the age threshold for
determining whether or not a property is “historical” is 50 years, tract housing
dating to the 1950s and ‘60s are beginning to present themselves as potential
historical resources. Buildings may be individually eligible for the local register
or may qualify for eligibility only as an intact grouping (i.e., housing tract). This
topic warrants exploration given that many neighborhoods, particularly east
of Newport Boulevard, contain representative examples of some of the
earliest tract housing development in Orange County.
Interpretation of Historical Resources
Interpretation of historical resources refers to the way in which historical
buildings, objects, and sites are identified and presented to the public. An
effective interpretation program helps preserve a sense of local history and
enhances opportunities for cultural heritage tourism. The City will explore
implementing an interpretation program to preserve local history.
Lack of Resources for Educating Residents about Identifying
and Caring for Historical Properties
Property owners often unknowingly alter historical properties in a manner
that causes significant loss of architectural integrity, which renders potential
resources ineligible for inclusion in the local inventory. Likewise, some City

                               enforcement do not have sufficient professional development support to
                               adequately address historical preservation.

                               The City aims to preserve, enhance, and promote its history and cultural
                               resources, and to integrate these efforts with broader community goals of
                               economic development. Costa Mesa seeks to continue its progress to actively
                               preserve historical resources, identify economically viable uses, encourage
                               public knowledge of resources, and foster civic pride.
                               The potential for adaptive reuse and revitalization of existing structures,
                               which would add to the character of Costa Mesa, is high. The City will
                               promote the development of appropriate land uses, site design, and
                               architectural treatments to ensure compatibility of new development with the
                               character of surrounding historical resources.

                               The City of Costa Mesa supports focused efforts to provide residents with a
                               sense of community and history through the protection and preservation of
                               historical and cultural resources.

CHAPTER 5
    HOUSING ELEMENT
            Accommodating the housing needs of the State of California is an important goal
            for the City of Costa Mesa, regional agencies and State agencies. As the
            population of the State continues to grow and pressure on resources increase,
            Costa Mesa is concerned with providing adequate housing opportunities while
            maintaining a high standard of living for all citizens in the community.
            Recognizing the importance of providing adequate housing, the State has
            mandated a Housing Element within every General Plan since 1969. The City of
            Costa Mesa adopted its first Housing Element in April 1971 and has continued to
            work towards the needs of the State, region and community. Changes in market
            conditions and state legislation resulted in amendments to the City’s Housing
            Element in 1974, 1978, 1980, 1988, 1992, 2000, and 2008. This Housing
            Element (2013-2021) complies with State General Plan law pertaining to Housing
            Elements.
5.1 PURPOSE
            The State of California has declared that “the availability of housing is of vital
            statewide importance and the early attainment of decent housing and a suitable
            living environment for every California family is a priority of the highest order.” In
            addition, government and the private sector should make an effort to provide a
            diversity of housing opportunities and accommodate regional housing needs
            through a cooperative effort, while maintaining a responsibility toward economic,
            environmental and fiscal factors and community goals within the general plan.
            Further, State Housing Element law requires “An assessment of housing needs
            and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of these
            needs.” The law requires:
                    An analysis of population and employment trends.
                    An analysis of the City’s fair share of the regional housing needs.
                    An analysis of household characteristics.
                    An inventory of suitable land for residential development.
                    An analysis of governmental and non-governmental constraints on the
                     improvement, maintenance and development of housing.
                    An analysis of special housing needs.
                    An analysis of opportunities for energy conservation.
                    An analysis of publicly-assisted housing developments that may convert
                     to non-assisted housing developments.
            The purpose of these requirements is to develop an understanding of the existing
            and projected housing needs within the community and to set forth policies and
            programs that promote preservation, improvement and development of diverse
            types and costs of housing throughout Costa Mesa.

                    ORGANIZATION
                    Costa Mesa’s Housing Element is organized into three primary sections:
                            Summary of Existing Conditions: This section includes a housing needs
                             assessment, an inventory of resources and a section discussing
                             constraints, efforts and opportunities.
                            Housing Issues/Trends: This section includes a discussion of State
                             issues and policies, regional housing policies, and Costa Mesa’s housing
                             issues and strategies.
                            Housing Program: This section identifies housing goals, policies and
                             objectives.     Funding sources are identified and schedules for
                             implementation are set forth. In addition, quantified objectives are
                             provided.
5.2   RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
                    State Law requires that “…the general plan and elements and parts thereof
                    comprise an integrated, internally consistent, and compatible statement of
                    policies…” The purpose of requiring internal consistency is to avoid policy
                    conflict and provide a clear policy guide for the future maintenance, improvement
                    and development of housing within the City.
                    The Costa Mesa General Plan is comprised of the following elements: Land Use;
                    Circulation; Growth Management; Housing; Conservation; Noise; Safety;
                    Community Design; Open Space and Recreation; and Historic and Cultural
                    Resources. The City is currently updating several of these elements, including
                    the Land Use Element and Circulation Element. As part of that update, the City
                    has reviewed its land use policies to ensure consistency with this Housing
                    Element and has updated the Land Use Element to address flood hazards and
                    management.
                    As portions of the General Plan are amended in the future, the Housing Element
                    will be reviewed along with other elements to ensure internal consistency is
                    maintained.
5.3   CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
                    The City of Costa Mesa has made diligent efforts to solicit public participation
                    pertaining to the formulation of this Housing Element update. Public participation
                    for the 2013-2021 Housing Element included the following components:
                    PUBLIC MEETINGS
                    The 2013-2021 Housing Element was updated in conjunction with the General
                    Plan Update. The City designed a public participation program as part of the
                    update process (see Appendix A). Specific meetings were dedicated for
                    obtaining community input on the Housing Element:

           community stakeholders, and developers.
           PUBLIC REVIEW OF DOCUMENTS
           Throughout the process of updating the Housing Element, the City posted
           relevant documents, including presentation materials and draft documents on the
           website for easy download and review by residents and interested parties.
           A public review draft was prepared and made available to the community as of
           May 28, 2013. The public review draft was sent to the State Department of
           Housing and Community Development (HCD). A notice announcing the
           availability of the Draft Housing Element for public review was sent to Orange
           County Housing Authority (OCHA), non-profit organizations, and various service
           providers.
           Public comments received on Draft Housing Element are summarized in
           Appendix A. As appropriate, the Housing Element has been revised to address
           the comments.
5.4 REVIEW OF PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
           State law requires the City of Costa Mesa to review its previous Housing Element
           in order to evaluate:
                1) The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives and policies in
                    contributing to the attainment of the state housing goal.
                2) The effectiveness of the Housing Element in attainment of the
                    community’s housing goals and objectives.
                3) The progress of the city, county, or city and county in implementation of
                    the Housing Element.
           The previous Housing Element originally covered the period of July 1, 2008
           through October 15, 2013 (as revised from June 30, 2014 by SB 375). A
           summary of the City’s achievements under the previous Housing Element is
           presented in this section. Table HOU-1 presents a program-by-program review
           of the previous Housing Element, containing a discussion on the effectiveness
           and continued appropriateness of each program.

                      SUMMARY OF PROGRESS
                      PROGRESS TOWARD RHNA
                      Pursuant to State law, each jurisdiction in California is responsible for a share of
                      the region’s housing growth needs. The process of determining that “fair share”
                      is called Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA). For the 2008-2014
                      Housing Element cycle, the City of Costa Mesa was assigned a RHNA of 1,682
                      units, divided into four income categories:
                              Very Low Income (0-50 percent Area Median Income): 353 units
                              Low Income (51-80 percent Area Median Income): 289 units
                              Moderate Income (80-120 percent Area Median Income): 330 units
                              Above Moderate Income (>120 percent Area Median Income: 710 units
                      The RHNA for the 2008 2014 Housing Element cycle in the SCAG region used
                      January 1, 2006 as the baseline for projecting housing needs. As such, housing
                      units constructed, permitted, approved, or affordable housing units preserved
                      from January 1, 2006 to 2008 were credited toward the RHNA. Table HOU-2
                      summarizes the City’s accomplishments in meeting the remaining RHNA.

                      The City recognized it had limited resources to address the varied affordable
                      housing needs in the community. As part of the 2008-2014 Housing Element,

5.5      HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
                             The purpose of this section is to summarize and analyze the existing housing
                             conditions in Costa Mesa. The section consists of two major sections: an
                             analysis of population and employment trends; and a housing profile which
                             includes an analysis of existing housing characteristics, housing conditions,
                             vacancy trends, housing costs and availability, coastal zone housing,
                             neighborhood and community resources, “at-risk housing” and suitable lands for
                             future development.
                             POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT
                             When evaluating housing needs in a community, demographic variables, such as
                             population, employment, and households must be examined to assess the
                             present and future housing needs. This section utilizes various data sources,
                             including:
                                      1970-2010 U.S. Census reports;

    The American Community Survey (ACS) by the Bureau of the Census surveyed only a small sample of the population and
    therefore tends to contain large margins of errors. As such, data from the ACS throughout this report are presented only as
    percentages to show magnitude and prevalence. Furthermore, certain data that are too detailed may have inherent margins of
    errors that are too large to be accurate. In such cases, ACS data, although available, are not presented in this Housing
    Element.

                             POPULATION TRENDS
                             Orange County or the Orange County Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area
                             (PMSA) is part of the Los Angeles Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area
                             (CMSA) that also consists of the Los Angeles-Long Beach PMSA, Riverside-San
                             Bernardino PMSA and Ventura County PMSA. The City of Costa Mesa is
                             located in Orange County which remains the second largest PMSA in the Los
                             Angeles CMSA.
                             Movement of the population from the central Los Angeles County to adjacent
                             counties resulted in proportionate booms initially in the coastal counties and
                             more recently in the inland counties. In 1980, Orange County’s population was
                             1,932,921 and increased by nearly 25.0 percent to 2,410,556 in 1990. Between
                             1990 and 2000, the population of Orange County further increased by 18.1
                             percent to 2,846,289. According to the 2010 Census, the population of Orange
                             County is now 3,010,232, an increase of 5.7 percent from the 2000 Census
                             estimates. The largest gains in population are being recorded in the inland
                             counties: Riverside and San Bernardino. However, proportionate increases have
                             slowed for all counties over the last seven years.

                             The City of Costa Mesa is surrounded by five cities: Fountain Valley, Huntington Beach,
                             Irvine, Newport Beach and Santa Ana. Between 1980 and 2010, Santa Ana and
                             Irvine experienced the largest numerical and proportionate gains for the six-city
                             area, but Costa Mesa also experienced a fair amount of population gains. In
                             2010, Costa Mesa has a total population of 109,960 persons (Table HOU-5).

                           AGE CHARACTERISTICS
                           According to the 2010 Census, approximately 35 percent of the population in the
                           City of Costa Mesa is between the ages of 25-44 (Table HOU-6). The 55-64 age
                           group experienced the largest proportionate growth between 2000 and 2010,
                           suggesting that in the coming years, there may be an increased demand for
                           senior housing. The proportion of small children (under the age of five) as well
                           as the proportion of older children (between the ages of five and 14) both
                           decreased over the ten-year period. Generally, the population of persons age 55
                           and above all increased.
                           Since 1990, City, County and State median age figures closely paralleled each
                           other with no more of a difference than 1.5 years. In 1990, the State median age
                           was 31.5 years, while the City and County median ages were 31.1 years and
                           31.4 years, respectively. In Costa Mesa, the 2000 median age was estimated to
                           be 32.0 years, and by 2010 it had risen to 33.6 years. Like the median ages of
                           the County and the State, the median age of Costa Mesa residents will likely
                           continue to increase over this Housing Element period.

                            According to the 2010 Census, the race/ethnic makeup of the Costa Mesa
                            population is comprised of White (51.8 percent), Hispanic or Latino (35.8
                            percent), Asian (7.7 percent), Black or African-American (1.2 percent), American
                            Indian and Alaska Native (0.2 percent), or other races (1.7 percent). The City’s
                            racial/ethnic composition has changed slightly since 2000, reflecting a statewide
                            trend. Since the 2000 Census, the proportion of Hispanic residents had
                            increased to approximately 36 percent, with corresponding declines in other
                            racial/ethnic groups.

                            EMPLOYMENT TRENDS
                            Employment by Industry
                            In 2010, the American Community Survey (ACS) estimates Costa Mesa’s total
                            employment is 59,932 persons. The figure represents an increase of 3,482
                            persons since 2000 (Table HOU-8). Comparatively, Costa Mesa and Orange
                            County are similar in terms of employment industry proportions. The largest
                            sectors in Costa Mesa are education, health and social services (17.0 percent)
                            and arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food services (13.7
                            percent).
                            According to the California State Employment Development Department, as of
                            June 2012, Costa Mesa had an estimated unemployment rate of 7.1 percent,
                            comparable to the countywide rate of 7.9 percent.

                           Employment in various sections in Costa Mesa has been steadily increasing over
                           the last eight years, which in turn can generate demand for additional housing.
                           As employers in the City offer a variety of wage types, the City should continue to
                           accommodate a wide range of housing types that match the wages, such as
                           single room occupancy (SRO) units, apartments, attached single-family and
                           detached single-family homes.
                           HOUSEHOLD TRENDS
                           A household is defined as all persons occupying a housing unit. Families are a
                           subset of households, and include all persons living together who are related by
                           blood, marriage, or adoption. Single households include persons living alone in
                           housing units, but do not include persons in group quarters such as convalescent
                           homes or dormitories. Other households are unrelated people living together,
                           such as roommates.
                           Household Growth
                           In 1960, 12,973 households resided in the City of Costa Mesa and that number
                           nearly doubled by 1970 (Table HOU-10) Between 1950 and 1970, the City
                           added 20,312 households, while increasing its land area through annexations
                           from 3.5 square miles to 14.7 square miles. The City continued to experience
                           large increases in the number of households through the 1970s but its growth
                           had slowed over the past 30 years as the City became increasingly built-out. As
                           of 2010, there were 39,946 households within 16 square miles in the City.

               Household growth rate is the primary factor in determining housing needs. Even
               during periods of fairly static population growth, there may be an increase in
               households due to: 1) young people leaving home; 2) divorce; 3) aging of the
               population; and 4) other social activities that cause people to occupy a new
               residence. Conversely, the population may increase in fairly static household
               growth periods. Between 1970 and 1980, household growth far exceeded
               population growth, while in more recent times population has been slightly
               greater than household growth. The difference between population and
               household growth rates has resulted in a fluctuating household size over the
               years.
               Household Size
               The City of Costa Mesa has a smaller average household size (2.68 persons per
               household) than the County (2.99 persons per household) and the State (2.90
               persons per household), generally reflecting a community where young families
               with children and young adults represent a smaller component of the community.
               However, consistent with countywide and statewide trends, average household
               size in Costa Mesa has held steady over the last decade.
               In 2010, nearly 60 percent of the Costa Mesa population was in a one or two
               person household, similar to the County in general (Table HOU-11). Generally
               between 2000 and 2010, the distribution of households based on their size
               remained the same, with a slight increase in the number of 3 and 4 person
               households.

                            Costa Mesa has a higher proportion of renters than most communities in Orange
                            County. From 2000 to 2010, according to the Census, the percentage of renters
                            decreased slightly from 60 percent to 57 percent. Among all renter-households,
                            about 20 percent were using single-family homes as rentals. Countywide, 41
                            percent of the households were renters in 2010.

                            Household Income
                            Over the ten-year period between 1990 and 2010, median household income in
                            Costa Mesa increased from $55,456 to $64,864, an increase of 17 percent. The
                            number of households with incomes below $50,000 decreased by 22 percent,
                            while households earning above $75,000 increased substantially (Table HOU-
                            13). The most dramatic increases occurred in the greater than $100,000 income
                            groups. From 2000 to 2010, the largest numeric increase (+2,847 households or
                            126 percent) occurred in the number of households earning greater than
                            $150,000 annually. Conversely, the largest numeric decrease occurred in the
                            $25,000 to $34,999 income group. Generally, the 2010 Census reflects a
                            continuing shift to the higher income categories in the City. The shifts in income
                            distribution are a combined result of inflation, real change in earning power, and
                            higher housing prices affordable only to higher income households. Overall,
                            Costa Mesa has a lower median household income than the County.

                         Between 2000 and 2010, the median household income increased at 1.7 percent
                         annually, while values of owner-occupied homes increased at 6.8 percent and
                         median rents increased at 29.9 percent. In 2010, the median home price in
                         Costa Mesa was $644,900, a 136-percent increase from 2000. In summary,
                         household incomes are not keeping pace with housing prices in Costa Mesa,
                         much like the rest of California.

                         SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATIONS
                         Certain segments of the community may need special consideration with regards
                         to housing. For the purposes of the Housing Element, special needs groups are
                         defined as: elderly, persons with disabilities, large households, single-parent
                         households, farmworkers, and the homeless.
                         Elderly
                         Elderly persons (age 65 or older) may live in housing that costs too much or live
                         in housing that does not accommodate their specific needs for assistance. In
                         2000, there were 5,717 elderly-headed households, which represented 14.7
                         percent of the total households in the City. Between 2000 and 2010, the number
                         of elderly-headed households increased to 6,339 at an average of 1.1 percent
                         annually, much faster than the rate of general household growth (0.5 percent).
                         Elderly households represented 15.9 percent of the City’s total households in
                         2010. As the proportion of elderly households continues to increase in Costa
                         Mesa, the provision of housing options for elderly persons should be a priority.
                         In 2010, 29.6 percent of the elderly households in the City were renters,
                         compared to 23 percent in Orange County. The proportion of senior renters in
                         Costa Mesa has decreased since 1990 when 36.5 percent of elderly households
                         were renters. Change in the proportion of senior renters is dependent on the
                         quantity of housing options and the propensity to convert to ownership. A
                         majority of the elderly population (56.3 percent) was living in family households,
                                                                            HOUSING ELEMENT  PAGE HOU-19

                        which are defined as a householder living with one or more persons related by
                        birth, marriage or adoption.
                        Elderly households tend to rely on fixed and lower incomes. According to the
                        CHAS data2, more than half of the City’s elderly renter-households had extremely
                        low and low incomes. In comparison, a majority of the City’s elderly owner-
                        households had moderate or above moderate incomes (Table HOU-14).
                        An important measure of housing affordability is “cost burden.” Cost burden is
                        defined as monthly housing costs in excess of 30 percent of a household’s gross
                        income, and severe cost burden is defined as housing costs exceeding 50
                        percent of gross household income. According to the CHAS data, Census, 56.1
                        percent of the elderly renter-households had a housing cost burden in Costa
                        Mesa, compared to 35.8 percent of the elderly owner-households (Table HOU-
                        14). Among the extremely low income group, cost burden impacted owner- and
                        renter-households almost equally. However, for very low and low income
                        households, cost burden was more prevalent among renters than among owners.
                        Three senior apartment complexes are located in the City of Costa Mesa. All are
                        subsidized through various public programs, such as the HUD Section 202.
                        Currently, the vacancy rate is zero percent in these properties and the turnover is
                        low. Subsequently, waiting lists for these units are very long. The three
                        complexes include: Bethel Towers (268 units), St. John’s Manor (36 units), and
                        Casa Bella (74 units). Some elderly residents are served through other publicly
                        assisted properties with smaller unit sizes, such as Costa Mesa Village (96
                        units), Park Place Village (60 units), and Newport Senior Village (91 units for
                        seniors only). These are single-room occupancy units (SROs). In addition the
                        City is home to several senior mobile home parks and many assisted
                        living/skilled nursing facilities. A 215-unit market-rate senior housing project is
                        also under construction (at 1500 Mesa Verde Drive East).
                        The City of Costa Mesa is committed to serving the needs of its elderly
                        population and therefore supports efforts related to: age restricted mobile home
                        parks, independent retirement living, assisted living, residential care, and skilled
                        nursing facilities. In addition, the City also has a second unit ordinance (updated
                        in 2011) that offers affordable housing opportunities for lower and moderate income
                        households.

                           Persons with Disabilities
                           Persons with disabilities usually have special housing needs, particularly in terms
                           of affordability, accessibility, and proximity to employment, social services, and
                           medical services. The Census defines disability as a long-lasting physical,
                           mental, or emotional condition. This condition can make it difficult for a person to
                           do activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or
                           remembering. This condition can also impede a person from being able to go
                           outside the home alone or to work at a job or business.
                           In 2011, a total of 8,259 persons age five and above in Costa Mesa had one or
                           more disabilities, representing 16.1 percent of the population (Table HOU-15). In
                           comparison, 16.6 percent of the County of Orange residents aged five and above
                           were considered disabled. Among the City’s disabled residents (in working age),
                           the majority (61 percent) were employed, although many may be under-
                           employed or not making adequate incomes to afford housing, health care, and
                           other necessities.

                           According to Section 4512 of the California Welfare and Institutions Code a
                           "Developmental disability" means a disability that originates before an individual
                           attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and
                           constitutes a substantial disability for that individual which includes mental
                           retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term shall also include
                           disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require
                           treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but shall
                           not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.
                                                                               HOUSING ELEMENT  PAGE HOU-21

                           Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
                           conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a
                           group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely
                           affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical
                           attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities
                           exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
                           developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a
                           child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
                           The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides
                           community based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental
                           disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers,
                           four developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The Regional
                           Center of Orange County and the Fairview Developmental Center provide point
                           of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities. These centers are
                           private, non-profit community agencies that contract with local businesses to
                           offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental disabilities and
                           their families.

                           The City of Costa Mesa is dedicated to accommodating the needs of disabled
                           persons and supports the Fairview Developmental Center and other residential
                           facilities in the City. In September 2012, a total of 10 community care facilities in
                           Costa Mesa are licensed by the State Department of Social Services to serve the
                           supportive housing and service needs of persons with disabilities. These
                           facilities provide 89 beds for developmentally disabled residents; another 90
                           clients are served by two adult day care facilities. In addition, the City of Costa
                           Mesa is home to the Fairview Developmental Center that serves developmentally
                           disabled persons. Fairview is licensed for 1,200 beds and currently has 850
                           beds. As of June 2012, there were approximately 375 individuals living at the
                           facility. Harbor Village (formerly the Fairview Housing Project) gives priority to
                           employees and transitional patients of Fairview Developmental Center.

                           of all households in the City, with approximately half of these families consisting
                           of single-parents with children. In 2010, the poverty level was $17,288 for a four-
                           person family. Of the female-headed families with children, 10.4 percent were
                           living below the poverty level in 2010, compared to 6.1 percent of all families with
                           children.

                           The City of Costa Mesa recognizes the needs of single-parent households. To
                           expand housing opportunities in areas near schools, jobs, child care, and
                           transportation, the City created three Urban Plans to encourage mixed-use
                           developments in three distinct areas. Programs that address affordable housing
                           for lower and moderate income households benefit female-headed households.
                           In addition, incentives are provided in the City’s density bonus provisions to
                           encourage affordable housing that incorporates child care facilities. The City’s
                           new Family Residential Occupancy (FRO) program encourages the development
                           of or conversion of hotel rooms into small housing units that are geared toward
                           small households, including single-parent households.

                           Large Households
                           A large household is defined as a household consisting of five or more persons.
                           In 2010, 13.3 percent of the households in the City of Costa Mesa consisted of
                           five or more persons, indicating a slight decrease from 2000 when 13.9 percent
                           of the City households were large households (see Table HOU-11). In 2010,
                           large households comprised 17 percent of County households.
                           Often, an issue with housing large households, particularly those of lower
                           incomes, is overcrowding. Overcrowding is defined as a housing unit occupied
                           by more than one person per room. A severely overcrowded housing unit is one
                           with more than 1.5 persons per room. A room is defined as a bedroom, living
                           room, dining room, or finished recreation room, but excludes kitchen and
                           bathroom.
                           In 2010, 6 percent of the households in the City were considered overcrowded
                           and 2 percent were considered severely overcrowded. Overcrowding tends to
                           impact renter-households more severely than owner-households. According to
                           the American 2006-2010 American Community Survey, 2,912 renter-households
                           (12.8 percent of all renters) and 294 owner-households (1.7 percent of all
                           owners) were overcrowded.
                                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT  PAGE HOU-23

 Note: Overcrowding data is based on sample data. Total number of households deviates slightly from 100-percent Census
 counts.
                            Overcrowding is largely a result of the lack of large rental units and the fact that
                            most large renter-households are unable to afford the large ownership units. For
                            example, a total of 3,521 large renter-households resided in Costa Mesa in 2010,
                            while there were only 710 rental units with four or more bedrooms. In
                            comparison, 5,906 large owner units were potentially available to 1,807 large
                            owner-households in the City (see Table HOU-19 and Table HOU-20).

                            Aside from overcrowding, large households are also impacted by housing cost
                            burden. Overall, cost burden affected large owner- and renter-households
                            almost equally (see Table HOU-21). However, cost burden decreased with
                            income increases for renter-households. The decrease was less prominent
                            among owner-households.
                            The City’s strategy for addressing overcrowding is to expand rental and
                            ownership housing opportunities in the City, allowing persons/families that double
                            up in housing arrangements to occupy separate housing. In addition, room
                            addition is an eligible activity under the City’s Single-Family Rehabilitation
                            Program if overcrowding is an issue. Furthermore, renter-occupied detached
                            homes also help address the issue of overcrowding.

                            Farmworkers
                            Currently, there are two remaining farms in the City of Costa Mesa: Sakioka
                            Farm and Segerstrom Farm. In 2009, the City of Costa Mesa requested the
                            California Department of Conservation remove Sakioka Farms from the State
                            Farmland Map. Specifically, the properties listed above be designated as Land
                            Committed to Non-Agricultural Use and designated on the Farmland Map as
                            Urban and Built-Up Land. Segerstrom Farm is designated for Commercial
                            Center use. The General Plan Land Use Designations and Development
                                                                               HOUSING ELEMENT  PAGE HOU-25

                    Agreements on each of the subject properties allow for commercial
                    and/residential development. Limited agricultural activities on these properties
                    will be phased out.
                    Due to the limited nature of agricultural activities in the City, the housing needs of
                    farmworkers in the City of Costa Mesa are considered to be minor and may be
                    addressed through existing housing strategies.
                    Homeless Persons
                    Specific information on the homeless in individual jurisdictions within Orange
                    County is not available. Service providers can only comment on the number of
                    homeless persons they serve but are not able to estimate the number of those
                    who do not seek assistance from their agencies, nor are the agencies able to
                    address the duplicative count issue (one person seeking assistance in several
                    agencies are often counted more than one time).
                    According to the 2010-2014 Consolidated Plan for Costa Mesa, the 2009 Point In
                    Time Survey of the homeless conducted by the County of Orange and OC
                    Partnership, it is estimated there may be as many as 930 homeless individuals
                    that consider themselves to be Costa Mesa residents (1,295 over the course of a
                    year). Similar to other Orange County cities, the seasonal need for
                    homeless/emergency shelters is typically heightened during late fall, winter, and
                    early spring seasons, and it is during these cold-weather periods that the
                    demand for shelter is generally higher. According to the Consolidated Plan,
                    based on accomplishment data submitted by service providers funded by the
                    City, about 113 persons were provided emergency shelter assistance and 257
                    persons were provided transitional housing between 2006 and 2012.
                    A number of agencies in Costa Mesa provide shelters and services for the
                    homeless and persons at risk of becoming homeless. These include:

                            Human Options

                            Someone Cares Soup Kitchen
                    Through the annual CDBG allocation process, the City provides funding to
                    agencies that serve various special needs groups in the City.

                    HOUSING GROWTH
                    Consistent with an urbanized, built-out community, Costa Mesa has seen modest
                    housing growth since 1990. The housing stock grew from 39,611 in 1990 to
                    42,867 in 2010, an 8 percent increase over 20 years. In comparison, Orange

                              VACANCY TRENDS
                              Vacancy trends in housing establish the relationship between housing supply and
                              demand. For example, if the demand for housing is greater than the available
                              supply, then the vacancy rate is probably low, and the price of housing will most
                              likely increase or remain stable.
                              According to the 2010 Census, the overall vacancy rate was 6.4 percent (2,763
                              vacant units) in the City of Costa Mesa, compared to 5.5 percent for Orange
                              County. Most of the vacant units were rental units, comprising 68 percent of all
                              vacant units. Vacant units for sale comprised 11 percent of all vacant units
                              (Table HOU-23). The remaining vacant uses are occupied seasonally or for
                              recreational uses.

                              HOUSING CONDITIONS
                              As a general rule, housing units require major repairs and rehabilitation after 20
                              to 30 years. As an older and built out community, more than 75 percent of the
                              housing units were built prior to 1980. Specifically, 79 percent of the owner units
                              and 77 percent of the renter units were constructed prior to 1980; these units are
                              either older than or approaching 30 years of age, potentially requiring major

                    Substandard is defined as either in need of rehabilitation or replacement. Overall,
                    the City’s housing stock is in good conditions. According to the City’s Code
                    Enforcement staff, less than ten percent of the City’s housing stock is in need of
                    minor repairs. Only two percent of the housing units may be considered in need of
                    substantial rehabilitation and fewer than five units in the entire City are in need of
                    replacement.
                    The City of Costa Mesa takes a proactive approach toward housing conditions
                    through housing rehabilitation programs and code enforcement programs. Existing
                    housing rehabilitation and code enforcement programs are successfully correcting
                    code violations and maintaining the housing stock.
                    In 2000, the City of Costa Mesa adopted Title 20: Costa Mesa Property
                    Maintenance Regulations intended to identify property maintenance standards
                    and establish procedures for the prosecution and abatement of public nuisance
                    conditions identified therein. Through these regulations, City Code Enforcement
                    staff is able to encourage homeowners and apartment building owners to
                    maintain their property by painting, relandscaping and correcting various property
                    maintenance issues such as, removal of inoperative vehicles, enclosure of trash
                    bins, onsite drainage issues, abatement of weeds and rubbish from properties
                    and other issues identified in Title 20. It is through these efforts that the number
                    of substandard housing units in Costa Mesa is minimized.
                    HOUSING COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY
                    One of the major barriers to housing availability is the cost of housing. In order to
                    provide housing to all economic levels in the community, a wide variety of
                    housing opportunities at various prices should be made available. The following
                    table describes the ideal monthly payment for households in the five major
                    income groups: extremely low, very low, low, moderate, and above-moderate.

                                Single-Family Home Sales
                                Regional home prices of single-family homes tripled between 1970 and 1979 and
                                continued to increase through the 1980s. In the early 1990s, the residential
                                market declined and continued to decline until approximately 2000. Starting in
                                the year 2000, extending until 2008, housing prices increased dramatically in
                                Costa Mesa and throughout California. However, following the economic
                                downturn of 2008, housing prices have fallen drastically. With the decline of
                                housing prices, a new problem occurred throughout California – defaults on
                                subprime mortgages. Between 2000 and 2006 (during the peak of the housing
                                market), many homeowners acquired mortgages that they could not afford, often
                                due to variable interest rate loans, or other “creative” financing such as zero
                                downpayment or negative amortization loans. From 2008 to 2011 numerous
                                homeowners were faced with foreclosure on their properties resulting in an
                                increased demand for rental housing. As the home ownership market evens out,
                                many homeowners are still addressing their financing and the rental market in
                                the City and County is tight, due to high demand.
                                                                                     HOUSING ELEMENT  PAGE HOU-29

                        In 2007, the median single-family home price (based on units sold) in Costa
                        Mesa was approximately $750,000, but by June 2012, the median price had
                        decreased to $530,000.3 Nevertheless, current home prices are significantly
                        higher than they were 10 years ago. For example, in 1997, the median single-
                        family home price was $220,000.
                        In Orange County, the median single-family sales price decreased from $610,000
                        in the third quarter of 2007 to $462,100 by the second quarter of 2012. In
                        comparison to surrounding jurisdictions, the City of Costa Mesa offers a fair
                        range of single-family prices. In the second quarter of 2012, Costa Mesa had a
                        median single-family sales price of $515,000, which was much less than Newport
                        Beach, but comparable to surrounding jurisdictions, including Huntington Beach,
                        Irvine, and Fountain Valley.
                        Condominium Sales
                        According to Zillow.com, a real estate data service, the median price of
                        condominiums in the City of Costa Mesa was $322,300 in 2012 (second quarter).
                        By comparison, median condominium sales price in the City of Costa Mesa was
                        moderately expensive amongst surrounding jurisdictions, below Irvine and
                        Newport Beach, but above Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley, and Santa Ana.
                        The City condominium sales were priced just below the county median of
                        $329,800 as of the second quarter of 2012.
                        Condominiums offer a niche in the housing market between the single-family
                        sales and the rental market. With sales prices in the $260,000 to $700,000
                        range, moderate income groups could afford to own condominiums priced in the
                        lower end of this range in Costa Mesa. However, most condominiums are not
                        affordable for lower income households.
                        Rental Units
                        According to a citywide apartment survey conducted in May and June 2007 as
                        part of this Housing Element update, rental rates for apartments in Costa Mesa
                        range from $750 a month for a studio to $2,550 a month for a three-bedroom
                        apartment (Table HOU-25).              According to interviews with property
                        owners/managers, apartment rents have been increasing at approximately $50
                        per year.
                        As shown in Table HOU-25, market rents in Costa Mesa are affordable to all
                        moderate income households and some low income households. Very low and
                        extremely low income households are not able to afford the rent in the City
                        without the cost being a burden. A key problem in comparing Table HOU-24 and
                        Table HOU-25 is the rent for larger units of 3 or more bedrooms, and the
                        affordable rent for large households. Larger households in each income category
                        are unlikely to be able to afford the rent for a larger unit.

                           Affordability
                           Affordability can be defined as a household spending 30 percent or less of
                           household income for housing. Housing costs include rent or mortgage
                           payments, insurance, taxes, and utilities.
                           According to the California Association of Realtors (CAR), Orange, Los Angeles,
                           and San Diego counties had the least affordable home prices to first-time
                           homebuyers. To afford a median priced single-family home in Costa Mesa, an
                           annual salary of $107,360 would be needed and a person has to make
                           approximately $67,080 to afford a median priced condominium.                                      Most
                           occupations in Orange County offer much lower salaries. Similarly, most
                           occupations offer wages below what would be needed to afford an average
                           priced three-bedroom apartment in Costa Mesa. As shown in Table HOU-24, the
                           median home prices are only affordable to some moderate income households
                           and not to households earning less. Comparing Table HOU-24 and Table HOU-
                           25 for a low-income family of four, the affordability gap to buy a home in
                           Costa Mesa is approximately $285,720 and the gap for a moderate
                           income family of four is still $110,415.
                           COASTAL ZONE HOUSING
                           California Government Code requires that Housing Elements include information
                           regarding changes to the housing stock within the Coastal Zone. A majority of
                           the Coastal Zone property in Costa Mesa is in public ownership and is
                           designated as open space. Of the total 125.1 acres, approximately 97.7 acres
                           are owned by the County of Orange, while 27.3 acres are owned by the City of
                           Costa Mesa. The remaining acreage includes a privately owned 0.28-acre parcel
                           containing a 16-unit condominium project. There has been no change to the
                           City’s Coastal Zone housing stock since 1991.
                           AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AT-RISK STATUS
                           California Housing Element Law requires all jurisdictions to include a study of all
                           low-income housing units which may be lost to the affordable inventory by the
                           expiration of some type of affordability restrictions. The law requires that the
                           analysis and study cover a ten-year period. For this Housing Element, the at-risk

                            Inventory of Publicly Assisted Rental Housing
                            The following inventories include all government assisted rental properties in the
                            City of Costa Mesa. Generally, the inventory consists of HUD Orange County
                            multi-family bonds and density bonus properties. Target levels include the very
                            low and the low income groups. Many affordable housing projects in the City
                            maintain 55-year affordability covenants.
                            In 2006, the Costa Mesa City Council approved an agreement with St. John’s
                            Manor to extend the affordability covenant for 55 years in exchange for financial
                            assistance to address rehabilitation needs. In 2012, Bethel Towers, through tax-
                            exempt revenue bonds, extended its affordability covenant for 55 years.

At Risk Status
Twenty-five properties with 156 affordable units have density bonus agreements
that were executed mostly in the late 1990s. These agreements are expiring
between 2018 and 2020. Among these units, 85 units are for very low income
and 71 are for low-moderate income.
St. John’s Manor was refinanced in 2006 to extend the affordability covenant for
55 years and continues to receive project-based Section 8 assistance. The
current Section 8 contract will expire in December 2015.
Another property, Casa Bella, is at risk of converting to market-rate housing or
losing their low income subsidies within the next ten years. Casa Bella was
constructed with a long-term Section 8 contract, which has long expired. The
project is currently maintained as affordable housing using short-term (five-year)
Section 8 contracts that require renewal periodically. At Casa Bella, a total of 75
units are “at-risk” of converting to market rate rents over the next ten-year period.
Specifically, Section 8 contract at Casa Bella is set to expire on September 11,
2015. Casa Bella is considered the highest priority, due to the owner being a for-
profit entity. However, the City imposed a land use restriction on Casa Bella in
exchange for the initial land write down, density increases, parking reductions
and participation in HUD financing. The land use restrictions require Casa Bella
to remain affordable for the length of the mortgage, 40 years. In other words,
Casa Bella is not “at-risk” of converting to market rate through a mortgage
prepayment. The risk with Casa Bella converting to market rate is associated
with the termination of a tenant-based Section 8 contract.
Preservation and Replacement Options
Preservation of at-risk projects can be achieved in a variety of ways, with
adequate funding availability. These include:
         Transfer of ownership to nonprofit developers and housing organizations
         Providing rental assistance to renters through other funding sources
         Purchase affordability covenants
         Refinance mortgage revenue bonds
Alternatively, units that are converted to market rate may be replaced with new
assisted multi-family units with specified affordability timeframes.
Transfer of Ownership
Transferring ownership of the affordable units to a nonprofit housing organization
is a viable way to preserve affordable housing for the long term and increases
number of government resources available to the project. The feasibility of this
option depends on the willingness of the owner to sell, funding sources to
actually buy the property, and the existence of a nonprofit organization with
sufficient administrative capacity to manage the property. The City can explore
transfer of ownership options with potential agencies or organizations included in
the State’s Department of Housing and Community Development qualified
entities list. The entities will be select from the State’s list of qualified entities to
acquire/manage affordable housing.
All at-risk projects are held by private profit-motivated entities. In Costa Mesa the
estimated market value for the 267 affordable units in the at-risk developments is
evaluated in Table HOU-27. The current market value for all affordable at-risk
                                                   HOUSING ELEMENT  PAGE HOU-33

                          units is estimated to be just under $39 million. The market value is only an
                          estimate based on general assumptions on unit sizes, building conditions, and
                          market rents. This analysis is only intended to establish some order of cost
                          impact and not intended to reflect the actual value of the at-risk properties.
                          Furthermore, affordable units at density bonus projects represent only a small
                          portion of the total units at these projects. Transferring ownership of projects in
                          their entirety to retain a small number of affordable units may not be the most
                          cost-effective approach. Another approach is to replenish the City’s affordable
                          housing inventory with new construction and encourage the use of density
                          bonus.

                          Rental Assistance
                          State, local, or other funding sources can be used to provide rental subsidies to
                          maintain the affordability of at-risk projects. These subsidies can be structured to
                          mirror the Section 8 program, whereby the subsidy covers the cost of the unit
                          above what is determined to be affordable for the tenant’s household income
                          (including a utility allowance) up to the fair market value of the apartment. The
                          total estimated annual subsidy to maintain the 267 at-risk units is estimated at
                          about $1,166,700.

Incentives to Purchase Affordability Covenants
Another option to preserve the affordability of at-risk projects is to provide an
incentive package to the owners to maintain the projects as low-income housing.
Incentives could include writing down the interest rate on the remaining loan
balance and/or supplementing the Section 8 subsidy received to market levels.
The feasibility of this option depends on whether the complexes require
rehabilitation or are too highly leveraged. By providing lump-sum financial
incentives or on-going subsidies in rents or reduced mortgage interest rates to
the owner, the City can ensure that some or all of the units remain affordable.
Construction of Replacement Units
The construction of new low-income housing can be a means to replace at-risk
units. The cost of developing new housing depends on a variety of factors
including density, size of units, construction quality and type, location, and land
cost. Assuming a development cost of $200,000 for a multi-family rental unit, the
cost of replacing all 267 affordable at-risk units would be approximately $53.4
million.
Preservation Resources
Efforts by the City to retain low-income housing must be able to draw upon two
basic types of preservation resources: organizational and financial. Qualified,
non-profit entities need to be made aware of the future possibilities of units
becoming ''at risk.'' Groups with whom the City has an on-going association are
the logical entities for future participation. The City can explore transfer of
ownership options with potential agencies or organizations included in the State’s
Department of Housing and Community Development qualified entities list.
The following is a list of potential financial resources considered a part of the
City's overall financial plan to deal with retaining affordable units.
        HOME Program: The City of Costa Mesa receives approximately
         $360,000 in HOME funds annually. HOME funds are used primarily for
         rehabilitation loans and grants, and acquisition/rehabilitation of rental
         units.
        Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds: The City of
         Costa Mesa receives approximately $1 million in CDBG funds annually.
         CDBG funds are used primarily for infrastructure and public facility
         improvements, public services, fair housing services, and code
         enforcement.
        Costa Mesa Housing Authority: The Costa Mesa Housing Authority
         was formed in 2012 to serve as the city agency responsible for the
         provision of quality, affordable housing in Costa Mesa after the
         dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency. The Housing Authority can
         carry out a broad range of activities such as acquiring and leasing land,
         acquiring and rehabilitating existing units, clearing sites for development,
         financing the construction of new or rehabilitated units, constructing
         public improvements to facilitate housing, owning and operating units,
         and operating programs and services that promote home ownership and
         responsible tenancy for persons of low income.

                             Orange County Housing Authority (OCHA): The Orange County
                              Housing Authority administers two programs: Conventional Public
                              Housing and Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program. The
                              Conventional Public Housing Program includes housing developments
                              that are owned and managed by OCHA. The Section 8 Housing Choice
                              Voucher Program is a tenant-based rental subsidy. As of March 2013,
                              OCHA served 442 Costa Mesa households through Section 8 vouchers.
                              Among the households assisted, 122 were families, 168 were
                              households with disabled members, and 152 were elderly households.
5.6   HOUSING CONSTRAINTS ANALYSIS
                    A number of factors can serve to constrain the development, preservation, and
                    improvement of housing in Costa Mesa.
                    GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
                    Actions or policies of numerous governmental agencies, whether involved directly or
                    indirectly in the housing market, can impact the ability of the private sector to
                    provide adequate housing to meet consumer demands. One example is the impact
                    of federal monetary policies. Federal budgeting and funding policies of a variety of
                    departments can either stimulate or depress various aspects of the housing
                    industry. Local or state government compliance or the enactment of sanctions
                    (sewer connection or growth moratoriums) for noncompliance with the federal Clean
                    Air and Water Pollutions Control Acts can impact all types of development.
                    State agencies and local government compliance with state statutes can complicate
                    the development of housing. The California Environmental Quality Act and sections
                    of the Government Code relating to rezoning and General Plan amendment
                    procedures can also act to prolong the review and approval of development
                    proposals by local governments. In many instances, compliance with these
                    mandates establishes time constraints that cannot be altered by local governments.
                    Local governments also exercise a number of regulatory and approval powers that
                    directly impact residential development within their respective jurisdictional
                    boundaries. These powers establish the location, intensity, and type of units that
                    may or may not be developed. The City's General Plan, zoning regulations, project
                    review and approval procedures, development and processing fees, utility
                    infrastructure, public service capabilities, and development attitudes all play
                    important roles in determining the cost and availability of housing opportunities in
                    Costa Mesa.
                    LAND USE CONTROLS
                    General Plan and Zoning
                    The Costa Mesa General Plan establishes the location and amount of land that will
                    be allocated to residential development, and the intensity of development (in terms
                    of unit densities and total number of units) that will be permitted. While nearly all
                    components or elements of the General Plan contain goals and policies that
                    influence residential development, the Land Use Element has the most direct
                    influence.

                                                                CITY OF COSTA MESA
The Land Use Element (as of October 2012) provides the following residential
designations:
          Low Density Residential (up to 8 units per acre)
          Medium Density Residential (up to 12 units per acre)
          High Density Residential (up to 20 units per acre)
Residential uses may also be permitted in the following nonresidential areas at a
density of no more than 20 units per acre in conjunction with a planned
development except at specific sites:
          General Commercial
          Commercial Center
          Regional Commercial
          Urban Center Commercial
          Industrial Park
          Light Industrial
In implementing the residential land use designations, the R1 zoning district
promotes low-density, detached single-family development. The R2-MD district
promotes medium-density, multi-family development. The R2-HD and R3 are
zones intended for high-density multi-family dwelling units.
In addition the Costa Mesa Zoning Code includes several additional zones aimed at
facilitating a variety of residential development throughout the City:
          Planned Development Residential - North Costa Mesa (PDR-NCM)
          Mixed-Use Overlay (MU)
The PDR-NCM zone allows for densities up to thirty-five (35) dwelling units per
acre. This district is intended to provide for excellence in the design of residential
projects. Site design could include single-and multiple-family residential
developments containing any type or mixture of housing units, either attached or
detached, such as clustered development, townhouses, patio houses, detached
houses, duplexes, garden apartments, high rise apartments or common interest
developments. Complementary non-residential uses could also be included in the
planned development.
The MU district may overlay the R2-MD, R2-HD, R3, CL, C1, C2, MG, PDR-HD,
PDR-MD districts, and is intended to allow development of residential and
nonresidential uses as mixed, integrated projects. This overlay district is intended to
be applied to the City’s zoning map in conjunction with the adoption of an urban
plan for the designated area. The urban plan is a regulating plan that shall define
the unique characteristics of the overlay area, include a matrix of permitted,
conditionally permitted, and prohibited uses and provide development standards. A
master plan is required to activate the overlay zone.

                              DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
                              General Residential Development Standards
                              Generally, minimum lot sizes, minimum open space, maximum height and
                              parking requirements are similar for residential zones R1 through R3, except for
                              a larger minimum lot size in the R2-MD zone and do not create negative impacts
                              for the community and developers (Table HOU-29).
                              In addition, the City has several planned development zoning districts including
                              the PDR-NCM, which is a special high-density district in North Costa Mesa. The
                              planned development districts provide incentives for innovative designs that
                              incorporate small lots, zero lot lines, residential clustering, mixed densities and
                              mixed income types. The Medium, High and North Costa Mesa PDR zones also
                              allow high-rise apartments and common interest developments (Table HOU-30).
                              Furthermore, common interest development allows small detached and attached
                              units a higher densities.

      covered parking is provided within either a carport or a parking structure.
  2. Guest parking is calculated separately from covered and open parking. Guest parking may be reduced to 0.25 space per
      unit for each unit above fifty (50) in a large residential development.
  3. In R1 zones, required open parking may be provided in a garage or on a minimum 19-foot long, individual driveway leading

                              Urban Plans
                              As the City of Costa Mesa approaches build-out and with 50.8 percent of the
                              housing stock built before 1970, the identification and preservation of resources
                              becomes essential with respect to long-term planning. Through coordinated
                              efforts the City has developed several neighborhood improvement strategies and
                              urban plans that identify the opportunities available within neighborhoods. These
                              urban plans were created to establish overlay zones in specific areas of the City,
                              with flexible development standards to encourage mixed-use developments.
                              Flexibility in development standards include:
                                         Reduced setbacks;
                                         Reduced parking requirements;

    State Density Bonus On-Site Parking Standards: Studio to one-bedroom: one parking space; two- to three-
    bedroom: two parking spaces; four or more bedrooms: 2.5 parking spaces. These requirements include guest
    and handicapped parking.
                                                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT  PAGE HOU-39

                            Reduced open space;
                            Tandem parking permitted;
                            Increased lot coverage; and
                            Increased height limits.
                    South Bristol Entertainment and Cultural Arts (SoBECA) Urban Plan: The
                    SoBECA urban plan area covers 39 acres located south of Baker Street, east of
                    the 73rd freeway, and north of the intersection of the SR-73 and SR-55 freeways.
                    The emphasis of the plan is to improve the visual appearance of this area and
                    provide a live/work environment. The plan includes a focus on mixed-use
                    development comprised of residential uses and commercial uses. This plan was
                    adopted on April 4, 2006.
                    Westside Implementation Plan: The Westside Implementation Plan was
                    adopted on April 4, 2006 and includes the Mesa West Residential Ownership
                    Urban Plan, 19 West Urban Plan, and Mesa West Bluffs Ownership Urban Plan.
                    The Westside Implementation Plan encompasses an area of 238 acres and
                    includes several multi-family neighborhoods primarily south of West 19th Street.
                    Additional areas north of West 19th Street include portions of neighborhoods that
                    are near Wilson Elementary School, Pomona Elementary School, and Rea
                    Center.
                    The following generally summarizes the intended residential uses in the Urban
                    Plan areas:
                            Mesa West Residential Ownership Urban Plan: The Plan encourages
                             owner-occupied housing by permitting rebuilding to the existing number
                             of units on site even if that exceeds the current zoning allowance. Height
                             limit is three stories and 45 feet.
                            19 West Plan: This Plan encourages live/work and residential loft units
                             in mixed-use developments (FAR 1.25); height limit for residential
                             component is four stories and 60 feet.
                            Mesa West Bluffs: This Plan encourages live/work (FAR 1.25) and
                             residential common interest developments (13 units per acre); height
                             limit is four stories and 60 feet.
                    The creation of the mixed-use overlay zone allows new mixed-use and
                    residential development opportunities. The Urban Plans serve as economic
                    incentive plans that provide guidance to property owners and developers for
                    mixed-use development.
                    Intensity refers to the magnitude of vehicle traffic activity generated by a
                    development. Density refers to the number of dwelling units per acre of land. It
                    is important to note that the density and intensity of mixed-use development are
                    limited by Floor-Area-Ratio (FAR) limits and circulation system capacity. Both
                    the FAR and vehicle trip generation work in concert to ensure that new
                    residential and mixed-use development, as measured by average daily trip
                    generation, do not exceed the capacity of the circulation system.
                    In the Urban Plan areas, density and intensity are therefore not exclusively
                    measured by the number of dwelling units per acre of land. In the SoBECA, 19
                    West, and Mesa West Bluffs Urban Plans, a maximum 1.0 FAR (and up to 1.25
                    FAR in some cases) may be allowed provided that the proposed project will not
                    result in adverse, unmitigable impacts to the City’s circulation system. The

circulation system must continue to operate consistent with adopted Master Plan
of Highways and General Plan goals/policies/objectives.
Specific Plans
Newport Boulevard Specific Plan: This specific plan represents a long-term
vision for the eastside of Newport Boulevard impacted by the 55 Freeway
extension (between 19th Street and Mesa Drive). The Specific Plan includes
issue identification, land use options, development standards and an
implementation program. The intent of the Plan includes working with existing
businesses to provide for a prosperous environment and encouraging marginal
commercial uses to redevelop to residential and less intensive commercial uses.
North Costa Mesa Specific Plan: This specific plan provides a comprehensive
review and analysis of the larger remaining pieces of vacant land and major land
holdings in the northern portion of the City. This plan provides opportunities for
mixed use projects and provisions for affordable housing in selected areas.
Density Bonus Program
Consistent with State law, the City of Costa Mesa offers density bonus incentives
for senior housing projects and projects that reserve a portion of the units as
housing affordable to very low, low, and moderate income households. To
qualify for a density bonus and concessions or other incentives, the developer of
a proposed housing project of at least five units must provide housing units
affordable to very low, low or moderate income households, housing for seniors,
donate land, and/or construct a child care facility. The review of an application
for a density bonus and concession or incentive request is processed as a
planning application and goes through the same processes as a typical planning
application. The City monitors the use of density bonus via its annual reporting
process.
VARIETY OF HOUSING TYPES
General Provisions
Generally, single-family homes (including manufactured homes) are permitted in
all residential zones. Multi-family units are also permitted in all residential zones,
except in R1 zone. Through a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) process, mobile
home parks are permitted in all residential zones, except in R1. Second units are
permitted in the R1 zone.
In addition, residential uses are also allowed in the Planned Development-
Commercial (PDC) and Planned Development-Industrial (PDI) zones. The City’s
Planned Development zones encourage a more efficient use of land through
innovative planning incentives.

                               Second Units
                               A second dwelling unit established in conjunction with and subordinate to a
                               primary dwelling unit. The second unit may be attached to the primary dwelling
                               unit or located in a detached accessory building on the same lot. It may also be
                               referred to as an accessory apartment, granny unit, granny flat, or in-law
                               apartment. Due to the small lot sizes and built out character of the City,
                               opportunities for second units are limited. Nevertheless, second units offer
                               affordable housing opportunities for lower and moderate income households. The
                               passage of AB 1866 (effective July 2003) requires cities to use a ministerial
                               process to consider accessory dwelling units in an effort to facilitate the
                               production of affordable housing statewide. Accessory units should be permitted
                               in all residential zones where a primary single family unit already exists.
                               The City updated its second unit ordinance in 2011 allowing the construction of
                               accessory second units in the R-1 zone and has adopted conditions under which
                               second dwelling units may be permitted. These conditions are consistent with
                               State law and include:
                                        a minimum lot size of 8,500 square feet
                                        Unit size not to exceed 1,200 square feet if detached from the primary
                                         dwelling unit, not to exceed 30 percent of the existing living area of the
                                         primary dwelling unit if attached to the primary dwelling unit
                                        Two open parking spaces shall be provided for the second unit

                           Special Needs Housing
                           The City of Costa Mesa offers a range of housing options for persons with
                           special needs.
                           Residential Care Facility: A residential facility is licensed by the State where
                           care, services, or treatment is provided to persons living in a community
                           residential setting. Residential care facilities that serve six or fewer persons are
                           treated as regular residential use and are permitted where residential uses of the
                           same types are permitted. Residential care facilities for seven or more persons
                           are conditionally permitted in R2-MD, R2-HD, R3, PDR-MD, PDR-HD, PDR-
                           NCM, PDC, and PDI zones.
                           Currently, 71 State-licensed community care facilities with a total capacity of 767
                                                                               5

                                    Adult Residential Care Facilities: 10 facilities totaling 89 beds
                                    Elderly Residential Care Facilities: 44 facilities totaling 491 beds
                                    Group Homes: 10 facilities totaling 69 beds
                                    Small Family Homes: 3 facilities totaling 16 beds
                                    Adult Day Care Facilities: 2 facilities totaling 90 beds
                                    Social Rehabilitation Facilities: 2 facilities totaling 12 beds
                           Residential Services Facility: The Costa Mesa Municipal Code defines a
                           residential services facility as a residential facility, other than a residential care
                           facility, boardinghouse, or single housekeeping unit, where the operator provides
                           to the residents personal services, in addition to housing, including, but not
                           limited to, protection, supervision, assistance, guidance, training, therapy, or
                           other nonmedical care. An example of this type of facility is a sober living
                           program. Residential services facilities that serve six or fewer persons are
                           permitted where residential uses of the same types are permitted. Residential
                           services facilities for seven or more persons are conditionally permitted in R2-
                           MD, R2-HD, R3, PDR-MD, PDR-HD, PDR-NCM, PDC, and PDI zones. There
                           are a number of unlicensed facilities in the City, which number is unknown since
                           a license is not required and they are permitted by right.

                    Referral Facility: A residential care facility or a residential services facility where
                    one or more person's residency in the facility is pursuant to a court order or a
                    directive from an agency in the criminal justice system. Referral facility does not
                    include any residential care facility containing six or fewer residents that is
                    required to be treated as a regular residential use by State law.
                    Referral facilities are conditionally permitted R2-MD, R2-HD, R3, PDR-MD, and
                    PDR-HD zones, subject to the following conditions:
                            No referral facility may be located within 500 feet of property that is as
                             zoned as R-1 or PDR-LD, or within 500 feet of a school, park, place of
                             worship, or licensed day care facility.
                            A referral facility must have a manager on-site, 24 hours every day to
                             ensure the orderly operation of the facility and its compliance with all
                             applicable laws, regulations, and conditions.
                            No referral facility shall admit a resident who has been convicted of any
                             crime involving physical force against a person, illegal possession of a
                             weapon, possession, or use of a weapon in the commission of a crime,
                             or a felony involving a controlled substance.
                    Transitional Housing: As defined by Section 50675.2(h) of Health and Safety
                    Code, transitional housing means buildings configured as rental housing
                    developments, but operated under program requirements that call for the
                    termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible
                    program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no
                    less than six months. The goal of transitional housing is to provide the support
                    needed for participants to move into permanent housing or permanent supportive
                    housing.
                    In December 2012, the City amended the Zoning Code to define transitional
                    housing meeting the definition as outlined in the Health and Safety Code Section
                    50675.2 as a regular residential use and be permitted in same manner as other
                    similar uses in the same zones.
                    Supportive Housing: As defined by Section 50675.14(b) of Health and Safety
                    Code, supportive housing is housing with no limit on length of stay, that is
                    occupied by the target population as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 53260,
                    and that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing
                    resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and
                    maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community.
                    Typically, supportive housing is permanent housing.
                    In December 2012, the City amended the Zoning Code to define supportive
                    housing meeting the definition as outlined in the Health and Safety Code Section
                    50675.14 as a regular residential use and be permitted in same manner as other
                    similar uses in the same zones.
                    Single Room Occupancy (SRO): SROs are allowed in the commercial C1 and
                    C2 zones with a Conditional Use Permit.
                    Emergency Shelters: Senate Bill No. 2 amended Sections 65582, 65583, and
                    65589.5 of the Government Code relating to local planning. This bill added
                    emergency shelters to these provisions and required that the Housing Element
                    identify zones in the City where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted
                    use without a Conditional Use Permit.

                        State law defines an emergency shelter as a means of housing with minimal
                        supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six
                        months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may be
                        denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay. Special needs housing
                        include boarding houses, residential care facilities, and residential service
                        facilities.
                        Currently, the Municipal Code allows small boarding houses and residential care
                        facilities for six or fewer persons as permitted uses in all residential zones (R1,
                        R2-MD, R2-HD, and R3). For example, a small boarding house is a dwelling
                        designed or used to accommodate a maximum of three guests, where
                        guestrooms are provided in exchange for an agreed payment of a fixed amount
                        of money or other compensation based on the period of occupancy. Special
                        needs housing may be provided in large boardinghouses, and these facilities
                        require a conditional use permit in the R2-MD, R2-HD, and R3 zones.
                        In 2012, City's Municipal Code was amended to provide for emergency homeless
                        shelters as a permitted use in the (PDI) Planned Development Industrial) zone as
                        required by Senate Bill 2 (SB 2). Properties zoned PDI are located north of 405
                        Freeway and on the east side close to John Wayne Airport and contain over 115
                        acres of land. Both areas are primarily located along major transportation
                        corridors (Harbor Boulevard and Red Hill Avenue), which make them suitable for
                        emergency shelters. The PDI zones are appropriate zoning districts for
                        accommodating emergency shelters because they offer easy access to public
                        transportation and services. The PDI zones include single tenant buildings as
                        well as office condominium complexes with smaller tenant spaces that could
                        potentially be converted to emergency shelters. Because of high land values in
                        Orange County, the industrial zoned areas in Costa Mesa no longer contain
                        heavy industries; existing uses generally consist of small manufacturing facilities,
                        office uses and ancillary commercial and service uses. In addition, uses that
                        require larger tenant spaces in a comparable commercial setting such as
                        religious and physical fitness studios (yoga and pilate classes) find these areas
                        suitable because of more affordable rents and proximity to major roadways.
                        Overall, 115 acres of land in the City are zoned PDI. With even one percent of
                        these properties converted to emergency shelters, there is potential for a
                        development capacity of 1.2 acres of land. Given that the shelters can be
                        accommodated at a high density, the development of emergency shelters as
                        permitted uses in the PDI zone could satisfy the majority of the annual demand
                        for homeless persons in the City. Emergency shelters can be accommodated
                        with reuse of underutilized properties. Existing buildings may also be converted
                        to accommodate emergency shelters.
                                                                                                               6
                        The Zoning Code establishes the following standards for emergency shelters:
                                 The maximum length of stay shall not exceed 120 days in a 365-day
                                  period.
                                 Each shelter may have a maximum of thirty (30) beds.
6
  In developing the standards for emergency shelters, the City reviewed standards for similar uses. Industrial uses
  require three spaces per 1,000 square feet, commercial uses require four spaces per 1,000 square feet, and
  motels require one parking space per room. As an example, an 80-bed facility would be equivalent in size to an
  8,000-square foot industrial or commercial building, or a 40-room motel; all would require similar or greater
  number of parking spaces. These development standards were also established after consulting the standards
  established by five similar and nearby jurisdictions in Orange County – Newport Beach; Huntington Beach;
  Irvine; Garden Grove; and Brea. The standards adopted by Costa Mesa are the same or similar to those
  adopted by Huntington Beach, Irvine, and Brea.

                             Off-site parking shall be provided at a parking rate of one parking space
                              per four beds and one space per employee.
                             Stays at the Emergency Shelter facility shall be limited between the
                              hours of 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.
                             Nonoperational and unregistered vehicles shall not be kept on site.
                              Towing shall be the responsibility of the shelter operator.
                             Each emergency shelter shall provide an interior and exterior waiting
                              area adequate to accommodate waiting clients and to prevent queuing
                              into the public right-of-way. An exterior waiting area shall be physically
                              separated and visually screened from the public right-of-way.
                             The emergency shelter facility shall provide an on-site resident manager
                              on-site at all times.
                             A minimum distance of 300 feet shall be maintained from another
                              emergency shelter. The distance of separation shall be measured in a
                              straight line between the property lines of each use without regard to
                              intervening structures or objects.
                             The shelter operator shall provide minimum exterior lighting in
                              compliance with City’s Security requirements. In addition, the operator
                              shall regularly patrol the area surrounding the shelter site during hours
                              that the shelter is in operation to ensure that homeless persons who
                              have been denied access are not congregating in the neighborhood.
                             Alcohol and narcotics use and consumption are prohibited within the
                              facility and on the property.
                             An operations plan shall be submitted for review and approval by the
                              Development Services Director and Police Chief prior to operation of the
                              Emergency Shelter. The plan shall include minimum provisions related to
                              on-site security and safety, staff training, loitering control, client eligibility,
                              counseling services, and indoor and outdoor management of the facility.
                    Constraints on Housing for Persons with Disabilities
                    The City of Costa Mesa recognizes the importance of addressing the housing
                    needs of persons with disabilities. This section review potential governmental
                    constraints to the development and improvement of housing for persons with
                    disabilities.
                    Definition of Family: The City’s Zoning Ordinance defines “family” as “one or
                    more persons occupying one dwelling unit and living together as a single
                    housekeeping unit.” This definition is accommodating to different household
                    types including unrelated persons living together. This definition would not
                    constrain the development and rehabilitation of housing for persons with
                    disabilities.
                    Zoning and Land Use: The Zoning Ordinance provides for a range of housing
                    options for persons with special needs, including persons with disabilities.
                    Specifically, the Zoning Ordinance provides for the permitting of residential care
                    facilities, residential services facilities, and referral facilities (see respective
                    discussions above). Such flexible standards have resulted in a large number of

                     residential facilities for persons with disabilities in the City. The Fairview
                     Developmental Center (FDC) is one of the largest residential facilities for
                     developmentally disabled persons in the State. As of September 2012, the FDC
                     had 369 residents and employed a staff of 1,500.7
                     The state-operated Fairview Developmental Center (formerly Fairview State
                     Hospital) provides affordable housing for hospital employees and transitional
                     patients/clients. A long-term lease extending through 2039 was executed
                     between the State of California and the City of Costa Mesa. Entitlements have
                     been established in the late 1970s to allow construction of the Harbor Village
                     apartment housing project in two phases.
                     Phase One of the Harbor Village multi-family residential project included a 144-
                     unit affordable apartment project developed on the Fairview State Hospital
                     property for employee and patient/client housing. This project was approved on
                     December 7, 1981 and became an accessory residential use to the hospital.
                     Phase Two involved the construction of an additional 406 apartments, for a total
                     of 550 units. All of the 550 units in Harbor Village will remain affordable through
                     2039. With a 50-year lease, the long-term affordability of this large apartment
                     community continues to provide housing to numerous low to moderate income
                     FDC employees and patients, which include developmentally disabled persons.
                     The City of Costa Mesa, in its Zoning Ordinance specifically requires the number
                     of handicapped parking spaces to conform to Title 24 of the California Code. All
                     multi-family complexes are required to provide handicapped parking spaces,
                     depending on the size of the development. The City is flexible and would work
                     with the developers of special needs housing and would reduce parking
                     requirements if the applicant can demonstrate a reduced need for parking.
                     Reasonable Accommodation: The Fair Housing Act requires that cities and
                     counties provide reasonable accommodation to rules, policies, practices, and
                     procedures where such accommodation may be necessary to afford individuals
                     with disabilities equal opportunity to housing. The City adopted a reasonable
                     accommodation ordinance in 2000.             A 2009 Zoning Code amendment
                     establishes a procedure to process reasonable accommodation requests as a
                     “minor modification” process (Title 13, Article 15 of the Zoning Code). This article
                     describes the City’s policy to provide reasonable accommodation in accordance
                     with federal and state Fair Housing Acts (42 USC Section 3600 et seq. and
                     Government code Section 12900 et seq.) for persons with disabilities seeking fair
                     access to housing in the application of the City’s zoning laws. The procedure
                     applies to requests for relief from the Zoning Code provisions, regulations,
                     policies, or conditions, and applies to both new construction and modifications.
                     The minor modification process allows City staff to approve these requests
                     administratively. For example, an application for a minor modification is reviewed
                     by the Planning Division with no public notice or public hearing, nor any
                     application fees. Requests can be made by the disabled persons occupying the
                     unit, or owner/operator of housing for persons with disabilities.
                     Costa Mesa continually reviews its ordinances, policies, and practices for
                     compliance with fair housing laws. Costa Mesa broadened and revised definition
                     of “family” to include State and federal definitions relating to unrelated adults. The

                    City’s Municipal Code defines family as being “One (1) or more persons
                    occupying one (1) dwelling unit and living together as a single housekeeping
                    unit.” This is a broad definition and does not constrain or limit development of
                    residential care facilities or other types of specialized housing for unrelated
                    individuals. The Residential Care Facility and Residential Service Facility are
                    defined as follows:

                              addition to housing, including, but not limited to, protection, supervision,
                              assistance, guidance, training, therapy, or other nonmedical care.

                    including single family detached low density districts. Residential care and
                    service facilities serving seven or more persons are subject to a conditional use
                    permit.
                    LOCAL ENTITLEMENT PROCESSING AND FEES
                    Two aspects of local government have been criticized as placing undue burdens
                    on the private sector's ability to build affordable housing. These are: (1) the fees
                    or other exactions required of developers to obtain project approval and, (2) the
                    time delays caused by the review and approval process. Critics contend that
                    lengthy review periods increase financial and carrying costs and that fees and
                    exactions increase expenses. These costs are in part passed onto the
                    prospective homebuyer in the form of higher purchase prices or rents.
                    Processing Procedures
                    The time required to process a project varies tremendously from one project to
                    another and is directly related to the size and complexity of the proposal and the
                    number of actions or approvals needed to complete the process. Table HOU-33
                    identifies the most common steps in the entitlement process. It should be noted that
                    each project does not necessarily have to complete each step in the process (i.e.,
                    small-scale projects consistent with General Plan and zoning designations do not
                    generally require Environmental Impact Reports (EIRs), General Plan Amendments,
                    Rezones, or Variances). Also, certain review and approval procedures may run
                    concurrently. Since most EIRs are prepared in response to a General Plan
                    Amendment request, these two actions are often processed simultaneously. Costa
                    Mesa also encourages the joint processing of related applications for a single
                    project. As an example, a rezone petition for a Planned Development Zone may be
                    reviewed in conjunction with the required Development Plan, a tentative tract map
                    and any necessary variances. Such procedures save time, money and effort for
                    both the public and private sector.
                    Generally, the process begins when the applicant submits their planning application,
                    fees, and required number of plans. A Development Review committee determines
                    if the plans are accurate and complete. This review generally takes about 30 days.
                    If the plans are accurate and complete, the application is accepted for processing, a
                    Project Planner is assigned to the project, and a public hearing is scheduled. An
                    Office Specialist then prepares draft publications and notices and distributes the file

                           application. The Project Planner prepares a staff report, and at the same time, the
                           Office Specialist mails, posts, and publishes public notices. When staff reports are
                           completed, they are distributed and posted to the website prior to the public hearing.
                           The Planning Commission conducts a public hearing and approves, conditionally
                           approves, or denies the application. The process from the time that the Project
                           Planner is assigned to the project to the time that it goes to the Planning
                           Commission is typically six to eight weeks.

                                     utilities.
                                    Protect residential neighborhoods from excessive noise, illumination,
                                     unsightliness, odor, smoke and other objectionable influences.
                                    Locate development which retains the scale and character of existing
                                     residential neighborhoods and facilitates the upgrade of declining and
                                     mixed-density residential neighborhoods.

                           Planning and Development Fees
                           A brief survey shows that the planning application fees charged by the City of
                           Costa Mesa are generally lower than surrounding cities (Table HOU-34). For
                           example, Costa Mesa imposed a fee of $3,560 for a General Plan Amendment
                           which is significantly lower than fees charged by Huntington Beach, Fountain
                           Valley, and the deposits required by Newport Beach and Irvine. Only Santa Ana
                           had a lower fee for General Plan Amendment. The City of Irvine charges the
                           processing of a General Plan Amendment hourly at $128 per hour and Newport
                           Beach at a rate of $155 per hour. Based on the deposit required, it is estimated
                           that this cost is higher than the fixed fee charged by Costa Mesa.
                           Furthermore, the City provides fee credits for existing development against new
                           development. The developer is required to pay certain fees for only the net
                           increase of residential units on site. Fee credits are available for park fees,
                           sanitation district fees, and traffic impact fees. Park fees and traffic impact fees
                           can also be deferred until the issuance of Certificates of Occupancy. The City is
                           also in the process of re-evaluating the park fees, potentially reducing the fee.

                           Fees, land dedications, or improvements are also required in most instances to
                           provide an adequate supply of public park land and to provide necessary public
                           improvements (streets, sewers, and storm drains) to support the new development.
                           While such costs are charged to the developer, most, if not all, additional costs are
                           passed to the ultimate product consumer in the form of higher prices or rents. The
                           significance of the necessary public works improvements in determining final
                           costs varies greatly from project to project. The improvements are dependent on
                           the amount of existing improvements and nature of the project.
                           Costa Mesa also assesses a traffic impact fee on an incremental basis, as shown
                           in Table HOU-35. Various governmental agencies also charge fees depending
                           on the service and the location of the project. A summary of these fees are
                           presented in Table HOU-36. Based on the City’s schedules of fees, the
                           development of a typical multi-family apartment complex is estimated to require
                           $29,581 in fees per unit. This is a nine-percent increase from the estimate made in
                           2007, indicating an annual increase of approximately 1.8 percent in fees.

                            ON-/OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS
                            Costs associated with site improvements are an important component of new
                            residential development costs. Site improvements costs are applied to provide
                            sanitary sewer and water service to a project, to make necessary transportation
                            improvements, and to provide other infrastructure to the project. Improvements
                            required may include grading, surfacing, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, culverts,
                            bridges, storm drains, water mains and service connections to the property line
                            with cutoff valves, sanitary sewers and such other structures or improvements as
                            may be required by ordinance for the general use of the lot owners in the
                                                                                HOUSING ELEMENT  PAGE HOU-51

                    subdivision and for local neighborhood traffic and drainage needs. In addition,
                    the City may require the payment for various offsite improvements as part of
                    project mitigation measures (e.g., payment towards an offsite traffic signal).
                    Developers of new residential projects are also required to construct all onsite
                    streets, sidewalks, curb, gutter, and affected portions of offsite arterials. The cost
                    for site improvements varies from project to project. Even for infill projects where
                    infrastructure may already be available, there is often a need to upgrade and/or
                    expand the existing improvements to serve new residential development. Curbs,
                    gutters, and drainage facilities direct storm and runoff water out of residential
                    developments.
                    City roadways are required to be paved. Pavement creates an all-weather
                    roadway, facilitates roadway drainage, and reduces dust. It also produces a high
                    speed circulation system and facilitates relatively safe traffic movement.
                    Roadways are classified by the City according to traffic needs. They are as
                    follows:
                             Major Arterial – 6-Lane Divided Roadway (104 feet)
                             Primary Arterial – 4-Lane Divided Roadway (80 feet)
                             Secondary Arterial – 4-Lane Undivided Roadway (72 feet)
                             Collector Arterial – 2-Lane Undivided Roadway (60 feet)
                    Arterials and collectors are designated on the General Plan according to existing
                    and projected needs. Developers are responsible for the development of
                    roadways associated with the residential project.          As the City’s circulation
                    system is already well established, street improvements required relate primarily
                    to traffic mitigation measures, such as installation of stoplights or stop signs, curb
                    cuts for ingress/egress, installation of turn lanes, or bike paths. Significant
                    dedication of land for new streets is not anticipated for most residential
                    developments in the City.
                    Development of and connection to municipal water and sewer services are
                    required as a condition of approving tract maps. Water service is necessary for a
                    constant supply of potable water. Sewer services are necessary for the sanitary
                    disposal of wastewater. These off-site requirements, which increase costs of
                    development, also allow for the development of much higher residential
                    densities.
                    The City’s on- and off-site improvement requirements are typical for urban
                    development in a highly developed community. While these improvements add
                    to the cost of housing, they do not constrain housing development as these
                    improvements are similarly required in all surrounding communities.
                    BUILDING CODES AND ENFORCEMENT
                    Compliance with Building Code standards is necessary to protect the health,
                    safety and welfare of the citizens. The City of Costa Mesa currently uses the
                    California 2010 Building Code (effective January 1, 2011) and no local
                    amendments have been made to the Code that might diminish the ability to
                    accommodate housing development in general or housing for persons with
                    disabilities in particular.

                      DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT
                      Redevelopment tax increment financing was once the most significant resource
                      the City of Costa Mesa had in facilitating the provision of affordable housing in
                      the community. With the dissolution of redevelopment in California as of January
                      2012, the City’s ability to provide affordable housing has been seriously
                      compromised. Without the low and moderate income housing funds from tax
                      increments, the City has limited financial resources to provide direct gap
                      financing or provide assistance through land write-downs or land banking
                      activities.
                      MARKET CONSTRAINTS
                      The private market influences the selling and rental prices of all types of housing.
                      While actions within the public sector play important parts in determining the cost of
                      housing, the private sector affects the residential markets through such mechanisms
                      as supply costs (i.e., land, construction, financing) and value of consumer
                      preference.
                      AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING
                      A constraint affecting housing costs is the cyclical nature of the housing industry.
                      Housing production can vary widely from year to year with periods of above-
                      average production followed by periods of below-average production. Fluctuations
                      are common in most industries but appear to be more volatile in the homebuilding
                      sector because of susceptibility of the industry to changes in federal fiscal and
                      monetary policies.
                      One significant component to overall housing cost is financing. After decades of
                      slight fluctuations in the prime interest rate, the 1980s saw a rise in interest rates
                      that peaked at approximately 18.8 percent in 1982. As the decade closed and
                      the economy weakened, the prevailing interest rate was around ten percent. The
                      decade of the 1990s saw interest rates drop dramatically, fluctuating between six
                      and eight percent. During the past five years interest rates dropped substantially
                      and currently, interest rates are around three to four percent. The substantial
                      drop in the cost of fixed rate mortgages and the widespread use of adjustable
                      rate mortgages have substantially decreased the effects of financing on the
                      purchase of a home.
                      However, as creative financing (e.g., zero downpayment, short-term fixed rate,
                      and interest only loans) allowed an increased number of households to enter
                      homeownership, it also led to escalations in home prices and increased number
                      of households buying beyond their financial means.                 Since late 2006,
                      foreclosures have become an issue impacting many households in Southern
                      California. In October 2012, mortgage default filings hit their lowest point since
                      first-quarter 2007, due in large part to a stronger economy and housing market
                      and more short sales, a real estate information service reported. According to
                                                                                                          8
                      Dataquick, between 2011 and 2012 notices of default decreased by 32 percent.
                      COST OF LAND
                      The cost of residential land has a direct impact on the cost of a new housing unit
                      and is, therefore, a potential market constraint. The higher the land costs, the
                      higher the price of a new unit.

                    The City of Costa Mesa is almost built out. Available vacant residential land will
                    become increasingly scarce over time, especially when considering the lack of
                    annexation opportunities. The cost of residential vacant land will continue to
                    increase in the City of Costa Mesa and will play a role in the prices passed on to
                    the consumer. The scarce supply of vacant land will influence residential
                    intensification and conversion in the future.
                    According to listings on Homes.com, there was only one residentially zoned
                    vacant lot for sale in the City of Costa Mesa in 2012. The 8,570 square foot lot
                    was for sale for $599,000 equating to $70.31 per square foot. However, the
                    property has been listed for sale for several months.
                    COST OF CONSTRUCTION
                    The costs of building materials are a major cost associated with constructing a
                    new housing unit. A reduction in amenities and the quality of building materials
                    (above a minimum acceptability for health, safety, and adequate performance)
                    could result in lower sales prices. In addition, prefabricated, factory-built housing
                    may provide for lower priced housing by reducing construction and labor costs.
                    Another factor related to construction costs is the number of units built at one
                    time. As the number increases, overall costs generally decrease, as builders are
                    able to take advantage of the benefits of economies of scale. This type of cost
                    reduction is of particular benefit when density bonuses are used for the provision
                    of affordable housing.
                    Product design and consumer expectations also influence the types and styles of
                    units being constructed in this area. Today's new homes are quite different than
                    those produced during the 1960s. Numerous interior and exterior design
                    features (larger master bedroom suites, microwave ovens, trash compactors,
                    dishwashers, wet bars, decorative roofing materials, exterior trim, and archi-
                    tectural style) make it difficult to make direct comparisons in costs over the years.
                    In a highly competitive and sophisticated market such as Southern California,
                    many consumers consider these "extra touches" as necessities when buying a
                    new home. While the basic shelter or "no frills" house has met with varying
                    degrees of consumer acceptance, the high costs of homeownership may lead to
                    a return to less complicated designs.
                    CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION
                    As the willingness to pay rent decreases, the private market can push apartment
                    owners toward conversion to condominiums units. A condominium conversion
                    can be a constraint on the maintenance of affordable housing and especially
                    impact rental units that may serve the lower income segments of the community.
                    Recent legislation has sought to curb the effects of condominium conversions on
                    the maintenance of housing.
                    The City of Costa Mesa manages condominium conversions or residential
                    common interest development conversions through the City Zoning Code. The
                    City recognizes condominium conversion serve as an important source of
                    moderately priced homeownership opportunities compared to new construction.
                    Due to the increase in conversion activities over the past few years and concern
                    over the quality of converted units, the City Council adopted a new Condominium
                    Conversion Ordinance on September 4, 2007. The ordinance removed the
                    critical rental vacancy rate as a condition for permitting conversion but included
                    specific development standards to ensure the quality of the converted units. In

                        addition, requirements are established for life safety, plumbing, security,

                        utilities. However, condominium conversion is not expected to impact the rental
                        market significantly over the next few years due to the current credit market
                        crisis.

                        REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS
                        State Housing Element law requires that a local jurisdiction accommodate a
                        share of the region’s projected housing needs for the planning period. This
                        share, called the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), is important
                        because State law mandates that jurisdictions provide sufficient land to
                        accommodate a variety of housing opportunities for all economic segments of the
                        community. Compliance with this requirement is measured by the jurisdiction’s
                        ability in providing adequate land to accommodate the RHNA.
                        The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), as the regional
                        planning agency, is responsible for allocating the RHNA to individual jurisdictions
                                                                                           9
                        within the six-county region, including the County of Orange. The Orange
                        County Council of Governments (OCCOG), a subregional planning organization,
                        worked closely with SCAG to develop the RHNA for Orange County jurisdictions.
                        ADEQUATE SITES COMMITMENT FROM PRIOR RHNA (2008-2013)
                        AB 1233 amended the State Housing Element law to promote the effective and
                        timely implementation of local housing elements. If a jurisdiction fails to
                        implement programs in its Housing Element to identify adequate sites or fails to
                        adopt an adequate Housing Element, this bill requires local governments to zone
                        or rezone adequate sites by the first year of the new planning period. The
                        rezoning of sites is intended to address any portion of the Regional Housing
                        Needs Allocation (RHNA) that was not met because the jurisdiction failed to
                        identify or make available adequate sites in the previous planning period.
                        For the 2008-2014 Housing Element, the City of Costa Mesa was allocated a
                        RHNA of 1,682 units as follows:
                                 Extremely Low/Very Low-Income (up to 50 percent of AMI): 353 units
                                  (21.0 percent)
                                 Low-Income (51 to 80 percent of AMI): 289 units (17.2 percent)
                                 Moderate-Income (81 to 120 percent of AMI): 330 units (19.6 percent)
                                 Above Moderate-Income (more than 120 percent of AMI): 710 units (42.2
                                  percent)
                        The 2008-2014 Housing Element includes a sites inventory with a capacity for
                        4,155 units: 407 very low-income units; 291 low-income units; 1,424 moderate
                        income units; and 2,051 above moderate-income units. To reach this capacity,
                        the City committed to two specific actions:

                            Extend affordability control on 160 units at Bethel Towers for 55 years
                             (88 very-low income units and 72 low-income units). In exchange, the
                             City would provide finance assistance for rehabilitating the property.
                            Amend the General Plan and rezone 13.6 acres of land of the Fairview
                             Developmental Center site by the end of 2009 to High-Density
                             Residential to allow development at a density of 30 units per acre. The
                             2008 Housing Element assumed 320 total units on this site, with 170
                             units set aside as lower income housing (85 very-low income and 85 low-
                             income units).
                    Status Update on Adequate Sites Commitments
                    Due to various reasons, the owner of Bethel Towers withdrew participation in the
                    City’s program to extend the affordability covenant in exchange for financial
                    assistance. While in 2012 Bethel Towers, through tax-exempt revenue bonds,
                    extended its affordability covenant for 55 years, this extension was not completed
                    within the allowable timeframe under State law, or utilized any City funding to
                    receive RHNA credits. The State Department of Developmental Services also
                    withdrew its application for residential development on the Fairview
                    Developmental Center.
                    Combined these two actions would have accounted for 330 lower income units
                    (173 very-low income and 157 low-income units) and 150 above moderate-
                    income units. The 2008-2013 Housing Element demonstrated an excess
                    capacity of over 1,340 units for above moderate income households, more than
                    adequate to compensate for the 150 above moderate-income units due to the
                    withdrawal of the Fairview Developmental Center project. However, the City
                    would need to demonstrate its ability to accommodate the 330 lower income
                    units (173 very-low income and 157 low-income units).
                    Replacement Sites for the RHNA Shortfall
                    Sakioka Lot 2: Located within the North Costa Mesa Specific Plan, Sakioka Lot
                    2 is a 33-acre site that is designated for future commercial and residential
                    development. The site was designated Urban Center Commercial by the
                    General Plan and zoned PDC (Planned Development Commercial). The General
                    Plan/Specific Plan originally established a maximum FAR of 0.50 for retail and
                    0.50 for office uses, and a density limit of 20 units per acre for residential uses.
                    This vacant lot was included in the 2008-2014 Housing Element for being able to
                    accommodate moderate income housing at an average density of 16 units per
                    acre and for a total of 528 units. The 2008-2014 Housing Element demonstrated
                    a capacity for 1,424 moderate income units, compared to a RHNA of 330
                    moderate income units.
                    The original FAR and density limits were found to have unintended effects of
                    excluding different types of mixed use development. In November 2011, the City
                    amended the General Plan and Specific Plan to remove the office and retail FAR
                    limits and to increase the maximum density of residential mixed use development
                    to 28 units per acre at Sakioka Lot 2. Assuming an average density of 22.4 units
                    per acre (at 80 percent of the maximum allowable density), up to 739 units can
                    be accommodated on this site.
                    Urban Plan Areas: The 19 West Urban Plan area consists of 103 acres of

                    Westside, generally along 19th Street, Superior Boulevard, and southeast of
                    Victoria Street and Placentia Avenue. The mixed-use overlay zone allows
                    horizontal and vertical mixed-use development pursuant to an approved Master
                    Plan. Live/work developments are conditional uses in this plan area.
                    Approximately 29 acres of commercially-zoned property within the 19 West
                    mixed-use overlay district could potentially serve as future adequate sites for
                    affordable housing, at residential densities of up to 30 units per acre as part of a
                    mixed-use development. The 19 West Urban Plan area is identified as a
                    revitalization area. Existing uses on these parcels include marginal commercial
                    uses with aging structures, bars, mini-markets, and neighborhood retail centers
                    which do not fully realize the development potential in the mixed-use overlay
                                                                                                  th
                    zone. Mixed-use development along a major arterial such as West 19 Street
                    could become dynamic, commercial destinations.
                    In the 2008-2014 Housing Element, only a handful of underutilized sites were
                    included in the sites inventory to fulfill the previous RHNA. The 19 West Urban
                    Plan contains more opportunities than identified in the 2008-2014 Housing
                    Element. Table HOU-38 identifies a list of underutilized sites that were not
                    included in the 2008-2014 Housing Element. No development has occurred on
                    these sites due to the housing market conditions. These properties are available
                    for lower income housing through the Mixed Use Overlay.
                    Mixed Use Overlay can be applied to these parcels for mixed use developments
                    up to 30 units per acre. The allowable FAR in the 19 West Urban Plan area is
                    1.0. The selected parcels all have existing FAR of less than 0.30, indicating
                    significant potential for intensification on these properties. The parcels identified
                    in Table HOU-38 can potentially be redeveloped as mixed-use developments,
                    with a capacity for 75 additional units.
                    With the General Plan and Specific Plan amendments for Sakioka Lot 2 and
                    additional underutilized sites in the 19 West Urban Plan area, the City has more
                    than replaced the 330-unit shortfall in sites resulted from the withdrawn Fairview
                    Development Center project and delayed preservation of Bethel Tower.

                              Affordable Housing Densities
                              State Housing Element law has established a default density of 30 units per acre
                              as being feasible for facilitating housing for lower income households in
                              urbanized communities within a metropolitan area. The table below lists many
                              affordable housing projects in Orange County and north San Diego County that
                              have been approved or constructed at less than 25 units per acre. Affordable
                              apartment projects approved or built in recent years include, Ability First
                              Apartments (12.0 du/ac), Avocado Court (16.2 du/ac), Brighton Place (18.9

                                                             CITY OF COSTA MESA
RHNA FOR 2014-2021 PLANNING PERIOD
For the 2013-2021 Housing Element, the RHNA covers a planning period from
January 1, 2014 through October 31, 2021. The RHNA is distributed by income
category. For the 2014-2021 RHNA period, the City of Costa Mesa has been
allocated a RHNA of only two units as follows:
         Extremely Low/Very Low-Income (up to 50 percent of AMI): one unit (50
          percent)
         Low-Income (51 to 80 percent of AMI): one unit (50 percent)
The City must ensure the availability of residential sites at adequate densities
and appropriate development standards to accommodate these two units.
As demonstrated in Table HOU-37 above, the City has identified underutilized
sites in the 19 West Urban Plan area with the capacity to accommodate 75 units.
Furthermore, Sakioka Lot 2 has to potential to accommodate 739 units, more
than adequate to accommodate the new RHNA of two units.
Development potential is also available at the “Argotech” site. This 9.1-acre site
                         th
located at 671 West 17 Street has a General Plan designation of Light Industrial
and is zoned MG (General Industrial). Located within the Mesa West Bluffs
Urban Plan area, the site can accommodate residential uses under the current
overlay zoning, which allows residential development at 13 units per acre or 20
units per acre if live/work housing is proposed.
This large industrial site contains multiple buildings (office and manufacturing)
and has not been in full operation for many years, with subleases to multiple
users. Prior to the economic downturn, the site was in the market for sale.
Currently, there is new development interest for this site.

                    ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
                    Based on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (last updated December 3, 2009),
                    there are no residential properties located in flood hazard areas in City of
                    Costa Mesa. All residentially zoned properties are within Zone X (either
                    areas outside the 0.2 percent annual chance floodplain or areas of 0.2
                    percent annual chance flood with one percent annual chance with
                    average depth of less than one foot or with drainage areas less than 1
                    square mile). This is also applicable to Sakioka Lot 2 (14850 Sunflower
                    Ave.) zoned Planned Development Commercial proposed with residential
                    uses of up to 28 du/acre.
                    The Urban Plan areas are urbanized areas with existing development on
                    the majority of the properties. Future development will involve recycling
                    of existing uses and will be subject to CEQA Guidelines. No major
                    environmental constraints exist to preclude residential/mixed use
                    developments in the Urban Plan areas; however, each development site
                    will be evaluated during the entitlement process and appropriate
                    mitigation measures will be required as applicable. Development on the
                    Sakioka Lot 2 and Argo Tech site may require remediation of hazardous
                    materials due to agricultural and industrial uses, respectively.
                    FINANCIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES
                    Efforts by the City to provide affordable housing through new construction,
                    acquisition/rehabilitation, and preservation (of at-risk housing) must be able to
                    draw upon two types of resources: organizational and financial.
                    ORGANIZATIONAL RESOURCES
                    The following agencies are potential organizations with interest, experience, and
                    capacity in the development and preservation of affordable housing in Orange
                    County:
                            Habitat for Humanity of Orange County (Santa Ana)
                            Orange County Community Housing Corporation (Orange)
                            Jamboree Housing Corporation (Irvine)
                            BRIDGE Housing Corporation (San Francisco)
                            Century Housing Corporation (Culver City)
                            National Community Renaissance of California (Rancho Cucamonga)
                    FINANCIAL RESOURCES
                    The following is a list of potential financial resources considered a part of the
                    City's overall financial plan to address affordable housing needs.
                            HOME Program: The City of Costa Mesa receives approximately
                             $360,000 in HOME funds annually. HOME funds are used primarily for
                             rehabilitation loans and grants, and acquisition/rehabilitation of rental
                             units.

        Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds: The City of
         Costa Mesa receives approximately $1 million in CDBG funds annually.
         CDBG funds are used primarily for rental and owner housing
         rehabilitation activities, infrastructure and public facility improvements,
         and public services.
        Orange County Housing Authority (OCHA): The Orange County
         Housing Authority administers two programs: Conventional Public
         Housing and Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program. The
         Conventional Public Housing Program includes housing developments
         that are owned and managed by OCHA. The Section 8 Housing Choice
         Voucher Program is a tenant-based rental subsidy. As of March 2013,
         442 very low income households in Costa Mesa were receiving rental
         assistance.
        Redevelopment Agency Tax Increment Funds: The elimination of
         redevelopment agencies in the State of California prompted the creation
         of the Costa Mesa Housing Authority to serve as the Successor Agency
         to the Costa Mesa Redevelopment Agency. The Housing Authority
         performs the City‘s housing functions, administers Recognized
         Obligation Payment Schedule (ROPS), liquidates the Redevelopment
         Agency‘s (RDA) assets, and pays off debts. The loss of the Costa Mesa
         RDA may significantly impair the production of affordable housing in the
         future unless the City can identify an alternate funding source. The status
         of obligated funds is unknown at this time. The Housing Authority is
         waiting for the State Department of Finance to issue a Finding of
         Completion that will indicate whether any obligated funds can be
         retained.
ENERGY CONSERVATION,                          GREEN        BUILDINGS,         AND
SUSTAINABLE RESOURCES
CITY PROGRAMS
The City of Costa Mesa recognizes the urgent need for regional energy
conservation. Conservation at average consumer level can be accomplished by
reducing the use of energy-consuming items, or by physically modifying existing
structures and land uses. Current state requirements such as Title 24 of the
California Administrative Code, with specifications relating to insulation, glazing,
heating and cooling systems, water heaters, swimming pool heaters, and several
other items require the minimum standards. The City of Costa Mesa has far
exceeded the minimum standards by inclusion of conservation measures in the
City’s General Plan Conservation Element, creating zoning districts promoting
urbanized and sustainable development by adoption of urban plans and, in day to
day building permit and construction operation by creation of the Costa Mesa Build
Green Programs. Each of these policies and programs are discussed in detail as
follows.
At the land use and policy level, the General Plan Conservation Element
encourages uses of alternative energy sources and passive and active solar energy
such as:
     1) Passive solar energy referring to the design of buildings to take
         maximum advantage of the sun for heating and cooling through
                                                   HOUSING ELEMENT  PAGE HOU-61

                             appropriate use of windows, overhangs and other shading devices,
                             building materials, and landscaping.
                         2) Active solar energy involving the use of solar collectors and related
                             plumbing and mechanical facilities to heat water, building interiors, or
                             swimming pools.
                    Urban Plans Promote Sustainable Communities and Green Technology
                    The City of Costa Mesa recognizes that land use policies could have a direct affect
                    on sustainable development and consequently consumption of energy for
                    transportation. Concentration of higher density housing and employment centers
                    along major transportation corridors increases the convenience of public transit and
                    may encourage reduced use of private automobiles with a corresponding reduction
                    in vehicular fuel consumption.
                    In an effort to promote revitalization of older industrial properties and provide more
                    housing opportunities, the City of Costa Mesa adopted three urban plans as land
                    use/zoning tools for the west side that promote integrated or mixed-use
                    developments and offer the opportunity for people to live within walking distance of
                    employment and/or shopping and services. The urban plans are intended for more
                    intense land uses compatible with the urban nature of the surroundings.
                    Build Green
                    The City’s promotes green building techniques through the City website. A
                    dedicated section of the website provides links to important resources and
                    educational materials on the benefits of building green. Furthermore, the City offers
                    a 50-percent discount on permits for solar panels.
                    Citywide Landscape Design Ordinance
                    The City will continue to implement the citywide landscape design ordinance and
                    water efficient landscape guidelines which encourage use of plant materials
                    suitable for soil and climate conditions and plant selection that are drought
                    tolerant plants and require low-flow irrigation systems. The ordinance also
                    requires landscape maintenance practices which foster long-term water
                    conservation such as performing routine irrigation system repair and
                    adjustments, scheduling irrigation based on the California Irrigation Management
                    Information System, use of moisture-sensing or rain shut-off devices, and
                    conducting water audits.
                    COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS
                    Water and Energy Conservation
                    The City’s water/sewer service provider, Mesa Consolidated Water District,
                    implements the Ultra-Low Flush Toilet Rebate Program and other water
                    conservation programs. The district provides monthly newsletters highlighting
                    water conservation and the current California water crisis. As a public education
                    service, the Water District has recently planted a Demonstration Garden as an
                    example and resource to demonstrate reducing outdoor water usage, and
                    protecting natural resources. The City will continue collaborative efforts with the
                    water district to promote water conservation and public awareness. A link to
                    these programs is provided on the City’s website. Additionally, in congruence

                                                                            CITY OF COSTA MESA
            with Senate Bill 1087 the City will provide a copy of the adopted 2013-2021
            Housing Element to Mesa Consolidated Water District within 30 days of adoption.
            Southern California Edison (SCE) Conservation Programs
            The City will continue to cooperate with SCE for disseminating public information
            about SCE energy conservation programs. This information is currently provided
            under the City’s website.
            In addition to the noted efforts by the utility providers, public awareness bulletins
            and articles are regularly included in the Costa Mesa Community News as part of
            City’s effort to encourage energy conservation and to offer information on build
            green incentives and programs.
5.8 GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
            Costa Mesa's housing goals concentrate on five specific aspects of the housing
            market. Goals are provided to address each of these issues, and policies are
            developed to support and implement each goal. The five priorities are:
                    Preserving and enhancing existing housing and neighborhoods;
                    Preserving affordability;
                    Providing adequate sites;
                    Providing adequate housing opportunities and accessibility for all segments
                     of the community; and
                    Encouraging coordination and cooperation.
            FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION
            Prior to the development of a program-specific housing strategy, it is necessary
            to establish the relative priorities of the identified housing needs and to assess
            the nature and extent of the City's existing housing programs.
            The process of prioritizing housing needs involves the identification of target
            households and neighborhoods as well as a preliminary analysis of the most
            appropriate housing programs and/or resources to meet these needs.
            TARGET HOUSEHOLDS AND NEIGHBORHOODS
            High construction costs, coupled with the diminishing availability of vacant land, limit
            the large scale expansion of the housing stock. Preservation and enhancement of
            the City's existing neighborhoods is vital to the maintenance of a viable urban
            community.
            In particular, target neighborhoods have: 1) significant concentrations of low- and
            moderate-income persons, or blighted and deteriorated housing; and 2) community
            development needs in terms of housing, public facilities, and public improvements.
            As such, these neighborhoods should be targeted for housing programs/assistance.
            Currently, there are several target neighborhoods identified throughout the

                                        but not limited to mobile home parks and manufactured home
                                        parks, from the encroachment of incompatible or potentially
                                        disruptive land uses and/or activities.

                   accommodation (i.e., persons with disabilities, family-members,
                   landlords, etc.), timeframes for decision-making, and provision
                   for relief from the various land-use, zoning, or building
                   regulations that may constrain the housing for persons of
                   disabilities.
     HOU-2.7       Monitor the implementation of the City’s ordinances, codes,
                   policies, and procedures to ensure they comply with the
                   “reasonable accommodation” for disabled provisions and all fair

GOAL HOU-3:
PROVISION OF ADEQUATE SITES
It is the goal of the City of Costa Mesa to provide adequate, suitable sites for
residential use and development or maintenance of a range of housing that varies
sufficiently in terms of cost, design, size, location, and tenure to meet the housing
needs of all segments of the community at a level that can be supported by

                   commercial, and/or industrial land to residential, where feasible
                   and consistent with environmental conditions that are suitable for
                   new residential development.
     HOU-3.2       Provide opportunities for the development of well planned and
                   designed projects which, through vertical or horizontal integration,
                   provide for the development of compatible residential, commercial,
                   industrial, institutional, or public uses within a single project or
                   neighborhood.

                                        implement programs to balance employment growth with the ability
                                        to provide housing opportunities affordable to the incomes of the
                                        newly created job opportunities.
                          HOU-3.4       Consider the potential impact on housing opportunities and existing
                                        residential neighborhoods when reviewing rezone petitions
                                        affecting residential properties.
                          HOU-3.5       Encourage transit-oriented development along transportation
                                        corridors.

                    age, household composition or size, source of income, or any other arbitrary factors.
                          HOU-4.1       Support the intent and spirit of equal housing opportunities as
                                        expressed in Federal and State fair housing laws.
                          HOU-4.2       Continue to provide fair housing and counseling services for all
                                        Costa Mesa residents in an effort to remove barriers and promote
                                        access to affordable housing in the City.
                          HOU-4.3       Encourage programs that address the housing needs of senior
                                        citizens.

                    appropriate federal, state, regional, and local governments and/or agencies and to
                    cooperate in the implementation of intergovernmental housing programs to ensure
                    maximum effectiveness in solving local and regional housing problems.

                    4. Incentives for Affordable Housing
                    The City will continue to pursue funding, partner with nonprofits and provide
                    incentives (such as density bonus and deferred impact fees) to developers that
                    agree to reserve a portion of the project units for lower income households
                    (including extremely low income), moderate income households (common interest
                    developments only), or for seniors and the disabled. The City will also defer
                    payment of fees for affordable housing projects upon certificate of occupancy.
                    2013-2021 Objectives: Promote the use of density bonus incentives and deferral

                    Due to the small lot sizes and built out character of the City, opportunities for second
                    units are limited. Nevertheless, second units offer affordable housing opportunities
                    for lower and moderate income households. Since 2008, three second units have
                    been built.

8. Preservation of At-Risk Housing
Overall, 267 housing units in the City of Costa Mesa are considered at risk of
converting to market-rate housing. Specifically 25 projects with 156 affordable units
are at risk due to the expiring density bonus agreements executed during the
1990s. Two projects – 75-unit Casa Bella and 36-unit St. John’s Manor – are at risk
due to the potential expiration of the Section 8 contracts.
2013-2021 Objectives: Monitor at-risk status of affordable units. For Casa Bella,
work with HUD and the property owner to extend the Section 8 rent subsidy
contract. Notify tenants of potential risk of conversion at least one year prior to
                                                     HOUSING ELEMENT  PAGE HOU-69

                    conversion. Provide information regarding HUD’s special vouchers set aside for
                    households losing project-based Section 8 assistance (applicable to Casa Bella
                    only). Work with property owners and nonprofit housing providers to pursue State
                    and federal funds for preserving at-risk housing. For density bonus projects, require
                    property owners to inform the tenants of affordable units at least two years in
                    advance of the expiration of affordability controls to allow tenants adequate time to
                    explore other affordable housing options. Work to replenish the City’s affordable
                    housing inventory via the City’s Density Bonus ordinance to create new affordable
                    units.

                    9. Condominium Conversion
                    According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the percentage of owner-occupied households
                    compared to renter households is 43% (owner) and 57% (renter). The City
                    recognizes the importance of offering affordable homeownership opportunities in
                    order to promote a balanced and diverse community. The City will revisit its
                    condominium conversion ordinance to remove potential constraints to conversion.
                    Specifically, many apartment developments would not be able to meet the City’s
                    current parking and open space requirements. The City will adopt an ordinance to
                    promote development streamlining and condominium conversion.
                    2013-2021 Objectives: Adopt condominium conversion ordinance in Zoning Code
                    in 2014 with the objective of removing constraints to conversion.

                    10. Adaptive Reuse for Multi-Family Housing
                    To expand housing options in the community, the City may allow, subject to a
                    Zoning Code Amendment authorized by the City Council, the adaptive reuse of
                    an existing motel use to a residential use for multi-family housing.
                    2013-2021 Objectives: Process Zoning Code Amendment in 2014/15 to allow a
                    discretionary review of motel conversions to multi-family housing.

                    11. Supportive Services for Persons with Special Needs
                    The City recognizes certain segments of the population require additional
                    assistance to secure decent housing and supportive services. Special needs
                    groups in Costa Mesa include: seniors, persons with disabilities (including
                    developmental disabilities), homeless and at-risk homeless, and low income families
                    (including large households, female-headed households).
                    Through the annual action plan process for the CDBG program, the City evaluates
                    the needs of various special needs groups and allocation CDBG Public Service
                    dollars accordingly. The City will continue to expend CDBG funds in a manner that

addresses local needs and augments the regional continuum of care system in
Orange County.
2013-2021 Objectives: Conduct needs assessment through the annual planning
and performance review processes of the CDBG program. Through the CDBG
Request for Proposal process, annually identify service gaps and prioritize funding
allocations. Provide public service grants to:
        Support existing local service providers that assist households that are at
         risk of becoming homeless. Assistance may include short-term financial
         subsidy to prevent eviction, foreclosure and/or utility termination and
         support services such as case management, budgeting/job search
         assistance, and food/clothing (160 persons total).
        Support existing local service agencies that provide short-term shelter (up
         to 3 months) to households that are in immediate need of shelter and
         support services. Funding may be focused on but not limited to assisting
         households that are escaping domestic violence (40 persons total).
        Support existing local service agencies that provide transitional housing (3
         to 24 months) to homeless households that are stabilized yet still require
         housing, case management, and other life skills in order to become self
         sufficient (80 persons total).
        Provide financial support to public and nonprofit organizations that provide
         direct services to seniors and frail elderly. Services should help seniors and
         the frail elderly maintain their independent living situation or ensure they are
         provided service that improves quality of life (1,600 seniors total).
        Provide financial support to public and nonprofit organizations that provide
         direct services to disabled and developmentally disabled. Services will help
         clients maintain their independent living situation or ensure they are
         provided service that improves quality of life (240 persons total).

PROVISION OF ADEQUATE SITES
12. Adequate Sites
The City will maintain an inventory of vacant and underutilized sites and provide this
inventory to interested developers. The City will monitor its status of meeting the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) annually and ensure that the City has
adequate sites available to accommodate its RHNA of two units. The City will
promote incentives available for housing, live/work development, and mixed-use
development in its Urban Plan areas.
2013-2021 Objectives: Update inventory of vacant and underutilized sites annually
and provide information to interested developers. Pursue opportunities for transit-
oriented development as part of the City’s General Plan update. Annually monitor
the status of the Fairview Developmental Center’s intent for the future use of this
site.

                    13. Mixed-Use Developments
                    The City will continue to promote mixed-use development in the Urban Plans and
                    the North Costa Mesa Specific Plan, and the former Downtown Redevelopment
                    Plan areas. Specifically the City will maintain a list of opportunity sites and market
                    these sites to interested developers. The City will respond to market conditions and
                    offer appropriate incentives through the Mixed Use Overlay zone. Incentives
                    include:
                            Reduced parking standards
                            Reduced open space
                            Increased densities
                            Increased height limit
                            Increased lot coverage
                            Reduced setbacks
                    2013-2021 Objectives: Update inventory of opportunity sites annually and make
                    inventory available to interested developers. Evaluate incentives package annually.

                    14. Annual General Plan Review
                    The City will continue to monitor the extent of residential, commercial, and industrial
                    development on an annual basis. Sufficient detail should be provided to monitor
                    employment growth and housing production to enhance jobs/housing balance in the
                    City.
                    2013-2021 Objectives: As part of the City’s annual report to State Development of
                    Housing and Community Development (HCD) for the implementation of the General
                    Plan (including Housing Element), provide detailed progress in residential,
                    commercial, and industrial development. As part of this annual review process,

                    The City contracts with the Fair Housing Foundation to provide fair housing and
                    tenant/landlord mediation services.
                    2013-2021 Objectives: Continue to provide fair housing services for all residents of
                    the City. Promote awareness of fair housing via the City’s website and distribute fair
                    housing brochures at public counters and community locations. Make fair housing

                         CHILD CARE FACILITIES
                         16. Promotion of Child Care Facilities
                         The City understands that finding adequate and convenient child care is critical to
                         maintaining the quality of life for Costa Mesa families. The City currently allows
                         large family day care facilities of up to 14 children in many residential zones (R1,
                         R2-MD, R2-HD, R3) as permitted uses. Day care facilities of 15 or more children
                         would require a conditional use permit in all residential and commercial zones, but
                         are considered as permitted uses in the I&RS zone.
                         2013-2021 Objectives: Continue to apply development incentives pursuant to the
                         State density bonus law and Costa Mesa Zoning Code to incorporate child care
                         centers as part of an affordable housing development. Allow all incentives related
                         to child care centers as afforded by the State density bonus provisions.

Appendix A: Public Participation
               A-1: Summary of Public Comments
               During the first two public meetings held for the Housing Element, the focus of
               the discussion was on the outreach program and how the Housing Element
               update schedule should be adjusted so that housing issues can be considered
               along with the General Plan update in progress in order to achieve a cohesive
               vision for the community. In response to these comments, the City retooled its
               public outreach program and schedule for the Housing Element update and
               provided additional opportunities for community input.
               Key comments received during the outreach process include:
                   There should be a balance between ownership and rental housing.
                   Affordable housing efforts should focus on permanent affordable housing.
                   Preservation of neighborhood quality and housing condition is important.
                   Affordable housing especially for seniors and disabled is needed.
                   Housing for the homeless is needed.
                   The City should reconsider density and location of higher density housing;
                    high density ownership housing is being used as rental housing.
                   A concerned is expressed that reduced parking standards, reduced open
                    space, and increased density would impact quality of life standards for
                    residents.
                   The City should consider opportunities for transit-oriented development.
                   Developmentally disabled population requires special attention regarding
                    affordable and accessible housing.
                   The City should reconsider its policy on motel conversion.
                   Establish a land trust for affordable housing.
                   Continue to pursue rezoning of the Fairview Developmental Center site for
                    high density residential development.

                         A-2: Response to Public Comments
                         In response to these comments, the Draft Housing Element includes policies and
                         programs to encourage housing for persons with developmental disabilities,
                         transit-oriented development, and condominium conversion. A new program is
                         included in the Draft Housing Element to facilitate the conversion of motels into
                         permanent housing for families. The public is reminded that many of the land
                         use related issues are being discussed and explored as part of the General Plan
                         Land Use Element update that is underway. Changes to the Land Use Element
                         could potentially warrant revisions to the Draft Housing Element at a later stage.
                         However, the City Council has determined that a land trust is infeasible for the
                         City of Costa Mesa.
Public Input Received                         Additions Made to Housing Element

                         Affordable Housing Coalition
The City received a comment letter by the Costa Mesa Affordable Housing Coalition, dated September 3,
2013 and provides the following responses:
Comment 1: Meaningful engagement and collaborate with the Coalition and community stakeholders to
develop effective housing policies and programs.
   Response: The City significantly expanded its outreach program for the General Plan update that
   includes the Housing Element. Specific meetings were dedicated for obtaining community input on
   the Housing Element:
           May 15, 2013 – Community Workshop
           May 28, 2013 – Planning Commission meeting
           June 13, 2013 – Community Workshop
           June 19, 2013 – Community Workshop
           June 24, 2013 – Planning Commission meeting
           September 17, 2013 – City Council meeting
   In addition, the City held five Road Shows where residents and stakeholders discussed housing and
   other General Plan issues.
           July 10, 2013 – Meeting with local home builders
           August 20, 2013 – Meeting with Eastside Neighbors Group
           August 27, 2013 – Meeting with the Building Industry Association of Southern California
           September 24, 2013 – Meeting with the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce
           October 2, 2013 – Meeting with Mesa Verde Community Association
   Several program revisions in the Draft Housing Element are direct response to public comments (see
   summary table provided earlier and further discussions below).
                                                                      HOUSING ELEMENT  PAGE HOU-A13

Comment 2: Continue to support the development of affordable homes on the Fairview Developmental
Center site.
    Response: The Fairview Developmental Center withdrew its application to develop affordable
    housing on site. The City has included a monitoring component in Program 12 (Adequate Sites) to
    monitor the State’s intent for the site.
Comment 3: Support and identify a specific site for the development of an emergency shelter.
     Response: As required by law, the City has identified the PD Industrial zone to permit emergency
     shelters by right. The City only has the authority to designate a zone for allowable uses but does not
     have the authority to designate private properties for public uses.
Comment 4: Reinstate Program 12 - Single-Room Occupancy, Family Residential Occupancy (FRO) as
a stand-alone program.
    Response: Currently, most motels in the City already incorporate an extended stay component.
    Based on comments from stakeholders at public meetings, FROs or existing motel rooms are not an
    appropriate housing arrangement for families. The City has introduced a new program to facilitate
    and encourage adaptive reuse of motels into permanent housing for families (Program 10).
Comment 5: Prioritize and facilitate the development of new rental homes affordable to lower income
working families on City owned sites. Create an Affordable Housing Land Trust and issue RFP on City
owned sites for affordable housing.
    Response: The City owns only a few properties – two City-owned parking lots serving under-parked
    commercial areas; Senior Center with associated parking lot; and a vacant property at 111 Fair Drive
    that is set aside for an institutional use. Given the small portfolio, an Affordable Housing Land Trust
    is not an appropriate or feasible tool. No affordable housing developers have expressed interest in
    utilizing the Senior Center parking lot. Furthermore, the City is in the process of updating its Land
    Use Element, which will consider various options for the site.
Comment 6: Provide attractive by-right incentives and concessions of certain development standards
that developers are not otherwise entitled to, in exchange for a dedication of 20 percent of homes
affordable to extremely low, very low, and low income families.
    Response: The City does not have an inclusionary housing ordinance. Given the current market
    conditions and the Governor’s veto of AB 1229 (to restore inclusionary housing policies), the City is
    not in the position to consider inclusionary zoning at this time.
Comment 7: Amend the City’s overlay zones to include effective incentives that will facilitate the
development of affordable homes in areas with existing commercial and light industrial uses.
    Response: The overlay zones (in Urban Plan areas) allow residential and mixed use developments
    in areas that normally do not allow residential uses. The flexible development standards are
    established to encourage a range of housing options in these areas. Affordable housing incentives
    are available citywide, including fee deferrals and density bonus.
    The City has recently amended the Specific Plan to allow high density residential at 28 units per acre
    on Sakioka Lot 2. Overall, the City’s residential sites inventory far exceeds its RHNA allocation of two
    units. Furthermore, as part of the City’s General Plan update, the City is considering other areas for
    future residential development.
Comment 8: Commit specific funding or financial resources to facilitate the development of homes
affordable for extremely low, very low, and low income working families. Leverage housing funds on

potential candidate sites). Prioritize and commit potential funding sources (SERAF repayments and
boomerang funds) to proposed extremely low income affordable rental developments.
    Response: The legislation and its interpretation governing the amount of redevelopment funds that a
    successor agency is able to retain is constantly changing. The amount of redevelopment funds that
    the Costa Mesa Successor Agency may be able to retain, if any, cannot be determined at this time.
    The City is not in the position to designate how such unknown funds may be expended in the future.
Comment 9: Identify city-owned sites in the draft Housing Element and include these sites to the City’s
inventory of vacant and underutilized sites.
    Response: The City’s RHNA is only two units and the City has identified an inventory of sites that is
    more than adequate to accommodate its RHNA. The City owns only a few properties – two City-
    owned parking lots serving under-parked commercial areas; Senior Center with associated parking
    lot; and a vacant property at 111 Fair Drive that is set aside for an institutional use. The Senior
    Center parking lot site has been available for affordable housing development as identified in the
    2008 Housing Element. However, to this date no affordable housing developers have expressed
    interest. The future uses of these sites are being considered as part of the City’s General Plan
    Update currently underway.
Comment 10: Encourage the development of housing affordable to extremely low income households
through application processing fee waivers for proposed development with a minimum of ten percent very
low income homes.
    Response: The City has revised the Draft Housing Element to provide fee waivers for projects that
    include at least ten percent of the units as housing affordable to extremely low income households.
Comment 11: Create an affordable housing strategic plan in which the City’s commits to constructing a
specific number of multi-family rental homes that will be affordable to lower income working families.
    Response: The City does not have an inclusionary housing policy and does not have adequate
    funding to subsidize new construction. The City is not in the position to commit to constructing a
    specified number of affordable units. The City will continue to partner with nonprofit and other
    housing developers as those opportunities arise to provide a range of housing options in the City.
Comment 12: Continue monitoring and negotiating the preservation of affordable homes that are at risk
or have affordability covenants that are set to expire during the planning period.
    Response: The City will continue to monitor the status of at risk housing units. The City has a
    demonstrated history of working with property owners to extend affordability controls on publicly
    assisted affordable housing projects. However, the City recognizes scattered sites affordable units
    provided through the Density Bonus ordinance are difficult to preserve, given that the rents for the
    affordable units are only restricted at affordable levels but not subsidized with public funds. The
    City’s strategy is to replenish the affordable housing inventory by encouraging the use of density
    bonus on new developments. Also, the City has revised the program to require property owners of
    density bonus projects to provide a two-year notice to existing and potential tenants regarding the
    remaining length of affordability controls.
Comment 13: Reduce the parking requirement for granny units from two to one space.
    Response: The City’s second unit ordinance provides for the construction of a detached or attached
    accessory unit. The maximum unit size is 1,200 square feet for a detached unit or up to 30 percent of
    the footprint of the main unit for an attached unit. These standards were established to facilitate
    second units as affordable housing options not only for seniors but also for family households.
    Therefore, given the generous unit size, the two parking spaces per unit are appropriate.
                                                                          HOUSING ELEMENT  PAGE HOU-A15

Comment 14: Evaluate on an annual basis how successful the identified Planned Development Industrial
zone will be in facilitating the development of emergency homeless shelters.
   Response: The City will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the PD Industrial zone for
   emergency shelters.
