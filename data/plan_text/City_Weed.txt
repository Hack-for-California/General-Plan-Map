PREAMBLE
The 2040 Weed General Plan 
This is a comprehensive revision and replacement of the City of Weed’s three-decades-old General Plan. The 2040 General Plan acts as a policy document to provide explicit and distinct policies and programs to help guide decision-making in order to achieve community aspirations.
 
Organization 
The documentation for the 2040 General Plan comes in two volumes as follows:
1. The Background Report, completed in January 2016 as Volume 1, documents existing settings, conditions, deficiencies as well as opportunities and constraints including a comprehensive inventory of land uses. It provided the technical basis for development of the Plan.
2. The General Plan is this document and constitutes Volume 2 in the series. Its key contents are as follows:
a. The Executive Summary provides a quick overview on existing conditions with respect to the General Plan Elements, the planning process, alternatives, the Preferred Growth Scenario, and highlights of the goals that provide the policy framework for the Plan.
b. Chapters 1 to 4 provide details on Plan Development. These chapters describe the planning process, demographic projections, opportunities, constraints, and issues that led to the development of Weed’s 2040 Vision. Chapter 4 documents alternative future development scenarios from which the preferred Plan was created.
c. Chapter 5, Preferred Growth Scenario, captures the 2040 Vision and the basis of the General Plan. 
d. Chapters 6 to 17 provide details of the Policy Framework including goals and objectives for future development, organized by the twelve elements of the General Plan.


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction 
The General Plan represents the official adopted goals and policies of the City of Weed. In California, State law (Government Code Sections 65300 et seq.) requires cities and counties to prepare, adopt, and maintain a general plan, the guiding “constitution” upon which public and private development and land use decisions are made. A general plan is central to the local planning process because it employs public policy, derived from citizen participation, to shape future development of a community. As a local constitution, the General Plan should address immediate, mid?term, and long?term planning issues concerning the community, including but not limited to economic development, resource conservation, and the development of public facilities. 
Typically, a general plan is divided into separate subject categories called “elements,” that individually identify specific issues such as housing, circulation, safety, and more. State law mandates that a general plan cover the elements of land use, circulation, housing, conservation, open space, safety, and noise. However, a jurisdiction may also prepare optional elements that relate to its physical development such as economic development, community development, and health. Regardless of whether elements are mandatory or optional, they have equal legal status and must all be internally consistent with one another. 
Most jurisdictions select 15 to 20 years as the long?term horizon for the general plan.  This general plan provides the framework for development decisions leading up to the year 2040.

Planning Process
This General Plan is a product of broad community participation by residents and stakeholders of the City of Weed including the City Manager, City Council, the Planning Commission, and City staff. A planning team of second year graduate students pursuing Masters Degrees in the field of City and Regional Planning under the supervision of Dr. Cornelius Nuworsoo, from the California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo, California facilitated the process, researched, and wrote the plan. The planning team worked closely with stakeholders of the City on the General Plan. Between September 2015 and December 2015, the Cal Poly planning team interacted with the City of Weed community as well as city leadership and staff in a series of public meetings and surveys to generate a Background Report on existing conditions. The 2015 Background Report serves as a supplemental informational document to the General Plan. The Background Report provides an overview of existing conditions with consideration of existing policies, regulations, programs, infrastructure, and services within the City, Siskiyou County, and the State of California. The Background Report guided the development alternatives in the subsequent General Plan document. Through additional community input received from January 2016 through March 2016, the City and the planning team developed the Preferred Growth Scenario, which is intended to guide development decisions through 2040. 
Three different methods were utilized to gather information to inform the planning process on existing conditions and to identify emerging directions, which in turn guided the development of goals, objectives, policies, and programs as well as the Preferred Growth Scenario of the General Plan. The methods include: 
* Primary data collection in the form of four public meetings and four street-side outreach events, all of which provided insights on the community’s aspirations and preferences for the City’s future. 
* Field work in the form of a land use inventory of existing conditions to record and identify the use of all parcels of land within the City. 
* Secondary research to identify applicable regulations, standards, policies, and programs related to each General Plan element. 
Demographics
In 2010, Weed had a population of 2,967, a decrease of 11 people since 2000. The City had a median age of 30.4 years. The largest age cohort in 2010 was the 15 to 19-year age group. Most Weed’s residents, 82 percent, identified as White. In 2010, the median income for Weed was $26,064, lower than Siskiyou County’s median of $36,981 and less than half the State’s median income of $60,883. From 2000 to 2010 the median household income increased by approximately 11.6 percent.
2040 Population & Housing Projections 
The population of Weed is projected to increase by an additional 5 percent over the next 25 years (or 0.2 percent a year) based on natural growth factors such as birth, death, and migration rates.  Under such baseline conditions, the population is projected to increase by 164 persons to 3,131 residents between 2010 and 2040 necessitating the addition of 191 housing units. The Preferred Growth Scenario targets a total population of 3,602 by 2040, which would require a total addition of 689 housing units. The housing need could be met through multiple means including reoccupation of existing vacant units, redevelopment of existing units determined to be in ‘poor’ condition, and construction of new housing units. 
Existing Conditions & Plan Elements 
Land Use
The Land Use Element is mandatory in a General Plan. It provides a guide for future development and growth to planners, the public, developers, and decision makers. The main objective of the Land Use Element is to play a “central role in correlating all land use issues into a set of coherent development polices” (Governor’s Office of Planning and Research [OPR], 2003). The Land Use Element designates the location, distribution, and intensity of uses including housing, commercial, industrial, recreational, open space, agricultural, educational, public buildings and facilities, and waste management facilities. 
The Land Use Element considers constraints to the use of land resulting from physical, legal, and environmental issues. It also considers the needs and desires of the community in establishing goals and policies to guide future land use in the City.
An inventory of all lands within Weed in 2015 revealed that 37 percent of the City’s land was vacant. Circulation, open space, public facilities, and residential land uses each consisted of roughly 15 percent of Weed’s total land area. Industrial facilities made up two percent and commercial uses made up three percent of land within City limits.
Trend data and future projections indicate that population, housing, and employment growth can be accommodated within Weed’s existing city limits. Community outreach revealed that residents value the City’s friendly, small-town character; they would like to revitalize the downtown core, prioritize infill development, and promote diversity of commercial and residential land uses within neighborhoods. The Land Use element sets goals and objectives that prioritize these factors.  

Circulation
The Circulation Element is a mandatory element of the General Plan according to Government Code §6530. Circulation has a critical impact on land use patterns, economic development, public health, and social interaction. A balanced multimodal transportation system encourages compact land use, ease of access, commercial development, and increased physical activity. This element describes the City’s transportation system and circulation network and provides an inventory of existing roadway and infrastructure conditions. In addition, this Element addresses future directions for transportation in the City.
The City of Weed’s transportation network currently features access to two major highways: Interstate 5 and US Route 97, which provide good regional connectivity within the State. In the City, the automobile is the primary mode of transportation, with 93 percent of the City’s population having access to at least one vehicle. The residents of Weed have access to public transit that serves Siskiyou County via the Siskiyou Transit and General Express (STAGE); however, transit ridership in Weed is minimal. Despite having few sidewalks outside of the downtown and South Weed, ten percent of the City’s population commutes to work by walking, which is a higher share than the County or State (ACS, 2014). The City has minimal provisions for bicyclists. Recommended transportation improvements in Weed focus on bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, traffic calming, and pavement repair to achieve a well-maintained, well-connected, multimodal street network.
The main goals of the Preferred Growth Scenario are to prioritize non-motorized transportation within the City and to ensure that existing infrastructure is in a state of good repair. Ensuring emergency vehicle access, increasing connectivity, and developing a recreational trail network are also focal points of the Preferred Growth Scenario. 
Housing
The Housing Element is one of the seven mandatory elements of the General Plan. The purpose of the housing element is to guide long?term, comprehensive housing needs for residents of each income level within the City by providing a variety of housing types. State law requires this element to report on the City’s ability to meet existing and projected housing needs of all socioeconomic groups within the City. The Housing Element covers topics of amount, type, location, condition, and affordability. Housing conditions in Weed are adequate overall. Most of Weed’s housing stock (77 percent) was in good condition, with only a small percentage of homes in poor condition. Additionally, 56 percent of the City’s housing units were single-family detached, making up over 88 percent of Weed’s total residential land.
Weed’s population is projected to increase through natural growth to 3,131 by 2040. Based on this projection, the City will require an additional 191 housing units. The Preferred Growth Scenario targets a total population of 3,602 by 2040, which would require a total addition of 689 housing units. Community outreach revealed that residents would like to maintain single-family housing as the primary housing type in Weed, while also accommodating some variation to meet the needs of all socioeconomic groups. The Housing Element includes goals, objective, policies, and programs that accommodate housing need and prioritize the desires of the community. The main goals of the Preferred Growth Scenario include maintaining an adequate supply of housing, fostering an aesthetically pleasing housing stock, and ensuring that housing remains livable and well maintained.

Open Space
The Open Space Element guides the comprehensive and long?range preservation and conservation of open?space land in the City. Open space is classified as any parcel, area, or waterway that is essentially unimproved and devoted to open space use (OPR Guidelines, 2003). As defined broadly under Section 65560 of the California Government Code, open space land is land designated for the preservation of natural resources, managed production of resources, outdoor recreation and space for public health and safety.
There are 28.5 acres of park space within the City; the Weed Parks and Recreation District (WPRD) operates and maintains these parks. The City of Weed had no local standards regarding parks or open space. However, the National Recreation and Parks Association has established standards for neighborhood and community parks which show that Weed currently has adequate park space to serve the population. If the City were to grow to exceed 3,000 total residents, current park space would not be adequate. The Preferred Growth Scenario allocates additional park spaces to meet the needs of the growing population. The main goals of the Open Space Element focus on enhanced park safety and recreational programs, accessibility and connectivity, and aesthetically pleasing parks and open spaces within the City. 

Conservation
The Conservation Element discusses natural resources within the City of Weed. The purpose of the Conservation Element is to minimize the negative impacts of development on the natural environment while allowing the City to grow. As defined by the California Office of Planning and Research, conservation is the “management of natural resources to prevent waste, destruction, or neglect” (OPR, 2003). The Conservation Element addresses federal and state standards of environmental regulation, soil and mineral resources, biological resources, water resources, energy, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as direction related to the conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources.
The Conservation Element identifies goals, objectives, policies, and programs to guide the City into the future while minimizing impacts on the natural environment. Under the Preferred Growth Scenario, future residential and commercial growth is concentrated within core areas of the City to preserve surrounding natural resources. While the Plan will necessitate increased water usage, energy usage, some tree removal to accommodate growth, the goals and policies in the Preferred Growth Scenario offset these impacts by establishing efficiency standards and policies to conserve natural resources.

Air Quality
The Air Quality Element is intended to promote and protect public health and welfare. The City of Weed recognizes the importance of air quality to public health and safety as well as the City’s economic well?being. This element discusses the status of the City in meeting federal, state, and local air quality standards and provides an overview of ambient air quality conditions, a description of the local setting including air quality conditions, and major pollutant sources and air quality issues pertinent to the City’s future. 
Weed is regulated under the Siskiyou County Air Pollution Control District for air quality standards, and is listed as an attainment area for many major air pollutants such as particulate matter and carbon monoxide according to the standards set forth by the State and Federal Clean Air Act. Most air pollutants affecting Weed come from mobile sources such as automobile traffic, trucking, and rail. Stationary sources include fuel combustion and processing at industrial sites. The Preferred Growth Scenario aims to improve air quality in Weed by utilizing clean energy, reducing vehicle emissions, and promoting non-motorize transportation alternatives.
Noise
The Noise Element is one of the seven mandatory elements of the General Plan. The element’s purpose is to identify noise sources and sensitive receptors within the City. The element includes goals, objectives, policies, and programs to alleviate unwanted sound produced in Weed. The State of California requires that all local jurisdictions prepare statements of the policy indicating their plans regarding noise and noise sources, establish maximum noise levels for each land use category, set standards for noise generation from transportation facilities and immobile noise sources, and develop a program for implementation of noise control measures. The City of Weed is generally a quiet town, but there are many stationary and temporary noise sources throughout the City. Stationary noise sources in Weed include highway noise from I?5 and US 97, the CORP rail line, and industrial land uses. The main goals of the Preferred Growth Scenario address noise by ensuring spatial compatibility of land uses and ensuring that new development meets regulatory standards. 
Safety
The Safety Element is a required element of all general plans in the State of California. The Safety Element addresses the protection of humans and property from natural and man?made hazards. Seismic, geologic, fire, and flood hazards must be addressed as required under California Government Code 65302(g). The Safety Element for Weed goes beyond the minimum requirements and includes safety concerns of crime and hazardous materials.
The greatest safety risk in Weed is the threat of fires, which have heightened potential due to high winds, dry conditions, and recreational activities that may encourage incidental fires. As the City continues to recover from the 2014 Boles Fire, a key focus of the Safety Element is to establish preventative measures and increase resilience to fire through strategic placement of development. Other safety hazards in Weed include seismic activity from two active unnamed faults cascading from Mount Shasta and the Yellow-Butte Fault, lava flow damage in the event of a volcanic eruption of Mount Shasta, and flooding along the Boles Creek floodplain. Additionally, emergency preparedness in Weed is inadequate, as the City has not established official evacuation routes, preparedness checklists, warning systems, or a chain of command for emergency response services. The Preferred Growth Scenario addresses safety concerns by focusing on goals related to risk-awareness, natural disaster preparedness, and crime reduction programs.

Economic Development
The Economic Development Element is an optional element of the General Plan. The goals, objectives, policies, and programs in this Element aim to expand and diversify the City’s economy. By aligning and analyzing key factors that drive Weed’s local economy, as well as City’s role within the Siskiyou County region, the General Plan can help guide economic development through the appropriate allocation of land uses. According to the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research, economic development plays a significant role in the physical development of the planning area and stability of the local tax base. For the City to remain competitive and support current and developing industries, economic strengths and weaknesses are identified in this element.
The South Weed highway-serving commercial industry captures most of the City’s revenue from retail and services. Weed has a limited amount of big box retailers, which supports the development of local business, but causes residents to travel to other municipalities to acquire goods and services. Furthermore, many businesses in the downtown core are vacant, which detracts from the local economic condition. The economic base of Weed consists of educational services, accommodation and food services, and the retail trade sector. The largest employers in Weed are the College of the Siskiyous, Crystal Geyser, and Roseburg Forest Products; the latter primarily provide skilled and semi-skilled, manufacturing jobs to city and county residents. Economic development is a primary concern to Weed’s residents. Community outreach has revealed that residents are determined to stimulate economic growth in core areas of the City, attract and retain well-paying jobs, and develop sustainable industries that will foster increased income and revenue for the City. The main goals of the Preferred Growth Scenario aim to capture the community’s vision for economic growth by attracting investors in anchor industries, promoting tourism, and reinvigorating key corridors throughout the City.

Public Facilities
The Public Facilities Element describes the existing services and utilities provided by the City and identifies deficiencies or inadequacies in meeting current and future needs. The element provides a comprehensive overview of existing public service infrastructure and facilities in the City. Public services and facilities are fundamental components of urbanized areas that support daily functions and quality of life in the community. The Public Facilities element covers topics of water infrastructure, water supply, storm water management, wastewater treatment, solid waste disposal services, police services, fire services, school facilities, and library facilities.
A system of ground water wells and a spring supply water to Weed for distribution. The City owns and operates two wastewater treatment facilities as well as a solid waste management plant. Solid waste is diverted to the Black Butte Transfer Recycle Station in Mount Shasta and the City receives trash-collecting services through C & D Waste Removal. The City of Weed has two public schools for children: an elementary?middle school and a high school. Weed is also home to the College of the Siskiyous, a local community college. The City provides Police services and the Weed Volunteer Fire Department provides fire service. The goals, objectives, policies, and programs in the Public Facilities element address community input gathered through the public outreach process, but primarily focus on prioritizing public facilities and utilities that can ensure that regulatory standards are met and that infrastructure systems are adequate for the population.
Health
The Health Element identifies measures of physical and mental wellness in Weed. The Element addresses adequate access to recreation and open space, healthy foods, medical services, active transportation, quality housing, economic opportunities, safe public spaces, and environmental quality. This optional element addresses health disparities, promotes healthy living, and uses the General Plan to encourage public health through land use policy. This element uses various indicators and standards to measure health and wellness conditions established by federal, state, and local agencies.
The main challenges pertaining to the health in Weed are limited access to healthy food options, proximity to mental healthcare services, and limited safe alternative transportation options. City residents have decent access to medical services in the surrounding area, including a full?service medical center in Mount Shasta. Access to parks and recreational opportunities are sufficient, and air quality and water supply are adjudged to be in good condition according to state mandated standards. Community members in Weed are primarily concerned with improving access to health services and recreation, supporting healthy youth activities, and enhancing access and safety of active transportation. These priorities reflect in the goals, objectives, policies, and programs of the Preferred Growth Scenario.
Community Design
The Community Design Element addresses the unique character and features of the City’s built environment and visual quality. The Community Design Element serves two purposes: to identify existing conditions of Weed's built environment and provide ways to preserve and enhance desirable community attributes. The purpose of this element is to enhance the physical character of the City and to guide the form and appearance of neighborhoods, streets, parks, and public facilities as well as new development.
The City of Weed has no formal design districts but does follow a “Mountain Western” theme. Gateway signage identifies main entrances into Weed, contributing to the City’s identity. Landmarks such as the scenic view of Mount Shasta, the statue of Abner Weed outside City Hall, and the Weed Mercantile Mall also enhance the City’s unique character and sense of place. The Preferred Growth Scenario aims to improve community design by establishing goals that promote a vibrant downtown, foster a distinct local identity, promote walkable neighborhoods, and improve streetscapes as part of the City’s scenic landscape.
Alternative Growth Scenarios
Business as Usual
Business as Usual is a development alternative that envisions how the City would grow by 2040 if historic trends and patterns in population growth and economic development remain the same. The Business as Usual scenario anticipates nearly 165 additional residents by 2040, as well as 200 new jobs and housing units. The conceptual land use plan in the Business as Usual Scenario could accommodate this growth through infill development that maintains current density levels within the City. Sufficient residential, commercial, open space, and public facilities land is available to meet the requirements of the growing population. Under the Business as Usual Scenario, circulation in Weed will remain primarily auto-oriented, with minimal expansion of bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure or public transit services.
Moderate Growth
The Moderate Growth Scenario assumes population and employment growth beyond Business as Usual. Under this scenario, the City would target nearly 400 additional jobs by 2040 necessitating 350 additional housing units and a population increase of 514 residents. The Moderate Growth Scenario focuses on strategically locating low, medium, and high-density housing options throughout the City, and promoting tourism and commercial activities in economic centers to boost job growth. This scenario focuses growth in five areas with respective features as follows:
1. Angel Valley
* Low-density residential infill development; with medium-density housing adjacent to Charlie Byrd Park
2. School House Hill
* Infill of 60 single-family homes 
3. Central Weed
* Designated mixed-use along Main Street; retail along North Weed Boulevard; and high-density residential development south of Boles Ave.
4. South Weed
* Continuation of highway-serving commercial development along Black Butte Drive
5. Vista Heights
* Low-density residential development

Progressive Growth
The Progressive Growth Scenario targets the largest amount of growth of the three development alternatives. Under Progressive Growth, Weed would target additional 800 jobs by 2040, which could trigger the need for 700 new housing units to accommodate a potential population growth of 635 residents. This alternative prioritizes compact development by focusing higher density development in core areas of the City, while maintaining single-family homes as the primary housing type in Weed. Economic growth is stimulated through a mix of commercial land uses, with highway-serving businesses concentrated in South Weed, mixed-use along key corridors, and neighborhood centers to provide residents with access to goods and services. The Progressive Growth Alternative focuses growth in five key areas with respective features as follows:
1. Angel Valley
* Low-density residential expansion north of California Ave; medium-density housing adjacent to Charlie Byrd Park; with neighborhood-serving commercial development
2. Historic Downtown
* Designated mixed-use along Main Street; infill of single-family homes; and high-density residential development south of Boles Ave.
3. North / South Weed Boulevard Corridor
* Service commercial development; with mixed-use office and retail; and serving as a key connection between the City’s north and south
4. Bel Air
* Mixed-use along College Avenue; retail geared towards student population; medium-density housing surrounding College Ave; and low-density residential expansion north of Sullivan Avenue.
5. South Weed
* Expansion of highway-serving commercial development along Black Butte Drive; low, medium, and high-density residential expansion; and public facilities west of I-5

Preferred Growth Scenario
The Preferred Growth Scenario incorporates the preferred elements from all the development alternatives, with an emphasis on concepts in the Moderate and Progressive Growth Scenarios. The Preferred Growth Scenario is based on public input from community outreach events as well as development opportunities and constraints within the City. Anticipated population, housing, and employment targets are the same as the Progressive Growth Scenario. Conceptual land uses for the Preferred Growth Scenario focus on a diverse and distributed mix of land uses throughout the City; with an emphasis on residential and open space land. Public facilities as well as commercial and industrial land uses would also expand throughout the City to accommodate population and job growth. The goals of the Preferred Growth Scenario focus on economic revitalization, attracting and retaining jobs, vibrant mixed-use corridors, a variety of housing types, and increased access and connectivity for all modes of transportation. The six key growth areas in the Preferred Growth Scenario include:
1. Angel Valley
* Neighborhood-serving commercial development along California Avenue; low-density residential expansion north of California Avenue; increased park space; and addition of a community center
2. Historic Downtown
* Designated mixed-use along Main Street with improved streetscape; and additional medium-density housing options
3. Creekside Village
* Single-family homes along Weed Golf Course; medium-density housing for senior homes or retirement community; and neighborhood-serving commercial development
4. North / South Weed Boulevard Corridor
* Service and retail commercial development; with mixed-use office and retail; and serving as a key connection between the City’s north and south
5. Bel Air
* Mixed-use along College Avenue; retail geared towards student population; high-density housing adjacent to COS; public facilities near COS; and low-density residential expansion north of Sullivan Avenue.
6. South Weed
* Expansion of highway-serving commercial development along Black Butte Drive; low, medium, and high-density residential expansion; and neighborhood-serving commercial development

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 The City & Planning Area
1.1.1 Setting
The City of Weed is a small, mountain town located in Siskiyou County about nine miles north of Mount Shasta. Weed is roughly 70 miles from Redding, CA and about 50 miles south of the Oregon/California border, as shown on Map 1.1. The City is approximately five square miles within a sphere of influence of about 28 square miles. Map 1.1 shows that Interstate 5 bisects the City from north to south. Interstate 5 is a major connector between Oregon and California. US Route 97 (US 97) intersects I-5 in central Weed providing additional connectivity with other major destinations in Oregon to the north. 
1.1.2 Climate
Four distinct seasons characterize weed’s climate. Average daytime temperatures range between 80 and 90 degrees in the summer and 30 to 40 degrees in the winter. The City averages about 12 inches of rainfall per year with over half occurring during the winter months. The winter season can begin as early as September and end as late as May. The growing season for the City averages 100 days.
1.1.3 History
The local pioneer, Abner Weed, founded the City of Weed in 1897 with the purchase of the 280-acre Siskiyou Lumber and Mercantile Mill for the sum of $400. Categorized as a booming logging town by 1905, Weed was a busy and growing community. The mill was a great success, and by the 1940’s the City boasted the world’s largest sawmill. The success of the mill was due in part to the fast-moving mountain air currents descending over Black Butte summit, perfect for drying green lumber. 
In its infancy, Weed was like any other Wild West town. In the late 1950’s an International Paper Company purchased the mill. The Company soon sold all company-owned homes to the residents. Since that time, the size of the mill has not changed significantly (Arnie Hultgren, correspondence, January 10, 2017). Though the City’s origins began as a company town, it was incorporated as a General Law City in 1961 (Weed Historic Lumber Town Museum). Today, Roseburg Forest Products Co. Mill is one of the remaining lumber mills in the State. The City has diversified to provide strong educational services through the College of the Siskiyous, and to play the role of a service center for travelers between major cities to its north and south.

1.1.4 Demographics
In 2010, Weed had a population of 2,967 residents, which was 6.6 percent of the population of Siskiyou County. Between 2000 and 2010, the population of Weed declined by 0.37 percent, which is 0.04 percent annually. However, the population of Siskiyou County grew by a total of 1.35 percent, or 0.14 percent annually. This steady decline shifted drastically after the 2014 Boles fire, when the population dropped almost 9 percent (Department of Finance, 2015). Table 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 show the comparative population trends in the City of Weed and Siskiyou County before and after the Boles fire. The City of Weed has a much younger population compared to Siskiyou County. The median age in Siskiyou County is 47 while Weed’s median age is 32.7, which is likely due to the presence of the College of the Siskiyous. The largest percent of the population is 15 to 19 years of age. Figure 3.2.1 illustrates the percent population by age for both the City of Weed and Siskiyou County. The ethnic composition of Weed is predominantly White, which comprises 65 percent of the total population. The second largest ethnic group is Hispanic or Latino, which makes up 16 percent of the population. In comparison to Siskiyou County, Weed contains a more diverse population. In 2013, the median household income in Weed was $28,170. This is significantly lower than the median household incomes in both Siskiyou County and California, which were $37,709 and $61,094, respectively. Figure 3.2.6 shows the comparison.

1.1.5 Planning Boundaries
A General Plan must cover the territory within the boundaries of the adopting city as well as any land outside these boundaries, which the planning agency finds relates to the City’s planning (§65300; OPR, 2003). This section describes the planning area for the City of Weed. Map 2.2 shows the city limits and Sphere of Influence (SOI).
City Limit
Weed’s city limit is comprised of land uses that are controlled by the City (OPR, 2003). The city limit encompasses an area of about 3,077 acres or 4.8 square miles. Land uses within the city limit include residential, commercial, circulation, industrial, open space, public facilities, and vacant land.
Area of Concern 
A city’s planning area boundary includes incorporated and unincorporated territory bearing relation to the City’s planning. The planning area may extend beyond the SOI (OPR, 2003). In Weed’s case, the planning area does not extend past the city limits; however, areas outside the city limits are addressed only in the case of concepts pending future evaluations of appropriate land uses for annexations. Land outside the city limits is also addressed as it pertains to access and connectivity of goods and services to city residents.
Sphere of Influence (SOI)
A city’s SOI is adopted by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), and includes incorporated land and unincorporated territory that services the City (OPR, 2003). The City of Weed’s SOI includes approximately 28 square miles of land. Unincorporated areas surrounding Weed include Edgewood, Carrick, and Black Butte. Map 1.2 shows Weed’s SOI.
The SOI contains valleys, rolling, moderate and steep hillsides (20 to 60 percent), alluvial plains, hilltops, ridgelines, and flowing creeks. Existing land uses and structures in Weed’s SOI range from open space, agriculture uses, animal grazing, and single?family residences, to industrial and manufacturing land uses. In addition, the SOI holds transmissions lines and oil and gas pipeline easements.

1.2 Purpose, Intent & Legal Authority
1.2.1 Long Range Planning
California law requires both cities and counties to adopt a long?term comprehensive General Plan to guide future development (Government Code Sections 65300). The general plan outlines goals and policies to guide long range planning within a city or county. The California Supreme Court has called the general plan the “constitution for future development,” the foundation on which all land use decisions are based (OPR, 2003). According to the Office of Planning and Research guidelines, the general plan “expresses community development goals and embodies public policy relative to the distribution of future land uses, both public and private” (OPR, 2003). 
The City of Weed’s most current General Plan was adopted in 1982. The 2040 General Plan update is designed to replace the 34-year-old document. In partnership with the City of Weed, this policy document is the product of second?year graduate students and a faculty advisor in the City and Regional Planning program at the California Polytechnic State University of San Luis Obispo.

1.2.2 Regional Coordination
The City of Weed is in Siskiyou County. Siskiyou County has a few commissions and committees that serve the area including the Siskiyou County Air Pollution Control District, the Siskiyou Local Agency Formation Commission, the local Certified Unified Program Agency, and the Local Transportation Commission.


1.3 General Plan Overview
1.3.1 Elements of a General Plan
State of California Government Code Section 65302(b) mandates that seven elements be addressed in a city’s general plan: land use, circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise, and safety. The City of Weed’s General Plan document includes these required elements and five additional elements: air quality, economic development, public facilities, community design, and health to ensure that the General Plan meets the City’s unique needs.

Land Use
The Land Use Element designates the type, intensity, and distribution of public land and private land uses. Housing, commercial, industrial, and open space are some of the land uses considered under this element. A land use map illustrates the planned location and density of these uses in the City.

Circulation
The Circulation Element intersects with the Land Use Element to address future transportation needs of proposed land uses and users. Major thoroughfares, transportation routes, hubs, and other infrastructure utilities and facilities, existing and proposed, are identified and planned under this element.

Housing
The Housing Element is a comprehensive assessment of current and projected housing needs. It includes policies and programs for providing adequate housing for all economic segments of the community. Every eight years the housing element must be updated by state mandate.

Open Space
The Open Space Element provides plans and guidelines for the long?term preservation of open space lands. The intent of this element is to ensure public health and safety through the conservation of natural resources, management of resource production (including agricultural lands), and maintenance of outdoor recreational facilities.

Conservation
The Conservation Element addresses the conservation, development, and use of natural resources. The condition and future of air, water, soils, minerals, and biological resources are assessed under this element.

Air Quality
The Air Quality Element is intended to promote and protect public health and welfare. The element places importance on air quality as it relates to public health and safety as well as the City’s economic well?being. 

Noise
The Noise Element sets goals to minimize community exposure to excessive noise by identifying existing and future noise sources and sensitive noise receptors to ensure their separation through land use planning.

Safety
The Safety Element includes strategies to protect the community from risks associated with fire, flood, seismicity, geologic activity, hazardous materials, and crime.

Economic Development
The Economic Development Element guides the economic character of the community while providing for a stable annual budget. A stable economy is achieved through the development of policies and strategies related to retaining existing businesses, attracting new businesses and industries, creating jobs, and expanding the City’s revenue base.

Public Facilities
The Public Facilities Element addresses the existing capacity of, and future demand for, water, power, waste management, telecommunications, health, educational, and emergency facilities in the City.

Health
The Health Element provides policies to address community health issues and needs by promoting healthy living solutions. The Health Element focuses on access to medical services, healthy food, recreation, mental health services, and clean air and water.

Community Design
The Community Design Element guides public and private development to create a city with a strong sense of place and unique visual character. It also addresses protection of the City’s historic and archaeological resources. This element brings several elements together to enhance the natural and built environment.

1.3.2 Contents of Each Element
During the General Plan update process, many efforts were made to ascertain the existing conditions in Weed. This information was collected from community members during public meetings and community outreach, from field research, planning documents, and other relevant sources. A series of goals, objectives, policies, and programs were developed based on the cumulative knowledge gained from this process and from the desires of the community. Following the California Office of Planning and Research guidelines, the format for these goals, objectives, policies, and programs are as follows:

Goal
A goal is a general direction?setter. It is an ideal future end related to the public health, safety, or general welfare. A goal is a general expression of community values and, therefore, may be abstract in nature. Consequently, a goal is generally not quantifiable or time?dependent.

Objective
An objective is a specified end, condition, or state that is an intermediate step toward attaining a goal. It should be achievable and, when possible, measurable, and time?specific. An objective may pertain to one particular aspect of a goal or it may be one of several successive steps toward goal achievement. Consequently, there may be more than one objective for each goal.

Policy 
A policy is a specific statement that guides decision?making. It indicates a commitment of the local legislative body to a particular course of action. A policy is based on, and helps implement, a general plan’s objectives.

Program
A program implements a general plan policy. Jurisdictions draft programs to be specific to implement policies, meet objectives, and ultimately work towards goals.

2 PLANNING PROCESS
2.1 Introduction
This General Plan is a product of broad community participation by residents and stakeholders of the City of Weed including the City Manager, City Council, the Planning Commission, and City staff. A planning team of second year graduate students pursuing Masters Degrees in the field of City and Regional Planning under the supervision of Dr. Cornelius Nuworsoo, from the California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo, California facilitated the process, researched, and wrote the plan. The planning process had three main phases: 
1. Gather information 
2. Analyze Information 
3. Compare Alternatives 
Phase 1 of the planning process occurred between September 2015 and December 2015. During this period, the planning team engaged in information gathering that included a land use inventory, secondary data research, and the collection of primary data from the City of Weed community and City staff. The Background Report is the culmination of the information gathered during this phase, and serves as the informational foundation for the development of the City of Weed 2040 General Plan. 
Phase 2 of the planning process incorporated information gathered during Phase 1 to determine emerging directions, develop population, housing, and employment projects, and consider development alternatives to meet the needs of the community expressed during Phase 1.
Phase 3 of the planning process took place between January 2016 and March 2016. During this phase, the planning team utilized information gathered from Phase 1 and 2 to develop three alternative growth scenarios to present in Community Meeting #3. These three alternatives were Business as Usual, Moderate Growth, and Progressive Growth. Using feedback from the community on each alternative, the team developed a Preferred Growth Alternative to drive the formation of element goals, objectives, policies, and programs.


2.2 Research Methods
Three different research methods were used to gather information to inform the planning team on existing conditions as well as to identify emerging directions, which guided the development of goals, objectives, policies, and programs.
* Primary data was collected through three public meetings and online surveys to gather community aspirations and preferences regarding the future of Weed as well as feedback on the three development alternatives. Community meetings are further discussed in a subsequent section of this chapter. 
* Fieldwork was performed to generate an existing land use inventory, which provided information regarding the existing conditions and use of all the parcels within Weed.
* Secondary research was conducted to identify applicable standards, polices, and programs related to each General Plan element.

2.2.1 Fieldwork: Land Use Inventory
To provide an accurate Background Report with reliable data, a thorough inventory of existing land uses within the City of Weed was conducted. The Team surveyed each parcel and gathered the following information: 
* Occupancy: whether the parcel was occupied or vacant 
* The active land use(s): primary, secondary, or tertiary 
* Absence or presence of sidewalk, and condition of sidewalk, if present 
In addition to gathering information for each parcel, the following information was recorded for all structures located on each parcel or lot: 
* The total number of structures on the parcel or lot 
* The type of structure 
* The number of stories for each structure 
* The physical conditions of each structure, ranked bad, poor, fair, or good quality 
Active land use identified the primary use of a parcel, such as residential, commercial, industrial, public facility, or some other use. Data was collected regarding the specific use within each land use category. For example, commercial land uses indicate subcategories of retail, office, service, and industry. While residential land uses are subdivided into single?family detached, single family attached, multi?family, mobile/modular homes, or apartment structures. 
The planning team completed the land use survey during the first week of November 2015. The planning team walked the City on foot to record information for each parcel. Data for each parcel was entered into iPads, which contained specific software to organize the land use database. Collected information was mapped using Geographic Information System (GIS) software.

2.2.2 Secondary Research
Secondary research provided the planning team with applicable background information and the regulatory framework to understand the City of Weed and identify the needs that should be addressed in each element of the General Plan. The Team was able to identify and define emerging directions for each element of the City’s General Plan by analyzing demographic trends as well as relevant City and County policies. 
The California Office of Planning and Research (OPR) guidelines were the starting point for this process. OPR provides a framework for, and mandatory components of, each General Plan element. These guidelines identify data and informational needs for each element and guided the planning team to appropriate documents for further analysis. Additionally, each section of the Background Report includes research into development standards applicable to those conditions found in the City of Weed. 
Other steps involved researching and analyzing existing city and county planning documents, including city and county General Plans, county policies, and reports and programs pertaining to Weed. These plans provided a planning and policy context for the development of the 2040 General Plan.

2.3 Community Meetings
Community outreach is integral to the development of the General Plan and is an essential stage of the General Plan update process. Outreach was conducted through organized community meetings and several informal planning activities in the City. The General Plan is intended to address the needs of the City’s residents and reflect their vision for the future of the City. The community meetings were a very important part of identifying what the community viewed as strengths, barriers, and opportunities for the City of Weed. This information was vital in creating the goals, objectives, policies, and programs for the City. The support from the community and City staff was exceptional. All community meetings had a great turnout, and community members in attendance were all engaged and participated in the process. The team developed and maintained communication with the community by using the following tools to inform the public of meetings and planning progress: 
* Community General Plan Website (http://plancityofweed.wix.com/plancityofweed)
* General Plan Update Facebook Page 
* Newspaper Announcements  
* Printed Fliers 
* Water Bill inserts 
* Street Interactions

2.3.1 Community Meeting 1: Focus Group
Format
The first community meeting was held on October 10, 2015 at City Hall in downtown Weed. The meeting began with an introduction to the General Plan, the contents of each element, and the process of updating the Plan. The meeting attendees were asked three questions about Weed. The questions were:
* What are the strengths of your community?
* What is holding your community back?
* What would make your community better? 
Twenty community members, including City staff, attended the meeting. Participants were asked to list the strengths and barriers of Weed individually as well as their wishes for the future. Each question was then discussed in small focus groups. All the feedback was collected and analyzed based on how it pertained to each element of the Plan. The information gathered during this meeting was incorporated into a presentation for the November 7, 2015 meeting. Community members liked the City’s geographic location, reasonable housing prices, variety of neighborhoods, good schools, clean air, variety of outdoor recreational opportunities, quite atmosphere, local entrepreneurship, and small?town character. The community disliked the limited economic diversity, limited medical services, drug related activities, limitations on water resources, pollution from major highways and industry, and lack of local connectivity. To improve the City, participants felt that the City needs to have better enforcement of codes and ordinances, more mixed-use and diverse neighborhoods, more sidewalks, more affordable housing for all income levels, expanded facilities for arts and culture, and better open space connectivity and maintenance. The following photos show the focus group activity at the first community meeting.

2.3.2 Community Meeting 2: Visioning with Emerging Directions
The second community meeting was held on November 7, 2015 and was aimed at identifying preferences for the future of Weed based on each element of the General Plan. A presentation was created based on the community input received during the first meeting, the Land Use Inventory, and research on existing conditions. The purpose of the presentation was to show Weed’s current state, some of the main issues and opportunities facing the City, and what changes could reasonably be expected given community preferences. The planning team developed emerging directions that adequately reflected the community’s interest and fit within the background research and regulatory framework conducted throughout the planning process.  
Approximately 35 community members attended the November 7, 2015 meeting, held at City Hall on Main Street. The presentation consisted of three breakout sessions where community members were given the opportunity to vote on their individual preferences for different emerging directions of each element of the Plan. These preferences were based upon the information gathered at the October 10, 2015 meeting, outreach events, and the online surveys.

2.3.3 Community Meeting 3: Presentation of Growth Scenarios
At community meeting #3, held on February 20, 2016, participants were presented with three alternative growth scenarios to facilitate discussion about preferred growth paths. Each alternative was developed based on different growth assumptions and potential future outcomes of the City by 2040. The three scenarios included Business As Usual, Moderate Growth, and Progressive Growth. Each alternative provided a conceptual land use map, proposed motorized and non-motorized transportation circulation maps, representative photos, and three-dimensional massing models. This information was presented in a before/after format to illustrate the physical impacts of each growth scenario.
Community meeting #3 was held at City Hall on Main Street, and was attended by over 25 participants. The meeting opened with an overview of growth assumptions, development opportunities and constraints, and a description of the outcomes under each growth alternative. Projections of population, housing, and job growth in 2040 were also presented to provide context to the planning process. After the presentation, posters were stationed around the room that displayed the key outcomes of each growth scenario. Participants were separated into three groups to discuss each scenario and were provided with a handout that asked them to identify whether they “liked” or “disliked” each outcome. Written comments were also encouraged to welcome ideas that were not reflected in the growth scenarios. The feedback gathered at community meeting #3 is outlined below, with “L” indicating “like and “D” indicating “dislike”. The results are also available in Appendix C.

Business as Usual Key Features
* Predominantly low-density (14L, 17D)
* Continuation of auto-oriented development (5L, 29D)
* Designated mixed-use area in downtown (31L, 3D)
* Expanded highway-serving commercial in South Weed (31L, 2D)

Moderate Growth Key Features
* Residential expansion north of the Weed Golf Course (33L, 0D)
* Infill residential development (25L, 4D)
* A variety of housing types (32L, 2D)
* Improved mobility (34L, 1D)

Progressive Growth Key Features 
* Expanded mixed-use along Main Street and College Avenue (29L, 1D)
* A variety of housing options (for all income levels) (28L, 2D)

Summary
Overall, participants were supportive of the outcomes in both the Moderate and Progressive Growth Scenarios. Many participants expressed the desire to develop a Preferred Growth Plan that reflects a combination of these two scenarios, with an emphasis on prioritizing outcomes that ensure economic growth and vitality. A main concern was maintaining Weed’s small-town character while promoting commercial growth, and ensuring that the City has a diverse housing stock that can accommodate a growing population. Participants agreed that improved mobility for all modes of transportation throughout the City is an important outcome that should be reflected in the Preferred Plan. Participants also supported expanded public facilities and preservation of open space, although some were hesitant about placing new public facilities in South Weed. 

2.3.4 Community Meeting 4: Presentation of Preferred Growth Scenario
At the fourth community meeting, held on March 12, 2015, participants were presented with the Preferred Growth Scenario. This scenario was developed based on the features of the three growth alternatives that were liked by most participants. The purpose of community meeting #4 was to provide a summary of the Weed General Plan update process and to ensure that the Preferred Growth Scenario accurately reflected the community’s desired outcomes for the City. The meeting began with a brief introduction to the General Plan process, a review of background research and existing conditions in Weed, and a summary of community feedback gathered at previous meetings. Population, employment, and housing targets were presented as well as development constraints and opportunities. The Preferred Growth Scenario was presented in detail, with a discussion of conceptual land uses, outcomes in six key growth areas throughout the City, and the effects on each element of the General Plan.

Feedback
Community meeting #4 was attended by 15 participants who provided feedback on the Preferred Growth Scenario. After the presentation, posters were located around the room that summarized the key features of the conceptual land use and circulation plans as well as the outcomes of growth within six key areas throughout the City. Participants were provided a handout that reflected the key features on the posters and were asked to identify whether they “liked” or “disliked” each outcome. General comments and suggestions were also strongly encouraged. The purpose of this exercise was to verify with community members that the Preferred Growth Scenario accurately reflected their desire for future growth in the City. The results of the community feedback are summarized below, with “L” indicating “like” and “D” indicating “dislike”. The complete results are listed in Appendix D.

3 CONDITIONS & FACTORS OF GROWTH
3.1 Introduction
This chapter addresses the conditions and factors that influence future growth in the City of Weed. Background Research for this chapter included fieldwork, data analysis, and community input. In addition, this chapter presents projections for population growth, housing, and jobs. These projections inform the three development alternatives, and ultimately, the Preferred Growth Scenario for the City. 

3.2 Existing Strengths & Challenges
The community strengths and challenges were identified through public meetings, community outreach, and background research of exiting conditions in Weed. These strengths and challenges were considered in the development of the alternative growth scenarios and the policy document.
3.2.1 Community Strengths
Small-town Character 
Community members consistently expressed their satisfaction with Weed’s small-town character and strong sense of place, as well as the desire to build on the City’s rich history and culture.
Scenic Views 
Weed’s multiple view sheds of the iconic Mount Shasta contribute to a strong sense of place and make the City a desirable destination for visitors and residents.
Regional Connectivity
Due to the presence of I-5 and US 97 through the City, residents have relatively good access to goods and services in surrounding areas and visitors are encouraged to stop in Weed off the highway.


Housing
Housing prices in Weed are relatively reasonable, with a variety of neighborhoods that have a generally quiet and peaceful atmosphere.
Environmental Health
Weed has relatively clean air except for a few industrial and transportation-related sources of pollution. Residents expressed that Weed’s clean air and water is an attractive feature of the City.
Park Space
Many parks throughout Weed provide many opportunities for outdoor recreation and physical activity.

Residents expressed that Weed is a relatively safe community with minimal crime and sufficient police and fire services.
Health
There is relatively decent access to health care services located in the surrounding area, with the nearest hospital in Mount Shasta just nine miles south of Weed.
College of the Siskiyous
The College of the Siskiyous constitutes much of Weed’s local population and provides well-paying employment opportunities as well as recreational space for both students and residents.
Entrepreneurship
Community members expressed that there is a strong sense of local entrepreneurship in Weed.  
South Weed Revenue
Highway-serving commercial development in South Weed provides a stable revenue source for the City.
Vacant Land
Based on the 2015 Land Use Inventory, approximately 37 percent of land in Weed is vacant, which means that the City can easily accommodate development and population growth.
3.2.2 Community Challenges
Sprawling Development
Residents expressed concern about sprawling development in Weed that might threaten the City’s small-town character.
Lack of Vision
Many residents are concerned that there is no clear process or vision for future growth, including a lack of planning documents that guide the City’s use and conservation of resources.
Auto-oriented Development
Although Weed is a small City, the roadways are relatively auto-oriented, with incomplete sidewalks and insufficient provisions for bicyclists, pedestrians, and public transit riders.
Affordable Housing
The majority of community members expressed that the City lacked affordable housing options and little diversity amongst the housing stock, which affect the accommodation of all income levels. 
School Performance
Records show that Weed’s schools are experiencing declining enrollment and performance levels.
Access to Parks
Although the City has sufficient park space, there is insufficient access to parks and recreation from all neighborhoods within the City, as well as a lack of youth-centered outdoor recreation programs.
Highway Emissions
Weed’s proximity to I-5 may expose residents to traffic-related air pollution and may contribute to runoff that can threaten biological systems.
Employment Opportunities
Residents are very concerned with the lack of employment opportunities in Weed and expressed that there are minimal well-paying jobs that would retain College of the Siskiyous students or attract new residents to live and work in Weed.

Fire Danger
High fire severity zones surround weed due to high winds and dry conditions. Fire constitutes a major safety hazard in the City that poses a threat to existing and proposed development.

3.3 Growth Projections for 2040
The section describes population, housing and job growth projections that guide the formulation of the General Plan. In addition, these projections serve as the basis for the alternative growth scenarios: Business as Usual, Moderate Growth, Progressive Growth and finally, the Preferred Growth Scenario.
3.3.1 Population Projections
The City of Weed experienced population decline from 2000 to 2010. Additionally, some residents were displaced as a result the Boles Fire in 2014. This trend is expected to change during the planning period of the General Plan, with an overall increase in population by 2040. In comparison, population growth in the County is expected to decrease over the period of the General Plan. Population projections indicate that the City of Weed can grow by approximately 5.5 percent between 2010 and 2040. Based on current birth, death, and migration rates, the population in Weed will approach an estimated 3,131 by 2040 as illustrated in Table 3.3.1. 
Table 3.3.1 Population Projections, 2010 - 2040

To illustrate future demographic shifts in gender and age distribution, comparative population pyramids were created for 2010 and 2040. As illustrated in Figure 3.3.1 and Figure 3.3.2, as the population ages, the will become more column-like. This means that there will be a more even distribution of the population in age cohorts, which reflects an expected increase in the City’s senior population. The share of the population under 40 will decrease from 57 percent in 2010 to 51 percent by 2040.

3.3.2 Housing Projections
By 2040, Weed will need 191 additional housing units to meet its estimated population growth. This value was calculated according to the State of California guidelines (OPR, 2003), which is based on trends in household formation according to age group. This is then applied to the projected population in respective age cohorts. Table 3.3.2 shows the distribution of households by age of head of householder for 2010 and 2040.

Vacancy Rate and Housing Condition
To offset the possible presence of housing vacancies, projections assume that 8 percent of all housing units will remain vacant by 2040. About 11.2 percent of housing units in Weed were vacant in 2010. Of the 11.2 percent of vacant housing units, 1.3 percent are vacant due to seasonal, recreational, or occasional use. The 2015 Land Use Inventory found only 0.3 percent of housing units to be in bad condition. The share of vacant and uninhabitable land in Weed is 37 percent, which is greater than the vacancy rate used in the housing need determination. Weed has sufficient vacant space to expand development.

Development Assumptions
Under the 2040 General Plan, vacant parcels would be developed to accommodate infill housing and reduce the need to encroach on open space lands. Weed has a mix of occupied and seasonal housing units; therefore, the City would not gain many new occupied units by reducing the vacancy rate. Similarly, renovating housing in bad condition would add a marginal amount of housing to the available housing stock. Therefore, additional housing must come from the construction of many new units at infill sites, vacant land, and some mixed-use locations. 

3.3.3 Economic Projections
Based on the average job to labor force ratio in Weed from 2009 to 2013, along with population forecasts for 2040, there will be a need to accommodate at least 196 more jobs by 2040. This amount of job growth is reflected in the Business as Usual Scenario. The jobs to labor force ratio is based on economic data included in the United States Census and retrieved from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) database. 
The following are the main sectors in Weed according to the U.S. Census:
* Educational Services 
* Service – Administration & Support; Waste Management and Remediation; Health Care and Social Assistance; Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation; Accommodation and Food Services; Other Services (excluding Public Administration)
* Retail – Wholesale Trade; Retail Trade
* Office – Information; Finance and Insurance; Real Estate and Rental and Leasing; Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services; Management of Companies and Enterprises; Public Administration 
* Industrial – Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction; Construction; Manufacturing
* Other – Utilities; Transportation and Warehouse

Job Targets for Growth Scenarios
The job targets for the three growth scenarios are based on historical growth in Weed and California. Yearly growth between 2002 and 2013 were reviewed to determine growth targets for Weed, Siskiyou County, and California. The yearly growth for the Business as Usual Scenario is 0.5 percent, which reflects the recent historical growth trends in Weed from 2007 to 2013.  The Moderate Growth Scenario uses average yearly growth of 1.0 percent, which reflects the recent average yearly growth for the State of California from 2007 to 2013. The Progressive Growth Scenario uses an average yearly growth of 2.0 percent, which reflects the maximum yearly growth from 2002 to 2013 in Weed. A comparison of scenarios and growth rates is shown in Table 3.3.3.
Table 3.3.3 City of Weed, Annual Job Growth Targets

Determining the distribution of job growth targets amongst employment sectors was conducted using the shift-share projections method in combination with historical distribution of employment sectors. In recognition of the different levels of growth over that past decade, the shift-share projections compare Weed’s recent jobs data to the State of California. The result reflected the dramatic difference in jobs caused by the 2008 recession. The distribution of jobs from the shift-share projection was matched with historical trends for reasonableness. The final distribution accounted for the historic prevailing number of jobs by adjusting the shift share distribution. The final distribution of employment sector shares was applied to the job growth targets to arrive at the final number of jobs by sector. Table 3.3.4 shows annual growth rates for the City, County, and State, which inform the job targets of each growth scenario.

3.4 Development Opportunities and Constraints
3.4.1 Boundaries & Limits
The City of Weed does not border any other cities; however, unincorporated communities, open space, and Black Butte border it. The unincorporated communities to the north are Edgewood and Carrick. To the west are homes outside of the city limits, which are not a part of an identified incorporated community. The Shasta-Trinity National Forest is located to the City’s east, and contains Black Butte, which is also part of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest that is considered federally protected land. About nine miles South of Weed is the City of Mount Shasta. Interstate 5 runs through the City separating Bel Air from the Downtown and South Weed. US Route 97 starts in the center of town and runs northeast separating the Weed Golf Course from Downtown. The City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) extends well beyond the city limits in most directions. The Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) is responsible for approving the SOI, which is considered “a plan for the probable physical boundaries and service area of a local government agency” (OPR, 2014). Map 3.1 shows the boundaries for the City’s limits and SOI.

3.4.2 Opportunities
Opportunities for development include both vacant and underutilized land within the city limits. Map 3.2 shows a combination of underutilized parcels and vacant land in Weed. There is also opportunity to redevelop and revitalize many areas within the City. 
Vacant Land 
The 2015 Land Use Inventory identified 331 vacant parcels within city limits, totaling approximately 1,127 acres. These parcels do not contain any occupied structures, and are thus not being put to productive economic use. Vacant parcels are considered prime candidates for development due to their presence within the existing city limits and the availability of infrastructure such as roads, municipal water, and sewer lines. Vacant parcels are spread throughout the City, but most of the larger vacant parcels are located to the south of the City, as shown in Map 3.2. 
Underutilized Land
The Land Use Inventory also identified parcels that were considered underutilized. Underutilized parcels may have some structures on them and may be in productive use. However, these sites are considered underutilized when compared to the potential of the property for development or the condition of the buildings. Underutilized parcels could include parcels with structures rated as in “poor” condition, single-family lots that have enough room for an accessory dwelling unit, or large lots with small structures. Map 3.2 shows all the land within city limits that was classified as “underutilized”.

3.4.3 Constraints 
Constraints to development include both natural hazards and man-made obstacles. These areas should not be prime candidates for development or redevelopment by “best management practices”. These constraints include fire danger zones, flood zones, noise zones, steep slopes, and stream zones. However, other constraints cannot be mitigated, such as fault zones, protected agricultural zones, and historic sites. Weed has no nearby fault zones or protected agricultural zones.  
Fire Hazard
During the hot, dry months of the year, fire danger can increase in areas with an abundance of dry grass or brush. Cal Fire classifies land based on its fire hazard. The City is surrounded by very high fire severity zones, with the area west of the College of the Siskiyous being classified as a high severity zone and areas surrounding Roseburg Forest Products Co. Mill being classified as medium fire severity. Areas with high and very-high risk classifications will likely require mitigation if developed. Map 3.3 depicts areas classified by Cal Fire as ‘very high’, ‘high’ or ‘moderate’.

Map 3.3 Fire Hazard Severity in Weed

Source: City of Weed, 2015

Steep Slopes
Areas where there are steep slopes (that is, slopes that rise at least 10 feet high over a horizontal distance of 25 feet or less) are undesirable to develop. Building on steep slopes can cause erosion or landslides. There are identified steep slope areas to the south of College of Siskiyous and south of downtown. Map 3.4 shows steep slopes within and surrounding the City of Weed. 
Flood Zones
Flooding can occur during periods of sustained or intense rain. The Federal Management Agency (FEMA) has developed maps, known as “flood insurance rate maps” that show the extent of areas that are expected to flood at least every 100 years. There are several flood zones within the City that correspond to the location of Boles Creek, which runs along Interstate 5 south of Downtown Weed, and Beaughan Creek, in north Weed. Map 3.4 shows the flood zones within the City. 
Creeks and Streams
All lands within 100 feet of streams should be preserved to protect streams from damage and poor water quality. Streams are also subject to periodic flooding during extreme rain events. Development within stream buffers is therefore constrained due to public safety and conservation efforts. Beaughan Creek and Boles Creek are within city limits and subject to these constraints. They fall within the 100 Year flood zone and are shown in Map 3.4.


Map 3.4 Excessive Slopes and Flood Zones in Weed

Noise
Noise is considered a constraint to future development due to the negative impacts of noise on humans. Noise is defined as “unwanted sound”. It can cause annoyance, loss of sleep, and even ear damage in extreme cases. The main noise producers in Weed include Interstate 5, US Route 97, railroad tracks, and industrial land uses. New development in proximity of noise sources will likely require noise mitigation such as greater insulation or vegetation buffers. Map 3.5 shows noise producers and estimated noise levels in decibels (Db). Map 3.5 also shows sensitive noise receptors, near which noise generating land uses should not be placed.

Historic Sites 
All properties with sites listed on the National or State Historic Register should be preserved in their existing state. Federal regulations prohibit the development of these sites. Only one site within city limits is listed on a historic register: Shasta Inn and Weed Lumber Company Boarding House (burned down in the 2014 Boles Fire). Other non-registered sites for potential consideration as historic include the Weed Volunteer Fire Department Station, located on Roseburg Forest Products Co. property, Weed Mercantile Mall, and the Weed Palace Theater, both located in downtown. Map 3.6 shows the potential historic sites located within and near the City.

4 DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVES
4.1 Introduction
This chapter presents three alternatives for accommodating future population, housing, and employment trends in Weed through the year 2040. Each alternative presents options with varying development locations, densities, intensities, and types, of growth throughout the City.
The Business as Usual Alternative assumes that future growth will continue based on historic trends in land use patterns, housing type and density, and employment opportunities and locations. In this alternative, residential development remains predominantly low-density, with slightly higher densities in the downtown core and near College of the Siskiyous. Commercial development is concentrated in South Weed, with minor addition of retail businesses throughout existing neighborhoods. Business as Usual assumes that transportation in Weed will remain primarily auto-oriented. 
The Moderate Growth Alternative anticipates additional growth in population, housing, and employment beyond Business as Usual. The alternative focuses on growth within five key areas of the City through infill development, expansion of residential and commercial land in South Weed, Angel Valley, and north of the Weed Golf Course, and improved bicycle and pedestrian accessibility. Under the Moderate Growth Alternative, the distribution and location of land uses within the City is similar to Business as Usual. The key features include expanded highway-serving commercial development in South Weed, a designated mixed-use corridor along Main Street and College Avenue, and expansion of single-family homes north of the Weed Golf Course.
The Progressive Growth Alternative assumes the largest amount of growth of the three development scenarios. This alternative utilizes vacant land and underutilized parcels within city limits to accommodate future population, housing, and employment growth. The Progressive Growth Alternative prioritizes infill development in six key growth areas and allocates additional land uses for expanded development. Under this alternative, residential and open space land uses would each consist of 25 percent of the City’s total land, with additional land dedicated to public facilities, commercial, and industrial development. The key features of the Progressive Growth Scenario include neighborhood centers within key growth areas, medium and high-density housing options in Angel Valley, Historic Downtown, Bel Air, and South Weed, and preservation of open space through compact development.

4.2 Business as Usual
Business as Usual is an alternative that envisions how the City would grow if historic trends and patterns in population growth and economic development remain constant. The guiding principles behind the land use designations are based upon current zoning and land use practice within the City. The following sections discuss the demographic trends that inform the scenario, conceptual land use throughout the City, and the key outcomes within five growth areas: Angel Valley, School House Hill, Central Weed, South Weed, and Vista Heights.
4.2.1 Growth Assumptions
The population of Weed is projected to increase 5.5 percent by 2040, amounting to a total population of 3,131. Given this population growth, the City will require the addition of 191 new housing units, which can be accommodated within city boundaries. Assuming natural growth over the last five years in Weed, Business as Usual forecasts an additional 196 jobs by 2040. Pre-approved projects capture many of these jobs to be developed in the South Weed area. Table 4.2.1 summarizes population, housing, and employment projections under Business as Usual Conditions.

4.2.2 Conceptual Land Use
Under these growth assumptions, anticipated population, housing, and employment trends would result in the continuation of low-density land uses, along with the introduction of some medium-density development in Central Weed. Map 4.1 highlights the location of new land uses in the Business as Usual Alternative and Figure 4.2.1 shows the distribution of land use types. Much of the additional housing need can be accommodated through infill development of vacant lots in existing residential neighborhoods, with land allocated to expansion in Angel Valley and Vista Heights. Following economic growth trends, the Business as Usual Scenario anticipates that future commercial development will be concentrated in South Weed and along North Weed Boulevard, and therefore allocates additional commercial land in these areas.

Residential Land Use
To accommodate the projected population growth for 2040, the City will need a minimum of 191 additional housing units. Most of the residential land in Weed is in the northern portion of the City, with many vacant parcels that are designated as residential land. A key feature of the Business as Usual Scenario is low-density single-family homes along the western boundary of South Weed, where land has already been subdivided and road and utility infrastructure have been expanded. Low-density residential land is also allocated in the vacant lot adjacent to Charlie Byrd Park in Angel Valley. A small amount of medium-density housing is apportioned through mixed-use development in downtown, and core areas near downtown and College of the Siskiyous.  
Figure 4.2.2 illustrates the future housing densities resulting from the Business as Usual development pattern. Low-density would continue to make up a large majority of Weed’s housing stock, with slight increases in medium-density, high-density, and mixed-use development. Table 4.2.2 details the distribution of housing by density of both existing and proposed acreage. Table 4.2.3 details the distribution by location and density of additional housing units, showing the acres needed to accommodate each housing type. Under Business as Usual conditions, the City would need to allocate 93 acres of vacant land for new housing development, which could accommodate up to 262 new housing units.

Commercial Land Use
Business as Usual accommodates commercial growth through vacant and underutilized parcels along Black Butte Drive in South Weed and North Weed Boulevard. As shown in Map 4.1, some of the new commercial land uses would occupy vacant lots in South Weed where new development projects including a Starbucks, Holiday Inn Express, and Grocery Outlet are underway. The South Weed commercial consists of highway-serving commercial development that is the City’s primary source of revenue. Expanding this commercial area may benefit the City by attracting visitors and increasing revenue. 
Commercial activity will also continue to expand in a similar fashion in downtown Weed. Many of downtown’s buildings are unoccupied, but historical mixed-use structures would be officially designated as mixed-use under the Business as Usual Scenario. Anticipated job growth by 2040 requires land to accommodate 196 new jobs, which can be met through commercial development of the City’s abundant vacant land and pre-approved project sites in the South Weed area. Figure 4.2.3 shows the distribution of commercial land use types.

4.2.3 Key Growth Areas
Weed is a small town with a traditional downtown center and primarily single-family homes. Due to the City’s location along I-5, it is also a prime location for travelers to stop and refuel. The Business as Usual Alternative projects a continuation of this type of development within five key growth areas of the City:
1. Angel Valley
2. School House Hill
3. Central Weed
4. South Weed
5. Vista Heights

Angel Valley
Angel Valley is the northernmost neighborhood in Weed, which consists primarily of low-density residential development north of Roseburg Forest Products Co. Mill. There is ample vacant land in Angel Valley, including a large lot east of Charlie Byrd Park and north of Broadway Avenue. Existing development in Angel Valley is shown in Figure 4.2.4. Business as Usual anticipates infill residential development in Angel Valley that is consistent with the neighborhood’s current density. Additional land allocated to low-density residential development would be located west of Oak Street in part of the vacant land near Charlie Byrd Park. The concept underlying this key growth area is to maintain the neighborhood’s quaint, residential character by limiting commercial or other larger scale development from occurring. Figure 4.2.5 shows the proposed changes that could occur in Angel Valley in the Business as Usual Scenario.
Figure 4.2.4 Angel Valley Existing Condition, Business as Usual

Figure 4.2.5 Angel Valley Future Vision, Business as Usual


School House Hill
The northeastern residential part of the City is identified as School House Hill due to its proximity to Weed High School and Weed Elementary school. This area also consists of low-density single-family homes, many of which are currently being rebuilt after the Boles Fire. The existing condition of School House Hill is shown in Figure 4.2.6. The Business as Usual Scenario anticipates the construction of 60 new homes that will replace homes destroyed in the 2014 Boles Fire. Like Angel Valley, School House Hill would continue to be characterized as a small residential neighborhood with low-density single-family homes that cater to a family-oriented environment. Figure 4.2.7 shows how the neighborhood would be built out by 2040, with new homes highlighted in yellow.
Figure 4.2.6 School House Hill Existing Condition, Business as Usual

Figure 4.2.7 School House Hill Future Vision, Business as Usual


Central Weed
In the Business as Usual Alternative, Central Weed is defined as the corridor along North and South Weed Boulevard, as well as Main Street and the surrounding residential area within the bounds of the railroad tracks. Central Weed functions as the City’s historic downtown, characterized by mixed-use buildings along Main Street and tourist-serving commercial uses along North and South Weed Boulevard. Many of Weed’s civic buildings such as City Hall and the Post Office are also located in Central Weed at the northern end of Main Street. Single-family homes are the primary housing type in the neighborhood, with some medium-density apartments along East Lake Street. Figure 4.2.8 shows existing development in Central Weed.
Under the Business as Usual Scenario, Main Street would be formally designated as a mixed-use area, with some additional commercial activity in the area. However, there would be minimal improvements to streetscaping or additional pedestrian amenities. North and South Weed Boulevard would continue to consist of low-density commercial service land uses geared toward visitors. The Business as Usual Scenario also presumes the addition of some higher-density development in Central Weed to support a growing population. Figure 4.2.9 shows the future vision for Central Weed.
Figure 4.2.8 Central Weed Existing Condition, Business as Usual


Figure 4.2.9 Central Weed Future Vision, Business as Usual


South Weed 
South Weed is comprised of highway-serving commercial development centered on the Vista Drive exit off I-5. There are several acres of vacant land adjoining the commercial center, with Crystal Geyser, a major employment center located north of Vista Drive. Business as Usual anticipates the continuation of highway-serving commercial land uses in South Weed, with no allocation of residential, open space, or public facilities land in the area. This scenario accounts for businesses that have been pre-approved to locate in South Weed including an RV park, Grocery Outlet, and Holiday Inn Express. These businesses capture a majority of the job growth projected under Business as Usual conditions. Additionally, these developments will likely attract more travelers to the area from I-5, which will generate additional revenue for the City. Under Business as Usual, no proposed roadway changes are in South Weed except for minor repairs necessary to maintain adequate pavement conditions. Figure 4.2.10 shows existing conditions in South Weed and Figure 4.2.11 shows the future vision for South Weed in the Business as Usual scenario.

Vista Heights 
Vista Heights is in South Weed west of I-5 and consists of vacant land that has been subdivided for single-family homes. The Business As Usual Scenario assumes the construction of low-density single-family homes that have a more rural and secluded character than the rest of the City’s housing stock. These homes will be surrounded by open space, prime forestland, and will have stunning views Mount Shasta. Figure 4.2.12 shows existing conditions in Vista Heights and Figure 4.2.13 shows the future vision for Vista Heights in the Business as Usual scenario.

Figure 4.2.13 Vista Heights Proposed Condition, Business as Usual

4.2.4 Circulation
Under Business as Usual conditions, Weed’s circulation system would remain primarily auto-oriented, within minimal improvements or expansion to the existing roadway network. Public transportation service would maintain in its existing state, serving core areas of the City but not providing frequent or adequate service to make transit a feasible transportation option. The number of bicyclists and pedestrians is projected to remain stagnant, with far more people walking in the City due to the proximity of destinations. However, Business as Usual would lead to minimal expansion of the sidewalk network, which will discourage further pedestrian activity and continue to put pedestrians at risk of speeding vehicles. Weed’s bicycle network would continue to be minimal, thereby further discouraging residents from biking for transportation or recreational purposes in the City. Map 4.2 shows the conceptual circulation network for motorized transportation under the Business as Usual Scenario. Map 4.3 shows the conception circulation for pedestrian and bicycle transportation under the Business as Usual Scenario.

4.2.5 Outcomes
The Business as Usual Scenario would result in a very similar pattern to Weed’s existing condition by 2040, with very few proposed land use changes. The City’s housing stock would remain predominantly low-density, with new housing accommodated through infill development in Weed’s existing neighborhoods. Minor residential expansion is projected to occur in Angel Valley as well as Vista Heights. A designated mixed-use area along Main Street is intended to promote the revitalization of buildings and attract new businesses to downtown. This strategy is intended to capitalize on the existing mixed-use buildings that have potential to help transform the area into a more vibrant corridor. While some jobs will be created through expansion of retail and service in Central Weed, most of the anticipated job growth under Business as Usual conditions will be absorbed by highway-serving commercial expansion in South Weed.


4.3 Moderate Growth Alternative
The Moderate Growth Alternative targets additional growth beyond the Business as Usual Scenario. In this scenario, the City can preserve existing low-density neighborhoods while accommodating future housing needs by concentrating higher-density housing options in core areas of the City. Moderate Growth aims to foster employment growth across sectors by allocating land to commercial development along key corridors within the City. A fundamental concept of the Moderate Growth Alternative is to place retail, jobs, and services within walkable and bikeable distances of residential development. Circulation improvements are proposed to enhance the transportation network for public transit, bicycles, and pedestrians to create a more accessible city.
The Moderate Growth Alternative accommodates growth in population, housing, and employment by focusing development in six key growth areas:
1. Angel Valley
2. School House Hill
3. Central Weed
4. Bel Air
5. South Weed
6. Vista Heights
4.3.1 Growth Assumptions
The Moderate Growth Alternative assumes that population and employment growth will surpass the historical trend in Weed over the last five years. The growth assumptions in this scenario are based on the annual growth rate in California over the last five years, which projects the addition of twice as many jobs in 2040 as the Business as Usual Scenario. The job target equates to a population growth of 514, resulting in about 3,481 total residents by 2040. Consequently, the Moderate Growth Alternative requires an additional 350 housing units to accommodate population growth. Table 4.3.1 shows the population, housing, and employment projections under the Moderate Growth Alternative.

4.3.2 Conceptual Land Use
The Moderate Growth Alternative plans for the City of Weed to meet future population growth, housing, and employment needs through 2040. This alternative meets the City’s needs by: (1) providing a mix of commercial land uses, (2) diversifying the housing stock through a mix of residential densities, and (3) creating a continuous active transportation network throughout the City. Conceptual land uses are illustrated in Map 4.2 and are based on development constraints and opportunities, existing conditions in Weed, and feedback gathered throughout the community outreach process. The bolded areas in Map 4.2 indicate new or changed land uses. Higher-density residential land uses are concentrated in core areas of the City, with low-density residential expansion along the periphery of existing neighborhoods. The purpose of these land use allocations is to ensure that residents are within a ¼ to ½ mile walkable radius of housing, recreation, goods, and services. Changes will reflect the City’s small-town character by limiting building heights in key growth areas.
The Moderate Growth Scenario concentrates growth well within Weed’s city limits, occupying about 5 percent of existing vacant land. Residential and open space land will increase to approximately 15 percent of Weed’s total land each. Commercial, industrial, and mixed-use land uses will also undergo a slight increase in this scenario to ensure sufficient land to accommodate economic growth. The distribution of land use types is shown in Figure 4.3.1.

Residential Land Use
The anticipated population growth in the Moderate Growth Alternative will require the City to house an additional 514 residents by 2040, which translates to about 350 additional housing units. Housing need is accommodated through a mix of low, medium, and high-density residential land uses as well as mixed-use. The location and distribution of residential land aims to preserve the character of single-family neighborhoods and prioritizes development on vacant and underutilized parcels within the City.
By distributing housing in key growth areas, a total of 423 housing units could be accommodated by 2040, with most of the additional homes being single-family detached. Much residential growth is proposed in Angel Valley, with medium-density development comprising most of the neighborhood’s additional housing units. Residential development in the downtown area will be more focused on higher-density housing options. 
As shown in Figure 4.3.2, new development between now and 2040 will focus on medium density housing while ensuring that low-density single-family homes remain the predominant housing type in Weed. Table 4.3.2 shows the breakdown of proposed housing densities in the Moderate Growth Alternative. These densities are intended to match the existing condition in Weed and accommodate new residential development that is compatible with the character of existing neighborhoods.

Commercial Land Use
The Moderate Growth Scenario anticipates the addition of nearly 400 jobs by 2040. To accommodate and stimulate job growth, this scenario allocates various types of commercial land uses throughout the City. New commercial land uses are proposed that intensify existing commercial corridors. Commercial development is proposed in vacant and underutilized parcels along Main Street and North Weed Boulevard, along College Avenue, and Black Butte Drive in South Weed. Proposed commercial land uses are shown in relation to existing commercial land in Map 4.3.
Under the Moderate Growth Alternative, commercial land uses in Central Weed along Main Street and North Weed Boulevard would create employment opportunities in retail, office, and service sectors. Mixed-use development along College Avenue would provide additional employment opportunities of this nature. Commercial land uses in South Weed along Black Butte Drive are geared towards highway-serving businesses that foster skilled and semi-skilled, manufacturing job opportunities and generate revenue for the City. Figure 4.3.4 shows the distribution of commercial land use types in the Moderate Growth Alternative. Proposed commercial acreages and employment potentials are detailed in Table 4.3.5.

4.3.3 Key Growth Areas
Angel Valley
The Moderate Growth Scenario envisions the continuation of Angel Valley as a solely residential neighborhood with a mix of housing densities to accommodate population growth by 2040. Angel Valley would include medium-density housing options such as multifamily dwellings and townhomes located in the vacant land east of Charlie Byrd Park, with infill of small-lot single-family homes is the existing residential neighborhood. The purpose of locating additional housing in Angel Valley is to maintain the neighborhood’s peaceful residential character while providing diverse housing options that meet the needs of all residents. A benefit of locating medium-density housing adjacent to Charlie Byrd Park is that residents will have access to recreational opportunities provided by the park. Under the Moderate Growth Scenario, 29 additional acres of land would be available for residential uses, accommodating a total of 197 medium-density housing units and 26 single-family homes. Figure 4.3.3 shows existing conditions in Angel Valley and Figure 4.3.4 shows the future vision for Angel Valley in the Moderate Growth Scenario.

Figure 4.3.3 Angel Valley Existing Condition, Moderate Growth


Figure 4.3.4 Angel Valley Future Vision, Moderate Growth


School House Hill
The Moderate Growth Scenario anticipates the reconstruction of 70 homes in the School House Hill neighborhood that were lost during the 2014 Boles Fire. Prioritizing infill development of single-family homes in this key growth area is intended to maintain consistency with the current land use pattern. A building height limit of two stories and a density standard of no more than four dwelling units/acre will ensure that the neighborhood retains its peaceful character. Figure 4.3.5 shows existing conditions in School House Hill and Figure 4.3.6 shows the future vision for School House Hill in the Moderate Growth Scenario.

Figure 4.3.5 School House Hill Existing Condition, Moderate Growth


Figure 4.3.6 School House Hill Future Vision, Moderate Growth


Central Weed
The Moderate Growth Scenario aims to concentrate residential development in the City’s core primarily by locating a range of new housing developments in the Central Weed area. Revitalization of mixed-use buildings in the Historic Downtown and infill of commercial development along North Weed Boulevard would provide residents with access to everyday goods and service. The Moderate Growth Scenario aims to transform downtown Weed into the City’s central activity hub with retail opportunities that cater to tourists and residents. As the City’s dominant commercial area, Central Weed would stimulate job growth and create an enhanced sense of place that reflects the City’s historic character. Although infill development of mixed-use buildings is proposed, limiting building heights to a maximum of three stories will ensure that the City retains its small-town feel and iconic views of Mount Shasta.
A key feature of Central Weed in the Moderate Growth Scenario is the addition of low to medium-density residential development north of the Weed Golf Course. This development would be targeted at accommodating Weed’s aging population by prioritizing senior housing or a retirement community in this serene location. Residents in this area would also be near Main Street that would reduce the need to drive long distances to acquire goods and services. Circulation improvements in Central Weed under the Moderate Growth Scenario include minor traffic calming improvements along South Weed Boulevard, provision of bicycle lanes along Main Street, and improved sidewalk connectivity that cater to an enhanced pedestrian experience. Figure 4.3.7 shows the existing condition of Central Weed and Figure 4.3.8 shows what the neighborhood could look like by 2040. 

Figure 4.3.7 Central Weed Existing Conditions, Moderate Growth


Figure 4.3.8 Central Weed Future Vision, Moderate Growth



Bel Air
The Bel Air key growth area is one of the City’s central neighborhoods, with predominantly single-family homes, the iconic Mount Shasta Brewery, and Bel Air Park. A prominent feature of the neighborhood is the College of the Siskiyous, which comprises much of the City’s population and occupies a large plot of land along the City’s western border. The Moderate Growth Scenario aims to capitalize on the presence of the College of the Siskiyous by developing a small-scale commercial corridor that primarily caters to the needs of students. This commercial center would be located along College Avenue, and would be characterized by mixed-use buildings that contain retail, office, and residential uses. Infill development of single-family detached homes along the neighborhood’s periphery are proposed to accommodate population growth. Since residents of Bel Air must travel roughly one mile to reach the nearest commercial area in downtown, this scenario aims to create a hub of services that are within a walkable distance. The Moderate Growth Alternative also aims to integrate more pedestrian amenities and bicycle facilities into the local roadway network. Incorporating principles of complete streets along College Avenue would enhance safety and provide college students with improved access to the City since college students often rely on non-motorized modes of transportation. Figure 4.3.9 shows the existing condition of Bel Air and Figure 4.3.10 shows the future vision of the area under the Moderate Growth Scenario.
Figure 4.3.9 Bel Air Existing Conditions, Moderate Growth

Figure 4.3.10 Bel Air Future Vision, Moderate Growth

South Weed
The Moderate Growth Alternative proposes the continuation of highway-serving commercial land uses in South Weed along the Vista Drive exit off I-5. Existing commercial development along Black Butte Drive provides a major source of revenue to the City, and residents expressed during community outreach that they would like to see an expansion of such development in the area. Expanded commercial development along Black Butte Drive is intended to attract additional traffic from passersby on I-5. To accommodate additional traffic, South Weed would be a priority location for roadway improvements, enhanced traffic control, and the provision of adequate parking facilities. 
Development in South Weed is anticipated to occupy approximately 43 additional acres of land, which translates to the creation of roughly 430 jobs. These jobs would be primarily concentrated in the service sector, with some opportunity for office and light industrial land uses. Figure 4.3.11 shows the existing condition of South Weed and Figure 4.3.12 shows the future vision of the area under the Moderate Growth Scenario.
Figure 4.3.11 South Weed Existing Conditions, Moderate Growth


Figure 4.3.12 South Weed Future Vision, Moderate Growth


Vista Heights
The Moderate Growth Alternative anticipates the construction of large-lot single-family homes in the Vista Heights neighborhood along the City’s southwest border. Vacant land in this area has been subdivided to accommodate low-density residential development. Under the Moderate Growth Alternative, Vista Heights could support roughly 80 homes, which translates to approximately two dwelling units per acre. Transportation infrastructure exists that can support new development; however, extension of utilities and service may be necessary to serve the new development. Figure 4.3.13 and Figure 4.3.14 show the existing condition and future vision of Vista Heights under the Moderate Growth Scenario.

Figure 4.3.13 Vista Heights Existing Conditions, Moderate Growth


Figure 4.3.14 Vista Heights Future Vision, Moderate Growth





4.3.4 Circulation 

The Moderate Growth Alternative proposes a complete network of sidewalks and bicycle infrastructure that will provide additional opportunities for walking and biking in Weed. This scenario targets improvements for all modes of transportation, while emphasizing the integration of complete streets principles along the City’s commercial corridors. Traffic calming mechanisms including speed bumps, textured pavement, and signage are proposed along roads with fast-moving traffic to notify drivers that they are entering an area with high pedestrian activity. The Moderate Growth Alternative also focuses on enhancing safety and reducing vehicle damage by prioritizing pavement repair in Angel Valley, School House Hill, Central Weed, and Bel Air.
Maps 4.4 – 4.6 reflect the proposed circulation network for motorized and non-motorized modes of transportation. As shown in Map 4.4, the Moderate Growth Alternative includes an extension of Black Butte Drive to accommodate commercial growth as well as expansion of the roadway network north of the Weed Golf Course and in Angel Valley to serve new residential development. Map 4.5 shows where sidewalk repair and extension would occur under the Moderate Growth Alternative, with most of the repair prioritized in core areas of the City with higher pedestrian traffic. The proposed bicycle network is displayed in Map 4.6. Bike lanes are proposed along the City’s major corridors, with an emphasis on shared roadway amenities along local roads. The Moderate Growth Alternative does not propose any addition or expansion of multi-use trails within the City.

4.3.5 Outcomes
The Moderate Growth Scenario could result in 423 additional housing units and over 400 additional jobs by 2040. The Alternative calls for strategic growth while retaining the small-town and historic character of Weed that community members wish to maintain. Emphasis on infill and redevelopment of vacant and underutilized parcels aims to accommodate higher-density housing options in core areas of the City. A mix of townhomes, multifamily homes, apartments, and duplexes will ensure that there is ample housing to meet the diverse needs of Weed’s growing population. Mixed-use residential, retail, service, and office use along Main Street and College Avenue will encourage residents to walk more frequently and increase retail and service opportunities for residents and tourists alike. An improved and continuous network of sidewalks throughout the City will also support walkability. 



4.4 Progressive Growth Scenario
The Progressive Growth Alternative targets the largest amount of growth of all three development alternatives. To accommodate population, housing, and employment growth, the Progressive Growth Scenario proposes many changes to land use and density throughout the City. The scenario envisions a reinvigorated local economy driven by job growth in anchor industries and a variety of housing types to accommodate the City’s growing population and workforce. The fundamental concepts underlying the Progressive Growth Alternative include neighborhood centers throughout core areas of the City, enhanced mobility for all modes of transportation, expanded public facilities, and preservation of open space. This growth scenario allocates land for expanded development along the City’s periphery and prioritizes more concentrated development in five key growth areas. These key growth areas are intended to enhance access to goods and services, increase local connectivity, and promote safe, healthy, and vibrant neighborhoods. 
The five key growth areas in this alternative include:
   1. Angel Valley
   2. Historic Downtown
   3. North/South Weed Boulevard
   4. Bel Air
   5. South Weed

4.4.1 Growth Assumptions
The Progressive Growth Alternative targets an annual job growth rate of 2 percent, which reflects the City’s historic growth rate from 2002 to 2013. This alternative would result in nearly 800 additional jobs by 2040, which is twice the assumed job growth of the Moderate Growth Alternative. Considering this job target, the City would experience a 20 percent increase in population to a total of 3,602 residents by 2040. This growth would require the addition of 689 housing units to accommodate the growing population. Table 4.4.1 summarizes the population, housing, and employment targets that inform the Progressive Growth Alternative.

4.4.2 Conceptual Land Use
The Progressive Growth Alternative allocates land for additional growth beyond the requirements necessary to accommodate population, housing, and employment targets. This alternative would result in a diversified set of land uses within the City and anticipates a build-out that would utilize about 60 percent of Weed’s vacant land. Consequently, residential and open space land uses would grow to comprise about 25 percent of Weed’s total land each. This scenario aims to diversify housing densities beyond the Moderate Growth Alternative by creating more options for higher-density living in core areas of the City. The Progressive Growth Alternative also proposes to increase commercial and industrial land uses to accommodate job growth. A slight increase in mixed-use land is proposed as well. Figure 4.4.1 shows the distribution of land uses in the Progressive Growth Alternative.
Map 4.7 shows the location of proposed land uses as well as the key growth areas in the Progressive Growth Scenario. As shown on the map, medium-density housing and neighborhood commercial development are proposed in Angel Valley, with high-density housing and mixed-use infill development in Historic Downtown. These higher-density housing options are intended to accommodate a large increase in population while preserving open space along the City’s periphery. Commercial expansion is proposed along North and South Weed Boulevard to stimulate further job growth, with additional mixed-use and commercial development in Bel Air that is targeted at the college population. South Weed would experience growth across all land use categories, with a large increase in residential land, open space, and commercial and industrial land uses. Growth in South Weed is intended to locate housing near jobs, retail services, and open space, thereby reducing the need to travel long distances.

Residential Land Use
To accommodate projected population growth under the Progressive Growth Alternative, the City would need a minimum of 689 additional housing units. The Progressive Growth Alternative plans beyond this minimum requirement by proposing residential land uses that could potentially accommodate nearly 3,439 new housing units. Table 4.4.3 details the residential potential of the Progressive Growth Alternative by key growth area. South Weed can accommodate the largest amount of housing due to its vast expanses of vacant land; however, the Progressive Growth Alternative aims to prioritize residential development in core areas of the City. Most of proposed housing units are medium-density due to the high number of dwelling units per acre; however, more acreage within the City would be devoted to low-density single-family homes. Figure 4.4.2 shows the distribution of residential densities, which indicates that there would be an increase in medium-density, high-density, and mixed-use housing options beyond the Moderate Growth Alternative. Table 4.4.2 shows the housing density standards, building height limits, and total land acreages by density in the Progressive Growth Alternative.

Commercial Land Use
Commercial land uses in the Progressive Growth Alternative are aimed at ensuring sufficient land to accommodate growth in anchor industries while diversifying across employment sectors. The Progressive Growth Alternative targets an additional 800 jobs by 2040, which is based on the City’s annual growth rate from 2002 to 2013. The land uses designated in this alternative exceed this target by providing enough commercial land to accommodate nearly 1,400 new jobs. This would result in a total of 2,800 jobs by 2040. Table 4.4.4 details job growth potential and commercial acreages by key growth area. South Weed has the highest potential for job growth due to its abundance of vacant land and existing highway-serving commercial land uses, which can be expanded to generate additional revenue for the City. Tourist-serving commercial development is also targeted along the North and South Weed Boulevard Corridor. Commercial land uses in the remainder of the key growth areas is dedicated to mixed-use and small-scale neighborhood centers that provide residents with access to goods and services while creating local jobs.
Figure 4.4.3 shows the breakdown of commercial land use types in the Progressive Growth Alternative. The office sector is captured by the mixed-use category, which explains why the figure shows such a small amount of land dedicate to office space. Industrial land would make up nearly half of all the commercial land in Weed due to proposed expansion surrounding existing industrial land in South Weed. Under the Progressive Growth Alternative, service and retail land uses would undergo the largest amount of growth, thereby accommodating jobs in retail, tourism, and accommodation and food services.

4.4.3 Key Growth Areas
Angel Valley
The Progressive Growth Scenario envisions Angel Valley as a densified residential neighborhood with multiple housing options and a neighborhood commercial center that provides services to residents across the City. In this scenario, infill development of single-family homes would be prioritized in the existing residential neighborhood, with expanded low-density development north of California Avenue, and opportunities for multifamily housing east of Charlie Byrd Park.
The key feature of Angel Valley under the Progressive Scenario is neighborhood-serving commercial development located in the vacant parcel of land directly north of Broadway Ave. This small-scale development could bring important goods and services to the local community, thereby reducing the need to travel long distance to carry out typical errands. The development would also include public spaces and outdoor seating where residents and visitors can enjoy the scenic view of Mount Shasta. A mix of multifamily housing and apartments are proposed north of the neighborhood commercial center, which will provide an affordable and accessible housing option for people working and living in Weed. Additionally, this new housing would be located adjacent to Charlie Byrd Park, thereby providing residents with convenient access to recreation. Figure 4.4.4 and Figure 4.4.5 show the existing condition and future vision of proposed development. 

Figure 4.4.4 Angel Valley Existing Condition, Progressive Growth

Figure 4.4.5 Angel Valley Future Vision, Progressive Growth


Historic Downtown
Under the Progressive Growth Scenario, Historic Downtown would become the focal point of the City, with expanded opportunities for housing, employment, and retail activity. Main Street would be transformed into a vibrant, walkable, mixed-use corridor that honors the City’s historic character and attracts residents and visitors to shop and recreate in the area. Designating Main Street as a mixed-use area would maximize the number of dwelling units and office space at the heart of the City. To accommodate more dense development while respecting the City’s small-town character, building heights would be limited to three stories along Main Street. This is also intended to preserve viewsheds of Mount Shasta. Other key features of Main Street include an enhanced streetscape with improved lighting, additional street trees, and pedestrian amenities as well as expanded space for public facilities and community-serving commercial uses along the northern end of Main Street. Figure 4.4.6 and Figure 4.4.7 show the existing condition and future vision of Historic Downtown.
The Progressive Growth Scenario also accommodates low-density housing options through infill of small-lot single-family homes in the existing residential neighborhood. Prioritizing infill development will ensure that single-family homes are the primary housing type in Historic Downtown. To accommodate a variety of housing types, high-density residential development is proposed on the south side of Boles Street adjacent to the Boles Creek Apartments. These apartment units will be near goods and services located along Main Street and South Weed Boulevard. The Progressive Growth Scenario does not propose any expansion to the circulation network in Historic Downtown, but establishes the neighborhood as a priority location for pavement repair, bicycle infrastructure, and a complete sidewalk network that will help encourage the use of non-motorized transportation.

North/South Weed Boulevard Corridor
The North/South Weed Boulevard corridor is an important connection between North and South Weed, and the only alternative connection to I-5. South Weed Boulevard serves traffic coming into downtown from I-5, and US 97 intersects with the junction of North and South Weed Boulevard where Ray’s Grocery store is located. In its existing condition, the corridor contains a mix of commercial uses including gas stations, motels, and restaurants that serve both residents and visitors.
The Progressive Growth Scenario emphasizes the importance of the North/South Weed Boulevard Corridor as a critical connection between the City’s north and south. This scenario envisions the continuation of service and retail development along the corridor to foster job growth and expand commercial opportunities in the City’s core. Infill commercial development that is compatible with existing uses along South Weed Boulevard is proposed to enhance the corridor’s walkability and sense of place. Vacant parcels along North Weed Boulevard will be allocated to mixed-use development that contains both office and retail uses. A key feature of the Progressive Growth Alternative is ensuring that parking is located behind new development to enhance the corridor’s streetscape and aesthetic quality. Figure 4.4.8 and Figure 4.4.9 show the existing condition and future vision for the North/South Weed Boulevard Corridor.
While commercial development is an important feature of this key growth area, transportation improvements such as traffic calming, sidewalk expansion, bike lanes, and transit accessibility are fundamental to actualizing the corridor’s full potential. Traffic calming improvements such as speed bumps, textured crosswalks, and signage are intended to warn vehicles to slow down upon exiting the freeway. Curb bulbouts, striped crosswalks, and flashing beacons are proposed at existing intersections to enhance the pedestrian experience, increase visibility, and improve safety for all road users. The Progressive Growth Scenario prioritizes a complete sidewalk network along the North/South Weed Boulevard Corridor to ensure that pedestrians always have a safe place to walk, especially considering that the corridor serves as one of the City’s official truck routes. Bicycle lanes are also proposed to ensure connectivity to Main Street, College Avenue, and Old Edgewood Road (a popular bike route). Lastly, the Progressive Growth Scenario proposes a new transit stop along North Weed Boulevard that will function as an access point to the new commercial development.
Figure 4.4.8 North/South Weed Blvd. Corridor Existing Conditions, Progressive Growth


Figure 4.4.9 North/South Weed Blvd. Corridor Future Vision, Progressive Growth



Bel Air
The Progressive Growth Alternative envisions Bel Air as a vibrant neighborhood with a variety of homes, offices, restaurants, and shops that cater locals, tourists, and the college population. Mixed-use development along College Avenue will provide retail opportunities on the ground floor, while accommodating medium-density housing options or office space above. A key feature of Bel Air under the Progressive Growth Alternative is the addition of commercial land uses along South Weed Boulevard, which would foster additional job growth while reducing residents’ exposure to noise and emissions from I-5. The purpose of commercial expansion along College Avenue and South Weed Boulevard is to create a cohesive neighborhood center that enhances the relationship between College of the Siskiyous and the rest of the City. These corridors are to undergo streetscaping as well as improvements to pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure in order to promote active modes as safe and viable forms of transportation.
The Progressive Growth Alternative focuses on infill development of vacant residential land surrounding College Avenue that could accommodate multifamily homes or townhouses. Medium-density development is proposed in the neighborhood’s core to enhance walkability and to ensure that there is a variety of housing types within walking distance to retail development. This key growth area also contains ample land surrounding existing residential areas that could be expanded to accommodate additional single-family homes. 

Figure 4.4.10 Bel Air Existing Conditions, Progressive Growth


Figure 4.4.11 Bel Air Future Vision, Progressive Growth



South Weed
Under the Progressive Growth Alternative, South Weed would experience significant commercial and residential growth, with strategic placement of land uses to improve accessibility to retail, open space, and emergency services. Unlike the Business as Usual and Moderate Growth Scenarios, Progressive Growth targets housing development in South Weed due to the abundance of vacant land that is within proximity to open space and services. The Progressive Growth Scenario proposes high, medium, and low-density housing options east of commercial development along Black Butte Drive, with lower density housing located father from the highway. Medium-density housing options are proposed along Vista Drive west of I-5. The Progressive Growth Alternative also anticipates the construction of large-lot single-family homes in the Vista Heights area. With a full build-out of residential land, South Weed could accommodate approximately 2,300 new housing units by 2040.
This alternative proposes expansion and diversification of commercial land uses beyond the Moderate Growth Alternative. While still focusing on highway-serving commercial development along Black Butte Drive to increase revenue, Progressive Growth includes the development of a neighborhood commercial center west of I-5. This neighborhood center would serve as an alternative to “big box” retailers across the highway, and would provide small-scale commercial opportunities to residents and visitors. The Progressive Growth Alternative also proposes a significant increase in industrial land in South Weed adjacent to the Crystal Geyser facility to stimulate additional job growth. Commercial land uses in the South Weed key growth area have the potential to accommodate over 1,000 new jobs by 2040.
A key feature of the Progressive Growth Alternative is preservation of open space in the Black Butte area at Weed’s southern border. This area serves as a popular recreation area and important natural habitat. Open space is also proposed surrounding new residential land uses on both sides of I-5 to create a buffer from highway and industrial sources of noise and pollution, and to ensure that residents have ample access to recreational opportunities. Another key feature of South Weed is new public facilities along Vista Drive west of I-5 that would contain both fire and police services that are intended to support new development within the area. Expansion of the roadway network, services, and utilities will also be necessary to support the rapid growth anticipated in South Weed.

4.4.4 Circulation
The Progressive Growth Alternative proposes a circulation system that will enhance safety, mobility, and accessibility for all modes of transportation. A complete streets emphasis with traffic calming improvements is intended to promote walking, biking, and public transportation within the between key growth areas. The Progressive Growth Alternative prioritizes sidewalk repair and construction in core areas of the City and ensures that sidewalk installation is required adjacent to new development. Map 4.9 shows the proposed pedestrian circulation network, with new and improved sidewalks highlighted in brown. A complete and connected bicycle network is also proposed under the Progressive Growth Alternative. Bicycle lanes along main corridors and shared roadway facilities on smaller residential streets will promote biking as a viable form of transportation and recreation. Additionally, the Progressive Growth Alternative proposes a multi-use trail that connects north and south Weed by following the CORP railroad line. However, physical separation between the path and railroad right of way would need to be installed to ensure the safety of trail users. The proposed bicycle circulation network is shown in Map 4.10.
Map 4.8 shows the proposed motorized circulation network, which includes automobiles and public transportation. The red stars indicate priority locations for new transit stops, three of which are in South Weed to serve new development. Expanded access to public transportation is focused in areas of the City that are currently underserved by the existing transit network and are expected to experience significant residential and commercial growth. Extensions to the existing roadway network are proposed in Angel Valley, Bel Air, and South Weed, with pavement repair prioritized along collector roads in key growth areas.
In Angel Valley, Railroad Avenue would be extended in the northbound direction to serve residential and commercial development adjacent to Charlie Byrd Park, with an expanded grid network north of California Avenue to provide access for new single-family homes. This new grid network will enhance connectivity within Angel Valley and ensure that emergency vehicles have adequate access to the area. A roadway extension is also proposed south of Boles Avenue to support high-density development. North/South Weed Boulevard will be emphasized as a key connection for all modes of transportation, with a focus on improving safety and accessibility for bicyclists and pedestrians who do not have access to alternative routes between Weed’s northern and southern neighborhoods. Lastly, College Avenue will be a priority corridor for complete streets improvements that cater to college students who typically rely on non-motorized transportation. All new roads constructed under the Progressive Growth Alternative will contain provisions for bicyclists and pedestrians to continue the promotion of active transportation.

4.4.5 Outcomes
The Progressive Growth Alternative proposes a land use plan that could accommodate up to 1,300 new jobs and 3,450 additional housing units by 2040. Strategic location of land uses and housing densities throughout key growth areas will enhance walkability and provide a diversity of housing and employment opportunities. Infill of vacant and underutilized parcels within city limits will also promote a more walkable and compact city. Mixed-use development in conjunction with streetscape improvements along Main Street and College Avenue will stimulate economic revitalization and create vibrant neighborhood centers that attract both residents and visitors. The Progressive Growth Alternative proposes commercial land uses that will foster job growth in anchor industries of tourism, retail, and accommodation and food services. Denser housing options in core areas of the City will ensure that the housing stock meets the needs of a diverse and growing population. Additional parks and open space will ensure that residents have access to outdoor recreation and physical activity opportunities. Lastly, expansion of the circulation network and additional public facilities and utilities will ensure that the City can accommodate growth throughout key growth areas.

5 PREFERRED GROWTH SCENARIO
5.1 Introduction
The Preferred Growth Scenario reflects a combination of the Moderate and Progressive Growth Alternatives presented in Chapter 4. This chapter describes the conceptual foundation of the Preferred Growth Scenario and growth assumptions that inform the proposed land use and circulation plans. The Preferred Growth Scenario is based on existing conditions in Weed, development opportunities and constraints, and the community’s vision for the City. The Preferred Growth Scenario directly influences future land use allocation and circulation improvements, and is designed to meet future community needs and growth expectations. The Preferred Growth Scenario has implications for each element of the General Plan, including circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise, public safety, economic development, public facilities and services, community design, and health, each of which is discussed individually in this chapter.

5.2 Concept & Proposal
The Preferred Growth Scenario is based on input from community meetings, public outreach in Weed, physical constraints to development, and land opportunities for growth. The concept focuses infill development in the City’s core areas, and residential expansion to accommodate a variety of housing types while maintaining the City’s small-town character. The Preferred Growth Scenario maintains low-density single-family homes as the primary form of housing in Weed. 
Conceptual circulation focuses on enhanced connectivity for all modes of transportation, with expansion of the existing roadway network to serve new development. Targeting roadway improvements along South Weed Boulevard, College Avenue, Main Street, Davis Street, and Broadway Avenue would improve access to downtown and enhance mobility for existing and future residents of Weed. The Preferred Growth Scenario prioritizes a complete streets circulation system that recognizes automobiles, pedestrians, and bicyclists equally. Additionally, development is distributed in a way that preserves open space and enhances access to trails and recreational opportunities. 
The Preferred Growth Scenario focuses on economic development through anchor industries of tourism, education, retail, health services, and accommodation and food services. Commercial land in key growth areas provides ample space for economic growth through 2040. This vision is reflected throughout the Plan, and can be achieved through the adoption of the General Plan goals, objectives, policies, and programs.

5.2.1 Growth Assumptions
The Preferred Growth Scenario assumes the same population, housing, and employment growth as the Progressive Growth Scenario. Population and housing growth is based on the employment target for 2040, which assumes that growth will follow the historic trend in Weed from 2002 to 2013. The job target under the Preferred Growth Scenario aims to accommodate nearly 800 new jobs by 2040. Taking into account population projections and employment growth, the Preferred Growth Scenario accommodates a 20 percent increase in population to a total of 3,602 residents by 2040. To accommodate the growth in population, the Preferred Growth Scenario requires the construction of approximately 689 new housing units, which would result in 1,922 housing units by 2040. Table 5.2.1 summarizes the growth assumptions that inform the Preferred Growth Alternative.
Table 5.2.1 Preferred Growth Scenario Growth Assumptions
Assumptions201020402010 – 2040 ChangePopulation Target2,9673,602635Housing Target1,2331,922689Employment Target1,4442,239795Source: Cal Poly Planning Team, 2016
5.2.2 Conceptual Land Uses
Conceptual land uses for the Preferred Growth Scenario are based on a combination of existing land uses, proposed land uses, and the community’s preferred aspects of each growth alternative. The goal of the Preferred Growth Scenario is to ensure a spatially well-balanced set of land uses within the City, with appropriate densities to serve the growing population while maintaining Weed’s small-town character. 
The intended outcome of proposed land uses is to create a place with adequate provision of jobs in anchor industries, suitable housing options for multiple income groups, improved conditions for active transportation, and increased access to parks and open space. This is achieved through strategic and concentrated development in core areas of the City, infill of residential and commercial land uses, and a connected circulation network that provides residents with access to recreation, health services, and everyday necessities.    

There are six key growth areas to accommodate future growth including:
1. Angel Valley
2. Creekside Village
3. Historic Downtown
4. North and South Weed Boulevard Corridor
5. Bel Air
6. South Weed

Map 5.1 shows the conceptual land uses in the Preferred Growth Scenario as well as the key growth areas.

Under the Preferred Growth Scenario, vacant land would decrease by 81 percent, leaving 7 percent of Weed’s total land vacant by 2040. Residential and open space land would comprise nearly 25 percent each of Weed’s total land area. There would also be a three percent increase in land dedicated to public facilities due to expansion in Bel Air, School House Hill, and Historic Downtown. Increased mixed-use, commercial, and industrial land uses are proposed to accommodate the anticipated job growth by 2040. Table 5.2.2 shows a comparison of land uses in 2015 and 2040, while Figure 5.2.1 shows the breakdown of land by uses in 2040.

Conceptual Housing
The Preferred Growth Scenario distributes a variety of housing types throughout the City. Infill residential development is prioritized within each key growth area, with additional land set aside for residential expansion along the periphery of existing neighborhoods. The Preferred Growth Scenario allocates a range of housing densities throughout the City to ensure that the housing stock meets the diverse needs of current and future residents. Map 5.2 shows where new housing would be located in the Preferred Growth Scenario. The residential potential of each key growth area is discussed in Section 5.2.5 - Land Use Outcomes.
Map 5.2 Conceptual Housing Map, Preferred Growth


Source: Cal Poly Planning Team, 2017
The Preferred Growth Scenario categorizes housing densities as low, medium, or high-density, as well as mixed-use, which contains the same ratio of units per acre as medium-density. High-density typically refers to apartments or other residential buildings that contain more than 16 dwelling units per acre. Medium-density contains between 6 to 15 dwelling units per acre, and can be either mixed-use, townhomes, or multifamily dwellings. Low-density is defined as residential areas with less than 5 dwelling units per acre. These housing densities are derived from known standards as well as existing housing densities in Weed. Table 5.2.3 shows the density standards under the Preferred Growth Scenario, as well as building height limitations, total parcels by density, and total acreage by density. 

Table 5.2.3 Housing by Density under Preferred Growth
Preferred Growth: Housing By DensityResidential DensitiesDwelling Units Per AcreNumber of StoriesParcels% of Total ParcelsAcreage % of 
Total AcresHigh Density16 - 211 - 3172%446%Medium Density6 - 151 - 3363%365%Low Density0.5 - 51 - 298089%60286%Mixed Use6 - 201 - 3666%152%Total 1099100%697100%Source: Cal Poly Planning Team, 2016

Figure 5.2.2 displays the distribution of housing densities in the Preferred Growth Scenario. Weed’s housing stock would remain primarily low-density to maintain single-family homes as the primary housing type. High-density and mixed-use residential land uses would make up a small percentage of Weed’s total land. The largest change in residential density is the increase in high-density development to accommodate growth while ensuring a scale that is consistent with Weed’s character.

Conceptual Commercial 
The Preferred Growth Scenario fosters job growth by allocating a mix of commercial land uses throughout the City. Diversifying commercial land uses can accommodate job growth across economic sectors, with an emphasis on five anchor industries: education, retail, tourism, health services, and accommodation and food services. Much of the anticipated job growth can be captured by growth of the College of the Siskiyous, which contains sufficient land for expansion. Neighborhood-scale retail commercial land uses are proposed in Angel Valley, Creekside Village, Bel Air, and South Weed, which can provide residents with every day goods and services within walking distance. Highway-serving commercial land uses are proposed in South Weed to capture revenue, and vibrant mixed-use corridors along Main Street and College Avenue can attract visitors and create retail jobs. Map 5.3 shows where commercial land uses are proposed within the City.





Map 5.3 Preferred Growth Scenario Commercial Land Use Map


Source: Cal Poly Planning Team, 2017

Figure 5.2.3 shows the distribution of commercial land use types in the Preferred Growth Scenario. Service commercial uses generally require larger amounts of land for the purposes of light production and consumer services such as ‘big box’ development. Service commercial development is concentrated in South Weed, making up 17 percent of Weed’s total commercial land. The Preferred Growth Scenario also includes tourist-serving businesses such as hotels and gas stations under the service commercial designation. Retail commercial refers to neighborhood-scale development such as restaurants, shops, and other small community-serving businesses. Retail land comprises about 26 percent of Weed’s commercial land. Office commercial land use is designated for professional services and businesses that concentrate jobs in certain areas, but makes up a small percent of commercial land in Weed. Industrial land is dedicated to light manufacturing and production purposes. Majority of the commercial acreage in Weed is designated as industrial land located in South Weed.

Figure 5.2.3 Distribution of Commercial Land Use by Acreage, Preferred Growth

Mixed-Use
Mixed-use development is defined as any combination of land uses, typically including commercial and residential development, located on the same parcel or structure. Mixed-use can be beneficial when located strategically by increasing access and walkability between compatible land uses. Reducing distances between housing, workplaces, and retail establishments can also lead to safer neighborhoods that cater to pedestrian and bicycle transportation. By increasing pedestrian activity, mixed-use neighborhoods can foster social interaction and enhanced quality of life through community cohesion. 
Weed’s downtown consists of mixed-use buildings along Main Street, many of which are vacant. While the structural component of mixed-use is in place, designating Main Street as an official mixed-use area can ensure that this type of development is the primary land use type. Mixed-use development is also proposed along College Avenue to accommodate retail and entertainment activities that would cater to college students and medium-density housing options. 

5.2.3 Key Growth Areas
Angel Valley
The Preferred Growth Scenario envisions Angel Valley as a community-oriented residential neighborhood with access to recreation and a small-scale retail commercial center. Neighborhood-serving commercial development along the eastern span of California Avenue can provide residents with access to everyday goods and services within walking distance. The addition of sidewalks throughout the neighborhood and bike lanes along key corridors such as California Avenue, Broadway Avenue, and Morris Street can enhance walkability and promote physical activity throughout Angel Valley. These improvements, along with prioritizing road pavement, can enrich the neighborhood’s character by promoting use of outdoor space.
The Preferred Plan aims to maintain Angel Valley’s quaint residential character by limiting housing density. By allocating new land uses as low-density residential and prioritizing infill of single-family lots, the Preferred Growth Scenario ensures that Angel Valley continues to consist predominantly of single-family homes. Open space land south of US 97 is reserved for preserving Weed’s natural resources and ensuring that future development is not exposed to potential flooding from Boles Creek. A major feature of the Angel Valley growth area is the expansion of park space directly east of Charlie Byrd Park. This land, acquired in 2016 by the Parks and Recreation District, is to be the site of a new community center with additional recreational space. Map 5.4 displays the location of these land uses. Figure 5.2.4 through Figure 5.2.7 compare existing conditions with how Angel Valley could look by 2040.

Creekside Village
Creekside Village refers to the area to the east of the Weed Golf Course and west of US 97 which consists of underutilized parcels that are suitable for development. The Preferred Growth Scenario envisions Creekside Village as an expanded residential neighborhood within the City that can accommodate additional single-family homes while providing special needs housing that meets the needs of Weed’s aging population. When presented during community meetings, participants liked the idea of residential expansion in this area. As shown in Map 5.5, low-density residential development could span the periphery of the Weed Golf Course, thereby creating a more traditional style neighborhood within a core area of the City. 

Medium-density residential development adjacent to US 97 is a key strategy of the Creekside Village growth area, which reflects the community’s preference to ensure a variety of housing types within the City. Demographic trends show that 20 percent of Weed’s population will be over 65 years old by 2040. A senior care facility or retirement homes in this neighborhood can accommodate the aging population by providing a safe, accessible, and centrally located housing option. Another key feature of Creekside Village is neighborhood-serving commercial development that can provide residents with access to basic goods and services without having to cross US 97 or the railroad tracks. To accommodate development, public utilities and local roadways would need to be expanded to provide adequate services to future residents and businesses. Figures 5.2.8 through 5.2.10 show the existing and proposed condition of Creekside Village in the Preferred Growth Scenario.

Historic Downtown
In the Preferred Growth Scenario, Historic Downtown would undergo significant economic revitalization that would transform the area into a vibrant, mixed-use, walkable neighborhood. This key growth area holds cultural and historic value for the City, and has great potential to serve as an economic center serving both residents and visitors. In its existing condition, Main Street contains mixed-use buildings and wide tiled sidewalks that are important structural foundations of a thriving downtown. The goals and policies of the Preferred Plan aim to capitalize on these structural components by attracting local businesses and investors to Weed’s downtown. Designating Main Street as a mixed-use corridor is a key strategy to reinvigorate Historic Downtown and enhance the neighborhood’s aesthetic quality and desirability as a place to live, work, shop, and recreate.

One of the key features of the Historic Downtown growth area is an improved streetscape along Main Street with pedestrian amenities such as outdoor seating, street trees, and articulated storefronts that foster interaction between indoor and outdoor spaces. Traffic calming improvements including curb bulb-outs can create a more inviting pedestrian atmosphere and improve safety by reducing crossing distances at intersections. Bicycle lanes along Main Street can also enhance multimodal connectivity and create additional foot traffic that could increase revenue for local businesses. The Preferred Plan also proposes limiting the height of mixed-use buildings along Main Street to three stories to preserve scenic views of Mount Shasta and maintain the City’s small-town character. Feedback from community meetings indicates that improving the aesthetic quality of Main Street through mixed-use development and an enhanced streetscape are top priorities for the residents of Weed.

Another integral component of Historic Downtown in the Preferred Growth Scenario is additional medium-density housing on the south side of Boles Avenue that could contain townhomes or multifamily homes. Community outreach, particularly from meeting #4, revealed that residents were hesitant to incorporate high-density development in this area as proposed in the Progressive Growth Scenario. The Preferred Growth Scenario limits density in this area to ensure adequate residential land to accommodate population growth while reflecting the community’s desire to preserve Weed’s small-town character. Additionally, infill development of single-family homes in the residential area surrounding Main Street is a priority of the Preferred Growth Scenario. Map 5.6 shows the proposed land uses in Historic Downtown. Figure 5.2.11 through Figure 5.2.13 show the existing and proposed condition of this key growth area.

North and South Weed Boulevard Corridor
The Preferred Growth Scenario identifies the North and South Weed Boulevard Corridor as a key connection between Historic Downtown, Bel Air, and South Weed. As the only alternative connection between north and south Weed (besides I-5), this corridor is an important functional component of the City’s transportation network. This key growth area emphasizes a mix of retail and service commercial land uses that cater to tourists travelling through the area. Due to the central location, development of this area can also enhance residents’ access to goods and services. The land uses designated in the Preferred Growth Scenario are compatible with existing land uses; however, the Plan calls for more dense and compact development along the corridor. Map 5.7 shows the proposed land uses along the North and South Weed Boulevard Corridor.
This key growth area should also serve as a gateway to Historic Downtown, as visitors exiting I-5 must use this route to access Main Street. Signage and navigational landmarks that indicate entrance to the City should be prioritized in an effort to create a smooth transition between the more auto-oriented North and South Weed Boulevard Corridor and the pedestrian-oriented downtown. While this key growth area can maintain its designation as a truck route through the City, traffic calming efforts can help create a more safe and enjoyable atmosphere for bicyclists and pedestrians. Multimodal considerations are especially important along this corridor due to the lack of non-highway alternative connections between Weed’s north and south. Reducing vehicle speeds, increasing safety, and enhancing awareness of pedestrians is fundamental to ensuring that a complete streets objective is achieved. Figure 5.2.14 through Figure 5.2.18 show the existing and proposed condition of this key growth area.

Bel Air
Bel Air is identified as the neighborhood adjacent to College of the Siskiyous (COS) and is the only neighborhood in Weed located west of I-5. This key growth area is characterized by low-density single-family homes spanning along College Avenue and South Weed Boulevard, as well as apartments and higher density student housing on the COS campus. Bel Air Park and the iconic Mount Shasta Brewery are two key features of the neighborhood. The Preferred Growth Scenario envisions Bel Air as a neighborhood that primarily caters to the college community through retail, arts, and recreation. The key outcomes of this key growth area include mixed-use development along College Avenue, expansion of low-density housing north of Sullivan Road, new apartments adjacent to COS, and additional public facilities. 
Map 5.8 shows where new land uses are proposed in Bel Air. As indicated on the map, mixed-use along College Avenue can provide accessible retail development to college students and faculty, with expanded access to healthy food and entertainment activities. The Preferred Growth Scenario conceptualizes College Avenue as one of the City’s economic centers, with a strong focus on fostering arts and culture through public art and outdoor spaces. Like mixed-use development along Main Street, building heights along College Avenue may be limited to two stories to preserve the neighborhood’s small-town charm. Another key feature of Bel Air is proposed commercial development along South Weed Boulevard, which would accommodate additional growth in the retail sector. This commercial land would also serve as a buffer between residential development in Bel Air and the potentially harmful effects of noise and air pollution from I-5.
Medium-density housing is proposed surrounding College Avenue that can accommodate the City’s population growth as well as growth of the COS community. To accommodate growth in the college population, high-density residential development for student housing is proposed adjacent to existing apartments east of the COS campus. Expansion of single-family homes north of Sullivan Avenue can also provide a low-density housing option for residents and workers in Bel Air. In addition to commercial and residential land uses, the Preferred Growth Scenario includes the provision of public facilities that would be centrally located to reduce emergency response times throughout the City.
In terms of circulation, Bel Air would be characterized by strong multimodal connectivity and accessibility. Bike lanes along College Avenue and South Weed Boulevard are proposed to enhance safety and enable students to bike as a viable form of transportation. Expansion of sidewalks throughout Bel Air can also improve the pedestrian experience and enhance access to public transit services. Figure 5.2.17 through Figure 5.2.19 show the existing condition of Bel Air and how the neighborhood could look like by 2040.

South Weed
The Preferred Growth Scenario emphasizes South Weed as the City’s service commercial center by allocating land to commercial and industrial uses that can create jobs and generate revenue for the City. The Preferred Plan aims to capitalize on South Weed’s existing condition as a highway-serving commercial center by concentrating additional tourist-serving uses along the Vista Drive exit off I-5. While economic activity is the primary focus of the South Weed growth area, residential and open space land uses are also proposed to ensure a diversity of land uses throughout the City that can accommodate population growth. Key outcomes of this growth area include expansion of low, and high-density housing options, neighborhood-serving commercial development west of I-5, an expanded circulation network and trail system, and preservation of open space. Map 5.9 shows the location of land uses in the South Weed growth area. 

Aside from generating revenue, the purpose of concentrating commercial development along Black Butte Drive is to ensure the preservation of open space land in the Black Butte area, which serves as an important recreational resource. Open space land is also apportioned surrounding proposed residential areas to serve as a buffer that can minimize potential noise and air pollution impacts due to commercial and industrial land uses. While highway-serving commercial development is proposed along both sides of I-5, land for small-scale retail businesses is also allocated west of I-5 to provide residents with access to goods and services within walking distance.
The Preferred Growth Scenario also generates a significant increase in residential land in the South Weed area that accommodates low, and high-density housing options. East of I-5, residential development becomes less dense with distance from Black Butte Drive to separate single-family homes from large commercial land uses. Low-density housing is apportioned in the Vista Heights area, which has already been subdivided to accommodate single-family homes. The land directly west of I-5 is allocated for expansion of retail. 
In its existing state, South Weed does not have sufficient infrastructure to support the type of development proposed in the Preferred Plan. Thus, public utilities and transportation infrastructure would need to be expanded to serve new development areas. To promote multimodal transportation throughout the City, new roadways would feature provisions for bicyclists and pedestrians as well as expanded public transit services. Figure 5.2.20 through Figure 5.2.23 show the existing condition of South Weed and the proposed condition of how the neighborhood could look like in 2040.

5.2.4 Circulation
The Preferred Growth Scenario proposes a circulation plan that emphasizes walking and biking as viable modes of transportation throughout the City. The objective of this plan is to address the circulation needs of the City by increasing mobility, accessibility, connectivity, and safety for all modes of transportation. This plan ensures compliance with the California Complete Streets Act of 2008 (AB 1358), and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, by incorporating complete streets principles and traffic calming measures that promote multimodal transportation along new and existing roadways. The plan also emphasizes pavement maintenance as an important component to improving circulation within the City. Weed is a small city, and the infill and mixed-use development proposed in the Preferred Growth Scenario can enhance the City’s compactness, making walking and biking more convenient ways of getting around.  




Non-motorized Circulation
Pedestrian Network
The Preferred Growth Scenario focuses on maintance and repair of existing sidewalks, as well as expansion of the sidewalk network to serve new development. According to the American Community Survey, 10 percent of Weed’s residents walk to work, which is higher than the state and national percentage of pedestrian commuters (ACS, 2014). Because Weed is a small City, most destinations are within walking distance; however, sufficient infrastructure is not in place to support the growth of pedestrian activity to its full potential. Map 5.10 shows existing and proposed sidewalks in Weed. Neighborhoods that should be prioritized for sidewalk improvements include Historic Downtown, Bel Air, and Angel Valley due to their compact residential character which supports walking. Existing roads in South Weed have good quality sidewalks which would be expanded in the Preferred Growth Scenario. 
In addition to the sidewalk network, traffic calming improvements are proposed along key corridors to enhance the pedestrian experience. Figure 5.2.24 shows examples of traffic calming improvements. These corridors include South Weed Boulevard, Main Street, Davis Street, College Avenue, and Shastina Drive. These priority locations could feature improvements such as widened sidewalks, textured crosswalks, curb bulbouts, benches, street trees, and improved lighting to help create a more inviting and enjoyable experience for locals and visitors walking in Weed.

Bicycle Network
The Preferred Growth Scenario emphasizes improvements to the bicycle network that can promote bicycling as a viable form of transportation and accessible recreational activity. Dedicated bicycle lanes should be added along the main corridors of each neighborhood and can serve the purpose of connecting key growth areas. Bicycle lanes along Main Street, College Avenue, and South Weed Boulevard cab enable residents to access retail establishments and provide visitors with a safe and enjoyable cycling experience in the City. Map 5.11 shows the proposed bicycle network. The orange lines indicate shared roadways, where residential roads with low traffic speeds can be improved through “sharrow” markings and signage to better accommodate bicycle travel. Figure 5.2.25 shows examples of the different types of bicycle infrastructure in the Preferred Plan.
The proposed bicycle network also includes a multi-use trail that connects north and south Weed, which can be utilized by both bicyclists and pedestrians. The multi-use trail is intended to promote and enhance recreational bicycling opportunities within the City, while also providing residents with a direct, scenic route for everyday trips. Map 5.11 also displays locations where bicycle parking should be prioritized. Community feedback revealed that residents not only support an enhanced bicycle network, but also would like to see bicycle amenities such as parking to supplement new infrastructure. The Preferred Growth Scenario strategically locates priority bicycle parking areas at key intersections to ensure that cyclists can securely park their bikes.

Motorized Circulation
Public Transportation
The Preferred Growth Scenario aims to increase public transit ridership within the City of Weed by improving access to transit and enhancing amenities at local bus stops. The City is geographically well-served by Siskiyou Transit and General Express (STAGE); however, service is infrequent which reduces convenience for transit riders. Map 5.12 shows existing transit routes in Weed as well as intersections that are identified as priority locations for new transit stops. Expansion of transit service is proposed primarily in South Weed to serve new development. The Preferred Plan outlines goals and objectives that focus on improving transit service by coordinating with STAGE, prioritizing sidewalk repair near transit stops, and installing benches, shelters, and trashcans at transit stops to make the bus a more attractive transportation alternative. Improving public transit in Weed is also an important component of increasing regional connectivity and access to neighboring cities.

Automobile Network
The Preferred Growth Scenario focuses on two key concerns regarding the automobile network in Weed: improvement of existing roadways and expansion to serve new development. During community outreach events, residents expressed that they would like to see improved pavement quality along Weed’s roads. Many roads in the City are in poor condition due to limited fiscal resources. Poor road conditions can be uncomfortable to drive on and damaging to vehicles. The Preferred Growth Scenario recommends the preparation of a Pavement Condition Inventory to identify roads where pavement repair should be prioritized. The Preferred Plan also allocates new land uses in undeveloped areas of the City that may require expansion of transportation infrastructure. Map 5.12 displays a conceptual representation of where new roadways could be located by 2040.

5.2.5 Land Use Outcomes
The Preferred Growth Scenario has implications on the allocation of land for commercial, residential, public facilities, industrial, and open space land uses. Although the Preferred Plan focuses on six key growth areas, there are land use implications in other areas of the City including Lincoln Heights and School House Hill. Lincoln Heights is the residential neighborhood west of US 97 and School House Hill is located next to Weed High School and Elementary School. While no land use changes are proposed in these areas, it is important to account for additional homes that are included in the Preferred Growth Scenario. 
As discussed at the beginning of this chapter, the Preferred Growth Scenario targets an additional 800 jobs and approximately 700 new housing units by 2040. A major goal of the Preferred Plan is to stimulate economic growth by setting a job target that can allow for increased employment opportunities for Weed residents. The following sections describe how the land use outcomes of the Preferred Plan could affect housing and employment in each key growth area and the City.

Residential Potential
Expansion of residential land in the Preferred Growth Scenario will result in additional housing units in every growth area except for the North and South Weed Boulevard Corridor. Although population and employment projections indicate a need for 700 new housing units, the Preferred Plan could potentially accommodate more than 1,900 new units. Table 5.2.4 shows the proposed residential densities within each key growth area as well as the total acreage and estimate of potential for additional dwelling units. The estimated dwelling units were calculated based on proposed density and residential acreage. The largest addition of residential land is in South Weed due to the area’s abundance of vacant land; however, the Preferred Growth Scenario prioritizes residential development through infill and expansion within existing neighborhoods. As shown in Table 5.2.5 the proposed residential densities indicate that by 2040, most of the housing units can remain low-density single-family. Mixed-use in Historic Downtown and Bel Air can serve as a medium-density housing option in core areas of the City, with a small amount of high-density residential development in Bel Air to serve the college population.

Commercial Potential
Commercial land uses are proposed in six out of seven growth areas to support service, retail, office, and industrial job growth. South Weed has the greatest potential for job creation due to ample vacant land that is suitable for commercial development. Job growth potential in Weed’s remaining neighborhoods is attributed to proposed neighborhood-serving commercial development as well as mixed-use land for office and retail uses. Table 5.2.6 shows the proposed commercial acreage in each key growth area, as well as the type of commercial use, jobs per acre standard based on existing conditions, and job growth potential. The Preferred Growth Scenario allocates commercial land that can accommodate job growth that far exceeds the target of 795 new jobs by 2040. It is important to note the distinction between commercial potential and job creation. While there is ample land allocated to different commercial uses, this does not necessarily overlap with the employment sectors emphasized in the Preferred Plan. A large amount of land in South Weed is designated as light industrial due to compatibility with existing land uses. Commercial land for retail and service has potential to accommodate over 1,600 new jobs including positions in tourism, retail, and food and accommodation services. The Preferred Plan anticipates employment growth in the education sector, which is not displayed in Table 5.2.6 because the land where these jobs would be created is owned by College of the Siskiyous (COS) and is designated as public facilities. Educational land of COS is not being changed or added to Weed’s developable land.

5.3 Effects on Community Needs
5.3.1 Land Use
The Preferred Growth can result in a diversified set of land uses within the City. The mix of land uses in key growth areas can benefit the community by offering residents enhanced opportunities to live, shop, work, and recreate locally. A majority of the proposed land use changes is to occur on vacant land or underutilized parcels, which comprised over 37 percent of Weed’s total land according to the 2015 Land Use Inventory. The proposed changes are intended to foster economic vitality through employment growth and tourism, while ensuring a stable and diverse housing stock that meets the needs of the growing population. Land uses within key growth areas are strategically located to ensure adequate access to services and to reduce the proximity of potentially conflicting uses.
Table 5.3.1 shows a comparison of the existing and proposed acreage of each land use category under the Preferred Growth Scenario.  Residential land will comprise nearly a quarter of Weed’s total land, with most of the total acreage dedicated to low-density development suitable to single-family homes. Due to the small amount of existing high-density residential development, this land use type is to more than double (by 130 percent) to 44 acres while only comprising 1 percent of Weed’s total land. Medium-density residential development is to increase by half as much to 36 acres under the Preferred Growth Scenario. These residential land uses are to ensure the provision of a variety of housing types throughout each neighborhood in Weed. Figure 5.3.1 shows the distribution of land uses in 2040. 
Mixed-use development is also to increase residential and commercial potential by providing compact housing and employment opportunities in core areas of the City. The Preferred Growth Scenario proposes nearly 15 acres of mixed-use land, which would comprise 0.5 percent of total land in Weed. Commercial land uses in service, retail, and office categories are to increase as well, primarily by locating neighborhood centers within key growth areas and expanding highway-serving commercial development in South Weed. Light industrial development is also to experience a significant increase from the existing condition, yet still making up about 5 percent of Weed’s total land by 2040. Land designated as open space is to increase drastically in the Preferred Plan. Open space is allocated strategically to preserve Weed’s natural habitats and resources, provide a buffer between potentially conflicting land uses, and ensure adequate recreational park space to meet the needs of the population.

5.3.2 Circulation
The multimodal circulation plan developed under the Preferred Growth Scenario aims to increase pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit shares while also improving conditions for vehicular traffic. The projected population and employment growth can lead to an increase in vehicular traffic throughout the City, which the Circulation Plan aims to mitigate by prioritizing public transit and active transportation modes. The increased vehicular traffic can also lead to increased parking demand, which is addressed through development guidelines and standards. The Preferred Growth Scenario also aims to capitalize on Weed’s recreational tourism sector, which could generate additional traffic beyond population growth projections. Tourist traffic is likely to have the greatest impact on South Weed, South Weed Boulevard, and Main Street. 
The proposed pedestrian network improvements in the Preferred Growth Scenario aim to enhance connectivity, safety, and accessibility for pedestrians. Sidewalks are prioritized in Weed’s residential neighborhoods to promote walking as a viable option for local home-based trips, and especially to ensure safe walking routes to school. Sidewalks exist along many of Weed’s commercial corridors; however, traffic-calming improvements such as crosswalks, curb bulb-outs, and speed bumps are proposed to increase safety and enhance the pedestrian experience. 
A comprehensive bicycle network is proposed to connect key growth areas to promote bicycling as a viable form of transportation and enhance recreational cycling within the City and surrounding areas. A multi-use trail connecting Weed’s parks and open space can contribute to increased recreational tourism and healthy physical activity, while bicycle lanes and shared roadway amenities can improve cycling conditions along city streets. The Preferred Growth Scenario also identifies priority locations for improved and expanded public transit services that would make transit a more feasible transportation option. The provision of benches, shelters, and improved sidewalk conditions aim to increase the attractiveness, comfort, and security of the existing transit system.
Another key feature of the Preferred Growth Circulation Plan is expansion of the roadway network to serve new developments in Angel Valley, Creekside Village, Bel Air, and South Weed. The Preferred Plan ensures that new roadways incorporate principles of complete streets and provide adequate safety and accessibility for all modes of transportation. Additionally, the adoption and implementation of a Pavement Condition Indexing system can help prioritize existing roadways where pavement maintenance is needed to enhance the City’s visual quality and improve conditions for vehicular travel. 

5.3.3 Housing
The Preferred Growth Scenario has many implications for the future of housing development in Weed. The City could need up to approximately 700 additional housing units by 2040 to accommodate the population growth anticipated in the Preferred Growth Scenario. There is an adequate supply of vacant land to meet the City’s future single-family and multi-family residential needs. Based on the 2010?2015 Housing Element, several multi-family residential sites identified in the City can accommodate additional housing required by the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). The Preferred Growth Scenario allocates sufficient residential land to accommodate the housing need set forth in the 2010 2015 RHNA and its future updates through 2040.
Under the Preferred Growth Scenario, new housing would be concentrated through strategic infill of targeted growth areas and expansion along the periphery of existing neighborhoods. Infill residential development in Angel Valley, Lincoln Heights, School House Hill, Bel Air, and Historic Downtown is intended to densify these areas while maintaining the small-town atmosphere characterized by Weed’s predominantly single-family housing stock. Residential expansion in Angel Valley, Bel Air, Creekside Village, and South Weed is to provide additional accommodation of low-density single-family homes. More concentrated residential development in core areas of the City is intended to bring residents within close proximity to amenities such as retail shopping, recreation, entertainment, and public services. This is part of a broader growth strategy to accommodate projected population growth while supporting the community’s desire to have a diversified housing stock and vibrant, walkable neighborhoods.
Demand drives the housing market. By 2040, Weed is projected to experience a change in demographic composition. The elderly population is expected to increase as well as young adults, while the population of middle age and young children are likely to decrease slightly. This shift has significant implications on future housing needs, as mobility, access, and proximity will be key criteria in housing selection. Elderly residents may have limited mobility and require closer proximity to essential services such as transit, health care, and shopping. Young adults working locally may prefer the convenience of smaller units and closer retail amenities, while multi-family homes can provide an affordable and compact housing option for families.
The Preferred Growth Scenario accounts for the various housing needs by allocating approximately 22 percent of residential land to medium-density and high-density housing in core areas of the City. This includes two acres of mixed?use allocated along the Main Street corridor that can accommodate approximately 40 apartment units above commercial businesses. Utilizing infill strategies, the Bel Air neighborhood can accommodate about 70 additional mixed-use and medium?density housing units. New medium-density and high-density land allocations in Creekside Village and South Weed have the potential for approximately 1,160 dwelling units. Mixed?use and medium density infill, such as apartments and townhomes allow for more housing types than is currently available. Additionally, this variety of housing offers a wider selection of homes at multiple price points, ranging from low?income, affordable units to market rate units. These housing options can reduce the rate of cost?burdened households in Weed and provide desirable market rate options for other income groups. 
The remaining housing need is met through low?density residential development in Angel Valley, Creekside Village, Bel Air, School House Hill, and South Weed, which can accommodate an estimated 770 homes, making up most of the residential acreage in the City. While some of this housing is to be realized through infill development, a majority is the result of residential expansion in these neighborhoods. The Preferred Growth Scenario identifies nearly 600 acres of land suitable for low-density housing, ensuring that single-family homes remain the primary housing type in Weed.

5.3.4 Open Space
The Preferred Growth Scenario includes an expansion of parks for recreation and preservation of open space for natural resource management. Park space is strategically located in each key growth areas to ensure that residents have adequate access to outdoor recreation opportunities. The National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) sets the standard for land dedicated to parks based on population. The land dedicated to parks and open space in the Preferred Growth Scenario is sufficient to achieve the NRPA standard based on projected population growth.
Parks are important community resources by providing a range of activities for different age groups and users, promoting physical activity, sustaining environmental health, and enhancing the overall quality of life. Having adequate access to parks is also an important indicator of a healthy community. The local Parks and Recreation District recently purchased three large vacant parcels east of Charlie Byrd Park to expand park space; it will include a community center, picnic areas, and a trail system. This space can serve as an important recreational resource to residents throughout the City. Neighborhood parks or “pocket” parks are proposed near Historic Downtown, School House Hill, and in South Weed west of I-5 to ensure sufficient access to parks in every neighborhood. Table 5.3.2 shows a comparison of the existing park space in Weed and the total acreage proposed in the Preferred Growth Scenario.
A considerable amount of passive open space is proposed in South Weed to buffer residential development from noise generating industrial land uses as well as I-5. Passive open space is also proposed south of Schoolhouse Hill where there are excessive slopes preventing other types of development. Additional passive open space is proposed north of residential developments in Angel Valley to maintain the Boles Creek floodplain as a resource for flood management. These passive open spaces are important for the preservation of natural habitats and biological resources located within the City.

5.3.5 Conservation
The Preferred Growth Scenario has the potential to affect environmental factors in and surrounding the City of Weed. The Preferred Growth Scenario may impact water resources, biological resources, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, culturally significant resources, and soil and mineral resources within the City. It is well understood that growth and development directly impact the environment. The Preferred Plan considers important ecological features and resources to ensure that development has minimal negative impacts on environmental resources. 
Water Resources
The City of Weed has two creeks that run through the City: Beaughan Creek and Boles Creek. This Preferred Growth Scenario proposes development of land in proximity to these creeks. New residential, commercial, and industrial development will increase the amount of property that is impervious to water infiltration. However, low-impact development strategies can address the increases in stormwater runoff that could negatively affect water quality. The City of Weed is known for having great surface water and groundwater quality, which is a priority that the Preferred Growth Scenario aims to maintain through goals, objectives, policies, and programs.
Water supply may be a limiting factor for growth in the City of Weed. The City has adequate water supplies, but must continue to explore opportunities for future water supply (as recommended, for instance, in the 2003 Master Water Plan Update that additional 7 wells be drilled to provide for future growth). The City can benefit from citywide water conservation techniques in both indoor and outdoor environments that are incorporated into the Preferred Plan. Water savings from additional conservation efforts are needed to meet the per capita water consumption goals established in Senate Bill X7-7, which can also help offset the demand associated with projected growth. The Conservation Element aims to conserve water by promoting efficient appliances, prioritizing infrastructure replacement, and offering incentives to residents and businesses that reduce water usage. Water capacity in Weed is discussed further in the Public Facilities Element.

Biological Resources
The Preferred Growth Scenario does not propose development in existing wildlife or natural habitat areas, and leaves many open space areas unchanged. Expanded development will minimally impact natural habitats and wildlife within city limits. Additionally, the proposed areas for infill and expanded development do not affect any listed critical habitats now. The Preferred Growth Scenario requires that all new development comply with federal, state, and local policies by undergoing environmental review to determine impacts on plant and wildlife habitats, and for the mitigation of biological resource type losses. 

Soil and Mineral Resources
The City of Weed does not have any prime farmlands and agricultural activities are not a major factor within the City. The Preferred Growth Scenario concentrates on infill development, which will mitigate any potentially significant impacts on the soil.

Energy Resources
Future energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are an important factor to consider in the Preferred Growth Scenario. New developments have the potential to increase the energy demand, which can further increase GHG emissions. However, the Preferred Plan has potential to increase energy efficiency in new and existing buildings through updated building code requirements and retrofit programs. These strategies can also lead to the co-benefit of significant cost savings due to reduced energy consumption. 
The Preferred Growth Scenario focuses on increasing green energy production in the City to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and take advantage of associated cost savings from local power generation. The Plan also aims to implement policies that streamline the permitting system and incentivize residents and visitors to incorporate renewable energy technology into buildings. Increased infrastructure for alternative energy vehicles, such as electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles can promote low-emission vehicle usage in the City. 

5.3.6 Air Quality
The City of Weed is in Siskiyou County, and is therefore under the jurisdiction of the Siskiyou County Air Pollution Control District. Siskiyou County enjoys some of the best air quality in the State and is classified as in attainment for most criteria air pollutants. New development in the Preferred Growth Scenario has potential to increase air pollution associated with new construction and traffic-related activities. Proposed development may also require the removal of trees, which can reduce essential ecosystem functions like carbon sequestration. However, the Preferred Growth Scenario includes many implementation measures that can offset, or even improve air quality in the City. Additionally, improvements to alternative transportation infrastructure can encourage community members to use public and active transportation that can lessen transportation-related air pollution. 

5.3.7 Noise
The projected increase in population and employment in the Preferred Growth Scenario suggests elevated noise levels due to increased vehicular traffic and industrial activity. However, the Plan addresses potentially conflicting land uses by ensuring adequate physical separation and requiring noise mitigation for new development. By maintaining low-density housing as the predominant housing type in Weed, residential neighborhoods might not experience a significant increase in noise. However, central areas of the City where higher development density is proposed could experience a slight increase in ambient noise and temporary noise levels during peak hours. Special needs housing such as senior housing proposed in Creekside Village is located away from noise generating sources to ensure a peaceful and relaxing environment. While sensitive land uses such as homes, schools, and places of worship are separated from noise sources, increased vehicular activity has the potential to increase ambient noise levels along Weed’s main corridors. Due to the City’s compact nature, certain land uses may be exposed to an increase in traffic-related ambient noise. 

5.3.8 Safety
New commercial and housing growth in the City is proposed for areas with comparatively low risk of fires. Increasing development in the central city, where fire hazard is low, would reduce exposure of residents and businesses to wildfires. They also can benefit from reduced emergency response times. Natural hazards do not change based on development, but the placement of development in lower risk zones makes for a more resilient community. The Preferred Growth Scenario development does not change the dynamic of hazards associated with seismic, geologic, and transportation of hazardous materials within the City. These hazards should continue to be mitigated; however, no additional challenges are likely to arise from the Preferred Growth Scenario. Fire, flooding, and emergency response time will more than likely be reduced by future development and are discussed in further detail in the following subsections.

Fire
The majority of Weed’s geographic boundaries fall within high and moderate fire severity zones. Infill development and residential expansion is prioritized in core areas of the City where fire hazard is the lowest. However, the Preferred Growth Scenario proposes new development in South Weed, which is in a high fire severity zone. Defensible space surrounding new development can mitigate the potential fire related hazards in South Weed. New public facilities, including a fire station, are proposed in Bel Air near College of the Siskiyous, which can reduce response times throughout the City. The most effective method of mitigating the wildland fire impact on Weed is to limit growth outside the City boundaries, which the Preferred Growth Scenario promotes.


Flooding
The Preferred Growth Scenario locates new development away from the 100-year flood zones along Beaughan Creek and Boles Creek. Beaughan Creek has potential flood areas directly north of the North and South Weed Boulevard Corridor. Although flood risk is low, the Preferred Plan contains mitigation measures that aim to reduce potential flood damage in this area. Residential development in Angel Valley is proposed south of the Boles Creek flood zone to minimize risk. 

Emergency Response
The increase in population will have no effect on the City’s evacuation routes; however, response times could increase due to higher traffic volumes on local roads. Locally, US 97 offers access to the northern neighborhoods, while the I-5 offers the fastest access to downtown and South Weed. The expanded grid network in new development areas can ensure adequate access to emergency response vehicles as well as multiple evacuation routes. In addition to the increase in overall population, Weed is expected to have a larger share of senior citizens who may need additional attention and assistance in an evacuation scenario.

Crime
Population growth and increased housing density might lead to more pedestrian traffic on Weed’s streets, which can deter crime and result in a safer environment. The Preferred Plan also advocates for enhancement of neighborhood watch groups and additional eyes on the streets programs to increase neighborhood safety and reduce crime.

5.3.9 Economic Development
Under the Preferred Growth Scenario, job targets include a multitude of job opportunities that can improve the jobs-to-resident ratio, and increase the City’s median income. The Preferred Growth Scenario targets the creation of nearly 800 new jobs. The job target is based on historical growth in Weed over the previous ten years; however, the Preferred Plan allocates commercial land to accommodate up to 2,480 jobs should the City experience growth beyond the target. Under the Preferred Growth Scenario, Weed would have the potential to accommodate up to 3,920 jobs by 2040.
A key strategy to attract new businesses and foster employment growth is to reinvigorate Weed’s downtown, thereby creating a vibrant, walkable, and aesthetically pleasing area that compliments Weed’s small, mountain-town character. Mixed-use structures along Main Street provide a good foundation to achieving a thriving downtown, and revitalization can attract key businesses that could lead to proliferated growth along the corridor. Mixed-use development along College Avenue has potential to create retail jobs, and the mixed-use development proposed along North Weed Boulevard could contain office space that can accommodate higher-paying jobs.
Small neighborhood centers in Angel Valley and Bel Air can also create retail opportunities for employment while bringing residents within proximity to goods and services. These neighborhood centers can stimulate economic growth citywide by making each key growth area a convenient and attractive place to live. While mixed-use and neighborhood commercial in the northern half of Weed are aimed at fostering resident and tourist-serving local businesses, development in South Weed would focus on expanding highway-serving commercial activity that is a major revenue source for the City. An expanded South Weed and revitalized downtown can capture increased revenue from tourists and residents alike with highway users potentially spending more time in Weed. The amount of development in the Preferred Plan can also create many interim construction jobs during implementation of the Preferred Growth Scenario.
Partnership with the College of the Siskiyous for the provision of vocational training can create a more skilled workforce and possibly attract new, high-quality industries to Weed. The Preferred Growth Scenario aims to cultivate an economy that would attract College of the Siskiyous students to seek local employment through expanded access to jobs in health services, sustainability, and entrepreneurial opportunities. These actions also aim to improve the jobs-to-resident ratio by having a greater share of the workforce living and working in Weed rather than commuting into or out of Weed for work.

5.3.10 Public Facilities
The Preferred Growth Scenario aims to provide adequate facilities and services to the residents of Weed. Population growth has the potential to impact water use, waste management, and sewer capacity as well as public education, library resources, and police and fire services. The following subsections describe how the Preferred Growth Scenario can affect the provision of public facilities in Weed.


Water
Proposed growth in key areas of the Preferred Growth Scenario may affect the future demand on Weed’s water supplies from Beaughan Springs, Mazzei Well, and Gazelle Well. Weed is already using close to the full capacity of its water supply with approximately 2.46 million gallons of water available per day. In February 2016, the City and Roseburg Forest Products Co. entered a ten-year agreement for the continued use of Beaughan Springs (and up to 15-years at the City’s option), to provide up to 969,840 gallons per day for city-specific uses. The estimated water usage per capita in 2013 was 542 gallons per day (including domestic and other uses); assuming the same ratio by 2040, Weed would need at minimum 1.95 million gallons per day. The population growth projected in the Preferred Growth Scenario could require additional water capacity (if wells do not yield at peak capacities) as well as expansion of water infrastructure to serve new development. The City of Weed does not have an Urban Water Management Plan, which would help address current and future water supply. The Preferred Plan contains an implementation measure that prioritizes the adoption of an Urban Water Management Plan to ensure that water resources are conserved, distributed, and managed in a manner consistent with existing needs and future growth.

Wastewater
The increase in population and development under the Preferred Growth Scenario would require an expansion of Weed’s two wastewater treatment facilities. The Preferred Growth Scenario anticipates growth and development in both north and South Weed, which would require an expansion of the Weed Wastewater System that serves the northern half of the City and the Shastina Wastewater System that serves the southern half.

Stormwater
There is not a history of significant flood events in Weed, although increased development proposed in the Preferred Growth Scenario needs to address infrastructure requirements to adequately capture and divert stormwater to reduce the risk of urban flooding. Proposed roadway expansion and particularly service commercial expansion in South Weed will likely necessitate an increase in parking and impervious surfaces that may impact the current flow of stormwater. The City’s stormwater infrastructure may need to be evaluated as more severe weather events continue to impact the region. Additionally, the City’s current drainage and conveyance systems will need to be expanded to serve the increased population and proposed new development.

Solid Waste Management
The City of Weed sends its waste to Black Butte Transfer Recycle Station in Mount Shasta. C & D Waste Removal is in the City and collects solid waste. Increased population and development proposed under the Preferred Growth Scenario would require that solid waste management services be expanded to serve new development in the City’s core as well as expanded areas along the City’s periphery. However, the capacity of Black Butte Transfer Recycle Station is not expected to be exceeded under the Preferred Growth Scenario.

Police 
The City of Weed meets the standard of one officer per 1,000 residents. The Weed Police Department has six sworn officers, which is sufficient to maintain the standard officer-to-resident ratio under the Preferred Growth Scenario. Additionally, new public facilities including expanded police facilities in Bel Air can reduce response times throughout the City. 
Fire 
Fire is the greatest potential hazard in Weed; therefore, the Preferred Growth Scenario recommends that adequate fire services and response times are provided to serve the anticipated population growth and development. Fire protection in Weed is provided by the Weed Volunteer Fire Department (WVFD) located at the southern end of Roseburg Parkway. The WVFD is staffed with less than ten personnel, many of who are volunteer fire fighters. The average response time is 4.8 minutes, which is better than the 9-minute standard set forth by the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA). The WVFD has a response area of approximately 20 miles. Under the Preferred Growth Scenario, development is to be concentrated within this 20-mile radius, and is thus able to be served by the WVFD.
The Preferred Plan features expanded public facilities in Bel Air, which includes the addition of new fire response services. This facility can allow for expanded personnel and equipment to better serve the City. The Preferred Growth Scenario proposes expansion to Weed’s existing roadway network, which would increase the coverage area of where people live. However, these roads are proposed in a grid network that fosters ease of access and multiple entry points for emergency vehicles.



Public Education
There are two public schools located in Weed: Weed Union Elementary School and Weed High School. These facilities have adequately served the existing population and have additional capacity to accommodate growth. However, the Preferred Growth Scenario does not anticipate significant growth of the school age population by 2040. Therefore, the existing school facilities are sufficient to meet the public education needs under the Preferred Plan.

Library
The expected growth in the Preferred Plan will most likely not require changes to the function or size of the Weed Library; however, population growth may result in additional public library use. The Weed Library may require a larger inventory of books and computers to meet demand, which may necessitate expansion of library facilities. 

5.3.11 Health
The Preferred Growth Scenario could have many effects and implications on the health of the community. The proposed changes in land uses, housing densities, circulation, and open space can provide residents with improved access to amenities, services, and recreation, which can have a positive impact on quality of life and well-being. 

Land Use and Design 
Land use patterns can strongly influence resident’s lifestyles and overall quality of life. The Preferred Growth Scenario proposes increases in the amounts of mixed-use and medium to high-density development in the City, thereby increasing proximity to services and creating a more walkable and bikeable environment. A byproduct of increased physical activity is improved mental and physical health of residents. The envisioned neighborhood centers and historic downtown can feature streetscaping, pedestrian amenities, and public spaces intended to enhance the City’s visual quality and sense of place, leading to improved quality of life.
Additionally, small-scale mixed-use development along College Avenue can ensure that students are within proximity to retail, services, and entertainment opportunities that fit their unique needs. The compact development in these areas can reduce the need to drive, thereby reducing automobile emissions that can impact public health. The proposed housing developments under the Preferred Growth Scenario also create open space opportunities for pocket parks and community gardens, which could increase access to fresh food and outdoor recreation spaces. This scenario also encourages more commercial and light industrial uses that can provide jobs, which could help match the available labor force and ensure a better jobs-housing balance. Moreover, bringing jobs closer to residents can reduce emissions from work travel, and provide a steady income for residents to be able to afford better housing, health care, and fresh food.

Parks and Open Space
The Preferred Growth Scenario proposes a significant expansion of park space within city limits to almost 25 percent of total land in Weed. Parkland expansion is proposed in Angel Valley adjacent to Charlie Byrd Park and in South Weed to preserve natural resources and ensure that potential future residents and visitors have adequate access to recreation. This additional park space features trails and amenities that cater to outdoor recreation as well as mental and physical health. Neighborhood parks and pocket parks are proposed in School House Hill and Historic Downtown to ensure that all residents in the City have immediate access to open space. Open space in Weed is not only intended to encourage physical activity amongst all age groups, but to ensure the health and resilience of the natural environment.

Circulation
The Preferred Growth Scenario proposes a multitude of improvements and additions to the pedestrian and bicycle network in Weed. These improvements are intended to promote and enhance active transportation while increasing opportunities for physical recreation. Due to land use and circulation changes, residents are likely to be within proximity to services, which can also increase the feasibility of active transportation. Traffic calming projects located along key corridors can also address public health and safety by reducing exposure of bicyclists and pedestrians to vehicular traffic. The Preferred Growth Scenario aims to implement a Circulation Plan that can have significant positive health impacts and cater to a more active lifestyle for all residents in the City.

Public Spaces
The Preferred Growth Scenario proposes infill commercial and mixed-use development, which is intended to enhance the City’s sense of place and create spaces that welcome community gatherings such as farmers’ markets, festivals, or art walks. Increased community building and social capital can result from these improvements and contribute positively to the overall health of the community.

5.3.12 Community Design
Community design addresses the preservation and enhancement of buildings, structures, places, and landscapes within the City that contribute to its historic and cultural character. These efforts recognize historical and cultural resources as an essential part of the City’s heritage, promoting community vitality and pride. The Preferred Growth Scenario takes a bold approach toward community design that aims to preserve and enhance Weed’s historic small-town character. Emphasis is placed on creating vibrant, walkable, and aesthetically pleasing streetscapes, ensuring a quaint atmosphere through building design, strengthening the sense of community through outdoor spaces, and attracting visitors to explore this historic location.

Sense of Community 
The Preferred Scenario proposes conservation of the small-town character of the City. Community design reflects and utilizes Weed’s location to attract visitors as well as provide other important social benefits for the community, including improved quality of life and pride in the City. Maintaining and respecting Weed’s cultural and architectural heritage is a priority of the Preferred Plan. Additionally, the community center in Angel Valley and increased public outdoors spaces proposed in the Plan can help strengthen and promote community building.

Building Design and Quality 
Building design and quality should strategically reflect the types of land use and density that adhere to the small-town character valued in the community. The Preferred Growth Scenario retains single-family homes as the primary housing type in Weed and fosters the continuation of small-scale neighborhoods. The Plan also promotes rehabilitation of existing homes in poor condition, which is intended to improve neighborhood’s visual appeal and resident’s sense of pride. Updated design guidelines are a key feature encouraged in Community Design Element, which will ensure that new buildings are compatible with Weed’s character. Code enforcement could also improve the aesthetics of Weed’s neighborhoods while promoting the safety and well-being of residents. Lastly, strategically placed medium to high-density and mixed-use development along Main Street, Boles Street, College Avenue, and Vista Drive are limited to a building height of three stories to preserve the City’s small-town character and preserve viewsheds of Mount Shasta. 

Streetscapes and Public Spaces
The preferred scenario proposes increasing capacity for different modes of transportation, addition of open space and parks for improved quality of life and tourist attraction. Human scale streetscape design should be focused along North and South Weed Boulevard, Main Street, College Avenue, and Black Butte to better accommodate pedestrians and bicyclists. Amenities such as traffic calming techniques, wayfinding signage, sidewalks, benches, trees, lights, bicycle facilities and gateways are functional design techniques that could make the atmosphere more attractive and safe for both residents and tourists. Streetscape design could transform Main Street into a vibrant downtown and establish a gateway at the North and South Weed Boulevard Corridor to promote the development of a visual identity and brand for the City of Weed.

6 LAND USE
6.1 Introduction
The Land Use Element serves as a guide for planners, the general public, developers, and decision makers for future development and growth. The main objective of the Land Use Element is to address land use issues through development policies. The purpose of the element is to designate the location, distribution, and intensity of land uses. Land use intersects with all other elements of the General Plan and is the foundation for housing, circulation, open space, and public facilities land uses. The goals, objectives, policies, and programs in this Element will influence future development decisions. 
The 2015 Land Use Inventory surveyed land uses in Weed and found that 37 percent of the City’s land was vacant, which implied that there was potential for development. Open space and residential uses were the second largest group of land uses in Weed with 14 percent each of Weed’s total land. Public facilities made up 11 percent of Weed’s land, with commercial and industrial land uses comprising 3 percent each. 
Based on the population, housing, and employment targets, there was sufficient land in Weed to accommodate growth by 2040. Community input indicated that maintaining the small-town character, ensuring diverse economic opportunities, and achieving neighborhood connectivity were essential to the City’s future. The Land Use Element incorporates this feedback in the development of the following goals and objectives.

7 CIRCULATION 
7.1 Introduction
Circulation is a mandatory element of the general plan under the California State Government Code §65302(b). Circulation refers to transportation systems that facilitate the safe and efficient movement of people and goods throughout a city and its surrounding areas. The California Office of Planning and Research (OPR) requires that the circulation element maintain consistency with the land use element, as well as state and regional transportation plans. According to State law, the element must address major roads, transportation routes, terminals and other public facilities, services, and utilities. In addition, the State requires that the element plan for a balanced multimodal transportation network that accommodates all users and modes on the City’s streets and highways. The California Complete Streets Act of 2008 (AB 1358) defines all users as “motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists, children, persons with disabilities, seniors, movers of commercial goods, and users of public transportation.” A multimodal network has a critical impact on efficient traffic flow, social interaction, public health, safety, economic activity, and development patterns within the City. Circulation can also greatly impact air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. The Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008 (SB 375) requires municipalities to address greenhouse gas emissions in the coordination between the land use and circulation element. The following chapter presents the goals, objectives, policies, and programs developed to ensure an adequate multimodal circulation network through 2040 that meets the needs of residents and enhances safety, access, and mobility for all road users.

8 HOUSING
8.1 Introduction
The Housing Element is one of the seven required elements of the General Plan, and is mandated through Article 10.6 of the State of California Government Code Section 65580 (California Department of Housing and Community Development [HCD], 1969a). This element addresses the long-term, comprehensive housing needs for residents of all income levels within the City by providing a variety of housing types. The Housing Element update occurs every five years and includes the identification and analysis of current and projected housing needs. This chapter includes goals, objectives, policies, and programs that aim to preserve, improve, and increase the supply of housing in the City of Weed. The Housing Element must remain consistent and compatible with other General Plan elements and State Law.
According to the 2015 Land Use Inventory and 2010 U.S. Census data, the City of Weed has approximately 1,200 housing units, nearly 60 percent of which are single?family detached homes. The Housing Element aims to maintain single-family homes as the primary housing type in Weed while accommodating population growth through a range of housing densities in core areas of the City. Housing growth is based on employment targets for Weed by 2040, which surpasses the mandated number of additional housing units required by the Regional Housing Needs Assessment.

9 OPEN SPACE
9.1 Introduction
The Open Space Element covers active open space for recreation and passive open space for recreation and natural resources management. The purpose of the Open Space element is to guide the comprehensive and long-range preservation and conservation of open space. As defined by the Office of Planning and Research, open space refers to “any parcel or area of land or water that is essentially unimproved and devoted to open space use”.
Active open space for recreation and parks in Weed is operated and managed by the Weed Parks and Recreation District (WPRD). The WPRD owns and operates three parks within city limits and one in the City’s Sphere of Influence, which amount to a total of 34.5 acres. Weed’s four parks are Bel Air Park near College of the Siskiyou, Sons Park and Lobis Field in School House Hill, Charlie Byrd Park in Angel Valley, and Carrick Park to the City’s north. These parks include various amenities such as, playgrounds, bocce ball courts, horseshoe pits, gazebos, picnic areas, baseball courts, basketball courts, and multipurpose fields, which promote physical activity.
Passive open space for the management of natural resources include forests, scenic places, and wilderness areas. Scenic places in the City are identified as city parks, the City’s historic downtown, and viewsheds of Mount Shasta. Forests surround the City of Weed, some of which are owned by commercial logging industries. Passive open space also includes, but is not limited to, open space for drainage, flooding, water retention, wetlands, and wildlife habitat.
The Open Space element contains goals, objectives, policies, and programs that ensure that Weed has sufficient park space to meet the standards set forth by the National Recreation and Parks Association. This Element also aims to represent the desires of the community by focusing on access to parks and increased recreational opportunities for residents of all ages.

12 NOISE
12.1 Introduction
Noise is defined as unwanted sound. The Noise Element is a required element of the General Plan. The State requires local governments to identify and quantify community noise levels expressed in a weighted scale such as Community Noise Equivalent Levels (CNEL) or day-night average level (Ldn). The measured noise levels must be used in the General Plan as a guide to future land use decisions, implementation measures for noise control, and policies to aid maintaining the community’s exposure to noise. The Noise Element must be consistent with the other elements of the General Plan and should serve as a guide to inform and prevent public exposure to excessive noise.

In 2015, the main sources of noise in Weed were from traffic on I-5 and US Route 97, as well as industrial land uses. During the community meeting held on November 7, 2015, nearly half of the participants targeted these two types of noise as the most bothersome in Weed. The participants also acknowledged that Weed is an overall quiet city and wish to maintain the City’s peaceful character. The following goals, objectives, policies, and programs reflect the community’s preferences and aim to support the separation of conflicting land uses to ensure a city free of excessive noise.

12.2 Goals, Objectives, Policies, & Programs

16 HEALTH
16.1 Introduction
The Health Element is an optional component of the General Plan allowed under Section 65303 of State Government Code. This element covers the public health and well­being of the City by incorporating aspects of other elements that have significant effects on public health, including but not limited to: circulation, open space and recreation, air quality, and water quality. 
Public health professionals and urban planners have found comprehensive planning as an avenue for promoting physical activity and increasing access to healthy foods. The Health Element raises awareness of the link between the built environment and public health. Land Use decisions help shape the pattern of community development and can promote active modes of transportation. Land uses are an important indicator of adequate access to healthy food, outdoor recreation opportunities, and civic services. The Health Element aims to promote access to healthy food, medical services, open space, and clean air and water to ensure that Weed residents can practice a healthy lifestyle. Existing best practices, standards, fieldwork, assessments, research, and community input were considered in creating the Health Element for the City of Weed.
