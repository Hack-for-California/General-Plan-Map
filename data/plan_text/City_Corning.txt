City of Corning Housing Element                  iv       October 15, 2009
I.       AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE
This Housing Element is an update of the City of Corning’s previous Housing Element, which
was adopted by the City Council on May 24, 2005 and certified by the State of California
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) in July 2005. The City has made a
concerted effort to follow through on the policies and programs in the adopted Housing Element,
and to further expand and more efficiently respond to its housing needs in coordination with
other City goals.
         A.       Legislative Authority
                  A Housing Element provides an analysis of the community’s housing needs for
                  all income levels, and strategies to respond to those needs. It is a key part of the
                  City’s overall General Plan. Planning and providing housing for all Californians is
                  considered by the state legislature to be of vital statewide importance. The state
                  has enacted legislation that sets forth rules regarding housing elements
                  (contained in California Government Code Sections 65580-65589).                    The
                  statewide goal is given as “decent housing and a suitable living environment for
                  every California family.” The substantive requirements for a housing element are
                  set forth in Article 10.6 and §65583 of the California Government Code.
                           "The housing element shall consist of an identification and analysis of
                           existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies,
                           quantified objectives, and scheduled programs for the preservation,
                           improvement, and development of housing. The housing element shall
                           identify adequate sites for housing, including rental housing, factory-built
                           housing, and mobile-homes, and shall make adequate provision for the
                           existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the
                           community."
                  All cities and counties have responsibilities to contribute to the attainment of that
                  state goal. Each jurisdiction’s housing element is required to demonstrate how
                  the goal will be furthered locally. Housing elements are required to contain
                  analyses of local housing needs and resources (including funds and sites), and
                  elements must make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of
                  all economic segments of the community.
                  State Law establishes detailed requirements and a regional “fair share” approach
                  to distributing housing needs. State Housing Element law recognizes that in
                  order for the private sector to address housing needs and demand, local
                  governments must adopt land-use plans and implementing regulations that
                  provide opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing development.
                  State law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan containing at
                  least seven elements including a housing element. Rules regarding Housing
                  Elements are found in the California Government Code Sections 65580-65589.
                  Unlike the other mandatory general plan elements, the housing element is
                  required to be updated every five years and is subject to detailed statutory
                  requirements and mandatory review by a State agency — HCD (Department of
                  Housing and Community Development).
City of Corning Housing Element                     I-1                                  October 15, 2009

                  According to State law, the Housing Element must:
                       •   Provide goals, policies, quantified objectives and scheduled programs to
                           preserve, improve and develop housing
                       •   Identify and analyze existing and projected housing needs for all
                           economic segments of the community.
                       •   Identify “adequate sites” that are zoned and available within the 7.5 year
                           housing cycle to meet the city’s fair share of regional housing needs at all
                           income levels
                       •   Be “certified” by the State Department of Housing and Community
                           Development (HCD) as complying with state law.
                       •   Be internally consistent with other parts of the General Plan (and is critical
                           to having a legally adequate General Plan)
         B.       Recent Changes in State Housing Element Law (Since the Current Housing
                  Element was Adopted in 2005)
                  Extremely Low-Income Households Housing Needs: Government Code (GC)
                  Section 65583(a) requires “ Documentation of projections and a quantification of
                  the locality's existing and projected housing needs for all income levels, including
                  extremely low-income households (GC 65583 (a)(1)).” Extremely Low income is
                  a subset of the Very Low income housing need and is defined as 30 percent of
                  area median and below. Local agencies may calculate the projected housing
                  need for Extremely Low Income households by presuming that 50 percent of
                  Very Low income households qualify as Extremely Low income households.
                  Planning for Emergency Shelters – SB2: Government Code Section 65582,
                  65583, and 65589.5, Chapter 614, Statutes of 2007 (SB 2) increases planning
                  requirements for emergency shelters to require, at a minimum and regardless of
                  the need, that all jurisdictions have a zone in place to permit at least one year-
                  round emergency shelter without a conditional use permit or any discretionary
                  permit requirements. In addition, SB 2 amended the Housing Accountability Act
                  (formerly known as anti-NIMBY law) to include emergency shelters, transitional
                  housing, and supportive housing. Emergency Shelters, Transitional Housing, and
                  Supportive Housing are defined in the Health and Safety Code.
                  AB 1233 (Government Code Section 65584.09) Requirement for Carryover
                  of Unmet RHNA Units: A jurisdiction's RHNA from the previous housing element
                  cycle is not required to be carried-over to the 2007-2014 planning period if the
                  current element was found in compliance by HCD and the inventory of sites
                  identified adequate sites, or the program actions to rezone or provide adequate
                  sites was fully implemented. A carryover of RHNA units does apply, however, if
                  a jurisdiction (1) failed to adopt an updated housing element for the prior planning
                  period, or (2) adopted a housing element found out of compliance by HCD due to
                  failure to substantially comply with the adequate sites requirement, or (3) failed to
                  implement the adequate sites programs to make sites available within the
                  planning period, or (4) failed to identify or make available adequate sites to
                  accommodate a portion of the regional housing need.
                  Realistic Development Capacity: The element must include a description of the
                  methodology used to estimate the realistic capacity for potential housing sites.
City of Corning Housing Element                       I-2                               October 15, 2009

                  The element should not estimate unit capacity based on the theoretical maximum
                  buildout allowed by the zoning, but should be based on all applicable land-use
                  controls and site improvement requirements.
                  Constraints-Housing for Persons with Disabilities (SB520): Housing element
                  law requires that in addition to the needs analysis for persons with disabilities,
                  the housing element must analyze potential governmental constraints to the
                  development, improvement and maintenance of housing for persons with
                  disabilities, demonstrate local efforts to remove any such constraints and provide
                  for reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities through programs
                  that remove constraints.
                  Fair Housing Laws: Since State and federal laws uniformly outlaw most kinds of
                  housing discrimination, the local government’s role is to identify program
                  strategies that support and implement these laws. Fair Housing laws make it
                  illegal to discriminate against any person because of race, color, religion, sex,
                  disability, familial status, national origin, ancestry, marital status, sexual
                  orientation, source of income and age in the rental or sale, financing, advertising,
                  appraisal, provision of real estate brokerage services, etc., and land-use
                  practices.
                  Priority for Water and Sewer: Chapter 727, Statutes of 2005 (SB 1087)
                  requires local governments to provide a copy of the adopted housing element to
                  water and sewer providers. In addition, water and sewer providers must grant
                  priority for service allocations to proposed developments that include housing
                  units affordable to lower income households.
                  Annual Reporting: Government Code Section 65400 requires each governing
                  body (City Council or Board of Supervisors) to prepare an annual report on the
                  status and progress in implementing the jurisdiction’s housing element of the
                  general plan using forms and definitions adopted by the Department of Housing
                  and Community Development (Department). HCD has developed regulations
                  governing the state housing element annual progress report.
                  Flooding Issues: In October, 2007, the Governor signed AB 162 which requires
                  cities and counties to address flood-related matters in the land use, conservation,
                  safety, and housing elements of their general plans.
         C.       Common Housing Terms
                  Accessible Housing: Units accessible and adaptable to the needs of the
                  physically disabled.
                  Disabled Person: As defined under the Federal Housing Amendments Act of
                  1988 and California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act, a disabled person, is a
                  person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life
                  activities, anyone who is regarded as having that type of impairment or, anyone
                  who has a record of that type of impairment.
                  Family: One or more persons living together in a dwelling unit, with common
                  access to, and common use of all living, kitchen, and eating areas within the
                  dwelling unit.
City of Corning Housing Element                              I-3                       October 15, 2009

                  Housing Affordability: The generally accepted measure for determining
                  whether a person can afford housing means spending no more than 25 percent
                  to 33 percent of one's gross household income on housing costs, including
                  utilities, principle, and interest. For example, a teacher earning $49,100 per year
                  can afford $1,350 per month for housing. A police officer earning $85,000 can
                  afford up to $2,337. For purposes of this Housing Element update, a 30 percent
                  measure will be used.
                  Income Limits: Income limits are updated annually by the U.S. Department of
                  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for Tehama County. For many State
                  and local programs, State Department of Housing and Community Development
                  (HCD) income eligibility limits are used. HCD income limits regulations are similar
                  to those used by HUD. Income limits as defined by California Housing Element
                  law are:
                            Extremely Low-Income Households: Households earning less than 30
                            percent of the median household income – family of four earning less
                            than $9,362 per year.
                            Local agencies may calculate the projected housing need for Extremely
                            Low Income households by presuming that 50 percent of Very Low
                            income households qualify as Extremely Low income households.
                            Very Low Income Households: Households earning between 30 percent
                            and 50 percent of the median household income – family of four earning
                            between $9,362 and $15,603 per year.
                            Low Income Households: Households earning 51 to 80 percent of the
                            median household income – family of four earning between $15,604 and
                            $24,965 per year.
                            Moderate Income Households: Households earning 80 to 120 percent of
                            the median income – family of four earning between $24,966 and $37,447
                            per year.
                            Above Moderate Income Households: Households earning over 120
                            percent of the median household income – family of four earning above
                            $37,448 per year.
                  Median Household Income: The middle point at which half of the City's
                  households earn more and half earn less. In 2008, the median income for a
                  family of 4 is $31,206.
                  Mixed Use: This new land use classification allows for a greater variety of uses
                  and flexibility in site planning than is generally permitted in other classifications.
                  The intent of the Mixed Use classification is to allow the creation of a mix of land
                  uses in a compact pattern that will reduce dependency on the automobile and
                  basin air quality impacts and promote high-quality, interactive neighborhoods.
                  Mixed-use neighborhoods are characterized by interconnected streets, vertical
                  and/or horizontal mix of commercial, residential, and possibly light industrial uses
                  and facilities that encourage pedestrian activity and transit accessibility.

                  Although not all properties identified within each Mixed Use area must be part of
                  an integrated development, proposed project boundaries must be logical, and it
                  must be demonstrated that the project can functionally relate to adjacent
                  properties consistent with the intent of this district. Mixed-use development is
                  encouraged to develop in areas outside the designated Mixed Use classification
                  as well, provided that the concentration of uses is located near a transit
                  opportunity and is designed to accommodate pedestrian activity and circulation.
                  Multi Family Housing: A housing type (or residential area) including attached
                  housing units available to multiple households.
                  Persons per Household: Average number of persons in each household.
                  Senior Housing: Defined by California Housing Element law as projects
                  developed for, and put to use as, housing for senior citizens. Senior citizens are
                  defined as persons at least 62 years of age.
                  Transitional Housing: Transitional housing programs assist people who are
                  ready to move beyond emergency shelter into a more independent living
                  situation. Some transitional program participants live in apartment-style quarters,
                  while others may be in group settings where several families or individuals share
                  a household.

         E.       Consistency With Other Elements Of The General Plan
                  By law (Government Code 65300.5), the goals and policies of the Housing
                  Element must be consistent with other elements of the General plan. The current
                  Elements of the City of Corning General Plan (Land Use, Housing, Recreation,
                  Open Space & Conservation, Circulation, Noise, Safety, Seismic, and Scenic
                  Route) are internally consistent regarding stated goals and policies. Internal
                  consistency between Elements will be monitored and maintained as part of the
                  review process at such time any of the various individual Elements are updated
                  or otherwise revised.
                  The Housing Element Update, as part of the City of Corning General Plan, has
                  been analyzed for consistency with all General Plan goals, policies, and

                  implementation measures and, as such, would not conflict with existing
                  applicable land use plans, policies, or regulations. General Plan amendment and
                  rezoning actions proposed will serve to improve the overall community.
         F.       Community Participation
                  Community and service agencies input was sought during the drafting of the
                  Housing Element. During the spring and summer of 2009, community housing
                  and supportive service providers were contacted soliciting input regarding local
                  housing needs. These organizations included:
                      •    Alternatives to Violence
                      •    Christian Church Homes
                      •    Community Housing Improvement Program (CHIP)

                      •    Tehama County Planning Department
                      •    Tehama County Veterans Service Office
                  Information received from these service providers form the basis of the special
                  needs group's statements of housing needs expressed in this document and
                  contributed to the formulation of the City's housing objectives for the upcoming
                  planning period.
                  The housing goals, policies, and quantified objectives expressed in the Element
                  are the product of information received at the initial Housing Element Workshop
                  and at the Planning Commission Public Hearing to consider Goals, Policies,
                  Objectives, and Implementation measures. Additional information was provided
                  by: local housing advocates; statistical analysis undertaken regarding
                  comparative need; and, a projection of what realistically can be expected to be
                  achieved over the five-year planning period, given the constraints of funding and
                  staffing.
                  The workshop and public hearing and the availability of the draft Goals, Policies,
                  Objectives and Implementation Measures, and the draft Housing Element were
                  published in the in the local newspaper. In addition, the draft was circulated in
                  the community and comments solicited regarding its content. A second draft was
                  formulated utilizing information received during the review period.
                  A public hearing by the City of Corning Planning Commission was held on
                  August 18, 2009 to obtain comments on the Draft Housing Element and
                  California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Initial Study and Mitigated Negative

                  Declaration (IS&MND).        After closing the public hearing the Planning
                  Commission recommended adoption of the IS&MND and the Housing Element
                  Update to the City Council.
                  A public hearing by the City Council is scheduled for October 27, 2009 to
                  consider the adoption of the CEQA IS&MND and the Housing Element Update of
                  the General Plan.
                  The aforementioned community and service agencies were notified regarding the

II.        HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
           A.       POPULATION
                    The City of Corning (City), California is a rural agricultural community of 7,396
                    people situated 25 miles northwest of Chico and 17 miles south of Red Bluff in
                    south central Tehama County (Figure II-1).1 The physical layout of the City was
                    established in 1878, when the town named Scatterville, later Riceville, was built.
                    In 1882, the town of Corning was established and merged with Riceville. Since
                    that time, the City and adjacent agricultural areas have seen a slow to moderate
                    increase in population growth. In the past, the population has been distributed
                    as a small nucleus in the incorporated urbanized areas, surrounded by a larger
                    non-urbanized halo in the unincorporated areas.2
                    The incorporated area of the City consists of 3.55 square miles, or 2,270 acres,
                    primarily located east of Interstate 5. Land uses present within this area cover a
                    broad spectrum of use, including residential, commercial, industrial, aviation,
                    agriculture, rural residential, public service/utility, floodplain, and vacant property.
                    The Tehama County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) established
                    Sphere of Influence (SOI) encompasses 7.22, square miles or 4,620 acres
                    contiguous to the City limits on nearly all sides of the City. LAFCO expanded the
                    City’s SOI in 2005 by an additional 4.6 square miles, or 2,950 acres. The SOI is
                    currently composed primarily of agricultural or rural residential uses (Figure II-2).
                    .
                    1. Population – Profile
                    The State of California Department of Finance identifies the population of the City
                    of Corning as of January 1, 2009 to be 7,396. Table II-1 identifies the population
                    growth per U.S. Census data between 1990 and 2000 that reflects an average
                    overall growth rate since 1990 of aproximately 1.08 percent per year.

                    2000 Census and in some instances the 2005 Housing Element Update.
                    However, for certain statistical information such as age characteristics,
                    overcrowding, and housing overpayment, 2000 Census information will need to
                    be utilized.
                    2. Population – Age Characteristics
                    Based on 2000 Census data, the population of the City is classified as very
                    young, with a median age of 30.9 years. The largest age bracket is persons of
                    0 to 19 years, which constitutes 35.7 percent of the total population. Following
                    closely behind is the 25 to 44 year age bracket, which represents 28 percent of
                    the total population. The next largest age bracket is persons 45 to 64, with
                    17.6 percent of the population, with persons 65 and older constituting 11.8
                    percent of the City’s population. The smallest age group is the 20 to 24 age
                    group, which accounts for less than 7 percent of the population.
                    3. Population – Race and Ethnic Characteristics
                    The City is a community with a predominately White population, as indicated by
                    statistics from the 2000 Census which identifies that 4,376 persons or 64.9
                    percent of the 6,741 residents are White. The City’s Hispanic population
                    constitutes approximately 28.8 percent of Corning’s population, or 1,943
                    residents. American Indians comprise 1.8 percent, or 122 residents. Other major
                    ethnic groups do not have large populations; Asian/Pacific Islander’s total 40 (0.6
                    percent), African Americans or Blacks total 30 (0.5 percent), Other totals 31 (0.5
                    percent) and persons of Two or More Races comprise 3.0 percent, or 199
                    residents.
          B.        EMPLOYMENT
                    1. Employment – Characteristics
                    Labor force for the City was determined utilizing statistics provided by the State of
                    California Employment Development Department. Table II-2 provides the total
                    estimated labor force, unemployed, and unemployment rate since 2000. The 1990
                    rate, derived from the 2005 Housing Element, is utilized for comparative purposes.
                    Table II-3 identifies the most common employment industries and occupations.3
                    The labor force in the City has seen an 18.2 percent increase between 1990 and
                    2000. Between 2000 and 2009 the increase was 13.3 percent. However, even
                    though the labor force has increased, so has the number of unemployed persons,
                    particularly in the last three years. Whereas, the unemployment between 1990 and
                    2000 was reduced by 0.7 percent, between 2000 and 2008, the rate would fluctuate
                    upward by as much as 1.3 percent. However, in 2008 the rate of unemployed
                    persons increased by 47.6 percent over 2000. Even worse, the unemployment rate
                    increased to 15.8 percent as of May 2009, an increase of 58.1 percent over 2008.
                    Since 2000, the number of unemployed has increased 133.3%. This is indicative of
                    the state and national economic crises currently being experienced.

                    The City’s current employment opportunities are greatest in the lower-paying
                    industries; service industries associated with retail and food services, and the
                    food processing and wood product industries In addition to paying lower overall
                    wages, service and/or food processing industries typically have a higher
                    percentage of persons working part-time or seasonally than do other types of
                    industries.
                    The availability of permanent, secure employment paying a decent wage is a
                    critical factor in the ability of an area's population to secure housing. Conversely,
                    an area's ability to attract new industry and increased job opportunities for its
                    residents is directly related to the ready availability of decent, affordable housing
                    in the community.

          C.        HOUSEHOLDS
                    1. Households – Income Characteristics
                    The household formation rate is the prime determinant for housing demand.
                    Households can increase or decrease in number even in periods of static
                    population growth, as adult children leave home, through divorce, and with the
                    aging of the general population. The ratio between population and households is
                    reflected by household size, referred to in the U.S. Census as persons per
                    household. The average size household in the City is 2.71 persons whereas, in
                    2000 it was 2.76 persons.
                    The Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) publishes
                    median household income data by household size for areas in the entire United
                    States. The income data is defined using an Area Median Income (AMI) for each
                    HUD area and classified by the California Department of Housing and
                    Community Development (HCD) into five income groups. As previously noted,
                    the standard terminology used for these various income levels is Extemely Low,
                    Very Low, Low, Moderate, and Above Moderate income. These terms are used
                    to describe relative income ranges tied to the median income of all households
                    within a given community. Thus, “Extemely Low income” means 30 percent less
                    of the meidan income, "very low-income" means below 50 percent of the median
                    income; "low-income" between 51 and 80 percent; and "moderate-income,"
                    between 81 and 120 percent. "Above moderate-income" is generally 121
                    percent and above. The term "lower income," includes both "low-income" and
                    "very-low income"; or all households that do not exceed 80 percent of median
                    household income.5
                    Income figures provided by the State of Calilfornia Employment Development
                    Department Labor Market Information identified a median household income for
                    the City of Corning of $25,357, whereas, Tehama County’s median income was
                    $31,206.6 However, for Housing Element preparation purposes, HCD utilizes the
                    County’s median income figure to determine income level thresholds. which is
                    applicable to the City.
                    Based on the County’s median income figure, the Extemely Low income
                    threshold is a family of four earning less than $9,362 per year, Very Low income
                    is $9,363 to $15,603, Low is $15,604 to $24,965, Moderate is $24,966 to
                    $37,447, and Above Moderate is $37,448 and above. In comparison, the
                    statewide median income was $47,493.
                    Table II-6 provides a comparison between the 2000 Census and 2007 data for
                    the various income category thresholds. The Very Low and Low income
                    categories decreased slightly by 0.3 and 0.5 percent, respectively. However, the
                    number of houselholds increased by 15 and 6 percent, respectively. The
                    percentage of Moderate income households remained the same although the
                    number of households increased by 7. The number of Above Moderate
                    increased the most by 0.8 percent reflecting an increase of 51 households.

  The average size household in the City is 2.71 persons. In 2000 it was 2.76 persons per household.

                    year being utilized of housing, 232 households pay more than $4,681 per year for
                    housing leaving these households $390 per month to pay food, clothing,
                    transportation, etc.
                    2. Households – Race and Ethnic Income Characteristics
                    Thoughout California, there exists a higher proportion of lower-income families
                    among these minority groups than in the population at large and the City of
                    Corning is no exception. In 2007, among the general population, 23.4 percent of
                    residents had incomes below the poverty level compared to 26.3 percent in 2000.
                    Minority families along with all lower income households of the community face
                    common problems and hardships in regard to meeting their housing needs. This
                    is evidenced by the higher unemployment rates identified in Table II-8.
                    Table II-8 identifies the 2007 estimated unemployment rates for the various
                    ethnic and racial groups by sex. Table II-9 identifies the median household
                    incomes for 2000 and 2007 for various ethnic and racial groups.9
                    3. Households – Tenure
                    According to the 2000 Census 48 percent of all households in the City of Corning are
                    renters, a total of 1,260 households. Owner-occupied housing units comprised 52
                    percent, or 1,162 households of the total. In 2007, the number of renters increased
                    by 391 households, a 31 percent increase over 2000, and comprised 1,503
                    households, or 52.9 percent of the total. Owner occupied units increased by 178
                    households, a 13.3 percent increase over 2000, for a total of 1,340 households.
                                                                     TABLE II-8

City of Corning Housing Element                               II-7                       October 15, 2009

                  4. Households – Overcrowding
                  According to the 2000 Census, 14.3 percent of all 2,422 occupied households in
                  the City are classified as “overcrowded.” Overcrowding is defined as households
                  with more than 1.01 persons per room. Of these households, 105 of the 1,260
                  (7.8%) homeowner households are overcrowded and 245 of the 1,162 (22.0%)
                  renter households are overcrowded.
                  Since 1990, the City has seen a significant increase in the amount of housing units
                  that are considered overcrowded (an increase of 186 units). The overall percentage
                  of overcrowded units has gone from 7.8 percent in 1990 to over 14.3 percent in
                  2000.
                  5. Households – Overpayment
                  A household is considered to be “overpaying” if its monthly housing cost or gross
                  rent exceeds 30 percent of its annual gross income. Table II-10, based on the
                  2000 Census, provides a breakdown between owner and rental households and
                  for all households in the City.

                  Table II-10 illustrates that 31.2 percent of all households spent more than 30
                  percent of their gross income for housing. 37.9 percent of all renters and 25.6
                  percent of all owner households in the City “overpay”. Overpayment is a
                  significant problem for renter households and, as Table II-10 shows, especially
                  for households earning less than 50 percent of the 2000 median household
                  income for Tehama County (i.e., less than $15,603).
                  In the City 63.5 percent of all households with incomes less than $10,000 a year
                  pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing. In the $10,000 to $20,000
                  range, over 42.1 percent of these households are paying 30 percent or more.
                  Around 31.2 percent (764) of all households earning the 2000 county median
                  income ($31,206) or less overpay for housing.
City of Corning Housing Element                     II-8                              October 15, 2009

                  However, based on Table II-7, 34.8 percent of all households (855) pay more
                  than 30 percent of their income for housing. Of these renters comprise 35.7
                  percent, or 877 households and homeowners constitute 34.0 percent or 835
                  households. Three-hundred and thirty-one households (331) or 79 percent of
                  Extremely Low income households pay more than 30 percent for housing. Of
                  these Extremely Low income housieholds, 223 rental households pay more than
                  30 percent for housing which identifies a significant need.
         D.       HOUSING
                  1. Housing – Historic and Current Profile
                  The 2000 Census recorded 2,618 housing units in the City The State
                  Department of Finance has estimated the total number of housing units, as of
                  January 1, 2009, to be 2,922, an increase of 308, or an 11.6 percent increase in
                  housing units over the past 9 years. The housing increase has kept pace with
                  the approximate 9.2 percent increase in population during the period of time.
                  New construction is primarily responsible for the overall increase in available
                  housing stock even though some housing units have been rehabilitated. Table II-
                  11 identifies the number of units constructed from 2000 through 2008 and the
                  percentage increase based on State Department of Finance data.
                                                       TABLE II-11

                  Table II-12 identifies the type and number of building permit statistics provided
                  by the City Building Department which differ from those identified by the State
                  Department of Finance. This is due to the Building Department reporting when
                  the permit was issued and the State basing their statistics on the year the
                  housing unit was completed.
                  A total of 318 building permits were issued since 2000 of which 233 were single
                  family (73.3 percent), 80 were multi-family (25.2 percent) and five were mobile
                  homes (1.5 percent). The 2005 Housing Element Update identified the
                  construction of 266 housing units between 1990 and 1999, of which 77 were
                  single family (28.9 percent), 53 were multi-family (20.0 percent) and 136 were
                  mobile homes (51.1 percent). Of significant importance is that the number of
                  multi-family residences, which provide better housing opportunities for Very Low
                  and Low income resdients, is being provided. As previously noted, housing
                  production has kept pace with population increases.

                     The City has 1,834 housing units which were built prior to 1980. These 30 plus
                     year old structures comprise 62.5 percent of the areas housing stock, followed by
                     40 plus year old housing structures (40.8 percent of available housing). Overall,
                     21.1 percent of Corning's available housing stock is less than 20 years old. As
                     evident in Table II-13, the housing stock in the City can be considered relatively
                     old, particularly with 348 housing units (approximatetly 11.9 percent) being 70
                     years and older.
                                                                    TABLE II-13

                     There exists a correlation between the age of a community's housing stock and
                     the relative condition of that housing stock. As part of this Housing Element
                     Update, a windshield survey of exterior housing conditions was undertaken in
                     April 2009.10 Experience has determined that there is a very good corrolation
                     between the exterior of a residence reflecting interior conditions. Based on the
                     survey, the City has approximately 94 percent of its housing stock in good and
                     decent condition. Of the remaining 176 housing units, 131 (4.6 percent) were
                     considered suitable for rehabilitation. The remaining 41 housing units, due
                     primarily to the extreme condition of disrepair, were determined unsuitable for
                     rehabilitation and need to be demollished. Typically, housing units over 20 years
                     of age are the most likely to need both moderate and major rehabilitation work to
                     elevate them to a "standard" condition. It is unlikely that units constructed in the
                     past 20 years would require more than minimum level on-going maintenance.

   The majority of the survey was undertakenon May 12 and 14 by Terry Hoofard – Building Official, John Stoufer – Planning
   Director, and Eihnard Diaz – Diaz Associates Principal Planner.
City of Corning Housing Element                                II-10                                         October 15, 2009

                  Of the 131 housing units suitable for rehabilation, 118 housing units are
                  considered substandard if they meet the following definition: Those buildings
                  which exhibit one or more critical structural, plumbing, and/or electrical deficiency
                  or a combination of intermediate defects in sufficient number or extent to require
                  considerable repair or rebuilding. Units are also considered substandard if they
                  do not provide safe and adequate shelter or endanger the health, safety, or well-
                  being of the occupants.
                  Substandard housing units are further classified into those that are suitable for
                  rehabilitation and those which are not suitable for rehabilitation. The following
                  definition of "suitable for rehabilitation" is used: Those buildings which exhibit one
                  or more of the deficiencies listed under the above definition of substandard, all of
                  which can be repaired in conformity with current codes and ordinances for a sum
                  not to exceed the value of the building. There are 67 housing units suitable for
                  rehabilation. Buildings are considered "not suitable for rehabilitation" when the
                  cost of the needed repairs would exceed the value of the structure. As
                  previously noted, there are 41 housing units that are not suitable for rehabilitation
                  and need to be removed.
                  The survey determined that there are approximately 68 housing units that need
                  minor repairs. These housing units, while not categorized as substandard
                  thereby needing rehabiliation, need primarily weatherization improvements such
                  as window replacement and more than likely, insulation.
                  The City does not currently have an established housing rehabilitation program.
                  Housing code enforcement primarily occurs when a housing unit is clearly an
                  open and notorious health and safety hazard, or when substantive complaints
                  are received. The Building Official assists property owners desiring to make
                  improvements to their structures.            Landlords participating, or desiring to
                  participate in the Section 8 rent subsidy program are required to bring units up to
                  a basic standard of condition.
                  Table II-14 identifies that there are a total of 162 mobilehome spaces available
                  within the City limits plus an additional 50 within the SOI. Also identified is that
                  that there are 90 recreational vehicle spaces within the City and 62 spaces within
                  the SOI that are more than likely used as permanent housing since the spaces
                  are equipped with drains. A total of 13 recreational vehicle spaces within the City
                  do not have drains, whereas, there are none in the SOI. The total of 265 mobile
                  home and recreational vehicles spaces provide housing opportunities to existing
                  City residents and another 112 spaces exist within the SOI.
                  Conditions within the mobile home and recreational vehicle parks vary. The
                  Blossom Trailer Park and Lazy Corral Trailer Court both exhibit significant
                  substandard conditions that need to be addressed. “Health and safety code
                  enforcement in mobilehome parks is the responsibility of the HCD, which aslo
                  has agreements with approximately 70 local agencies to conduct inspection of
                  parks in their jurisdictions.” The City does not have such an agreement with
                  HCD. “There are two kinds of inspections, the Mobilehome Park Maintenance
                  (MPM) inspections which involve full inspection of a park and all spaces, and the
                  complaint inspections that are mainly in response to complaints from park
                  residents, park owners or the public about possible health and safety violations.

                    There is a clear need for HCD to inspect existing mobilehome and recreational
                    vehicle parks in the City and to initiate enforcement action, as necessary, to
                    provide residents utilizing this type of housing with safe and sanitary condtions.
                    3. Housing – Vacancy Rates
                    The residential vacancy rate is a good indicator of the balance between housing
                    supply and demand in a community. When the demand for housing exceeds the
                    available supply, the vacancy rate will be low. However, a low vacancy rate
                    sometimes drives the cost of housing upward and increases tolerance for
                    substandard units. In a healthy market, the vacancy rate is between five and

City of Corning Housing Element                             II-12                                      October 15, 2009

                     eight percent. If the vacant units are distributed across a variety of housing types,
                     sizes, price ranges, and locations throughout the City, there should be an
                     adequate selection for all income levels.
                     According to the State Department of Finance, Corning's vacancy rate for all
                     types of housing units has fluctuated between 7.33 and 7.37 percent from 1999
                     through 2009. The 2000 Census identified vacancy rental rates to be 5.31
                     percent of the total vacant units. The balance vacancy’s are for housing units for
                     sale, seasonal recreational use, migrant worker housing, and rental housing
                     which is being sold, but not occupied.
                     This level of vacancy, particularly over a lenghty period of time, is generally
                     indicative of healthy market. Vacancy rates, as an indicator of market conditions,
                     typically run a fine line between an over-built market (typically considered above
                     eight percent vacancy) and an under-built market (generally anything under 3
                     percent). In a healthy market, there should be some number of vacant units in all
                     sizes, locations, and price ranges. Typically, in the type of market present in
                     Corning, the choice of units available would be fairly limited for households
                     seeking new residences. In order to fully analyze the effect of vacancies upon a
                     specific housing market, it is necessary to delve deeper into vacancy by type,
                     location, price range, and size of unit. There could exist a surplus of units at one
                     level and a scarcity at another which when averaged together indicate a vacancy
                     rate indicative of neither. There is no information currently available which
                     compares variation in the vacancy rate based on price or size of unit in the City.
                     4. Housing – Costs and Affordability
                     The ability of households to obtain housing that is affordable on their incomes –
                     whether purchasing a home or renting a unit – is an issue of significant concern
                     not only in the City of Corning, but throughout the State of California. Housing is
                     considered affordable if a household pays no more than 30 percent of its monthly
                     income for monthly housing costs.
                     “The general perception of “affordable” or “low” income housing tends to be
                     negative in character. Many people have concerns about the location of housing
                     considered affordable to lower-income households. One image people have is
                     that affordable housing attracts undesirable residents who would contribute to the
                     degradation of the community. As previously noted, the definition of affordable
                     housing is that housing should cost a household no more than 30 percent of its
                     income. Also, the definitions of Extremely Low, Very Low, and Low income are
                     based on the median income of the area being considered. Therefore, a
                     household with a certain income may be considered Low income in an area
                     where the cost of living is high, but would be considered Moderate or Above
                     Moderate in lower-cost areas. Moreover, the entry-level income of many
                     professions may qualify those employed as being a Low income household.
                     These include professions whose members are considered an integral part of a
                     community, such as fire fighters, police officers and nurses. Also, households
                     with retirees may also be Low income households, particularly those relying on
                     relatively fixed incomes.12

                     Homeowners – According to the 2000 Census, the median value of a single-
                     family home in the City was $79,600. The median home value in the City was
                     substantially lower than the median home value in the County, which was
                     $103,000, as shown in Table II-15. In 2000 in order to purchase an older home
                     at the median price within the City, a family household would have to earn
                     approximately $30,000 a year to qualify. Therefore, existing family housing
                     opportunities in the City appeared to be focused on the needs of the upper Low
                     to Moderate income groups in 2000. The 2000 Census collected and reported
                     selected monthly costs for owner occupied dwellings. In the City median
                     monthly mortgage payments were $747 whereas; the median monthly mortgage
                     cost in the County was $873.

                     Mortgage interest rates are a prime determinant of home affordability. Table II-
                     16 indicates that at the 2000 interest rate of 5.62 percent, a household earning
                     the City median family income per month could qualify for a median value home
                     of $79,600. An average family income with both parents working ranges from
                     $2,800 to $3,200 a month. An annual income of $33,600 to $38,400 made it
                     difficult, but not impossible, for the average resident to purchase a median value
                     home in the City in 2000.

                     In 2007, the median home value was approximately $202,000, a significant increase
                     over the 2000 median value home of $79,000. Based on a three percent down
                     payment, a mortgage with a 5.62 percent interest rate would require payments of
                     $1,129 per month. Interestingly in 2000, 2007 and currently, in 2009, interest rates
                     are very similar to those in 2000. Interest rates in the 96021 zip code are currently
                     ranging between 5.23 and 6.23 percent.13
                     Based on Table II-17, a monthly mortgage payment of $1,129 per month would only
                     be available to Above Moderate income group, thereby making home ownership in

                      market conditions are significantly different in mid-2009 than they were in 2007 as
                      evidenced by the following summary by the Tulia Real Estate Search web site:
                               “The median sales price for homes in ZIP code 96021 in Corning from
                               Mar 09 to May 09 was $84,050 based on 36 sales. Compared to the
                               same period one year ago, the median sales price decreased 38.2%, or
                               $51,950, and the number of sales increased 33.3%. Average price per
                               square foot for homes in 96021 was $89, a decrease of 11.9% compared

                      Further evaluation of sales only within the City limits and SOI boundaries
                      revealed that between January 1 and May 1, 2009 the median price of 20 homes
                      sold was $95,000. Based on the same 5.62 percent interest rate with a three
                      percent downpayment, a $92,000 mortgage would require payments of
                      approximately $530 per month. This provides Low income households housing
                      ownership opportunities.
                      Currently there are 18 homes for resale within the City limits and SOI boundaries
                      with a median “asking” sales price of $133,750.15 In the current real estate
                      market, actual sales prices are usually in the 10 percent range. Therefore, based
                      on a price of approximately $120,000 with the previous parameters, mortgage
                      payments would be approximately $690 per month which provides Moderate and
                      above housing purchasing opportunities.
                      Interestingly, there are 18 foreclosed homes within the aforementioned
                      boundaries with a median asking price of $101,200. Assuming the 10 percent
                      reduction of the “asking” price, a sales price of $91,000 results in a $524 per
                      month mortgage making housing affordable to Low income households.
                      In 2007, home buying opportunities were not available to Very Low, Low or even
                      Moderate income households. Whereas, the housing crisis has resulted in
                      economic hardships on many households due to employment terminations
                      and/or work hour reductions, it has provided home purchasing opportunities for
                      Low and Moderate income households. Therefore, single family housing in the
                      City is within the range to serve its residents with affordable housing. These
                      assertions assume that the household does not have a large outstanding
                      consumer debt (i.e., credit cards, revolving loans or car loans), which could
                      otherwise disqualify them.

   A “resale” means that the home for sale is not newly constructed.

                  5. Housing – At Risk Housing Evaluation
                  The California Government Code (Section 65583) requires that a Housing
                  Element include a study of all low income rental housing units, which may at
                  some future time, be lost to the affordable inventory by the expiration of some
                  type of affordability restrictions. This analysis must address a ten-year period,
                  which is divided into two five-year segments coinciding with the updating of the
                  Housing Element.
                  In the case of the City of Corning, certain types of HUD and State sponsored
                  projects, and any locally financed projects with specified time and use
                  restrictions, must be evaluated. The analysis must contain the following
                  components as required by HCD:
                      •    A comprehensive inventory of all subsidized rental housing units.
                      •    A cost comparison of replacing or preserving any units, which will become
                           at-risk in the ten-year period.
                      •    Identification of non-profit entities qualified to acquire and manage rental
                           housing.
City of Corning Housing Element                      II-16                                 October 15, 2009

                       •   Identification of possible sources and potential funds for preserving
                           housing units.
                       •   Inventory of existing and proposed City programs for preserving at-risk
                           units.
                  The first segment for analyzing at-risk units is 2009-2014 and the second
                  segment is 2014-2019.
                  Inventory of Affordable Rental Housing Units – Table II-19 identifies all of the
                  Low income rental units within housing complexes in the City, regardless of
                  restrictions and time frames. Over time, this will serve as a list to be regularly
                  monitored, to evaluate the possible loss of affordable units and also as planning
                  information for use in analyzing the distribution and concentrations of lower
                  income units in the City.
                  Based on information gathered from the USDA Rural Development Multi-Family
                  Housing Rentals web site and discussions with management representatives, it
                  has been determined that all 309 of the units in the existing subsidized
                  complexes, namely the Corning Garden Apartments, Maywood Apartments,
                  Corning Apartments, Tehama Village, Valley Terrace Apartments, and the
                  recently constructed Salado Orchards Apartments will not be at-risk prior to the
                  year 2013. However, the Corning Garden Apartments will be at risk in 2015. At
                  this stage, it is not know if the owners of Corning Garden Apartments will
                  continue with a rental assistance program. The Spring Mountain Apartments,
                  while not subsidized, do accept Section 8 vouchers and nine dwelling units are
                  currently rented under this program.                  Table II-18 also identifies affordability
                  restrictions.
                  All subsidized apartment projects are serviced by USDA – RHS approved
                  Management Agencies who provide required annual tenant certification
                  processing for their residents.

                      Cost Analysis – In order to provide a cost analysis of preserving at-risk units, cost
                      must be determined for rehabilitation, new construction or tenant-based rental
                      assistance. This analysis determines whether replacement (new construction) or
                      preservation (acquisition and rehabilitation, and/or direct rental subsidy
                      commitments) will be the most economical approach to preserving at-risk units.
                               a)     Rehabilitation – The factors that must be used to determine the cost
                                     of preserving low income housing include property acquisition,
                                     rehabilitation and financing. Actual acquisition costs depend on
                                     several variables such as condition, size, location, existing financing
                                     and availability of financing (governmental and market).                          The
                                     following are estimated per unit preservation costs for a multifamily
                                     rehabilitation project in the City of Red Bluff according to the
                                     Community Housing Improvement Program (CHIP), which most
                                     recently acquired and rehabilitated the Brickyard Creek Apartments.
                                     The approximate cost per unit for acquisition and soft costs was
                                     $18,800. The cost per unit for rehabilitation was approximately
                                     $40,400. The total cost per unit to preserve a low income housing
                                     unit in the City of Red Bluff is approximately $59,200.16 These costs

                                     would be applicable to the City of Corning since they share the same
                                     local real estate and construction market.
                                b) New Construction – Multi-family replacement property would be
                                     constructed with the same number of units and amenities as the one
                                     removed from the affordable housing stock. Cost factors were based
                                     a project in the City of Red Bluff and the recently completed Salado
                                     Orchard Apartments in the City of Corning.17
                                     The cost of new affordable housing can vary greatly depending on
                                     factors such as location, density, unit sizes, construction materials,
                                     type of construction (fair/good), and on and off site improvements.
                                     The following costs describe new construction for an apartment in an
                                     affordable housing complex in the City of Red Bluff. The cost for land
                                     acquisition is estimated at $2,377-$3,170 per unit based on a recent
                                     sale of a vacant R-4 property in Red Bluff. The cost per unit for
                                     construction is approximately $63,800-$82,000 depending on the type
                                     of construction used. The cost per unit for financing at 30-year loan at
                                     5.62 percent is $111,574-$143,596. The total cost per unit to replace
                                     a typical low income housing unit in Red Bluff ranges from $177,751
                                     to $228,766 or an average of $203,258.
                                     In comparison, the Salado Orchards Apartment complex recently
                                     completed in the City cost approximately $210,000 per unit. The cost
                                     per unit for both projects is similar.
                     The rehabilitation of existing units is the most cost effective approach towards the
                     preservation of at-risk units in the City. It should be noted, however, that at-risk
                     units may also be preserved through tenant-based rental assistance.
                                c) Tenant-Based Rental Assistance – Tenant- based rental assistance
                                     primarily depends on the income of the family, the shelter costs of the
                                     apartment, and the number of years the assistance is provided. If the
                                     typical family that requires rental assistance earns $20,200 (i.e., the
                                     estimated median household rent in the City in 2007), then that family
                                     could afford approximately $500 per month for shelter costs. The
                                     difference between the $500 and the typical rent for a two-bedroom
                                     apartment of $650 per month and would result in the necessity for a
                                     monthly rental assistance at the maximum rent cost of $150 a month
                                     or $1,800 per year. For comparison purposes, typical affordable
                                     housing developments carry an affordability term of at least twenty
                                     years, which would bring the total cost to $36,000 per family.
                                     For the five-year period of this Housing Element, none of the 309 units
                                     are considered to be at-risk of becoming market rate. In 2015 the 38
                                     Corning Garden apartment units will be at-risk. The total cost of
                                     replacing these units with new and comparable units is estimated at
                                     $7,980,000 based on the Salado Garden Apartment project. The
                                     estimated cost to rehabilitate and preserve a comparable number of
                                     dwelling units is $2,280,000. The estimated cost of providing tenant-

                              based rental assistance is approximately $1,368,000 for a twenty year
                              period. It is not known if the Corning Garden Apartments will renew
                              their rental assistance contract when it expires in 2015. If not
                              replacement, preservation, and renter-based assistance will be
                              required elsewhere in the City. Conversely, if the contract is renewed,
                              this would negate the estimated costs of replacement, preservation,
                              and renter-based assistance.
                  6. Housing – Preservation Resources
                      Efforts by the City to retain low income housing in the future must be able to
                      draw upon two basic types of resources, organizational and financial. First,
                      qualified non-profit entities need to be made aware of the future possibilities
                      of units becoming at-risk.         Demonstrated management and, perhaps
                      development abilities, should be assessed to give a thorough perspective on
                      the future of those resources. Groups with whom the City has an ongoing
                      association and those who are the logical entities for future participation are:

                          seniors who were facing fewer housing choices in a shrinking Northern
                          California market. CCH has a three-fold approach to meeting those
                          needs: building and/or preserving affordable, quality senior housing
                          developments where they are most needed; creating and maintaining
                          caring communities; and providing professional property management
                          that meets and/or exceeds industry standards. They are the largest

                      The process of monitoring, negotiating, disseminating housing information,
                      and identifying potential funding sources will be an ongoing program function
                      for City staff. City staff will be responsible to:
                          a) Establish procedures for monitoring, disseminating tenant counseling,
                              and identifying potential funding sources.
                          b) Regularly monitor the housing complexes, which are on State or
                              Federal inventories of the 38 Corning Garden Apartments at-risk

                              d) Establish review procedures for determining adequacy, and selecting
                                  designated groups to collaborate with the City in addressing the
                                  preservation of units that might become at-risk.
                              e) Evaluate and adopt new programs and incentives to entice the
                                  construction of additional units by both the public and private sectors.
                              (f) When seeking agencies for development of low income housing, the
                                  City should utilize a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) format, which
                                  solicits the background as well as organizational structure of
                                  interested entities with no previous experience with the City.
                              (g) Utilize this Housing Element as a guideline for directing efforts to
                                  preserve and create units for targeted needs groups in the City.
                     8. Housing – Financing Resources for Housing Preservation
                          Whereas, the City does not currently have any at-risk housing projects over
                          the next 10 years, it is prudent to identify the potential resources that could
                          become a part of the City’s overall financial plan for retaining affordable units,
                          which might become at-risk in the future. Furthermore, the potential
                          resources also can also be utilized to expand the current inventory of
                          affordable housing units.
                          Whereas, Table II-20 provides a comprehensive identification of potential
                          financial resources, the following are those that are more readily available to
                          the City, non-profit partners, and developers. These potential resources
                          include, but are not limited to:
                              a) HCD Programs – Work with and monitor HCD Loans, Grants, and
                                  Enterprise Zone Programs. HCD administers more than 20 programs
                                  that award loans and grants for the construction, acquisition,
                                  rehabilitation and preservation of affordable rental and ownership
                                  housing, homeless shelters and transitional housing, public facilities
                                  and infrastructure, and the development of jobs for lower income
                                  workers. It should be noted that, with rare exceptions, these loans
                                  and grants are not made to individuals, but to local public agencies,
                                  nonprofit and for-profit housing developers, and service providers. In
                                  many cases these agencies then provide funds to individual users.
                              b) HUD Programs – Continue to encourage the utilization of Section 8
                                  Housing Vouchers which can be used in rental housing of the tenant’s
                                  choice. Vouchers are issued through Tehama County which has
                                  contracted with Plumas County for delivery and the administration of
                                  this program. The program pays the difference between what the
                                  household can afford (i.e., 30 percent of their income) and the Fair
                                  Market Rent for the region, which is established by HUD. The
                                  vouchers are portable and may be used at any rental complex that
                                  accepts them. The Community Action Agency currently provides
                                  vouchers to 120 City Low-income families.18

                           established and a Redevelopment Plan adopted, there would
                           potentially be tax increment resources available to assist in
                           preserving or creating additional affordable housing in the
                           community. Twenty percent of tax increment funds must be
                           set-aside for affordable housing activities.

                        Housing
                        A combination of existing and new policies and programs in the City will
                        improve the ability to preserve and expand the affordable housing choices.
                        Those programs that have not been adopted by the City shall be noted.
                             d) Anti-Displacement Ordinance – The City should consider the adoption
                                  of an Anti-Displacement Policy which, in general, might require
                                  owners to bear the cost of relocating displaced tenants when
                                  affordability restrictions expire and the units are being converted to
                                  market rate. Also, it could include a requirement to rent to existing low
                                  income tenants for their period of stay in the units. Rent decontrol
                                  would then be permitted as low income tenants move.
                             e) Density Bonus Ordinance – The City adopted a Density Bonus
                                  Ordinance to encourage future residential development for lower
                                  income and elderly households.
                             f)   Housing Referral Service – The City should develop a catalog of
                                  programs and a methodology for disseminating pertinent information
                                  about the types of subsidized housing and the various providers of
                                  housing-related services.
                             g) Housing Rehabilitation: The City should establish a housing
                                  rehabilitation program in partnership with a housing service provider
                                  and seek appropriate funding. Qualified lower income homeowners
                                  and landlords who rent to lower income households have been and
                                  will continue to be assisted with low interest loans for basic
                                  improvements to residential dwellings.

         E.       SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
                  Household groups with special needs include seniors, mentally and physically
                  disabled persons, large family households, female-headed households,
                  agricultural workers and homeless persons. Households with special housing
                  needs often have greater difficulty in finding decent and affordable housing. As a
                  result, these households may experience a higher prevalence of overpaying,
                  overcrowding and other housing problems.
                  1. Special Housing Needs – Seniors
                  For the purposes of this Housing Element, seniors are defined as people age 65
                  years or older. Seniors may have special housing needs resulting primarily from
                  physical disabilities and limitations, fixed income, and health care costs.
                  Additionally, senior households also have other needs in order to preserve their
                  independence, including protective services to maintain their health and safety,
                  in-home support services to perform activities of daily living, and conservators to
                  assist with financial affairs.
                  The 2000 Census identified a total of 794 persons, comprising 672 households,
                  with one or more people over the age of 65 in the City. This represents 11.7
                  percent of the total population and 27.4 percent of all households. The City
                  recognizes that the elderly have special access and affordability limitations, and
                  therefore, has identified programs and policies in this document to address those
                  issues. There are five independent elderly living facilities within the City and/or
                  the SOI; Windsong Ranch, Woodson Lodge, Leisure Acres, Olive City Care
                  Home, and Wanda’s Boarding House. They offer an estimated 48 bed spaces
                  for senior citizens.
                  There are an additional six subsidized family and senior citizen rental housing
                  projects in the City. The rents for these units are based on tenant income. In
                  addition, the USDA - RHS apartment projects in the City have rental-assisted
                  units for Very Low income senior citizens. There are ten units in the Tehama
                  Village complex that are set aside specifically for senior citizens. The six family
                  and senior citizen rental housing projects are Corning Garden Apartments,
                  Corning Apartments, Maywood Apartments, Valley Terrace Apartments, Tehama
                  Village, and Salado Orchards Apartment.
                  2. Special Housing Needs – Persons With Disabilities
                  According to the 2000 Census, 23.8 percent of the total population in the City is
                  living with a disability. There were a total of 1,612 persons considered disabled
                  in the City in 2000. A breakdown of age groups with disabilities in the City is
                  provided in Table II-21.

                  With the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act, new multi-family
                  housing contains some units specifically designed for the disabled. The six rental
                  assisted apartment complexes within the City have 14 dwelling units for disabled
                  persons. In addition, Spring Mountain Apartments has an additional two units.
                  The City has policies and programs to accommodate the needs for persons with
                  disabilities as identified in the goals, policies, implementation measures, and
                  objectives of the currently adopted Housing Element, many of which are revised
                  by this Update.
                  Senate Bill 520 enacts that, no city, county, city and county, or local
                  governmental agency shall, in the enactment or administration of ordinances
                  pursuant to this title, prohibit or discriminate against any residential development
                  or emergency shelter because of the method of financing or the race, sex, color,
                  religion, ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, lawful occupation, familial status,
                  disability, or age of owners or intended occupants of the residential development
                  or the emergency shelter.
                  3. Special Housing Needs – Large Households
                  Large households are defined as those containing five or more persons.
                  According to the Census 2000 CHAS Data Book, 357 households, or 14.5
                  percent of the total number of occupied households in the City contained five or
                  more persons as identified in Table II-22.
                                                           TABLE II-22

                  Source: Census 2000 CHAS Data Book
                  Housing needs for large households are usually associated with overcrowding
                  and affordability. Of the 49 Extremely Low, 69 Very Low, and 40 Low income
                  households with five persons or more, 59, 50, and 25 households respectively,
                  pay more than 30 percent of their household income for housing.
                  The City has adopted policies and identified programs to meet the needs of large
                  households, which are discussed in Chapter IV. Review of the Previous Housing
                  Element and are also identified in Chapter V. Housing Goals, Policies, And
                  Programs.
                  4. Special Housing Needs – Female Head Of Households
                  Of the 2,422 occupied households in the City of Corning, 34.1 percent (836) are
                  female-headed households. There is a subset of these households comprising
                  12.8 percent (336), which are headed by females 65 years and older. A summary
                  of this information is contained in Table II-23.
                  Single parent households and single female householders, in particular, often
                  experience the full range of housing problems such as affordability, since they
                  are often on public assistance; overcrowding, because they cannot afford units
                  large enough to accommodate their families; insufficient housing choices and

                  sometimes, discrimination. The City recognizes these problems and has included
                  policies and programs in this document to address affordability, overcrowding,
                  and discrimination to all segments of the population.

                  5. Special Housing Needs – Farmworkers
                  Farmworkers are defined as persons whose primary income is earned through
                  permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farmworkers work in the
                  fields or in support activities on a year-round basis. When the growing and
                  harvesting season begins, the work force is supplemented by seasonal or
                  migrant labor. The State of California defines seasonal farm laborers as those
                  who are employed fewer than 150 consecutive days by the same employer.
                  Farmworkers are generally considered to have special housing needs due to
                  their limited income and the often unstable nature of their employment. In
                  addition, farmworker households tend to have high rates of poverty; live
                  disproportionately in housing which is in the poorest condition; have very high
                  rates of overcrowding; have low homeownership rates; and, are predominately
                  members of minority groups.
                  Tehama County is known for its olive and nut crops. Both the State of California
                  Employment Development Department and Census of Agriculture provide
                  information on migrant and permanent farmworkers by county, but do provide
                  city-specific detail.         The State of California Employment Development
                  Department estimates that there were 1,640 individuals employed in farm-related
                  work in Tehama County in 2008. Comparably, the 2002 Census of Agriculture
                  found significantly larger numbers of farmworkers in Tehama County. According
                  to the 2002 Census of Agriculture, Tehama County had 910 permanent
                  farmworkers and 2,893 seasonal farm laborers.
                  Although there is a need for both temporary and permanent housing for
                  farmworkers, the City’s limited staff and resources contribute to the lack of
                  facilities to meet this need. To meet the housing needs for farmworkers in the
                  City, funding and participation by outside agencies will be essential.
                  Farmworkers special housing needs arise from their limited income and the
                  seasonal nature of their employment. Because of their low incomes, farmworkers
                  have limited housing choices and are often forced to double-up to afford rents.
                  The majority of the land within the City is or will be developed for urban uses,
                  however agricultural land surrounds the City on all sides and some is located
                  within the SOI. There is an active olive, fruit and nut industry, which demands
                  seasonal labor. The growers provide housing for migrant workers and support
                  services are provided by Tehama County. The housing needs of permanent and
                  seasonal farm workers are primarily addressed through the provision of
                  permanent housing rather than employer provided housing. The City zoning
City of Corning Housing Element                        II-34                              October 15, 2009

                  ordinance does not make a distinction between residential zoned lands that
                  would facilitate single-family or multifamily housing for farmworkers. Therefore,
                  farmworker housing is allowed in all residential zones.
                  The special housing needs of farm workers are addressed by the City through
                  the assistance provided to non-profit corporations such as SHHIP. Self-help
                  housing has become a major source of affordable housing in the City. Since
                  2005 approximately 100 homes have been constructed under the assistance of
                  SHHIP with four more currently under construction. The USDA also provides low
                  interest financing for homeownership and rental housing construction.
                  6. Special Housing Needs – Homeless Persons and Families
                  California law requires that Housing Elements estimate the need for emergency
                  shelter for homeless people. Individuals and families in need of emergency
                  shelter have the most immediate housing need of any group. They also have
                  one of the most difficult sets of housing needs to meet, due in part to both the
                  diversity and complexity of the factors that lead to homelessness and need for
                  shelter. Among the primary groups that comprise the homeless population are
                  traditional single male transients, deinstitutionalized mental patients, teen
                  runaways, evicted families and individuals, battered women and their children,
                  victims of disaster, and alcohol and drug addicts. Another factor in the difficulty
                  in providing for housing needs of this group is community opposition to the siting
                  of facilities that serve homeless clients.
                  For a variety of economic, social and/or personal reasons individuals and families
                  either choose or are forced to be homeless. Their homelessness can be a
                  temporary situation or a semi-permanent way-of-life. The City is located along
                  Interstate 5, south of Red Bluff, the county seat and the largest city. Because of
                  the county level resources available in Red Bluff, it is likely that most persons or
                  families in need of assistance will find it there. Northern California Planning &
                  Research conducted a survey in 2003 to find the number of people who received
                  homeless assistance through the Salvation Army food lockers, Tehama County
                  Welfare, and the Poor And The Homeless shelter (PATH). The homeless survey
                  for Tehama County, found 153 homeless people living in shelters between
                  November 15 and April 14 and no persons visibly living in the streets. These
                  numbers only represent the homeless that sought assistance during the winter
                  months at the local shelter.
                  There are a number of different situations in which people may find themselves
                  being homeless. Each situation is different, requiring different housing needs.
                  These situations can be broken down into three basic shelter types; emergency,
                  transitional, and temporary.
                  The City’s Zoning Ordinance does not define nor specifically provide for the
                  development of emergency and temporary shelters, or transitional housing
                  unless these types of shelters could be considered as a “boardinghouse” use,
                  which permitted outright in the R-4 General Apartment District. There is also the
                  potential that the uses could be permitted in the P-Q Public or Quasi-Public Use
                  District; however, this would require a determination by the planning commission.
                  In order to address this issue, a “Mixed Use” General Plan Classification and
                  Zone District is proposed that would permit emergency and temporary shelters
City of Corning Housing Element                   II-35                                 October 15, 2009

                  and transitional housing. Unlike the approach other communities utilize, the
                  shelters and transitional housing will not be solely relegated to industrial areas.
                  Emergency Shelter
                  Emergency shelters are needed to take care of an individual, or family, that has
                  had a sudden traumatic event forcing them to become homeless. Battered
                  women and their families require emergency shelter where they can stay without
                  fear of their batterer. After the emergency is over, a transitional shelter may be
                  required if the women and their families are unable to provide for themselves
                  immediately. Evicted individuals and/or families need short-term housing usually
                  until they can find another residence. Disaster victim’s housing needs vary
                  depending on the type of disaster. Destructive events, which completely destroy
                  their residence and belongings, may force the victims to live in an emergency
                  shelter until they can find long-term housing or replace what they have lost.
                  Some disaster victims can return to their homes after the disastrous event
                  passes but require over-night or short-term emergency shelter.
                  Emergency shelters are typically motels, hotels, homeless shelters, gymnasiums,
                  churches, barracks, and other similar facilities. Their use is short-term and
                  typically the accommodations are sparse.
                  Through the Tehama County Social Services Department, the California Work
                  Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) program provides
                  assistance to those eligible for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. This
                  program provides eligible individuals approximately $65 per day for 16 days for
                  emergency housing needs. Families are eligible for this assistance one time
                  only. In addition, once more permanent shelter is found, the Tehama County
                  Social Services Department will provide the last month’s rent (if necessary) and
                  security deposit on an apartment.
                  Due to the location of the City, the incidence of homelessness does not currently
                  appear to be an issue. The homeless tend to gravitate to larger communities
                  where, due to larger population levels they can more easily become relatively
                  inconspicuous. In addition, the homeless will go to communities where they
                  know they can obtain emergency shelter and meals. The ease of access to a
                  bus terminal is also an attraction. However, the City will address the outright
                  permitting of emergency shelters as part of this Housing Element Update.
                  Shelters may only be subject only to development and management standards
                  that apply to residential or commercial development in the same zone except that
                  local governments may apply written and objective standards that include all of
                  the following:
                           •  maximum number of beds;
                           •  off-street parking based upon demonstrated need;
                           •  size and location of on-site waiting and intake areas;
                           •  provision of on-site management;
                           •  proximity to other shelters;
                           •  length of stay;
                           •  lighting; and
City of Corning Housing Element                    II-36                                October 15, 2009

                              •     security during hours when the shelter is open.19
                    Transitional and Supportive Housing
                    Transitional housing and transitional housing development mean rental housing
                    operated under program requirements that call for the termination of assistance
                    and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at
                    some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than six months.
                    Transitional housing is often required for housing individuals or families after their
                    immediate need for emergency shelter has been satisfied but they are not self-
                    reliant. Transitional housing programs are often combined with a variety of social
                    services intended to provide job training and self-reliance. Transitional housing is
                    typically single family residences, either detached homes or apartment houses.
                    Sometimes motels and hotels can serve in this capacity if they are equipped with
                    kitchens.
                    Supportive Housing is housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by
                    the target population and that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the
                    supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health
                    status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the
                    community.
                    The City does not prohibit transitional or supportive housing. Both housing types
                    are permitted in the General Apartment (R-4) Zone District as an outright
                    permitted use. Transitional and supportive housing are considered as residential
                    uses and only be subject to the same restrictions that apply to similar housing
                    types in the R-4 Zone.
                    Temporary Shelter and Single Room Occupancy Units (SRO)
                    Temporary shelter is needed for the chronic homeless. There is a portion of the
                    homeless population who are voluntarily homeless. Single male transients
                    require nighttime or poor-weather shelters or single room occupancy (SRO)
                    housing. Migrant farm laborers and their families need short-term low cost
                    housing which is available during a variety of different months each year.
                    Deinstitutionalized mental patients require medical as well as SRO units.
                    Teenage runaways need temporary shelter and other social services. Illegal
                    immigrants may require short-term individual or family shelter.
                    Temporary shelters are needed to address a variety of situations in which
                    individuals and/or families find themselves homeless. While there is a portion of
                    the homeless population that is voluntarily homeless, these individuals still often
                    require nighttime or poor-weather shelters. Teenage runaways require temporary
                    shelter, counseling and other social services. Evicted individuals and/or families
                    often need short-term housing until they can find another residence. Seasonal
                    workers, including migrant farmworkers, need short-term low cost housing for
                    various durations throughout the year. SRO units, which are often converted
                    hotels and motels, are one of the most appropriate types of temporary housing
                    for extremely low-income persons.

   HCD. Building Blocks for Effective Housing Elements – Zoning for Emergency and Transitional Housing.
City of Corning Housing Element                             II-37                                       October 15, 2009

                  The City’s Zoning Code does prohibit SRO’s, however, the Code does not
                  specifically define single-room occupancy units. The Code does allow a similar
                  use (i.e., boarding houses) by right in the Neighborhood Apartment (R-3) and
                  General Apartment (R-4) zones and in the Historic Residential (HR) district with
                  an administrative use permit. The development standards for these are the
                  same as other uses in the respective zone and do not constrain the development
                  of SRO types. However, to ensure the facilitation of SROs, the City will amend
                  its zoning code to clarify the definition of SROs and describe specific
                  development standards for these units.

III.     HOUSING RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
         This chapter provides both an overview of the factors that may constrain development as
         well as the resources that assist with the construction of new housing which were
         addressed in Chapter II – Housing Needs Assessment. Major constraints to residential
         development faced by the City and most other communities include: market constraints,
         such as development costs and interest rates; and, governmental constraints, which
         consist of land use controls, fees, processing times and development standards, among
         others. In addition, environmental and infrastructure issues can also impede the
         development of housing. Conversely, there are a number of resources available to the
         City and housing providers that can assist with the development of housing. The
         financial resources have already been discussed, therefore, what needs to be
         addressed are the vacant sites suitable for housing. This chapter also highlights the
         City’s progress towards meeting its share of the regional housing need.
         A.       FAIR-SHARE HOUSING PROJECTED HOUSING NEED
         The City’s future housing need is based on population and employment growth
         projections over a 2007-2014 planning period. Based on these projections, the State
         assigns each region in California a Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), which is
         mandated by the State of California for regions to address housing issues and needs
         (California Government Code Section 65584). The State through the HCD, establishes
         the total housing unit needs for each region. For areas such as the City and Tehama
         County with no council of governments, the HCD determines housing market areas and
         defines the regional housing need for cities and counties within these areas.
         The HCD developed the RHNA for unincorporated Tehama County and the cities of Red
         Bluff, Corning and Tehama. It allocates to the cities and unincorporated areas of the
         County their “fair share” of the projected housing need, based upon household income
         groupings over the five-year planning period for the Housing Element of each specific
         jurisdiction. The RHNA also identifies and quantifies the existing housing needs for
         each jurisdiction. The quantification is based on a planning period from January 1, 2007
         to June 30, 2014. The City may reduce its respective allocation by the net units
         developed during the interim period; that is, from January 1, 2007 to the date of
         preparation of the Housing Element. The intent of the RHNA is to ensure that local
         jurisdictions address not only the needs of their immediate areas but also provide their
         share of housing needs for the entire region. Additionally, a major goal of the RHNA is
         to assure that every community provides an opportunity for a mix of housing affordable
         to all economic segments of its population. The RHNA jurisdictional allocations are
         made to ensure that adequate sites and zoning are provided to address existing and
         anticipated housing demands during the planning period and that market forces are not
         inhibited in addressing the housing needs for all facets of a particular community.
         Table III-1 provides the adjusted RHNA target for the planning period 2007 to 2014. The
         RHNA is based on the projection of population and new household formation determined
         by the Demographic Research Unit of the Department of Finance. The Department
         applied a small percentage adjustment to accommodate an additional number of vacant
         and replacement housing units needed. The resulting RHNA is a minimum projection of
         additional housing needed to accommodate household growth over the planning period;

                      1. Non-govenmental Constraints – Land Availability
                      In addressing the estimated housing needs identified in the Housing Needs
                      Assessment section of this Housing Element, State law, Government Code
                      Section 65583(c)(1), requires that this Element contain an inventory of land
                      suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having
                      potential for redevelopment. This inventory must identify adequate sites which
                      will be made available through appropriate zoning and development standards
                      and with public services and facilities needed to facilitate and encourage the
                      development of a variety of housing types for households of all income levels.
                      In preparing this Housing Element, all vacant general plan classified and zoned
                      residential lands within the City were inventoried including vacant commercial
                      and industrial zoned lands for conversion to residential use based on location
                      and existing land use compatibility. In addition, the existing vacant residential
                      general plan classified and zoned lands were evaluated to determine if densities
                      could be increased where the locations were appropriate to do so.
                      Table III-2 and Figures III-1A and 1B (the Figures are at the end of this Chapter)
                      identify 65 vacant residential parcels through April 2009 by Assessor’s Parcel
                      Number (APN), parcel sizes, General Plan Classification, Zoning District, the
                      density factor and the number of potential residential units that could be
                      constructed.1 The number of dwelling units that could be constructed is then
                      distributed, where applicable, between the four income levels of Very Low, Low,
                      Moderate and Above Moderate. In many instances the size of the parcel may
                      only allow for one residence. The distribution between income levels is generally
                      based on Table III-3. The distribution takes into account the existing parcel size,
                      location, infrastructure, and when applicable, natural environmental constraints
                      such as wetlands.
                      Table III-4 and Figures III-1A and 1B provide an inventory and location of the
                      nine residential subdivision projects approved since the 2003 Housing Element
                      was adopted through April 2009. The approval date is provided under the name
                      of the project. All the projects are classified as Residential in the general plan.
                      The APN, acreage and zoning designations are identified. The Density Factor is
                      determined by dividing the total number of parcels approved by the acreage.
                      Due to the location of the subdivisions, except for the Salado Orchards Phase 2
                      and the Corning North Project, the income range distribution is based on 40
1
  The Density Factor is “net” whereby streets have already been excluded. As an example, the maximum density allowable in the R-
  1 Zone District is seven dwelling units per acre. However, the “net” density is six dwelling units per acre.

                     percent for Moderate and 60 percent for Above Moderate based on estimated
                     sales prices and lending qualification criteria.
                     Phase 2 of the Salado Orchard Apartments has a projected 28 percent Very Low
                     and 72 percent Low income distribution based on the July 25, 2007 Tax
                     Allocation Committee Staff Report for Phase 1. The Corning North project has a
                     10 percent Low, 36 percent Moderate and 54 percent Above Moderate income
                     distribution based on estimated income distribution taking into account projects
                     developed in the area and existing housing sales prices. Except for Stonefox
                     project none of the subdivisions have begun the construction of infrastructure, let
                     alone residences. This is due to current housing market conditions and the
                     economy in general. The Stonefox project has a portion of the infrastructure
                     constructed; however, the project is in foreclosure.

                     classification such as Residential or Multi-Family Residential and where
                     appropriate, to a commensurate zoning designation, is recommended. For some
                     parcels, the existing zoning designation does not need to change. In some
                     instances, all that is necessary is a rezone. In some cases, Table III-5 does not
                     reflect the Table III-3 distribution due to location, infrastructure, and
                     environmental constraints for individual parcels.

                     Gallagher Avenue and SR99W/3rd Street. The area encompasses approximately
                     260 acres within which approximately 186 net acres could be developed to
                     provide approximately 1,346 single and multi-family housing units.

                     However, Table III-7 utilizes Table III-2 which is utilizing R-1 (7 units per acre),
                     R-1-A (7 units per acre) and the R-1-2 (14 units per acre) zones to encourage
                     and facilitate the development of housing for lower-income households. HCD
                     has noted that “If these zones are being used toward the City's housing need for
                     lower-income households, the element must include an analysis as described
                     above.” In addition, HCD stated that many small sites have been identified
                     whereby “14 of the 15 sites zoned R-1-2 and R-2 (14 units per acre) are small,
                     less than a half-acre in size (page III-3). If necessary to accommodate the City's
                     housing need, particularly for lower-income households, the element must
                     include an analysis of small sites demonstrating their potential residential
                     development capacity and ability to facilitate housing for lower-into lie
                     households. While it may be possible to build housing on a very small parcel, the
                     nature and conditions necessary to construct the units often render the provision
                     of affordable housing infeasible.                      For example, most assisted housing
                     developments utilizing local, State or federal financial resources include at least
                     50-80 units. The analysis could consider recent small lot residential development
                     trends including affordability and lot consolidations to facilitate this analysis.”
                     HCD did state that “However, if the City rezones sufficient candidate sites (Table
                     III-5) to appropriate sizes, this analysis is not required.”2
                     Whereas, an analysis could be undertaken which would demonstrate that small
                     sites could be utilized for the construction of housing for Lower income
                     households and that such housing could be developed on R-1 and R-2 zoned
                     properties, Table III-5 plus the approval of Salado Orchards Phase II
                     demonstrates that there are enough candidate sites of appropriate sizes for the
                     development of assisted housing. Briefly, however, an explanation why an
                     analysis would support that small sites could be utilized needs to be provided.
                     The Self Help Home Improvement Project (SHHIP), a non-profit, assists in the
                     development, repair and rehabilitation of housing units for Lower income
                     households. USDA Rural Development provides funding for the SHHIP projects.
                     Since 2005 SHHIP has assisted in the construction of the following affordable
                     housing projects, 20 homes in the McDonald Court Subdivision, 13 homes on the
                     east and west sides of Fripp Avenue, 16 homes in the Blue Heron Court

                     along Blossom Avenue with four homes currently under construction. These total
                     104 homes are made available to Lower income households and are being
                     provided on “small sites” with R-1 zoning. In addition to these homes there are
                     four vacant parcels along Blossom Avenue that will be developed with the
                     assistance of SHHIP. SHHIP has indicated that they are interested in pursuing
                     the development of additional residential projects in the City. It should also be
                     noted that Phase 1 of the Salado Orchards Apartments which provides 47 Lower
                     income housing units plus a manager’s unit was constructed on a 5.17 acre site
                     zoned R-1.
                     Utilizing Table III-7 i during the Housing Element planning period of 2009 to 2014
                     and 2007-2014 RHNA the following assumptions can be made:
                            •    Based on Existing vacant parcels, there are an insufficient number of
                                 potential housing units to meet the Very Low and Low income group
                                 housing needs.3
                            •    There are a sufficient number of Existing vacant parcels to serve the
                                 needs of Moderate and Above Moderate income groups.
                            •    Based on Existing parcels and Approved subdivision parcels, there are an
                                 insufficient number of potential housing units to serve the housing needs
                                 of the Very Low and Low income groups.
                            •    To serve the housing needs of the Low income group, there are a
                                 sufficient number of Existing parcels and Approved subdivision parcels.
                            •    To adequately serve the housing needs of the Very Low income group
                                 during the planning period, the City will need to undertake general plan
                                 amendments and/or rezonings.
                            •    Beyond the current planning period, the City may need to undertake
                                 additional general plan amendments within the City limits and/or annex
                                 lands within the existing SOI to meet the needs of Very Low and Low
                                 income housing groups.
                     However, to address the aforementioned HCD comments, Table III-7 was refined
                     to include the Salado Orchards 48 units that were approved in April 2007 and
                     had construction completed in April 2008. Also included is the approved Salado
                     Orchards Phase 2 and sites within the City that will be general plan amended
                     and/or rezoned to R-3 and R-4 which are of sufficient size. Larger R-2 parcels
                     were also included since duplexes can be easily developed Table III-8 identifies
                     the sites and potential number of dwelling units by income level. When
                     combined with SHIPP housing to be constructed during the planning period,
                     there will be sufficient housing to address Very Low and Low Income needs. The
                     City of Corning, therefore, will have sufficient sites and dwelling units to provide
                     112 Very Low, 248 Low, 351 Moderate, and 32 Above Moderate income
                     households on 63.73 acres comprised of 11 parcels.
                     The City has planned for the future growth through the adoption of a Municipal
                     Service Review (MSR) in 2005. The MSR allowed the Tehama County LAFCO

  It should be recognized that without knowing which housing assistance programs will be utilized, and/or the levels of funding
  that will be available, it is not possible to anticipate the potential distribution of lower income units among the Very Low and Low
  income groups. It is possible that some of the Existing vacant parcels could be utilized for Very Low income housing
  development.

                     to expand the City’s SOI by an additional 4.65 square miles, or 2,950 acres. The
                     current SOI encompasses 7.22 square miles, or 4,620 acres contiguous to the
                     City limits on nearly all sides of the City. Approximately 260 acres within the SOI
                     adjacent to the northwestern City limits are proposed for annexation.
                     One needs to be aware that the Dutra Bill (AB 2292), approved by the governor
                     on September 19, 2002, “prohibits a city, county, or a city and county, by
                     administrative, quasi-judicial, or legislative action, from reducing, requiring, or
                     permitting the reduction of the residential density for any parcel to a lower
                     residential density that is below the density that was utilized by the Department of
                     Housing and Community Development in determining compliance with housing
                     element law, unless the city, county, or city and county makes written findings
                     supported by substantial evidence that the reduction is consistent with the
                     adopted general plan, including the housing element, and the jurisdiction's share
                     of the regional housing need, as specified.”4
                     Once a parcel(s) is amended to meet densities required to meet RHNA fair share
                     regional housing need objectives over designated planning periods, the density
                     of the parcel(s) cannot be reduced if it were utilized by HCD in determining
                     housing element law compliance.

    Phase 1 of Salado Orchards does not need a general plan amendment or rezone. It has already been constructed but was
    included since the dwelling units are counted towards meeting the City’s RHNA fair share for the 2009-2014 planning period.

                     There are two major housing fiancial sources; a) some form of government
                     assisted or enabled funding, or b) funding through banks and other traditional
                     mortgage lending institutions.

                     Government Assisted or Enabled
                     Table II-20 provides a summary of the federal, state, local, and public resource
                     funding programs that are currently available or not available due to the lack of
                     funding and current economic conditions. This does not preclude them from
                     being available sometime during this 2009-2014 Housing Element plan period.
                     It is recognized that the City does not have the resources to avail themselves of
                     all the potential funding available, therefore, in partnership with existing housing
                     providers, the City should concentrate on the following funding programs.
                           •     HUD Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds
                           •     HUD Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers
                           •     HOME Investment Partnership Act (HOME) Funds
                           •     USDA RHS Direct Loan Program and Loan Guarantee Program (Section
                                 502)
                           •     USDA RHS Home Repair Loan and Grant Program (Section 504)
                           •     USDA RHS Rural Rental Housing - Direct Loans (Section 515)
                           •     CalHome Program
                           •     California Homebuyer’s Down payment Assistance Program (CHDAP)
                           •     Multi-Family Housing Program (MHP)
                     The City should also actively pursue evaluating and potentially establishing the
                     following programs which could be a source of funding:
                           •     Establishment of a Redevelopment Agency.
                           •     Establishment of a housing rehabiliation program.
                           •     Establishment of a grant and loan weatherization program.
                     Bank Or Traditional Mortgage Funding
                     Housing financing for individual households through banks and other traditional
                     mortgage lending institutions is currently very difficult to obtain. The following
                     discussion is derived from an article in the Daily Mortgage/Housing News.5
                     Despite prices and rates coming down there are just not enough available buyers
                     to absorb the entire present and future housing inventory, within the foreseeable
                     future of two to three years, and possibly more. Buyers are divided into several
                     types: first-time home buyers, move-up buyers, and second home/investment
                     buyers. Renters are often in the same position as first-time home buyers.
                     During the bubble years, all of these potential buyers purchased new and
                     existing homes and were the driving force in the housing market. Today they are
                     not. Real estate bubbles are invariably followed by severe price decreases (also
                     known as a house price crash) that can result in many owners holding negative
                     equity (a mortgage debt higher than the current value of the property. This is
                     currently being evidenced by the real estate bubble of 2007.6

  The real estate bubble discussion is derived from Wikipedia, the Free Encylclopedia – “http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Real_ estate_
  bubble”. As defined, the housing bubble for residential markets is a type of economic bubble that occurs periodically in local or
  global real estate markets. It is characterized by rapid increases in valuations of real property such as housing until they reach
  unsustainable levels relative to incomes and other economic elements.
City of Corning Housing Element                                 III-11                                          October 15, 2009

                    First-Time Buyer – First-time home buyers in their early to mid 20’s are a group
                    that can benefit from lower rates and prices at the lower end of the price range.
                    However, historically they were one of the smallest housing market segments.
                    Now the question is, how many 20-something’s have a large enough down
                    payment, two-year job history, very little debt and good enough credit score to
                    take advantage of the low base rates available?
                    The first-time home buyer group as a whole will not be able to get the low base-
                    rates being offered by banks and traditional mortgage lenders because they are
                    not seasoned borrowers with large cash positions. A loan to value ratio (LTV)
                    and credit score that was considered ‘Super-Prime’ two years ago can result in a
                    1.5 percent hit (increase) to the rate bringing them from 5.5 to 7 percent very
                    quickly. While the 7 percent rate may fall further, it is believed that this group is
                    more price-sensitive and looking for a ‘great deal’ on a foreclosure-related
                    property instead of waiting for rates to drop to buy. This seems to be the case
                    with most buyers given over half of all home sales in the bubble states such as
                    California come from the foreclosure stock.
                    Move-up Buyer – Although purchases always accounted for a small portion of all
                    mortgage loans and still do, move-up buyers were the largest segment of buyers
                    during the bubble years. Easy lending made it a no-brainer for folks to always
                    get something newer and bigger in a better location. Each quarter brought about
                    new and innovative loan programs designed by the investment banks to bring
                    payments and down-payments lower making homes more affordable. With very
                    little to no down payment required and housing rising double-digit percentages
                    per year it was easy to sell, pocket the profit and buy the new home with little
                    expense and even a lower payment if you chose a Pay Option Adjustable Rate
                    Mortgage.7 The new home was also furnished on “easy” credit terms from their
                    favorite furniture chain.
                    Just about everyone qualified due to stated income, no ratio and no documented
                    loans. Now, the move-up buyer is virtually non-existent because most can’t sell
                    for what they owe; can’t sell for what is needed to extract the large down
                    payment needed to buy the new home given today’s sensible financing; can’t get
                    good financing above $417,000; or can’t qualify for a mortgage without an exotic
                    or “liar” loan.
                    The move-up home buyer complicates the housing market because they often
                    are the group purchasing newly constructed housing. These existing home
                    owners are now not freely able to sell their homes and purchase newly
                    constructed housing. This identifies the following: a) that many home owners are
                    stuck upside down in their home and can’t sell; b) the all-important move-up
                    buyer is non-existent and can’t even afford to buy the home they presently live in
                    given present-day sensible lending guidelines; and, c) home owners with equity
                    can’t sell their home in order to get the down payment for a new home.
                    Second Home/Investment Buyer – Again, it is more about getting a “great deal”

  Wikipedia, the Free Encylclopedia - “http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjustable-rate_mortgage”. As defined, Option ARMs are often
  offered with a very low teaser rate (often as low as 1%) which translates into very low minimum payments for the first year of the
  ARM. During boom times, lenders often underwrite borrowers based on mortgage payments that are below the fully amortizing
  payment level. This enables borrowers to qualify for a much larger loan (i.e., take on more debt) than would otherwise be
  possible.
City of Corning Housing Element                                             III-12                          October 15, 2009

                  purchase for this group. For those not paying cash, most investors have
                  significant interest rate adjustments on their loan taking the rate up substantially
                  over 5.5 percent. For investment properties, the 3-point hit for LTV’s above 75
                  percent alone takes the 5.5 to 6.75 percent – most will have multiple hits.
                  The second/vacation home buyer can get more aggressive rates than investment
                  buyers, but it is easily assumed that economists are not staking their reputation
                  on vacation home buyers saving the housing market. The investment buyer is
                  one of the driving forces in the purchase market today but that cannot be
                  sustained over time. The investment buyer is a potential source of rental housing
                  opportunities, but not for purchasing, at least over a short period of time. The
                  second home/investment buyer is not a driving force in today’s housing market.
                  Renters – Renters can also benefit from lower rates but the same rules apply as
                  with First-Time Buyers. This segment also has historically been one of the
                  weakest, as many are renters for a reason. In many cases those reasons
                  prohibit them from buying. The renter segment is not a driving force in today’s
                  housing market.
                  The pundits preach that falling values are great for housing because more people
                  can buy. While some of this is true, particularly with respect to foreclosures that
                  is not the whole story. In this market after such a devastating past year and a
                  half for home prices, lower prices are a leading indicator of two things – more
                  loan defaults and more zombie home owners ‘stuck’ in their home unable to sell
                  or refinance. Both of these are a leading indicator of future home price
                  depreciation.
                  Given the state of financing opportunities from banks and traditional mortgage
                  lending institutions, housing financing opportunities in the near future will need to
                  be from government programs, particularly federal ones. Banks and the
                  traditional institutions will rely on more government financial support in making
                  housing loans, however, lending criteria will be strictly followed and closely
                  monitored.
                  Overall, the availability of financing to all income groups in the City is a constraint
                  particularly to first-time home buyers and renters who wish to purchase a home.
                  They are generally representative of the Low and Moderate income groups.
                  Existing home owners, regardless of income, may be unable to move-up in
                  housing due to being financially over-extended, facing foreclosure, having
                  insufficient equity, all of which limit them from qualifying financially. Naturally
                  there are homeowners and renters who have no desire to purchase a home or
                  move-up.
                  3. Non-govenmental Constraints –– Land Cost
                  Based on a June 2009 review of the Tehama County Association of Realtors and
                  the Trulia Real Estate Search web sites, there are no actively listed sites with
                  sufficient size acreage for future subdivision and/or multi-family development
                  readily accessible to service services within the City limits. Based review of the
                  web sites and the May 2009 housing and vacant land survey there are only five
                  lots currently available posted for sale within the City limits. All the lots have
                  necessary infrastructure available to them. Two of the lots are each 7,500
                  square feet in size and are listed for $35,000 each. The three other lots are
City of Corning Housing Element                              III-13                    October 15, 2009

                      8,960 square feet in size and are each listed for $85,000. All five lots are
                      classified as Residential in the General Plan. The first two are zoned R-1-2,
                      which would permit duplexes with the approval of a conditional use permit,
                      however, the last three are zoned R-1-8 which only permits a single family
                      residence.
                      By comparison in the City or Red Bluff, based on a 2009 survey of local real
                      estate agencies, vacant single-family residential lots are selling for $36,000 to
                      $106,000 depending on size and location, or an average of $37,040 for a 7,000-
                      square foot lot.8
                      On the average, the cost of land should not exceed 25 percent of the overall cost
                      of the sale of a residence. Based on the median sale price of homes between
                      January 1, and May 1, 2009 at $95,000, the value of the land should be
                      approximately $23,750. The lots listed $35,000 each would exceed the median
                      by $11,250. In order to not exceed the 25 percent value of land to sale price, the
                      $35,000 lot normally requires a home value of $140,000, whereas, the $85,000
                      lots normally requires a home value of $340,000.
                      The purchase of a $140,000 home with three percent down payment results in a
                      mortgage of $135,800 requiring a monthly payment of approximately $780. Such
                      a payment is not affordable to Very Low or Low income households. The
                      $340,000 home with a three percent down requires a payment of $1,900 per
                      month which only Above Moderate income households could afford.
                      There is no vacant multi-family land listed for sale in the City. However, in the
                      City of Red Bluff, multi-family is selling for approximately $330,000 per acre.
                      Vacant land owners including developers, particularly those that purchased
                      and/or developed land at higher prices between 2002 and 2006 are reluctant to
                      sell at reduced prices unless required to do so because of economic constraints.
                      Also existing vacant land owners are unwilling to sell at prices lower than what
                      their neighbors sold their land during the boom years. They are expecting the
                      same rate of return on their investment and are willing to wait until the next cycle.
                      Overall land costs are a constraint on the development of Very Low, Low, and to
                      an extent, Moderate income housing in the City due to not only the existing lands
                      costs, but also due to the lack of an adequate supply of land for sale. This is
                      applicable to both single family and multi-family lands.
                      4. Non-govenmental Constraints –– Development Cost
                      Construction costs vary widely depending on the housing type. Multiple family
                      housing generally costs less to construct than single family housing. Labor and
                      materials also have a direct impact on costs and comprise the main component
                      of costs. Housing constructions costs vary greatly depending on the quality of
                      materials used and the size of the home being constructed. Table III-9 illustrates
                      construction costs (per square foot) for California regions, excluding San
                      Francisco and Los Angeles, from 2000 to 2009.

                  Discussions with Mr. Dave Rutledge, Executive Director of the Community
                  Revitalization and Development Corporation noted that current construction costs
                  for an average wood frame home could be as low as $90.00 per square foot
                  given the current state of the economy and unemployment levels, particularly in
                  the construction industry. The construction costs do not include City building and
                  impact fees, or school fees.
                  For an approximate 1,440 square foot home construction costs could range
                  between $129,600 and $146,880 plus the cost of the land. Assuming the
                  $35,000 vacant lot previously discussed, the cost of the home could range
                  between $164,600 and $181,900. Such a home would be available to Moderate
                  and Above Moderate income households, but not to the Low or Very Low
                  households. However, when City building permit and schools fees are added to
                  the land and construction costs, housing will be barely available to Moderate
                  income households. This is discussed in Chapter III Housing Constraints,
                  Section C. Sub-Section 3. Governmental Constraints – Development and
                  Construction Fees.
                  If labor or material costs were to increase substantially, the cost of construction
                  could rise to a level that impacts the price of new construction and also
                  rehabilitation. Therefore, increased construction costs have the potential to
                  constrain new housing construction and rehabilitation of existing housing.
                  Impacts of increased construction costs could be reduced to an extent by lower
                  land costs and City building permit and impact fees and school fees. However,
                  this will create a stain on the provision of services by the City and schools.
                  5. Non-govenmental Constraints –– Vacancy Rates
                  As previously discussed, the residential vacancy rate is a good indicator of the
                  balance between housing supply and demand in a community. When the
                  demand for housing exceeds the available supply, the vacancy rate will be low.
                  However, a low vacancy rate sometimes drives the cost of housing upward and
                  increases tolerance for substandard units. In a healthy market, the vacancy rate
                  is between five and eight percent. If the vacant units are distributed across a
                  variety of housing types, sizes, price ranges, and locations throughout the City,
                  there should be an adequate selection for all income levels.
                  According to the State Department of Finance, Corning's vacancy rate for all
                  types of housing units has fluctuated between 7.33 and 7.37 percent since 1999
                  through 2009. The 2000 Census identified vacancy rental rates to be 5.31
                  percent of the total vacant units. The 7.33 through 7.37 vacancy rates are just
                  within the range of desired minimum vacancy rates. Therefore, vacancy rates
                  are not considered to be a market constraint on the supply of housing in the City;
                  however, any slight increase in the vacancy rate will place the City in a position
                  where the vacancy rate may be a constraint to residential development,
City of Corning Housing Element                                         III-15                             October 15, 2009

                      particularly multi-family rental housing development which provides housing
                      opportunity to Very Low and Low income households. Multi-family housing
                      developers wish to keep vacancy rates as low a possible. High vacancy rates
                      will disuade additional mulit-family rental housing from being developed since the
                      need is already being met.
                      6. Non-govenmental Constraints – Environmental Issues
                      As previously noted, the City of Corning (City), California is a rural agricultural
                      community situated 25 miles northwest of Chico and 17 miles south of Red Bluff
                      in south central Tehama County. The physical layout of the City which is mainly
                      a grid street pattern9 was established in 1878, when the town named Scatterville,
                      later Riceville, was built. In 1882, the town of Corning was established and
                      merged with Riceville. Since that time, the City and adjacent agricultural areas
                      have seen a slow to moderate increase in population growth.
                      Active earthquake faults can be found throughout California; however the City is
                      located in an area that is considered to be relatively free of seismic hazards in
                      the immediate vicinity. The most significant seismic activity that can be
                      anticipated in the area is ground shaking generated by seismic events on distant
                      faults. The closest of which is the Elder Creek Fault, which lies approximately five
                      miles to the southwest. There is no evidence of a “potentially active fault,”
                      located in the area, which could result in significant damage to structures and
                      associated infrastructure.
                      Noise exposure at the available housing sites in the City can be considered a
                      potential constraint to the development of residential housing. There is an active,
                      municipal airport in the northern central portion of the City; however the traffic
                      patterns of the airport are designed to avoid flying over the city limits. Also
                      extending within the western edge of the City is I-5 which is a major source of
                      ambient noise. Trains are another major source of ambient noise that may act as
                      a constraint to housing development since California Northern Railroad (CNFR)
                      has a rail line running in a north-south direction through the central part of the
                      City. CFNR interchanges with the Union Pacific Railroad and provides daily and
                      scheduled service for major commodities which are food related being tomato
                      products, olives, rice, cheese, frozen foods, beer, wine and wheat with some
                      stone, petroleum products, and chemicals. However, service is not as frequent
                      as Union Pacific which also accommodates passenger service via AMTRAC.
                      Adherence to Uniform Building Code requirements for acceptable interior noise
                      thresholds and the utilization of noise attenuation mechanisms such as building
                      siting and berm/solid wall construction will minimize noise impacts to acceptable
                      levels.
                      The undeveloped, general planned and residentially zoned land in the City will be
                      unable to adequately meet local housing needs over the next five years and
                      existing vacant lands within the City will need to be redesignated and reclassified
                      to residential uses and also higher residential densities. However, many of these
                      vacant sites are infill sites with direct access to infrastructure and with minimal
                      natural resource environmental constraints from cultural resource, biological and
                      wetland resources. Due to the relatively level topography of these existing sites,
9
  This is due to the relatively level topography within the current City limits. Topographic changes begin to occur in the eastern and
   northeastern portions of the City.

                  erosion and in turn, water quality issues are minimized with adequate use of Best
                  Management Practices (BMPs).
                  Those areas proposed for annexation are located in areas adjacent to the City
                  that have access to adequate infrastructure to meet the need of new residential
                  development. Contained within are large parcels that, with the installation of the
                  proper infrastructure, will be able to not only support the projected population of
                  the City for many years to come, but will also assist in meeting affordable
                  housing needs, in particular for Very Low and Low income households. Potential
                  environmental issues are either relatively minor or can be readily mitigated and
                  do not result is a constraint to the development of housing in the City.
         C.       GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
         There are a number of ways in which governmental action, or inaction, can inhibit the
         production of housing and/or increase its cost. Many types of governmental constraints,
         such as the control of the supply of money and mortgage rates or State and Federal
         environmental laws, are out of the hands of local governments. Local governments
         control many processes which can affect the cost of housing directly (infrastructure
         improvements, development fees, etc.) or indirectly (application processing time, land
         use controls, etc.). Housing element law requires the analysis of governmental
         constraints which include land use controls, building codes and their enforcement, site
         improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and the local
         processing and permit process. Each potential constraint and its effect on housing are
         discussed below.
                  1. Governmental Constraints – Land Use Controls and Development
                      Standards
                  The Land Use Element of the General Plan sets forth the City's policies for
                  guiding local development which together with existing zoning, establish the
                  amount and distribution of permitted land uses within each zone, and sets forth
                  development standards with which the permitted land uses must comply. The
                  General Plan Land Use Element objective is to promote the best use of land
                  through protection of desirable existing uses, orderly development, and
                  consideration of the City’s future needs. Residential development is permitted in
                  accordance with the Zoning Ordinance, under the districts shown in Table III-10.
                  The City’s residential on-site development standards are less restrictive than all
                  surrounding communities, except for the front and side yard requirements of the
                  City of Tehama. Furthermore, the City of Corning allows higher densities for
                  comparable zoning classifications.
                  The City's residential off-site development standards are not overly or
                  unnecessarily restrictive, when compared to surrounding communities. The low
                  to high density standards are slightly lower than those found in select
                  surrounding communities and are not so onerous as to be considered a
                  constraint on the development of housing.

        Minimum lot size of one acre.
     10
        An additional 5 feet shall be required for each story over the first story of any building.
     11
        An additional 5 feet shall be required for each story over the first story of any building. Distances between main buildings on
        the same lot is 10 feet. Depending on the arrangement of buidlings, other side yard distance requirements are applicable
        per Section 17.60.030.G.
     12
        Three feet added to each side yard for each story abouve the first story of any building. Side yard on the street side of each
        corner lot shall not less than 10 feet. A 20 foot minimum side yard is requred where a two-story residencial structure abuts
        the rear yard of a single family lot.
                     Since the City of Corning’s development standards are not more restrictive than
                     those of the surrounding communities, they will not inhibit the development of a
                     range of housing types within the City. Furthermore, through the use of tools
                     such as Specific Plans and Planned Unit Development Ordinances, the City
                     encourages innovative planning design that, among other benefits, may translate
                     into lower housing costs as exemplified by Salado Orchards.
                     Housing supply and cost is greatly affected by the amount of available vacant
                     land designated for residential use and the density at which development is
                     permitted. As noted in Table III-2 there are approximately 133 acres of vacant
                     residentially zoned lands capable of supporting an additional 659 dwelling units.
                     Table III-4 identifies another 129 acres of approved residential projects yielding
                     548 units. Recommended in Table III-5 are the general plan amendments and/or
                     rezoning for approximately 187 acres within the City which could generate 1,199
                     dwelling units. Cumulatively there exists the potential for an additional 2,406
                     residential dwelling units within the City.
City of Corning Housing Element                                   III-18                                            October 15, 2009

                  Whereas, the City currently has a “density bonus” provision ordinance for the
                  development of affordable housing, it will need to be amended to bring it into
                  compliance with SB 1818. The State enacted significant changes to the state's
                  density bonus law, which went into effect on January 1, 2005.
                  The number of affordable units that a developer must provide in order to receive
                  a density bonus is significantly reduced from prior law. If at least 5% of the units
                  are affordable to Very Low income households or 10% of the units are affordable
                  to Low income households, then the project is eligible for a 20% density bonus.
                  If 10% of condominium or planned development units are affordable to Moderate
                  income households, then the project is eligible to receive a 5% density bonus. In
                  addition, there is a sliding scale that requires:
                      •    an additional 2.5% density bonus for each additional increase of 1% Very
                           Low income units above the initial 5% threshold;
                      •    a density increase of 1.5% for each additional 1% increase in Low income
                           units above the initial 10% threshold; and
                      •    a 1% density increase for each 1% increase in Moderate income units
                           above the initial 10% threshold.
                  These bonuses reach a maximum density bonus of 35% when a project provides
                  either 11% Very Low income units, 20% Low income units, or 40% Moderate
                  income units.
                  The continued affordability requirements for Very Low and Low income units
                  have not changed.            However, the requirements for Moderate income
                  condominium units have changed significantly. The new law specifies that the
                  city must insure that the initial occupants of Moderate income units meet the
                  income qualifications. However, upon resale of the units the seller retains the
                  down payment, the value of any improvements, and the seller's proportionate
                  share of appreciation. The city recaptures its proportionate share of appreciation
                  and those funds must be used within three years to promote Lower or Moderate
                  income home ownership.
                  Cities must grant more "concessions or incentives" reducing development
                  standards, depending on the percentage of affordable units provided.
                  "Concessions and incentives" include reductions in zoning standards, other
                  development standards, design requirements, mixed use zoning, and any other
                  incentive that would reduce costs for the developer. Any project that meets the
                  minimum criteria for a density bonus is entitled to one concession from the local
                  government agency, increasing up to a maximum of three concessions
                  depending upon the amount of affordable housing provided.
                  A city may not impose a "development standard" that makes it infeasible to
                  construct the housing development with the proposed density bonus. In addition
                  to requesting "incentives and concessions," applicants may request the waiver of
                  an unlimited number of "development standards" by showing that the waivers are
                  needed to make the project economically feasible. The bill defines "development
                  standards" as "site or construction conditions."
                  Additional density is available to projects that donate land for residential use. The
                  land must satisfy all of the following requirements:

                         a) Have the appropriate general plan designation and zoning to permit
                             construction of units affordable to Very Low income households in an
                             amount not less than 10% of the units in the residential development;
                         b) Be at least one acre in size or of sufficient size to permit development of
                             at least 40 units; and,
                         c) Be served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure.
                    If a project qualifies for a density bonus, the developer may request (and the City
                    must grant) new parking standards for the entire development project. The new
                    standards are:
                         •   zero to one bedroom – one on-site parking space
                         •   two to three bedrooms – two onsite parking spaces
                         •   four or more bedrooms – two and one-half on-site parking spaces.
                    These numbers are inclusive of guest parking and handicapped parking and may
                    be tandem or uncovered (but cannot be on-street). The parking standards may
                    be requested even if no density bonus is requested.
                    The City currently allows second units in compliance with AB 1866 (Chapter
                    1062, Statutes of 2002) as a means to achieve higher densities and meet
                    affordable housing needs. Second-units (i.e., in-law apartments, granny flats, or
                    accessory apartments) provide an important source of affordable housing. By
                    promoting the development of second-units, a community may ease a rental
                    housing deficit, maximize limited land resources and existing infrastructure, and
                    assist low and moderate-income homeowners with supplemental income.
                    Second-units can increase the property tax base and contribute to the local
                    affordable housing stock. Local governments may allow for the creation of
                    second-units in residential zones, set development standards (i.e., height,
                    setbacks, lot coverage), require minimum unit sizes and establish parking
                    requirements.
                    However, review of the current City Ordinance reveals that no specific “second
                    unit” ordinance was developed and adopted. A section in the Zoning Code
                    defines “Granny housing” as a studio or one-bedroom dwelling unit, containing
                    no more than six hundred forty square feet, to be used for occupancy of family
                    members. The definition then proceeds to discuss how the unit: “must be place
                    on a lot in the R-1 district; can be attached to the main dwelling or detached;
                    occupants are to be 60 years of age or more, or handicapped, and no more than
                    two persons; if occupants are husband and wife, only one of them needs to be 60
                    years of age or older; a separate off-street parking space, which may be
                    uncovered, is provided; the unit is constructed in compliance with city and
                    building codes; and the unit shall provide complete, independent living facilities
                    for the one or two persons.”10
                    Chapter 17.10 which discusses the R-1 Single Family Residence District does
                    not make any reference to, or incorporates, the “Granny housing” definition in the
                    District. The City needs to clarify the second unit provisions of the Government
                    Code in order to provide clear and concise direction to property owners wishing
                    to construct a second unit. The City cannot adopt an adopt an ordinance which
10
   Section 17.06.260. Page 195. August 1994. City of Corning Zoning.
City of Corning Housing Element                                      III-20             October 15, 2009

                       totally precludes second units within single-family or multifamily zoned areas
                       unless the ordinance contains findings acknowledging that the ordinance may
                       limit housing opportunities of the region and further contains findings that specific
                       adverse impacts on the public health, safety, and welfare that would result from
                       allowing second units within single-family and multifamily zoned areas justify
                       adopting the ordinance.
                       Government Code Section 65852.2(a)(3) requires that when a local agency has
                       a local ordinance, an application for a second-unit permit is to be considered
                       ministerially without discretionary review or public hearing on or after July 1,
                       2003. “Ministerial” is a governmental decision involving little or no personal
                       judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the
                       project. The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but
                       uses no special discretion or judgment in reaching a decision. A ministerial
                       decision involves only the use of fixed standards or objective measurements, and
                       the public official cannot use personal, subjective judgment in deciding whether
                       or how the project should be carried out. Common examples of ministerial
                       permits include automobile registrations, dog licenses, and marriage licenses. A
                       building permit is ministerial if the ordinance requiring the permit limits the public
                       official to determining whether the zoning allows the structure to be built in the
                       requested location, the structure would meet the strength requirements in the
                       Uniform Building Code, and the applicant has paid his fee.11
                       2. Governmental Constraints – Building Codes and Enforcement
                       Building codes serve an important role by preventing the construction of unsafe
                       or substandard housing units. They also can ensure that requirements, such as
                       those associated with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, are
                       implemented in order to provide units for special needs group. However, building
                       codes and code enforcement do add to the cost of housing, and excessive
                       requirements can be a constraint to housing development.
                       The City has adopted the Model Codes consisting of the Uniform Building Code
                       (UBC), Uniform Housing Code, Uniform Code for the Abatement of Dangerous
                       Buildings, Uniform Fire Code, Uniform Mechanical Code, Uniform Plumbing
                       Code, and the National Electric Code. The UBC is designed to ensure both the
                       structural integrity of all buildings and the safety of their occupants. The Uniform
                       Housing Code, on the other hand, provides requirements for the conservation
                       and rehabilitation of homes and is used to abate substandard property which
                       endangers the health, property, safety, or welfare of the public or its occupants.
                       “Abatement” means and includes, but is not limited to, demolition, removal,
                       repair, vacation, maintenance, construction, replacement, reconditioning of
                       structures, buildings, appliances or equipment; and to the correction or
                       elimination of any substandard condition upon substandard property.12
                       The City Code vests building and housing code enforcement duties on the
                       Building Official. The Building Official upon referral from the Fire, Public Works
                       or Planning Departments, is responsible for the initial identification of and contact
                       with persons suspected to be in violation of any provisions of the building or
                       housing codes. In the past, there has been no systematic enforcement of
                       building codes in the City. Existing units were inspected either when complaints

   As defined in the 1997 Uniform Housing Code

                  were received by the Building Official or when an owner sought a permit for
                  additional construction.                 Building and Housing Code enforcement is not
                  considered a significant constraint to housing development. However, a housing
                  rehabilitation program is an identified need to not only provide safe and sanitary
                  housing but provide additional housing opportunities for Very Low and Low
                  income households. Utilization of the Uniform Housing Code will be utilized to
                  identify necessary improvements.
                  3. Governmental Constraints – Development and Construction Fees
                  Development and construction fees can be divided into two categories, a project
                  requiring land development entitlements in order to create building sites, or just
                  the issuance of building permit(s) on an already existing parcel. The land
                  development project will eventually require building permits to, thereby subject to
                  all the fees. Table III-11 identifies fees associated with entitlements.

                     Application is subject to the environmental review fee. However, a tentative parcel map encompassing less
                    than five acres may be Categorically Exempt under CEQA. If this were to occur, the environmental review fee
                    for a Categorical Exemption would be the environmental fee charged.
                  2
                    Excess staff costs may be charged for applications where processing time significantly exceeds the customary
                    processing time for similar applications or for staff time processing applications other than those shown on the
                    schedule.

                    SB 1535 imposed this fee in 2006 and requires Fish and Game to revise it annually on January 1 to reflect the
                    permitted increase by law. A County fee is also imposed to process the Fish and Game fee.

                  parcels are to be created, or if an apartment project is proposed on an individual
                  parcel, entitlement application processing fees are imposed. The amount of the
                  fees is dependent on the complexity of the project which could range from a site

                  requiring a general plan amendment, rezone, and tentative subdivision map
                  where the preparation of a California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
                  environmental impact report (EIR) is required to only splitting a parcel into two
                  lots where all that is required is a tentative parcel map application and a CEQA
                  categorical exemption. As an example, assume a 25 acre parcel being
                  subdivided into 120 parcels where a general plan amendment, rezone, and EIR
                  are required due to potential traffic and wetland issues. In addition, due to the
                  complexity of the project, 80 hours of staff time will be required. The cost for
                  such an application is identified in Table III-12. However, if just a parcel map
                  were proposed dividing one lot into two, Table III-13 identifies those fees.

                  The entitlement process cost to create one residential lot is $199.24 and $570 to
                  create the two lots. Not factored in are the engineering and surveying costs
                  associated with the 120 lot entitlement, however, the point being made is that
                  entitlement processing fees are not a constraint to the development of parcels
                  for affordable housing in the City. This is very strongly evidenced when
                  compared to some of the entitlement fees imposed by the City of Red Bluff and
                  Tehama County as identified in Table III-14. The City entitlement process fees
                  are significantly less.

                        SB 1473 imposes a fee that began on January 1, 2009, where cities and counties must collect, on behalf of
                        the California Building Standards Commission a fee based on building valuation to fund development of
                        statewide building standards. The fee is four dollars ($4.00) per every hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) in
                        building valuation. Cities and counties may retain up to ten % (10%) of the fee to cover related administrative
                        costs and for code enforcement education.

                         Properly titled the Strong Motion Instrumentation and Seismic Hazard Fee, this fee based on building valuation
                        was created by the State of California/Division of Mines and Geology offsets the cost of installing expensive
                        seismic detection equipment and maintaining research projects within the state. Every jurisdiction in California
                        participates. The fee is based

                         The school impact fee of $2.97 per square feet, which can be adjusted annually, is paid to the Tehama County
                        Department of Education. A building permit cannot be issued to the contractor without a receipt showing that
                        the fee has been paid.
                      Tables III-16 and III-17 reflect that the cost to obtain a building permit for an
                      approximate 1,440 square foot, two bath home with a two car garage is
                      approximately $19,250.13 The fees for a duplex unit would total $32,920 or
                      $16,460 per dwelling unit. Based on a construction cost of $90 to $102 per foot,
                      the 1,440 square foot home would cost approximately $129,600 to $146,880 to
                      construct. Adding a land cost of $35,000 to $85,000 plus the fees would result in
                      a total cost of approximately $183,900 to $251,100.
                      The 2,200 square foot duplex would cost approximately $265,900 to $342,300,
                      or $132,950 to $171,160 per dwelling unit. Granted that the amount of square
                      footage is 340 square feet less than the single family residence and has a one
                      car garage instead of a two car garage, the duplex dwelling unit is about $51,000
                      to $80,000 less than the cost for a single family home.

   It needs to be recognized that $3,090 of the fee, or 16 percent , is paid to the school district.

                  Initially $19,250 in building permit fees may appear to be high and potentially a
                  constraint. However, when considering land costs, building costs, and building
                  permit fees, the fees for a single family residence reflect 10.5 percent to 7.7
                  percent of the cost and 12.4 to 9.6 percent of the cost for a single duplex
                  residence.           This percentage is not a significant constraint.                             Land and
                  construction costs are more of a constraint. Land costs could range from 19
                  ($35,000 lot cost) to 36 percent of the total housing cost ($85,000 lot cost) and
                  construction costs could range from 58 to 70 percent of the total housing cost.

                  4. Governmental            Constraints         –    Development            Permit       and     Approval
                       Processing
                  The development review and permitting process is utilized to receive, evaluate
                  and consider approval of new development applications. This process ensures
                  that new residential developments reflect the goals and policies of the City’s
                  General Plan and meet the requirements of the City’s Zoning Code.
                  Applications are made in writing to the City’s Planning Department.
                  Applications vary depending on the type of permit being requested. In addition,
                  some planning applications require public hearings, such as conditional use
                  permits, general plan amendments, rezones, and tentative subdivision maps.
                  Table III-18 lists typical review times for various planning actions.
                  Determination of approval is usually based on consistency with the General
                  Plan, character of adjacent land uses, adequate size and shape of lots, zoning
                  compliance and conformance with land division standards.                                        Although
                  application review and approval adds time to the development process, the
                  review periods listed in Table III-18 are consistent with typical review periods in
                  other jurisdictions. In fact, in many cases the City review period is less than
                  that of other jurisdictions. If a general plan amendment, zone change and
                  subdivision tract map were processed concurrently for a residential project, all
                  of those entitlements could be obtained over a four to five month processing
                  period, provided the application is complete.                              Moreover, unlike other
                  jurisdictions, the City does not have a design review process that would add
                  more time to project application review. Therefore, development application
                  procedures are not considered a significant constraint on housing development.

                  Note: General Plan Amendments and/or Zone Changes can be undertaken concurrently with a Subdivision
                  Tract Map or Parcel Map. The longest time period normally prevails plus an additional month depending on the
                  complexity of the project.
                  Larger development projects, such as residential subdivisions and multifamily
                  housing complexes, may be subject to the California Environmental Quality Act
                  (CEQA). Projects subject to CEQA require the preparation of an environmental
                  document, such as an environmental impact report (EIR) or negative declaration,
                  before a project can be approved. Smaller projects also may be subject to the
                  CEQA process if special environmental circumstances are found. The
                  requirement to prepare an environmental document can substantially lengthen
                  the development review process. If an EIR must be prepared, project approval
                  may be extended up to one year. State environmental law mandates much of
                  the time required in the environmental review process. Also, the environmental

                   review process requires public participation. This typically includes a public
                   review and comment period for environmental documents and at least one public
                   hearing for certification of the environmental document, which can add time to
                   the process.
                   5. Governmental Constraints – Housing For Persons With Disabilities
                   Under Senate Bill (SB) 520, which became effective January 1, 2002, a Housing
                   Element is required to analyze potential and actual constraints upon the
                   development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with
                   disabilities and to demonstrate local efforts to remove governmental constraints
                   that hinder the locality from meeting the need for housing for persons with
                   disabilities (California Government Code Section 65583(a)(4)). The City must
                   also demonstrate efforts to remove constraints or provide reasonable
                   accommodations for housing designed for persons with disabilities. As defined
                   under the Federal Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and California’s Fair
                   Employment and Housing Act, a disabled person, is a person who has a physical
                   or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities, anyone who is
                   regarded as having that type of impairment or, anyone who has a record of that
                   type of impairment.
                   The City has proposed policies and programs to comply with State requirements.
                   In addition, the City proposes reviewing not only the zoning ordinance, but also
                   land use policies, permit practices, and building codes to comply with State and
                   fair housing laws. As an example, the City currently limits the use of granny
                   housing to be use for occupancy of family members. However, there is no
                   definition of family. Utilizing guidance from HCD Staff, family will be defined as
                   “one or more persons living together in a dwelling unit, with common access to,
                   and common use of all living, kitchen, and eating areas within the dwelling unit.”
                   This definition of family does not limit the number of persons occupying housing
                   or distinguishes between related and unrelated persons.
                   Table III-19 identifies potential constraints on housing for persons with disabilities.
                   The first column identifies the constraints in the form of questions. The second
                   column discusses if and how the constraints are dealt with and if the City needs to
                   modify their current efforts and/or undertake evaluations to establish additional
                   policies and/or programs to address the constraints. Other than some minor
                   clarifications in the zoning code, there are no constraints on the development,
                   maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities in the City
                   of Corning.

                                                       comment to City staff during normal working hours. These
                                                       comments are included in the Staff reports to the Planning
                                                       Commission, and if necessary, the City Council. Both bodies
                                                       accept and consider public written and oral comments in their
                                                       deliberations for entitlement approvals, such as a use permit.

                    6. Governmental Constraints – Services and Facilities
                    Before a development permit is granted, it must be determined that public
                    services and facility systems are adequate to accommodate any increased
                    demand generated by a proposed project.                             Costs associated with site
                    improvements are an important component of new residential development
                    costs. Site improvements costs are applied to provide sanitary sewer, water
                    service and other infrastructure for the project. In addition, the City may require
                    the payment for various offsite improvements as part of project mitigation
                    measures (e.g., payment towards an offsite traffic signal). Developers of new
                    residential projects are also required to construct all onsite streets, sidewalks,
                    curb, gutter and affected portions of offsite arterials.
                    The ensuing evaluation of specific public services and facilities provides
                    information regarding their adequacy. The evaluation clearly identifies that there
                    is sufficient water and wastewater treatment capacity, in addition to other
                    services and facilities, necessary for the development of affordable housing, in
                    particular for Low and Lower income households.14
                    Wastewater Collection and Treatment – The wastewater (sewer) system is a
                    closed sanitary sewer system that collects wastewater from all City residents
                    and businesses and transports it to the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP)
                    southeast of the City. The sewer collection system is composed largely of lines
                    measuring six or eight inches in diameter that extend down the centerline of City
                    streets.
                    The City’s original sewer system was constructed over 85 years ago, eliminating
                    the problem of mixed sewer collection and septic tank systems in the City.

   The majority of the information is derived from the 2005 Municipal Service Review of the City of Corning, Tehama County,
   California.
City of Corning Housing Element                                         III-29                            October 15, 2009

                  Corning has been proactive in maintaining its sewer system – it replaced the
                  majority of the old sewer lines between 1997 and 2000 to avoid costly repairs
                  and replacements in the future, and in anticipation of growth. This also reduced
                  problems with infiltration and inflow. The funding for the replacement project
                  came from a Farm Home Loan, and the project was carried out in three stages.
                  In all, approximately 35,700 linear feet of sewer lines were replaced at a cost of
                  $3,070,000.
                  A number of future capital improvements are also needed that include the
                  extension of sewer main lines, improvements to the lift stations, and future sewer
                  expansion engineering. The sewer collection system is composed largely of
                  lines measuring six or eight inches in diameter. While these lines appear to be
                  suitable to the current City population, increased flows may require the
                  replacement with larger diameter collector and trunk lines to serve new areas.
                  The proximity of existing sewer lines to future annexations varies by location. In
                  some areas, the existing system is in close proximity – between 200 and 1,500
                  feet. Other areas face challenges in connecting to the system, largely due to
                  changes in topography and sheer distance. These areas may require the
                  construction of new lines and lift (pump) stations to raise the wastewater to a
                  higher elevation to continue gravity flow at an acceptable slope and depth.
                  In anticipation of the growth and development within the SOI, the City prepared
                  estimates for design and construction of new trunk sewer and water mains in the
                  northwest and southwest areas of Corning. Current projections indicate that the
                  northwestern area of Corning (Blackburn Avenue to Gallagher and I-5 to
                  Highway 99-W) will require $622,000 for sewer improvements.                     The
                  southwestern area (Fig Lane to Viola Avenue, and I-5 to the Northern Pacific
                  Railroad) will need $2,542,500 in funding according to the 2005 Northwest and
                  Southwest Corning Area Drainage Study and Assessment of Related Water,
                  Sewer, and Street Needs. The sources of funding for these projects will include
                  impact and annexation fees.
                  The City’s Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) is situated between Corning
                  and Sacramento River off Gardiner Ferry Road, approximately 3.5 miles east of
                  the City. The WWTP is operated privately under contract with the City to
                  maintain the sewer collection system and coordinate with the Regional Water
                  Quality Control Board (RWQCB) and Air Resources Board. The facility is
                  permitted by the RWQCB to discharge up to 1.75 million gallons per day (mgd),
                  but has a capacity of 1.0 mgd. The WWTP was expanded to a capacity of 1.4
                  mgd (1,818 additional homes/220 gpd per home/450 acres) in 2005 and funded
                  by a Rural Farm Home loan and new sewer rates and connection fees.
                  Assuming that future development of the City results in approximately 24,300
                  new residents, this population in addition to the existing population of 7,000,
                  yields an estimated future population of 31,300 which is equivalent to
                  approximately 11,300 households. At a rate of 220 gpd per household, the
                  WWTP will expect to receive 2.5 mgd. The City will be required to expand the
                  WWTP by 1.1 mgd again in the future.
                  Water Service – The City supplies domestic water to residents located within the
                  City limits. City water originates from ten well locations, which consist of deep
City of Corning Housing Element                            III-30                   October 15, 2009

                  well turbine pumps that pump ground water from the deep, unconfined aquifer
                  located beneath the City. Water quality is generally good, but three additional
                  wells remain off line due to detected or imminent contamination by
                  Tetrachloroethylene (TCE) or Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE). The Regional
                  Water Quality Control Board is currently monitoring the contamination and is
                  facilitating remediation.
                  In 1994, 1,863 connections to the water distribution system were present in the
                  City. This is composed of 1,631 residential, 212 commercial, 5 industrial, and 15
                  public authority connections. All connections are operated on a metered rate
                  system, and all agricultural irrigation water is provided from outside sources. In
                  1994, there were approximately 23 miles of water mains (121,200 linear feet) and
                  two water storage tanks to equalize pressure: one 100,000 gallon tank at Third
                  and Butte streets and a second 5,000 tank supplying the South Avenue area.
                  Water lines in the City are typically 8 inches in diameter, with a range from 4 to
                  15 inches.
                  All residential and commercial water service customers in the City are metered
                  for water use. These fees fund the operation and maintenance of the water
                  system. New development is subject to payment of impact fees that will be used
                  to provide new wells to supplement the public water system.
                  Currently, the water distribution lines maintained by the City do not extend
                  beyond the City limits into the areas proposed for future annexation. Distance
                  varies from 200 feet to 0.25 mile. Future developments will be required to extend
                  water lines and loop the distribution system whenever feasible to provide
                  required fire flows and minimize dead end water lines. According to the 20 year
                  plan, the City will need to add nine new well sites, to be acquired during the
                  subdivision process. Developers will also be required to dedicate land for future
                  well sites, and may be required to construct new wells, pumps, controls, and
                  other appurtenances to City standards.            Additionally, while current City
                  distribution lines are currently adequate in size, they often do not have the
                  capacity or standards required to support future development. Some water lines
                  may need to be replaced completely with larger pipes in order to serve residents
                  in the expanded sphere. The cost of these improvements related to increased
                  development will be borne upon the developers through impact fees or required
                  construction or replacement of facilities. Master drainage, wastewater collection
                  and roadway system plans will be needed to efficiently handle additional
                  development surrounding the existing city.
                  Storm Water Drainage – If the City has one significant infrastructure constraint
                  that is readily identified, it is the storm drainage system. The City uses a
                  combination of underground pipes and surface channels to drain storm water
                  from improved areas of the City. The main surface channel is the Blackburn–
                  Moon Drainage Ditch, which is a highly modified natural channel. It is used to
                  collect storm water drainage and direct it out to the WWTP for eventual discharge
                  to the Sacramento River. Jewett Creek is a perennial stream that originates west
                  of Corning and flows though the southern portion of the City. It receives some
                  surface drainage from less intensely developed portions of the City. In the late
                  1980s, it was planned as a major collector of storm water drainage from the
                  southern portions of the City.
City of Corning Housing Element                            III-31                    October 15, 2009

                  The drainage inside the City is problematic because of the flat topography of the
                  area. An expansion of the storm water system will actually improve the current
                  drainage situation because it will allow surface runoff to flow away from the City.
                  Onsite detention facilities are standard for commercial developments. The
                  current standard for detention is to meet the needs of a 25-year storm for a
                  period of four hours. These standards are currently being met; however, the two
                  regions of concern for the City are between the City and the Sacramento River,
                  and just west of Corning in the Red Hills area. The City needs to revisit the
                  concept of a Master Drainage Plan to reduce loads on the City’s WWTP and to
                  more efficiently handle drainage. The City is currently studying the issue of
                  storm water system improvements between Gallagher and North Street, across
                  to SR 99W.
                  Significant problems will be generated as more development occurs in the
                  northeastern portion of the City. In this location, there is more variation in
                  topography, and access to the Blackburn-Moon Ditch will require lift stations for
                  storm water flows. The City needs to develop a policy of onsite detention and
                  retention, especially on projects with ten or more homes. The outfall line to the
                  Sacramento River will either need to be increased in size, or a second parallel
                  outfall line constructed added to handle the increased amounts of treated
                  effluent.
                  Streets – The circulation system consists of a combination of City roadways,
                  connecting County streets, and State and Federal highways. The City, alone,
                  has a total of 33.3 miles (68.4 lane miles) of maintained roads. Of those, 46
                  percent have deficient pavement conditions, 23 percent are in poor condition,
                  and the remaining roads are in good condition.
                  The General Plan projected that traffic will increase at all intersections and
                  roadways within Corning at maximum build-out. The only intersection or
                  roadway that falls below the LOS C is the South Avenue and 99W area. Part of
                  the reason is the high volume of heavy truck traffic and projected future
                  automobile and truck as development increases along the 99W corridor.
                  The City has identified improvements intended to accommodate projected traffic
                  volumes and help maintain the City’s level of service (LOS) policy. Included in
                  the recently completed street projects are miscellaneous asphalt repairs in the
                  northwestern portion of the City, ongoing street patching caused by rain damage,
                  and street sweeping by Corning Disposal under a Franchise Agreement.
                  City and County pavement has suffered from years of funding shortfalls for
                  maintenance and rehabilitation. At least 900 (38 percent) of the 2,400 lane miles
                  of streets and roads maintained by Tehama County are deficient and need
                  rehabilitation. In addition, some of the right of way widths are only 40 feet, which
                  is less than the minimum 60-feet width city requirement. These substandard
                  streets must be reconstructed and brought up to City standards when the
                  properties adjacent to the roads are developed. The cost of this improvement
                  will be borne by the developers of the adjacent land.
                  The necessary rehabilitation of roads that the City will be acquiring through
                  annexations within the SOI will be funded, in part, by the new development.
                  Developers are currently responsible for full improvements of the lane adjoining
                  the project and one-half of the adjacent lane. There are currently no funds for
City of Corning Housing Element                             III-32                   October 15, 2009

                  the roads to be connected to the existing roadways between improved areas.
                  Some of these improvements will be funded by traffic impact fees.
                  According to the General Plan, the Planning Commission identified some overall
                  concerns and important issues for future development. These include: 1) the
                  need to protect future east-west and north-south right-of-ways for an efficient
                  circulation system; 2) residential driveway access to arterial roadways; 3) the
                  lack of access to land east of Union Pacific Railroad and west of the airport; 4)
                  the high accident rate at Toomes and Solano Street; 5) the traffic count program
                  initiated by the City; and 5) the need for a contiguous bicycle path system.
                  As the City annexes more County areas, the amount of substandard roads will
                  increase, more than doubling under the expanded SOI. As new properties
                  develop, the developers are required to provide street improvements, including at
                  least one half of a lane, curbs, gutter, and sidewalks. If development occurs in a
                  patchwork fashion across the City’s new SOI, this will result in a mix of poor and
                  substandard roads connected to improved roads in front of subdivisions.
                  Transportation Center – The City’s Transportation Facility is located on the
                  southeastern corner of Solano and Third Streets. The Transportation Center is
                  centrally located downtown to provide a convenient place for residents and
                  visitors using the TRAX Bus System. The complex is composed of a park and
                  ride lot and is currently being uses as the Corning Recration Department office.
                  An increase in population associated with an expanded SOI will simultaneously
                  increase the number of citzens using the Transportation Center. Because many
                  of the proposed developments will likely be filled by commuters in the outlying
                  communities, these new residents may not use the Transportation Center. The
                  City could promote a Ride-Share program to encourage commuters to use the
                  facility, which would also reduce congestion on City and County roads.
                  Parks – Existing City parks offer many recreational opportunities to residents of
                  and visitors to Corning, described above. Community involvement, business
                  donations, and agency cooperation have all been key elements in park
                  improvements and maintenance.             Community groups involved in recent
                  improvements include the Volunteer Park Improvement Committee, the Rotary
                  Club, the Exchange Club, the Lions Club, the Volunteer Fire Department,
                  Corning Little League, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Businesses have
                  donated materials for park improvements, and the California Division of Forestry
                  inmates from Salt Creek Camp have provided labor for several improvements.
                  The City currently owns and maintains six parks and a small plaza totaling
                  approximately 18 acres: Estil C. Clark Park, Woodson Park, Yost Park, Flournoy
                  Memorial Park, Children’s Memorial Park, North Side Park, and Martini Plaza.
                  Estil C. Clark Park is the largest city park. Facilities include a little league field, a
                  tee ball field, concession building and announcer’s booth, and bleachers.
                  Woodson Park contains a playground with equipment and picnic areas set within
                  shady olive trees. Yost Park includes a playground and a softball field with a
                  concession room, announcer’s booth, and roof canopy for the bleachers.
                  Flournoy Memorial Park is a small neighborhood park containing picnic areas
                  with tables and grills, a sprinkler system, and a playground area with wooden
                  equipment. Children’s Memorial Park contains a grassy area and playground.
City of Corning Housing Element                             III-33                        October 15, 2009

                  The metal playground equipment includes a swing set, moon climber, and a
                  slide. North Side Park features a Junior Olympic size swimming pool with a
                  smaller pool, a two-court lighted tennis court, playground area with equipment,
                  barbeques, a fenced play area including equipment for small children, water
                  fountains, a basketball court, and a sand-filled volleyball court. Martini Plaza is
                  the newest addition to the Corning parks system. This small downtown plaza
                  contains restrooms, picnic tables, and a water fountain.
                  Currently, parks are distributed across the City in a Northwest to Southeast
                  trending band. Park facilities are noticeably absent in several areas within the
                  existing City limits. The southwestern portion of the City lacks park facilities, but
                  this area is largely commercial. The west-central and south-central areas of the
                  City are also without nearby parks. These deficiencies will become more
                  pronounced with an expansion of the City limits.
                  Within the SOI, parks will be needed in the northeastern section of the City due
                  to high concentrations of new and proposed residential developments. The
                  addition of new park facilities could occur at a lower than anticipated cost to the
                  City under certain situations. For example, the City could raise development
                  impact fees or require dedication of lots as green space or small parks to serve
                  new developments. In addition, the City could enter into agreements with new
                  schools, built in response to increased growth, to have shared playground and
                  recreation facilities. A number of cities in the Northern Sacramento Valley take
                  advantage of such cooperatives to share the cost of maintaining park space.
                  Fire Protection – The City of Corning Fire Department provides fire protection
                  services and emergency medical services within a five-square mile area of the
                  City, including the business district, two shopping centers, and several large truck
                  stops. The Department is centrally headquartered in the City at 814 Fifth Street,
                  resulting in an average response time of three to five minutes. Backup services
                  for areas proposed for annexation to the City are provided by the Tehama
                  County Rural station, which has a three to five minute response time to the
                  outlying areas.
                  Insurance Services Office (ISO) ratings are used by insurance companies to
                  determine fire insurance rates. The rating takes into account the number of
                  firefighting personnel and equipment available to an area and the average
                  emergency response times. Ratings range from one through ten, with one
                  indicating excellent fire service and ten indicating minimal or no protection.
                  Based on its average response time for fire and medical emergencies, the Fire
                  Department’s current ISO rating is four.
                  The Department maintains a fleet of equipment in fair to excellent condition.
                  These include three pumpers (two with a capacity of 1,250 gallons per minute
                  (gpm) and one with an output of 1,500 gpm); two brush trucks; and a rescue
                  squad. The standard initial dispatch for a dwelling unit is two pumper trucks and
                  the rescue unit.
                  Police Protection – The Corning Police Department (CPD) provides continuous
                  law enforcement and emergency assistance services to areas located within the
                  City limits of Corning. The department also maintains a fleet of 14 vehicles,
                  including special duty vehicles (such as the Youth Programs van), two Citizens
                  on Patrol volunteer vehicles, one Community Service Officer/Animal Control
City of Corning Housing Element                             III-34                   October 15, 2009

                  vehicle, one K-9 vehicle, and one unmarked Detective vehicle. The CPD focuses
                  their efforts on several specific local problems, including narcotics and gang
                  activity. For example, in 2004, approximately 2,564 hours of CPD labor were
                  spent on narcotics, with an additional 200 hours per year for each officer
                  assigned to the Tehama County task force for gang activity.
                  Gas and Electricity – PG&E provides gas and electrical service. Currently, and
                  for the next ten years, there are no limitations placed on the construction of new
                  homes in the City due to insufficient gas and/or electricity supplies and/or
                  infrastructure.
                  School Facilities – With the assessment of school mitigation fees on all new
                  developments, the Corning Elementary and High School districts are collecting
                  funds that will maintain the level of service that is currently provided. Developers
                  are required to participate in a fee program that collects funds based on the
                  square footage for a project, at a rate of $2.14 per square foot. While this
                  constraint is not considered significant for market rate housing, it may be
                  significant to the production of affordable housing units.
         D.       ENERGY CONSERVATION
                  Energy-related costs could directly impact the affordability of housing in Tehama
                  County. Title 24 of the California Administrative Code sets forth mandatory
                  energy standards for new development and requires the adoption of an “energy
                  budget.” Subsequently, the housing industry must meet these standards and the
                  County is responsible for enforcing the energy conservation regulations.
                  Alternatives that are available to the housing industry to meet the energy
                  standards include, but are not limited to:
                      •    A passive solar approach that requires suitable solar orientation,
                           appropriate levels of thermal mass, south facing windows and moderate
                           insulation levels.
                      •    Higher levels of insulation than what is previously required, but not
                           requiring thermal mass or window orientation requirements.
                      •    Active solar water heating in exchange for less stringent insulation and/or
                           glazing requirements.
                  Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) provides electricity and natural gas
                  service to the City. PG&E is a privately owned utility whose service area covers
                  most of northern and central California. PG&E provides a variety of energy
                  conservation services for residents, as well as energy assistance programs for
                  lower income households to help lower income households to conserve energy
                  and control utility costs. These programs include the California Alternate Rates
                  for Energy (CARE) and the Relief for Energy Assistance through Community
                  Help (REACH) programs. The CARE program provides a 15 percent monthly
                  discount on gas and electric rates to households with qualified incomes, certain
                  non-profit organizations, homeless shelters, hospices and other qualified non-
                  profit group living facilities. The REACH program provides one-time energy
                  assistance to customers who have no other way to pay their energy bills. The
                  intent of REACH is to assist low-income households, particularly the elderly,
                  disabled, sick, working poor and the unemployed, who experience hardships and
                  are unable to pay for their necessary energy needs. PG&E has also sponsored

                   rebate programs that encourage customers to purchase more energy-efficient
                   appliances and heating and cooling systems.
                   The Self Help Home Improvement Program (SHHIP) manages a weatherization
                   program in Tehama County for lower-income households under contract with
                   PG&E, which also provides the funding. Eligible households may receive attic
                   insulation, caulking, door replacement and weather-stripping, and glass
                   replacement. The City shall actively pursue working with SHHIP and PG&E to
                   institute a weatherization program as previously identified.
                   HCD is encouraging the use of Energy Efficient/Green Building features as
                   identified in Table III-20. A new bonus category has been added to NOFA’s to
                   reward developers that use energy efficient products that will enhance new units.
                   Therefore, a new bonus opportunity has been developed. Applicants must self
                   certify that items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 13 are included in the units to be
                   constructed, and that at least two of the remaining items (1,8 and 9) will also be
                   included in the units to be constructed.
                   Additionally, appliances that are customarily provided with the units, such as hot
                   water heaters and dishwashers, or heating/cooling systems, should all meet the
                   ENERGY STAR® standards.

IV.      REVIEW OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
         Government Code Section 65588 requires that: “Each local government shall review its
         housing element as frequently as appropriate to evaluate all of the following: (1) The
         appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the
         attainment of the state housing goal. (2) The effectiveness of the housing element in
         attainment of the community's housing goals and objectives. (3) The progress of the
         city, county, or city and county in implementation of the housing element.” The review
         requires analysis in three areas as follows:
                  1. Effectiveness of the element – A description of the actual results or outcomes
                       of the prior housing element’s goals (i.e., what happened), objectives,
                       policies, and programs. The results should be quantified where possible
                       (e.g., number of units rehabilitated) and may be qualitative where necessary
                       (e.g., mitigation of governmental constraints).
                  2. Progress in implementation – For each program, the analysis should
                       compare significant differences between what was projected or planned in
                       the earlier element and what was achieved. The differences to determine
                       where the previous housing element met, exceeded, or fell short of what was
                       anticipated should be discussed.
                  3. Appropriateness of goals, objectives, policies and programs – A description
                       of what has been learned based on the analysis of progress and
                       effectiveness of the previous element. A description of how the goals,
                       objectives, policies, and programs in the updated element are being changed
                       or adjusted to incorporate what has been learned from the results of the
                       previous element.
         A.       OBJECTIVES
                  The objectives for the construction of new housing units contained in the
                  previous Housing Element were a direct reflection of the Regional Housing
                  Needs Allocation (RHNA) plan prepared for Tehama County by HCD pursuant to
                  Government Code Section 65584. The RHNA Plan identified a need for 4,511
                  new residential units in Tehama County over a 7.5-year period (January 1, 2001
                  to June 30, 2008). The need for 4,511 units was shared and distributed amongst
                  each of the communities in the County, with each community’s fair share
                  determined by its proportion of the County’s overall household population. Thus,
                  the City of Corning’s share of regional housing needs was 290 dwelling units or
                  about 38 units per year over the 7.5 year period.
         B.       RESULTS
                  As shown in Table IV-1, Policy HP-1, a total of 280 new housing units were
                  constructed in the City between 2001 and 2008, or approximately 37 units per
                  year. While detailed information regarding the income levels for the households
                  of each of the units is not readily available, based on the type of housing program
                  utilized, it has been estimated that 42 of these units were for Very Low income
                  households, 93 were for Low income persons, 73 were for the Moderate income
                  group, and 73 were for the Above Moderate income households.

                  The City was unable to quantify how many housing units were rehabilitated or
                  conserved so that they were affordable to Lower income households since no
                  program or tracking system was in place. Direct funding for Low income
                  households was primarily provided to 120 households by the HUD Section 8
                  Housing Choice Voucher program. However, rental assistance also came in the
                  form of rent limits established through participation by the City, non-profit
                  organizations, renters and/or owners of residential developments in the federal
                  and state housing programs primarily HUD’s HOME programs; USDA’s Section
                  515 program; and state and federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit programs
                  administered in the State of California by the California Tax Credit Allocation
                  Committee.
                  The total number of new housing units constructed in the City over the prior
                  planning period fell short by only 10 dwelling units of the total projected need.
                  However, the shortfall was in the availability of Above Moderate income housing.
                  Very Low and Low income housing was provided to 135 households, while the
                  objective was the construction of 102 units.
                  Many of the other objectives identified in Table IV-1 that were not met can be
                  partially attributable to City funding and staffing limitations. While the City has
                  been active in pursuing the use of State and Federal housing assistance
                  programs and obtaining funding, other programs such as establishment of a
                  housing rehabilitation program and other informational programs did not occur.
                  The City now has a full time Planning Director who will be able to monitor and in
                  some instances, assist in the implementation of the various policies and
                  programs proposed.
         C.       IMPLICATIONS FOR THE UPDATED HOUSING ELEMENT
                  In preparing the Updated Housing Element, the City re-examined the goals,
                  policies, programs, and objectives that give direction to the City’s housing efforts,
                  as well as the progress that has been made toward their attainment. The
                  housing goals that were adopted by the City Council were responsive to State
                  housing goals and many continue to reflect the desires and aspirations of the
                  community. Hence, through the adoption of this Updated Housing Element, the
                  City has reaffirmed its commitment to many of these goals, while augmenting the
                  supporting policies and addressing new housing laws passed after 2003.
                  Whereas, housing goals and policies for the City have been revised and also
                  expanded, the substance of these goals and policies as adopted by the City
                  Council on May 24, 2005 have not changed.
                  In establishing its current policies, implementation measures, and objectives, the
                  City once again considered its experience over the past five-year period. Based
                  on this experience, certain programs contained in the prior Housing Element
                  have been deleted or modified while new programs have been added. Some
                  programs that were not initiated, but are still pertinent, have been carried over
                  and will be implemented during the current planning period. Finally, since the
                  quantified objectives contained in this Housing Element are based, in many
                  cases, on more current empirical data they are therefore, more realistic and
                  attainable than those contained in the prior Housing Element.

V.       HOUSING GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
         A.       INTRODUCTION
         This section of the Housing Element sets forth the City's goals, policies, implementation
         measures, and quantified objectives relative to its previous and new identified housing
         needs. Goals are general statements of the desires and aspirations of the community
         with regard to the future supply of housing within the City and represent the ends to
         which housing efforts and resources are directed.         Policy statements provide well-
         defined guidelines for direction and decision-making. Objectives are more specific and,
         in many instances, quantified statements that gives guidance to and allow for later
         evaluation of housing actions.
         The proper basis for any plan of action is a well-integrated set of goals. The City Council
         adopted a series of formal housing goals in 2003. These goals have been retained and
         expanded, as necessary, in preparing this Updated Housing Element, while the
         supporting policies, implementation measures, and objectives have been revised and
         augmented as necessary.           The framework within which these goals, policies,
         implementation measures, and objectives are presented reflects the seven major issue
         areas identified in State law. As required, this section provides the following information
         to describe a program and how and when it will be implemented:
                  Overall Goals are sought to be attained by the community to address housing
                  needs.
                  Policies are necessary to guide the decisions to achieve the stated goals.
                  Policies provide an organizational framework to address the provision of
                  sufficient housing and programs to meet the needs of all City income groups.
                  Lead City Departments are responsible for measures to implement the identified
                  policies. These Implementation Measures are specific programs or actions to
                  address the results and analyses of the jurisdiction’s local housing needs,
                  available land and financial resources and the mitigation of identified
                  governmental and non-governmental constraints. It should be noted that the City
                  Department listed is expected to take some lead role towards implementing the
                  program based on direction from the City Council. Ultimate responsibility for
                  approving and directing all City implementation measures rests with the City
                  Council.
                  Potential Funding Sources are identified. The availability of funding resources is
                  often beyond the control of the City. If funding resources prove not to be
                  available, implementation of some programs and achievement of objectives will
                  not be feasible.
                  Quantified Objectives are measurements by which to determine if programs are
                  being implemented to address the identified policies and meet the identified
                  goals. Objectives will also estimate the number of units likely to be constructed,
                  rehabilitated or conserved/preserved during the planning period. The quantified
                  objectives often do not represent a ceiling on what is proposed to be
                  implemented or developed, but rather sets a target goal for the City to achieve
                  based on needs, resources and constraints.

                  The Time Frame identifies the period during which the particular program or
                  action is expected to be implemented, completed, or continued. Again, just as
                  the availability of funding resources are often beyond the control of the City, the
                  implementation of some programs and the associated time frame may often be
                  beyond the City’s control.
         B.       GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
         Table V-1 identifies the various goals, policies, implementation measures, potential
         funding sources, and objectives. The City Departments responsible for carrying out
         each action and the schedule for doing so are also indicated. However, due to the
         number of actions and differing time frames involved, a single individual should be
         charged with overseeing and coordinating the implementation of these actions. The
         Planning Director would be the appropriate individual to serve in this capacity. The
         Director will be required to document the results of his/her monitoring in the annual
         reports, which are filed with HCD. These reports are the official method of charting the
         progress made in implementing the City's housing program.
         Under the Time Frame in Table V-1 a priority number is assigned for the implementation
         of each policy given the foreseeable resources currently available and/or easily foreseen
         to be available to/or within the City. The priorities are defined as follows:
                  Priority 1 – P1
                  The policy can and should be able to be implemented during the Planning Period
                  and a commitment is made by the City to do so. The City does not need to rely
                  on the federal or state government, other agencies, non-profits, or organizations
                  to implement the policy. However, if state funding continues to be reduced
                  thereby requiring the City to continue to reduce staffing levels and resources,
                  implementation of the policy during the projected time frame, or during the entire
                  Planning Period becomes questionable.
                  Priority 2 – P2
                  The policy should be able to be implemented during the Planning Period
                  provided that resources become available to the City. The City will need to rely
                  on the federal or state government, other agencies, non-profits, or organizations
                  to provide resources and/or partner with the City. If the resources become
                  available and/or the partnerships can be formed, a commitment is made by the
                  City to implement the policy.
                  Priority 3 – P3
                  The policy may be implemented during the Planning Period; however, resources
                  and/or partnerships which may be currently available may not be so in the future
                  either at current levels or not at all. Whereas, it would be advantageous to
                  implement the policy, the ability to do so is beyond the City’s control and
                  resources.
         Table IV-2 provides a summary of the quantified objectives identified in Table IV-1.
         Table IV-2 estimates the number of dwelling units likely to be constructed, rehabilitated
         or conserved/preserved by household income level during the Planning Period. The
         quantified objectives do not represent a ceiling on development, but rather set a target
         goal for the City of Corning to achieve based on needs, resources and constraints.

City of Corning 2014-2034 General Plan Update ii                          September 8, 2015
I.        INTRODUCTION
          On May 24, 1994 the City Council adopted The Corning General Plan through Resolution 5-24-
          94-1 which superseded the 1981 General Plan. Subsequent to the adoption of the 1994 General
          Plan various major general plan updates and/or revisions occurred.
          The 1994 General Plan identified the area along the Highway 99W Corridor as being an area for
          potential growth and development in the City. The specific plan process was initiated in 1995 with
          the purpose of providing “a comprehensive set of plans, policies, guidelines, and implementation
          measures for guiding and ensuring the orderly development of the Highway 99W Corridor.” On
          January 18, 1997 the City Council adopted the Highway 99W Corridor Specific Plan.
          Other than the Highway 99W Corridor Specific Plan, the only other major general plan updates
          and/or revisions have been with respect to the Housing Element which State law requires to be
          updated every five years. On October 27, 2009 the City Council adopted the 2009–2014 Housing
          Element Update of the General Plan. However, the State of California Department of Housing and
          Community Development (HCD) in the ensuing months after City Council adoption, required a
          series of changes to the Update in a non-sequential manner. The City Council after review of the
          HCD directed changes, reaffirmed their adoption of the Housing Element Update on July 13, 2010.
          Since almost 20 years had elapsed since the 1994 General Plan was updated, the City Council in
          early 2012 began the process to update the Plan. Eihnard Diaz of Diaz Associates was contracted
          to team with City Staff, in particular John Stoufer, at that time the Planning Director, and John
          Brewer, the City Manager. These three individuals and Lisa Linnet, the City Clerk comprise the
          core of the 2014-2034 General Plan Update Staff Team (Team).
          On February 2, 2013 the first Task Force Meeting was held to review the 2014-2034 General Plan
          Update Overview and compilation of the 1994 General Plan Goals, Policies and Implementation
          Measures. Another meeting was held on April 16, 2013. However, State HCD determined that in
          order for the City to contract with a consultant that a “Request for Proposal” process needed to be
          undertaken since the City was utilizing Community Development Block Grant –
          Planning/Technical Assistance funding from State HCD to assist in funding the Update. State HCD
          determined that the on-call contract between the City and Diaz Associates to provide professional
          environmental and associated planning services to assist the City as requested did not comply with
          State HCD Standard Conditions for the grant. The Task Force was informed at the May 21, 2013
          Planning Commission Meeting that there would be no further meetings regarding 2014-2034
          General Plan Update efforts until the Conditions were cleared.
          The City issued a “Request for Proposals” on September 18, 2013 to which several firms, including
          Diaz Associates responded. Once again, Diaz Associates based on qualifications and the fee for
          services was awarded the contract by the City Council on December 10, 2013. On January 21,
          2014 the Task Force reconvened to continue the 2014-2034 General Plan Update process. Section
          G of this Chapter identifies the 2014-2034 General Plan Update Task Force Workshop and Public
          Hearing dates, and the Planning Commission and City Council Public Hearing dates for the 2014-
          2034 General Plan Update.
A.        PURPOSE OF THE GENERAL PLAN
          California State law (Government Code Section 65300) requires the City of Corning to adopt a
          general plan "for the physical development of the city, and any land outside its boundaries which .
          . . bears relation to its planning." The general plan serves as a "constitution" for development, the
City of Corning 2014-2034 General Plan Update           1                                        September 8, 2015

          foundation upon which all land use decisions are to be based. It expresses community development
          goals and embodies public policy relative to the distribution of future public and private land use.
          In summary, it is a statement of the City's vision of its physical growth over the next 20 years.
          The City of Corning General Plan serves to:
                  Identify the City’s long-range goals, objectives, policies & implementation measures for
                   existing and future development and conservation of natural resources;
                  Provide for “quality of life” improvements for City residents, employers and employees;
                  Provide the Planning Commission and City Council a foundation for judging whether
                   specific private development proposals and public projects are consistent with the general
                   plan;
                  Provide citizens, developers, employers, public and private agencies, and decision-makers
                   the “ground rules” that guide existing and future development
                  Provide a basis for decision making, including a nexus to support development exactions
                   as required by Nollan v. California Coastal Commission (1987) 107 S. Ct. 3141; and
                  Provide citizens with opportunities to participate in the planning and decision-making
                   processes of the City.
          The General Plan is designed to be:
                  Long range in nature since almost any development decision has effects lasting for more
                   than several years;
                  Comprehensive, since the Plan must provide direction to coordinate all major components
                   of the City's physical development; and,
                  General, because although it serves as a framework for detailed public and development
                   proposals, it establishes requirements for additional planning studies which must be
                   completed prior to any future actions to modify land use allocations.
          The following are definitions for goals, objectives, policies and implementation measures.
          Whereas, the 1994 General Plan and the 2009-2014 Housing Element do not identify objectives,
          they are included in this 2014-2034 General Plan Update.
          Goals
          A goal is a broad, generalized expression of commonly held community values. Since a goal is
          broadly stated, disagreement regarding a goal tends to be uncommon.
          Objectives
          Objectives are similar to goals and frequently the two terms are used interchangeably. As used in
          the general plan, however, an objective is a more narrowly drawn expression of community intent.
          One goal may imply two or more objectives, each responsive to a particular aspect of a more
          broadly stated goal. For example, a community goal might be “Protection of natural resources.”
          A related objective could be “Prevention of erosion, which leads to loss of soils, degradation of
          water quality, and destruction of wildlife habitats.”
          Policies
          A policy is a precise statement of public regulatory powers and fiscal resources that will be
          exercised and allocated to achieve a specific objective. Policies may be expressed in text, maps,
          diagrams, or some combination thereof. Since policies are tangible, they can be quantitatively
City of Corning 2014-2034 General Plan Update           2                                      September 8, 2015

          measured. It is important to note that some policies are more specific than others. Examples of
          policies relating to the previous examples of goal and objective include, “Construction practices
          shall provide for the impoundment of storm waters and removal of sediment prior to discharge into
          creeks, and development shall not be permitted on highly erosive soil when slopes exceed 15% (or
          some other specified limit).”
          The policies contained in the general plan are expressed in terms of shall or should. There is an
          important distinction between these two terms. As used in the general plan, shall indicates an
          unequivocal commitment, while should indicates a guide toward accomplishing a long-range goal.
          Implementation Measures
          The final link in the hierarchy running from an objective to its physical realization is provided by
          implementation. Although implementation is commonly spoken of in terms of programs implying
          a long-term effort, it may be of much shorter duration and simply be referred to as a measure. In
          any event, implementation programs and measures are concerned with the specific actions
          necessary for accomplishment within a definite time. An example of an implementation measure
          would be “Revise the zoning and grading ordinances and the development standards.”
B.        WHY UPDATE THE GENERAL PLAN
          The City is updating the General Plan:
                  As required by state statute to periodically review and revise, as necessary (§65103(a));
                  Because, except for the 2009-2014 Housing Element which was updated in 2009, the last
                   comprehensive update was May 1994 whereas, the practice is to update every 15 to 20
                   years;
                  Because policies need to be updated to reflect the City’s current vision & priorities for the
                   next 20 years;
                  In order to implement Housing Element Goals, Objectives, Policies, & Implementation
                   Measures;
                  To address air quality & greenhouse gas (GHG) issues; and,
                  To incorporate “sustainability” concepts, where feasible.
C.        CONTENTS OF THE 2014-2034 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
          A general plan is required by State law to address the following seven elements briefly summarized
          as follows.
                  The Conservation Element addresses the conservation, development, and use of natural
                   resources including water, forests, soils, rivers, and mineral deposits.
                  The Open Space Element details plans and measures for preserving open space for natural
                   resources, the managed production of resources, outdoor recreation, public health and
                   safety, and the identification of agricultural land.
                  The Noise Element identifies and appraises noise problems within the community and
                   forms the basis for land use distribution.
                  The Safety Element establishes policies and programs to protect the community from risks
                   associated with seismic, geologic, flood, and fire hazards.
City of Corning 2014-2034 General Plan Update             3                                     September 8, 2015

                  The Land Use Element designates the general distribution and intensity of uses of the land
                   for housing, business, industry, open space, education, public buildings and grounds, waste
                   disposal facilities, and other categories of public and private uses.
                  The Circulation Element is correlated with the land use element and identifies the general
                   location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes,
                   terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities.
                  The Housing Element is a comprehensive assessment of current and projected housing
                   needs for all segments of the community and all economic groups. In addition, it embodies
                   policy for providing adequate housing and includes action programs for this purpose.
          In addition to the general plan elements listed above, the City may adopt "any other elements or
          address any other subjects which . . . relate to the physical development of the county or city"
          (Government Code Section 65303). Upon adoption, an optional element becomes an integral part
          of the general plan and has the same force and effect as the mandatory elements and must be
          consistent with the other elements of the plan.
          The 2014-2034 General Plan Update addresses all of the mandatory elements and will incorporate
          the current optional Recreation and Public Facilities Elements. The inclusion of an Air Quality
          Element into the Plan was considered by the General Plan Task Force but not undertaken.
          The City is located in the Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin (NSVAB) which is one of the air
          “sub-basins” in the Sacramento Valley Air Basin. The other sub-basin is the Greater Sacramento
          Air region. The NSVAB encompasses Shasta, Tehama, Glenn, Butte, Colusa, Sutter, and Yuba
          counties. The basin’s principal geographic features include a large valley bounded on the north
          and west by the Coastal Mountain Range and on the east by the southern portion of the Cascade
          Mountain Range and the northern portion of the Sierra Nevada. The basin is about 200 miles long
          in a north-south direction, and has a maximum width of about 150 miles, although the valley floor
          averages only about 50 miles in width. Based on the geographic size and population of the air
          basins with respect to the size and population of the City of Corning, the preparation of a separate
          element does not make sense since the City’s contribution of stationary and mobile emissions is
          relatively minimal compared to other much larger jurisdictions where an air quality element could
          significantly make a difference in air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. However, this did not
          preclude the City’s 2014-2034 General Plan Update from identifying goals, policies and
          implementation mechanisms to assist in the reduction of these emissions and their cumulative
          effects.
                  The Recreation Element is closely linked with the Land Use and Open Space Elements
                   since plentiful, well-designed parks and recreation facilities contribute to the quality of life
                   in the community and also help to preserve natural features and habitat areas. Since this
                   element is an integral component of a community it is recommended that it be linked to the
                   Community Organization Group. This element could be expanded to include “Parks” in
                   the title.
                  The Public Facilities Element will identify public services and facilities needed to serve
                   the existing and future development. This element also forms a consistent policy
                   framework to guide capital improvement programs which are compatible with the General
                   Plan and overall management policies of the City of Corning.
          As previously noted, the City adopted the Highway 99W Corridor Specific Plan on January 18,
          1997 with the intent to provide a more detailed examination of the planning issues in the corridor
City of Corning 2014-2034 General Plan Update            4                                        September 8, 2015

          than could be achieved in the City's General Plan. The purpose of the Specific Plan was to provide
          a comprehensive set of plans, policies, guidelines, and implementation measures for guiding and
          ensuring the orderly development of the Highway 99W Corridor. Components of the Specific Plan
          were incorporated into the 2014-2034 General Plan Update, where applicable.
D.        ORGANIZATION OF THE 2014-2034 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE
          Some local governments adopt their general plan elements individually. However, due to the nature
          of the state's general plan statutes, a number of issues (such as flooding and open space) have to be
          addressed more than once. This results in needless pages and duplication and makes administration
          difficult. Therefore, it is proposed that elements be combined so that the Plan is adopted as a single
          Plan document arranged by primary issue topics within each element. The format addresses all the
          mandatory general plan elements, but is organized to eliminate redundancies, where possible.
          Many general plans, including the City of Corning’s 1994 General Plan, include in the body of the
          Plan all supporting information which provides the basis (or background) for the goals, objectives,
          policies and implementation measures advanced by the Plan. This approach not only increases the
          bulk of the document, but also serves as a distraction to the reader. Many readers are only interested
          in what directly affects their respective properties and possible projects, in particular policies and
          implementation measures. They do not wish to “wade” through what they perceive to be an
          “endless amount” of possibly interesting, but not “necessary information.” In addition this
          increased bulk generates more paper and additional reproduction costs. Therefore, the 2014-2034
          General Plan Update is provided in two separate documents both of which comprises the City of
          Corning 2014-2034 General Plan.
          The first document, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Environmental Impact
          Report (EIR) identifies the existing natural and man-made conditions within the City and Planning
          Area. Research and review of existing documents, information, and other reports will be
          undertaken. As necessary, supplemental studies were conducted, which when combined with the
          other research and review, identified existing conditions. The document assists in identifying
          existing problems and deficiencies. These existing conditions, not only serve as the basis for the
          Goals, Objectives, Policies and Implementation Measures in the 2014-2034 General Plan Update,
          but also provide the “baseline” conditions for the EIR required for the General Plan. Those readers
          desiring to understand the rationale for the Goals, Objectives, Policies and Implementation
          Measures, or wish to become more familiar with the City, are able to obtain this document
          separately from the second document which is the actual 2014-2034 General Plan with
          accompanying Land Use and Circulation Maps.
          The second document is the actual 2014-2034 General Plan which includes text, exhibits and maps
          Goals, Objectives, Policies and Implementation Measures are clearly and concisely identified. The
          2014-2034 General Plan Update Elements are combined and arranged by primary issue topics
          within which each Element is addressed as identified in “Chapter II. Section C. General Plan
          Groups and Associated Elements.”
          The Land Use and Circulation Maps are an integral part of the 2014-2034 General Plan Update.
          Whereas, these maps are provided separately, the Circulation Map identifies the relationship of
          land use to circulation. This Map serves to identify the type of land use permitted on each property
          and the relationship to the street system. In addition to the existing and proposed street system, the
          Circulation Map identifies railroad lines and the location of the City of Corning Municipal Airport.
          The Land Use Map identifies the General Plan Land Use classifications of property within the City
          of Corning.

E.        CONSISTENCY
          INTERNAL CONSISTENCY
          The State of California General Plan Guidelines provide a clear discussion regarding the general
          plan consistency issue. The concept of internal consistency, as used in California Planning Law,
          means that no policy conflicts exist, either textual or diagrammatic, between the components of an
          otherwise complete and adequate general plan. Without consistency in the five areas described
          below, a general plan cannot effectively serve as a clear guide to future development. Decision-
          makers will face conflicting directives; citizens will be confused about the policies and standards
          the community has selected; and land owners, business, and industry will be unable to rely on the
          general plan's stated priorities and standards for their own individual decision making.
          Equal Status among General Plan Elements
          All elements of the general plan have equal legal status. For example, the land use and open space
          elements cannot contain different land use intensity standards rationalized by statements such as
          "if in any instance there is a conflict between the land use element and the open space element, the
          land use element controls"
          Consistency among the Elements (Inter-element Consistency)
          All general plan elements, whether mandatory or optional, must be consistent with each other. As
          an example, the land use and open space elements should not designate different future land uses
          for the same site. Whenever a jurisdiction adopts a new element or amends part of a plan, it should
          update the rest of the plan at the same time, or immediately thereafter. It must eliminate any
          inconsistencies that the new element or amendment creates.
          Consistency within an Element (Intra-element Consistency)
          Each element's data, analyses, goals, policies, and implementation programs, must be consistent
          with and complement one another. Established goals, data, and analysis form the foundation for
          any ensuing policies. For example, if one portion of a circulation element indicates that city roads
          are sufficient to accommodate the projected level of traffic, while another section of the same
          element describes a worsening traffic situation aggravated by continued subdivision activity, the
          element cannot be internally consistent.
          Area Plan Consistency
          Internal consistency also means that all principles, goals, objectives, policies, and plan proposals
          set forth in an area or community plan must be consistent with the overall general plan.
          Text and Diagram Consistency
          Internal consistency means that the general plan text and diagrams must be consistent with one
          another since both are integral parts of the plan. A general plan with written policies and programs
          that conflict with its corresponding diagrams is internally inconsistent. For example, if a general
          plan's land use element diagram designates extensive low density residential development in an
          area where the text describes the presence of prime agricultural land, and further contains written
          policies to preserve agricultural land or open space in this area, a conflict exists.
City of Corning 2014-2034 General Plan Update            6                                      September 8, 2015
          All land use regulations and plans must be consistent with the general plan. These include zoning
          ordinances, subdivision ordinances, and specific and area plans. Ensuring that existing ordinances
          and plans are consistent with the general plan is one method of implementing the general plan's
          policies. Other methods include development of new ordinances, plans, financing programs,
          capital improvement programming, code enforcement, and the entitlement process. The 2014-2034
          General Plan Update identifies implementation measures or programs.
          CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER PLANNING PROCESSES
          To be an effective guide for future development, a general plan must provide a framework for local
          development that is consistent with the policies of relevant State, regional, local programs and
          regulatory agencies. The 2014-2034 General Plan Update takes into consideration the following

II.       2014-2034 GENERAL PLAN GOALS, OBJECTIVES, POLICIES &
          IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
          The City of Corning combined general plan elements so that the 2014-2034 General Plan Update
          is adopted as a single document arranged by primary issue topics within which each general plan
          element is addressed. The topics are Natural Resources Group, Public Health and Safety Group,
          and Community Development Group. Several Community Goals and Objectives are advanced to
          reflect commonly held community values and intent.
A.        COMMUNITY GOALS
          There are four existing major ideas, or concepts that provide an overview of what the 2014-2034
          General Plan Update is attempting to accomplish and why. These are reflected as four major goals
          that the 2014-2034 General Plan Update advances.
               Goal 1 Preserve and enhance the quality of life by providing a variety of living environments and
                       accommodating growth.
               Goal 2 Geographic distribution and the timing of growth shall be directly related to the
                       conservation of natural resources and the provision and/or improvement of public
                       facilities, services and utilities.
               Goal 3 Recognition that the general plan is a decision-making tool which will be reviewed and
                       revised periodically.
               Goal 4 Application of an inter-jurisdictional approach to planning issues.
B.        COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES
          The function of the following objectives is to provide guidelines for the overall implementation of
          the 2014-2034 General Plan Update and the operation of the planning process. These objectives
          are advanced as part of the 2014-2034 General Plan Update.
               1–1     To ensure that planning is a comprehensive process that is derived from public policies
                       clearly stated in the General Plan Update and includes the application of these policies
                       to lands within the City, Planning Area and Sphere of Influence, as applicable through
                       rehabilitation, zoning, subdivision, and other mechanisms and regulations.
               1-2     To develop a General Plan which is both internally consistent among all its elements
                       and which provides the policy basis for the rehabilitation, zoning, subdivision, and
                       other implementing mechanisms and ordinances.
               1-3     To develop public trust and confidence that the objectives, policies, and
                       implementation measures shall be faithfully adhered to and equitably applied to all
                       land use matters.
               1-4     To provide public assurance that the General Plan shall be applied in a manner that
                       responds to local conditions and local concerns through the interpretation of its
                       policies, but only within well-defined and understood limits intended to preserve the
                       overall integrity of the plan.
City of Corning 2014-2034 General Plan Update              11                                     September 8, 2015

              I-5      To develop a planning process that resists short-term pressures exerted by narrow
                       interests to modify the General Plan, but is capable of thoughtfully responding to
                       significantly changing conditions or community needs.
              1-6      To ensure that administration of the planning process is characterized by:
                               The efficient and expeditious handling of planning matters through the
                                coordination and communication of the various departments and divisions of
                                the City and other government agencies.
                               Timely and decisive action on all planning matters.
              1-7      To promote a planning process that is accessible to all citizens.
              1-8      To fashion a planning process that recognizes the continuing need for citizen review
                       of the objectives, policies, and implementation measures contained in the General Plan.
              1-9      To convert the General Plan land use boundaries to precise zoning boundaries through
                       the use of natural and man-made physical boundaries such as creeks, topographic
                       changes, roads, etc., and non-physical boundaries such as property lines, section lines,
                       etc.
C.        2014-2034 GENERAL PLAN UPDATE GROUPS & ASSOCIATED ELEMENTS
          As previously noted, the City combined general plan elements so that the 2014-2034 General Plan
          Update is adopted as a single document arranged by primary issue topics within which each general
          plan element is addressed. The topics are Natural Resources Group, Public Health and Safety Group,
          and Community Development Group.
          A brief overview for each Group is provided after the listing of topics within each Group. Those
          topics which are mandatory elements required by state law are identified with an asterisk.
           NATURAL RESOURCES GROUP – CONSERVATION* & OPEN SPACE*
                      Biological Resources
                      Water Resources
                      Cultural Resources
                      Mineral Resources
                      Open Space and Scenic Resources
                      Park and Recreation Facilities & Resources
          The Natural Resources Group is essentially synonymous for the Conservation and Open Space
          Elements, where goals, policies, and implementation measures or programs will be established that
          value and protect natural resources to ensure they are available in the future. The primary goal of
          the Natural Resources Group is to preserve the range of visual, natural, and cultural resources that
          exemplify the City. This Group will strive to minimize the impact of future development in areas
          with significant visual, natural, and cultural resources and supports the creation and enhancement
          of important habitat and open space areas that are well managed and maintained. This Group will
          also promote efficient use of water and other natural resources and strive to ensure the long‐term
          sustainability of non‐renewable resources. This Group also supports the conservation and creation
          of parks, recreational facilities, and open space.

          The Natural Resources Group also sets forth goals and polices that minimize agricultural land use
          conflicts and support the long‐term presence and viability of the City’s agricultural industry, as
          applicable.
          HEALTH AND SAFETY GROUP
               Safety*
                    Seismic & Geologic Hazards
                    Flood Protection
                    Dam Failure Inundation
                    Fire Safety & Sheriff Protection
                    Hazardous Materials
               Noise*
          Planning for growth and development requires the consideration of a wide range of public health
          and safety issues. Safety hazards are naturally induced, such as seismic and geologic hazards,
          flooding, and wildland fire hazards. Some hazards are the result of natural hazards that are
          exacerbated by human activity and alteration of the natural environment, such as dam failure, urban
          fires, and development in sensitive areas such as floodplains or areas subject to erosion and
          landslides. Finally, some hazards are manmade, including airport crash hazards, hazardous
          materials, and crime. In addition to safety issues related to hazardous conditions, the planning
          process should account for other issues related to community health and safety, such as medical
          services, fire and police protection, and noise exposure.
          On June 12, 2012, the Tehama County Board of Supervisors approved Resolution No. 31-2012 to
          adopt the Tehama County Hazard Mitigation Plan. The Hazard Mitigation Plan was developed as
          a multi-jurisdictional plan with participation by the three cities in the county, the Capay Fire
          Protection District and the Red Bluff Joint Union High School District with oversight by the
          Tehama County Department of Public Works. On November 27, 2012, the Corning City Council
          adopted Resolution No. 11-13-2012-04 adopting the Tehama County Hazard Mitigation Plan.
          However, the City of Corning completed a Hazard Mitigation Plan for submission to FEMA that
          identifies hazards and mitigations on a more specific level to the City and surrounding area.
          The Hazard Mitigation Plans were prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation
          Act of 2000. A Federally approved hazard mitigation plan enables the County and City to apply
          for Federal pre-disaster hazard mitigation grant funds to support mitigation projects. Those
          portions of the Tehama County Hazard Mitigation Plan, approved by FEMA in the latter part of
          2012 and the one being prepared for the City will be incorporated by reference into the Health and
          Safety Group.
          Many of the health and safety risks associated with development can be avoided through locational
          decisions made at the planning stages of development, while others may be lessened through the
          use of mitigation measures in the planning and land use entitlement process. The Health and Safety
          Group, in conjunction with the Tehama County and the City of Corning Hazard Mitigation Plans
          identify goals and policies defining the strategy for ensuring the maintenance of a healthy and safe
          physical environment in the City.

          COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT GROUP
                       Land Use*
                       Circulation*
                       Public Services
                       Housing*
                       Air Quality, Climate Change, and Energy
          The Community Development Group is comprised of General Plan Elements that address the use
          of the City of Corning’s physical resources in order to define a community in which its residents
          live, work, shop and play. The Elements are grouped together because they collectively address
          the development and maintenance of the City.
          While often included in the Conservation and Open Space Elements of a general plan, the City of
          Corning addressed air quality, climate change and energy in the Community Development Group.
          There is a strong correlation between land use planning, transportation and circulation, and the
          emission of air quality pollutants, and greenhouse gases (GHG) that contribute to global climate
          change (GCC) and criteria pollutants that degrade air quality within the region. The primary
          opportunities to reduce air quality pollutants and GHG emissions are in urbanized areas, such as
          the City, within the region where land use patterns can best support the increased use of transit and
          pedestrian activities since most GHGs and air pollutants result from mobile source emissions. The
          development of a City with sustainable components also contributes to both the reduction in overall
          air pollutants as well as solving the larger challenges associated with global climate change. A
          balanced approach to achieving sustainable communities requires the integration of a region-wide
          multi‐modal transportation system with a reduction in the reliance on single‐occupant motor
          vehicles, along with buildings that consume less through design and efficient building materials.
          Energy production, transportation, and consumption are key contributors to greenhouse gases
          affecting climate change, poor local air quality, and a variety of other sustainability challenges. The
          Community Development Group encourages and supports land use development patterns and
          transportation choices that reduce pollutants and greenhouse gases. In addition, this Group
          encourages renewable energy production, along with efficient energy use in buildings and
          infrastructure and minimizes the impacts of projects that can generate air pollutants.
          The policy options available in this Group are closely influenced and in some areas constrained by
          elements in the Natural Resources and Health and Safety Groups. A major goal of the 2014-2034
          General Plan Update is to balance and coordinate the sometimes competing objectives contained
          in the three General Plan Groups. Achieving this goal requires some understanding of their
          interrelationships. Elements contained in the Health and Safety Group place limits on the use of
          the City’s physical resources in order to reduce the risks of loss or damage to life and property.
          Elements contained in the Natural Resources Group describe the opportunities presented by the
          City's resource base and define the limits within which these resources may be used on a long-term,
          sustainable basis. Elements in the Community Development Group must respond to risks posed
          by natural and man-made hazards and to the opportunities presented by the natural resource base.
          Responding to these risks and opportunities in a responsible manner will ensure that both present
          and future generations of City residents, employers and employees will be able to enjoy the quality
          of life that the City offers.

          BR-a     In addition to rare, endangered, or threatened species as designated by federal and State
                   resource agencies, CEQA also requires that special emphasis be placed on resources that are
                   rare or unique to the region (CEQA Guidelines § 15125). Agency coordination should occur
                   regarding California Species of Special Concern; Fully Protected species as defined in FGC
                   sections 3511, 4700, 5050, and 5515; California Native Plant Society Rare Plant Rank plant
                   species; and any species that can be shown to be rare pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section
                   15380.
          BR-b     The significant creekside corridors in the City shall be designated on 2014-2034 General Plan
                   Update Maps.
          Implementation Measures
          BR-(1) Ensure that open space corridors along creeks and wetlands, including vernal pools, include
                   protective buffers (non-development setbacks), preserve existing riparian vegetation
                   through the environmental review process and require minimum setbacks from the edge of
                   the riparian dripline or the top-of-bank along creeks and surrounding wetlands, whichever
                   is greater. Specific setbacks and widths will be determined on a case by case basis. Input
                   from resource agencies, including the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the
                   U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be considered in determining the setback distance.

          SG-c     Sedimentation and erosion from development shall be minimized through ordinances and
                   implementation mechanisms as adopted by the City.
          SG-d     When soil tests reveal the presence of expansive soils, require engineering design measures to
                   eliminate or mitigate their impacts.
          Implementation Measures
          SG-(1) Evaluate and, if feasible, implement a program whereby existing buildings that do not meet
                   current seismic safety standards could be retrofitted.
          FLOOD PROTECTION
          Goal     Minimize the risk to lives and property loss from flood hazards and prevent impacts to
                   waterways due to human activities that may increase flood hazards.
          Objectives
          FL-1     Protect public health and safety, both on-site and downstream, from flooding through
                   floodplain management which regulates the types of land uses which may locate in the
                   floodplain, prescribes construction designs for floodplain development, and requires
                   mitigation measures for development which would impact the floodplain by increasing runoff
                   quantities.
          Policies
          FL-a     Development in FEMA Special Flood Hazard Areas (floodplain) shall be regulated.
          FL-b     Flood control measures should advance, to the degree feasible: recreational opportunities;
                   resource conservation (including streamside vegetation and habitat); and, the preservation of
                   the scenic values of water resources.
          FL-c     Flood control measures shall avoid to the maximum extent feasible, alteration of creeks and
                   their immediate environs.
          FL-d     The City should participate in local and regional emergency preparedness plans and flood
                   control drainage plans to protect the public from flooding hazards.
          FL-e     New critical or high occupancy structures (e.g., schools, hospitals) shall not be located in the
                   FEMA Special Flood Hazard Area (100 year floodplain) unless those structures and
                   supporting utilities are designed to prevent damage and service interruption during the 100
                   year flood.
City of Corning 2014-2034 General Plan Update             20                                       September 8, 2015
          Implementation Measures
          FL-(1) As part of project development review, ensure that structures located in the FEMA Special
                   Flood Hazard Area provide adequate protection from flood hazards and do not impact
                   upstream or downstream properties.
          FL-(2) In designing flood control facilities, consider the need to protect anadromous fisheries and
                   allow for adequate water passage to ensure the survival of downstream riparian ecosystems.
          FIRE SAFETY & LAW ENFORCEMENT
          Goal     Protect and improve public health and safety.
          Objectives

                   urban fires.
          FS-2     Protect life and property from crime and fire hazards by encouraging the incorporation of
                   defensible space design techniques in the physical design of new development.
          Policies
          FS-a     Protect development from wildland and non-wildland fires by requiring development to
                   incorporate measures responsive to the risk from this hazard.
          FS-b     All land divisions and development shall be required to conform to fire safety standards.
          FS-c     Known fire hazard information should be identified in all land development entitlement
                   applications subject to environmental assessment.
          FS-d     New development shall be encouraged to incorporate site planning and appropriate building
                   design features designed to minimize fire impacts and deter crime.
          FS-e     Development in areas requiring additional levels of police and fire services should participate
                   in offsetting costs for the additional services.
          Implementation Measures
          FS-(1) Provide rapid and timely response to all fire protection emergencies and maintain the
                   capability to have minimum average response times.
          FS-(2) Maintain mutual aid agreements with other agencies in Tehama County.
          FS-(3) Encourage the County to require development in unincorporated and within the City's
                   Sphere of Influence to conform to City development standards, including but not limited
                   to Uniform Building Code, Uniform Fire Code, water, wastewater, and street improvement
                   standards.
          FS-(4) Provide rapid and timely response to all law enforcement emergencies and maintain the
                   capability to have minimum average response times.

          FS-(5) Identify geographical areas or population groups experiencing noticeable crime
                   victimization in order to improve effectiveness of crime prevention efforts and commit
                   resources, as appropriate, to these areas for assistance.
          HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
          Goal     Reduce and control the adverse effects of hazardous materials on the public’s health, safety
                   and welfare.
          Objectives
          HM-1 Protect life and property from contact with hazardous materials through site design and land
                   use regulations and storage and transportation standards.
          HM-2 Protect life and property in the event of the accidental release of hazardous materials through
                   emergency preparedness planning.
          Policies
          HM-a The City shall maintain an emergency preparedness plan for hazardous materials.
          Implementation Measures
          HM-(1) Promote greater community awareness and preparedness by working with business
                     associations, homeowners' associations, community groups and utilities.
          HM-(2) Coordinate emergency drills with all affected operating departments including, local and
                     County Fire, Law Enforcement, Public Services, Public Works, Finance, and Emergency
                     Medical Services.
          HM-(3) Design critical public facilities to remain operative during emergencies.
          NOISE
          Goal     Minimize excessive, objectionable or harmful noise impacting existing and future residents
                   and land uses.
          Objectives
          N-1      Protect noise sensitive areas through regulation of new noise-generating development.
          N-2      Protect noise sensitive new development from existing and future noise generators by
                   regulations encouraging each to locate within compatible noise environments.
          N-3      Protect established noise-generating development from noise sensitive new development.
          Policies
          N-a      New development shall use appropriate site planning and building design to reduce
                   undesirable noise impacts. The noise sensitivity of land uses as established in Table N-1 shall
                   be used in the location of new development, preparation of general plan amendments and
                   specific plans.
City of Corning 2014-2034 General Plan Update            22                                       September 8, 2015

                   The interpretive guidelines in Table N-1 shall not be applied mechanically, but with the
                   degree of flexibility required in each case to achieve a sound and feasible land use decision.
                   However, in no case shall a residential land use be located where the existing noise
                   environment, combined with the measured or calculated noise reduction of the type of
                   structure under consideration, makes it impossible to maintain an interior noise environment
                   at or below 45dBA CNEL.
                                                                        TABLE N-1

                        Notes:
                        1. For traffic noise Ldn and peak-hour Leq values are estimated to be approximately similar. Interior noise
                             level standards are applied within noise-sensitive areas of the various land uses, with windows and doors
                             in the closed positions.
                        2. Outdoor activity areas for single-family residential uses are defined as back yards. For large parcels or
                             residences with no clearly defined outdoor activity area, the standard shall be applicable within a 100 foot
                             radius of the residence.
                        3. For multi-family residential uses, the exterior noise level standard shall be applied at the common outdoor
                             recreation area, such as at pools, play areas or tennis courts. Where such areas are not provided, the
                             standards shall be applied at individual patios and balconies of the development.
                        4. Where it is not possible to reduce noise in outdoor activity areas to 60 dB Ldn or less using a practical
                             application of the best-available noise reduction measures, an exterior noise level of up to 65 dB Ldn may
                             be allowed provided that available exterior noise level reduction measures have been implemented and
                             interior noise levels are in compliance with this table.
                        5. Outdoor activity areas of transient lodging facilities include swimming pool and picnic areas.
                        6. Hospitals are often noise-generating uses. The exterior noise level standards for hospitals are applicable
                             only at clearly identified areas designated for outdoor relaxation by either hospital staff or patients.
                        7. Only the exterior spaces of these uses designated for employee or customer relaxation have any degree of
                             sensitivity to noise.
          N-b      The planning and design of improvements in the circulation systems shall consider their noise
                   impacts on adjacent land uses and shall include measures to mitigate significant noise impacts.
          N-c      Adhere to the “Corning Municipal Airport Master Plan Land Use Compatibility Guidelines”
                   with respect to access, land uses, noise and safety measures. Coordinate with the Tehama
                   County Airport Land Use Commission regarding projects that may impact, or may be
                   impacted, by airport operations.
          Implementation Measures
          N-(1)    Where noise mitigation measures are anticipated to be needed based on a review of a
                   project, require that project applicants secure the services of a qualified acoustical engineer
                   to perform a detailed technical study and to advance mitigation measures.
          N-(2)    Where site conditions permit, require noise buffers along the California Northern Railroad
                   for all new adjoining developments that are subject to unacceptable noise levels.
City of Corning 2014-2034 General Plan Update                       23                                                      September 8, 2015

          N-(3)    Site-specific railroad noise studies shall be prepared for noise sensitive development
                   projects anticipated to be affected by railroad noise.
          N-(4)    Control noise at the source through use of insulation, berms, building design and
                   orientation, buffer yards, staggered operating hours, and other techniques; where
                   necessary, use noise barriers to attenuate noise to acceptable levels; require that barriers
                   are landscaped to reduce negative visual impacts on the community.
          N-(5)    Encourage noise attenuation programs that avoid visible sound walls, where practical.
                   Open space, parking, accessory buildings, frontage roads, and landscaping can be used to
                   buffer development from noise.
          N-(6)    The maximum noise exposure from Corning Municipal Airport operations that shall be
                   considered normally acceptable for residential areas is 60 dBA CNEL.
          N-(7)    Request Caltrans to provide freeway sound walls adjacent to residential areas where
                   existing noise levels exceed 65 dB, consistent with State standards and Caltrans' priorities
                   for community noise abatement.
F.        COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
          LAND USE
          Goal     Promote a development pattern which will accommodate, consistent with the other objectives
                   of the Plan, the growth which will be experienced during the planning period (2014-2034),
                   and as such period is extended by future revisions of the Plan.
          Objectives
          LU-1     Guide development in a pattern that will provide opportunities for present and future residents
                   to enjoy the variety of living environments, which currently exist, which are served by the full
                   range of urban services.
          LU-2     Guide development in a pattern that will minimize land use conflicts between adjacent land
                   uses.
          LU-3     Guide development in a pattern that will establish an acceptable balance between public
                   facility and service costs and public revenues derived from new development.
          LU-4     Fashion a development pattern whose implementation mechanisms such as zoning,
                   subdivision, and other regulations, explicitly define a relationship between public and private
                   expectations and responsibilities concerning land use that is based on the following principles:
                            Public programs shall recognize both the expectations of individual property owners
                             to be able to use their lands as they desire and the responsibility of government to
                             provide a regulatory climate, which does not impede reasonable private expectations.
                            Property owners shall recognize public programs emphasizing that land be used in a
                             responsible manner that does not adversely affect either adjacent property owners or
                             the community values of the citizens of the City.
City of Corning 2014-2034 General Plan Update             24                                       September 8, 2015

          LU-5     Recognition that the major economic resources for achieving the development pattern will
                   come from the private sector, rather than government, and that the General Plan, as the
                   expression of community values, will guide the use of these resources.
          LU-6     Encourage a sense of community "village" quality and character throughout the City.
          LU-7     Improve existing neighborhood aesthetics.
          Policies
          LU-a     The City shall ensure the availability of an inventory of developable lands sufficient to
                   accommodate growth projected for the planning period.
          LU-b     The City shall monitor, on a yearly basis, the rate at which the developable land inventory is
                   being consumed, the population and employment growth of the City, and other useful
                   indicators of growth.
          LU-c     The procedure for adding lands to the inventory shall be by amendment of the Plan at five
                   year intervals. This policy shall not preclude any resident or property owner in the City from
                   requesting a general plan amendment upon submission of the required application and
                   payment of the prescribed fee.
          LU-d     The City shall ensure that a 15-20 year supply of commercial and industrial land required for
                   employment purposes is available within the City. The City shall continue its close working
                   relationship with economic development groups to monitor the demand and supply of land.
          LU-e     Evaluate the boundaries of the City’s Sphere of Influence and establish urban, rural and
                   urban reserve boundaries within the planning area, where and when appropriate.
          .
          LU-f     To the degree feasible, develop and ensure land use compatibility through coordination and

          Implementation Measures
          LU-(1) Reclassify the parcels listed in Appendix A to the Land Use Classification identified. The
                   parcels should be rezoned to the appropriate Zoning Designation within one year after
                   adoption of the 2014-2034 General Plan Update.
          LU-(2) Establish zoning districts and development standards in the Zoning Ordinance consistent
                   with the General Plan, and amend the Zoning Map to be consistent with the 2014-2034
                   General Plan Update Map within one year.
          LU-(3) Establish the Alternative Housing (AH) Zone District and zone appropriate parcels AH to
                   permit emergency shelters, transitional housing, or supportive housing.
          LU-(4) As part of the Annual General Plan Report, monitor and report on; commercial, industrial
                   and residential development since Plan adoption; the overall density of residential projects
                   approved during the previous year; and the remaining supply of vacant land by land use.
          LU-(5) Ensure that the Zoning Ordinance provides for minimum and maximum densities
                   consistent with the Plan's land use classifications.
          LU-(6) Encourage that new neighborhood shopping centers are located at least one mile away from
                   existing major shopping centers.
          LU-(7) For development along arterials such as South Avenue, 99W, adopt appropriate standards
                   to improve the character of these corridors, including but not limited to site access, building
                   and off-street parking orientation to street, building height, on-site lighting, transitional
                   requirements adjacent to residential uses.
          LU-(8) Evaluate strict enforcement of the non-conforming uses in instances when a preexisting non-
                   conforming use is clearly in conflict with other surrounding uses which fully conform to the
                   existing zoning.
          LU-(9) Adhere to the setback requirements identified in the “Corning Municipal Airport Master
                   Plan” and the “Tehama County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan”.
          CIRCULATION
          Goal: Provide an efficient, balanced and maintained road circulation system that, not only serve the
                   needs of vehicular traffic, but must also serve the needs of bicyclists and pedestrians, in
                   particular school children.
          Objectives
          C-1      Provide for safe and efficient vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian movement that meets existing
                   needs and accommodate growth in an orderly manner.
          C-2      As the City grows, connections between neighborhoods, commercial and industrial areas need
                   to serve the transportation needs of residents and businesses.
          C-3      Promote alternative travel modes, including transit, pedestrian and bicycle circulation
                   systems.
          C-4      Coordinate policies for land development and circulation.

          Policies
          C-a      Monitor, maintain and improve, as necessary, the operation, safety and performance of the
                   street system, including roadway surfaces, capacity, and traffic signals. For capacity and
                   operational purposes, strive to attain a Level of Service (LOS) “C,” to the maximum degree
                   feasible, so that potential traffic congestion on streets and at intersections is minimized. LOS
                   “D” is permissible based on a case by case review. Refer to Tables C-1 and C-2 for Levels
                   of Service criteria for intersections and roadway capacities, respectively.
          C-b      Improve unpaved roads, driveways and parking areas.
          C-c      Provide for adequate, safe, and direct, and if necessary, alternative access to public facilities,
                   schools, parks and shopping areas.

                   pedestrian circulation safety and drainage control.
          C-h      Promote the use of programs and strategies to reduce overall vehicle travel, particularly during
                   peak commute periods.
          C-i      Coordinate transportation planning and implementation with regional and local plans.
          C-j      Protect natural features, to the degree feasible, when maintaining and expanding the City’s
                   circulation system.
          Implementation Measures
          C-(1)    Establish a data collection program for the street system to include a physical inventory,
                   condition of surfacing, maintenance needs, traffic volumes and accident reports. Update
                   the program at least yearly.
          C-(2)    Develop a priority system for physical improvements based on demonstrated needs
                   according to the collection of data on physical conditions, traffic volumes and safety
                   reports.
          C-(3)    Develop a priority system of road improvement projects.
          C-(4)    Respond quickly to correct traffic signal breakdowns, sign damages and losses.

            2. All volumes are approximate and assume ideal roadway characteristics. Actual threshold volumes for each Level of Service
            listed above may vary depending on a number of factors including curvature and grade, intersection or interchange spacing,
            percentage of trucks and other heavy vehicles, lane widths, signal timing, on-street parking, amount of cross traffic and
            pedestrians, driveway spacing, etc.
           C-(5) Review high frequency accident locations and develop specific mitigation measures or
                      improvements.
          C-(6)       Complete all “Safe Route to School” studies to determine requirements for new walkways,
                      school crossings, traffic control and roadway improvements.
          C-(7)       Develop and adopt street standards that provide flexibility in design, especially in
                      residential neighborhoods. Revise right-of-way and pavement standards to reflect adjacent
                      land use and/or anticipated traffic, and permit reduced right-of-way dimensions where
                      necessary to maintain neighborhood character. Standards should consider median
                      construction, or intersection lane widening which may require additional width and right
                      of way. Alternative standards should be provided for new and existing alignments, since
                      having just one set of standard may conflict with existing facilities, which for various
                      reasons are inconsistent in right-of-way or other constraints. Interpretations and/or
                      recommendations regarding minimum street widths is the responsibility of the City
                      Engineer with input from the planning process.
          C-(8)       Continue to require that new development pays a fair share of the costs of street and other
                      traffic and transportation improvements based on traffic generated and impacts on service
                      levels.
          C-(9)       Development of vacant parcels will require the construction, or a deferral agreement for
                      the construction of curb, gutter, sidewalk and the necessary tie-in paving along the street
                      frontage of the affected parcel(s), whichever combination of improvements are applicable,
                      as a requirement of the entitlement or building permit approval. A deferral of curb, gutter
                      and sidewalks can be considered for existing vacant parcels where drainage requirements
                      have not been established. New development that requires road extension beyond parcel
                      frontage will be required to construct and/or pave, at minimum, the road surface and insure
                      proper drainage.
          C-(10) An evaluation should be undertaken to prioritize the streets where curb, gutter, sidewalk
                      and tie-in paving improvements (whichever combination of improvements are applicable)
                      are necessary. For those streets where deferral agreements have been made, a prioritization
                      of the streets to be improved should also be undertaken.

          C-(11) Undertake and approve Plan Line studies for future collector roads identified on the Land
                   Use & Circulation Map to establish precise alignments in order to identify future right-of-
                   way needs. No entitlements for any properties affected by the proposed alignments can be
                   approved until the Plan Line study is undertaken or the precise alignment is identified as
                   part of an entitlement process.
          C-(12) Development proposals shall be reviewed according to the provisions of the zoning and
                   subdivision ordinance to insure that adequate access, on-site circulation, parking and
                   loading areas are provided.
          C-(13) Development shall mitigate any adverse impacts of a proposed development project on the
                   existing street system. This may include necessary street improvements, traffic signs or
                   signals.
          C-(14) Design roads created by development to tie into the existing and anticipated road systems.

                   applicable.
          PF-d     The City will cooperate and coordinate with the Corning Union Elementary and Corning
                   Union High School Districts to develop plans that respond to the growth of the City.
          PF-e     Public uses (e.g. schools, parks, waste disposal sites) and public utilities (e.g. substation,
                   transmission lines) whose site specific locations often cannot be identified in advance by the
                   General Plan may be permitted throughout the City to serve the public need. Appropriate
                   zoning on site specific locations will be determined in response to the identified need as it
                   occurs. Solid waste disposal facilities shall be conditionally permitted to ensure that the site
                   is compatible with adjacent land uses. Surrounding land uses, to the extent feasible, shall be
                   regulated to avoid incompatibility with the solid waste disposal facility.
          Implementation Measures
          PF-(1) If cost effective, require annexation to the City as a condition of extending City services.
          PF-(2) As part of the project review and building permit process, ensure that all new development
                   has a minimal impact on natural drainage channels and flow capacity.
          PF-(3) Explore the feasibility of using reclaimed water for landscaping of residential landscaping
                   in new subdivisions, major commercial and industrial projects, and landscaping at public
                   facilities, including schools, government facilities, and parks.
          PF-(4) Establish guidelines and standards for water conservation and actively promote use of
                   water-conserving devices and practices in both new construction and major alterations and
                   additions to existing buildings.

          ENERGY
          Goal
          Reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources in existing and future development and improve the
          delivery of energy to existing and future users.
          Objectives
          E-1      Develop and adopt local energy standards that would result in less energy consumption.
          E-2      Encourage use and development of renewable or nontraditional sources of energy.
          E-3      Evaluate and establish policies and standards to increase energy efficiency in existing
                   buildings and new developments.
          E-4      Evaluate and establish outdoor lighting standards.
          Policies
          E-a      Continue to participate in undergrounding of public utility lines; whenever appropriate,
                   require conversion of overhead lines to underground in conjunction with public and private
                   projects.
          E-b      Identify and implement energy conservation measures that are appropriate for public
                   buildings and facilities.
          E-c      Identify energy conservation measures appropriate for retrofitting existing structures.
          E-d      Investigate and implement alternative sources of renewable power to supply City facilities.
          E-e      Participate in state and local efforts to develop appropriate policies and review procedures
                   for the institution of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, biomass
                   and hydroelectric power.
          Implementation Measures
          E-(1)    Coordinate with PG&E to educate the public about the need to conserve scarce energy
                   resources, insulate buildings to reduce energy required for heating and cooling, and use
                   energy-efficient appliances.
          E-(2)    Require consideration of passive solar energy techniques in subdivision design; including
                   house orientation, street and lot layout, vegetation and protection of solar access.
          E-(3)    Continue to require new buildings to meet state energy efficiency standards, and develop
                   a design manual showing examples of energy conservation in subdivision planning, site
                   layout, landscaping, and building design.

          of time.
          A-Weighted Decibel (dBA) - A numerical method of rating human judgment of loudness. The
          sound pressure level in decibels, as measured on a sound meter, uses an A-weighting filter to de-
          emphasize the very low and very high frequency components of sound in a manner similar to the
          response of the human ear.

          Decibel, dB - A unit for describing the amplitude of sound, equal to 20 time the logarithm to the
          base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the reference pressure, which is 20
          micropascals (20 micronewtons per square meter).
          Density - The number of families, individuals, dwelling units or housing structures per unit of land.
          Density Bonus – A zoning tool that that permits developers to build more housing units than
          normally allowed under existing standard residential zoning, in exchange for provision of a defined

          of affordable units included in the development.
          Dwelling - A structure or portion of a structure used exclusively for human habitation.
          Encourage - The City will not actively promote, but will welcome and stimulate others to pursue
          a particular goal or end.
          Fair Share Allocation - A distribution of lower income housing need among the cities in the region
          which is prepared by the State of California Department of Housing and Community Development
          for cities in Tehama County. The idea behind the allocation is that each jurisdiction should bear
          proportional responsibility for housing the low and moderate income population of the region. The
          allocation is expressed in terms of the number of additional lower income households that each
          jurisdiction should absorb over a five year period.
          Fault - A fracture in the earth's crust forming a boundary between rock masses that have shifted.
                       Active Fault - A fault that has moved recently and which is likely to move again. For
                        planning purposes, "active fault" is usually defined as one that shows movement within
                        the last 11,000 years and can be expected to move within the next 100 years.
                       Potentially Active Fault - (1) A fault that last moved within the Quaternary Period
                        before the Holocene Epoch (the last 2,000,000 to 11,000 years); (2) A fault which,
                        because it is judged to be capable of ground rupture or shaking, poses an unacceptable
                        risk for a proposed structure.
                       Inactive Fault - A fault which shows no evidence of movement in recent geologic time
                        and no potential for movement in the relatively near future.
          Fire Flow - The quantity of water necessary to attack and extinguish structure fires. Fire flow is
          further established at a minimum pressure of 20 pounds per square inch for a duration consistent
          with established Insurance Services Office Guidelines and based upon the size and type of
          construction, occupancy hazards, and distance to exposures. The formula is found in the 1974
          edition of the Insurance Services Office Guide for the Determination of Required Fire Flow.

          Flood Plain - A lowland or relatively flat area adjoining inland or coastal waters that is subject to
          a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year (i.e., 100-year flood).
          Floor Area Ratio - The gross floor area of all buildings on a lot divided by the lot area.
          Ground Failure - Mudslide, landslide, liquefaction or the compaction of soils due to seismic-
          induced ground shaking.
          Ground Water - The supply of fresh water under the ground surface in an aquifer or soil that forms
          a natural reservoir for potable water.
          Handicapped - The count of persons with disabilities or handicaps in the U.S. Census is based on
          self-definition with no medical documentation required. As a result, the definition of handicaps
          may include asthma, arthritis, mental illness, diabetes, etc., as well as musculoskeletal diseases,
          paralysis, etc., which require modification to housing.
          Hazardous Material - An injurious substance, including pesticides, herbicides, toxic metals and
          chemicals, liquefied natural gas, explosives, volatile chemicals and nuclear fuels.
          Historic Area - A district or zone designated by local, state or federal authorities within which
          buildings, structures and places are of basic and vital importance due to their association with
          history, or their unique architectural style and scale, or their relationship to a square or park, and
          therefore should be preserved and/or developed in accord with a fixed plan.
          Household - The Census considers all persons living in a dwelling unit to be a household whether
          or not they are related. A single person living in an apartment and a family living in a house is
          considered a household.
          Household Income - The total of income of all the people living in a household. Households are
          usually described as very low income, low income, moderate income, middle income, and upper
          income according to their household size and relation to the regional median income for that
          household size.
                  Extremely Low Income = 0-30% of the regional median income
                  Very Low Income = 0-50% of the regional median income.
                  Low Income = 51-80% of the regional median income.
                  Moderate Income = 80-120% of the regional median income.
                  Upper Income = over 120% of the regional median income.

          released in an earthquake.
          Local Street - A roadway providing direct access to properties and designed to discourage through-
          traffic.
City of Corning 2014-2034 General Plan Update                   39                               September 8, 2015

          Median Income - The income category for each household size which is defined annually by the
          Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. Half of the households in the region
          have incomes above the median and half below.
          Mitigation - The lessening or elimination of the impacts of an action through changes in the
          proposed action or the undertaking of additional measures.
          Noise - Any unwanted or undesirable sound.
          Noise Exposure Contours - Lines drawn about a noise source indicating constant energy levels of
          noise exposure. CNEL and Ldn are two measures used to describe noise exposure.
          Open Space - Any parcel or area of land or water essentially unimproved and set aside, designated,
          dedicated or reserved for public or private use or enjoyment.
          Response Time - The amount of elapsed time between the notification of a fire or police unit for a
          call for service and that unit's arrival at the incident.
          Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Units – An SRO unit usually is small, between 200 to 350 square
          feet. These units provide a valuable source of affordable housing for individuals and can serve as
          an entry point into the housing market for formerly homeless people.
          Special Housing Needs - Those characteristics of the population (other than income) which cause
          households to have difficulty obtaining housing. The elderly, the handicapped, large families, the
          homeless, migrant farmworkers, and female-headed households are all considered to have special
          housing needs under state law.
          Subsidence - The gradual, local settling or sinking of the earth's surface with little or no horizontal
          motion. (Subsidence is usually the result of gas, oil, or water extraction, hydrocompaction, or peat
          oxidation, and not the result of a landslide or slope failure.)
          Substandard Buildings - Section 1001 of Chapter 10 of the 1994 Uniform Housing Code defines
          a substandard building as one where the "building or portion thereof which is determined to be an
          unsafe building in accordance with Section 102 or the Building Code; or any building or portion
          thereof, including any dwelling unit, guest room or suite of rooms, or the premises on which the
          same is located, in which there exists any of the conditions referenced in this section to an extent
          that endangers the life, limb, health, property, safety or welfare of the public or the occupants
          thereof shall be deemed and hereby declared to be substandard buildings."
          The conditions referenced in the section include inadequate sanitation, structural hazards,
          nuisances, hazardous electrical wiring, hazardous plumbing, hazardous mechanical equipment,
          faulty weather protection, fire hazard, faulty materials of construction, hazardous or unsanitary
          premises, inadequate exits, inadequate fire-protection or firefighting equipment and unauthorized
          occupancy.
          Housing which does not comply with the applicable building or housing codes is considered
          substandard. Generally two types of substandard housing are identified - that which can be repaired
          or rehabilitated and that which is so deteriorated that it should be replaced.
          Surface Rupture - A break in the ground's surface and associated deformation resulting from the
          movement of a fault.
          Tenure - Whether a housing unit is owner-occupied or renter-occupied.
City of Corning 2014-2034 General Plan Update                     40                              September 8, 2015

          Transportation System Management (TSM) - A cooperative process involving all transportation
          agencies in an urban area attempting to increase the efficiency of a transportation system through
          low-cost and relatively short-term actions. TSM typically includes traffic controls, improved
          public transportation, regulatory and pricing measures, and improvements to the management of
          the existing transportation system.
          Vacancy Rate - The percentage of unoccupied housing units in a jurisdiction. Vacancy rates
          usually differ according to tenure and housing type.
          Village Concept – In urban planning and design, a village is an urban development typically
          characterized by medium-density housing, mixed land uses, good public transit and an emphasis
          on human scale, pedestrian oriented and public space.
          Urban villages are seen to provide an alternative to recent patterns of urban development in many
          cities, especially decentralization and urban sprawl. They are generally purported to:
                   Reduce car reliance and promote cycling, walking and transit use
                   Provide a high level of self-containment (people working, recreating and living in the same
                    area)
                   Help facilitate strong community institutions and interaction
