                                                      Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale*
  I.         Tremor not felt.
 ll.         Tremor felt by persons at rest or in upper floors of a building. (2)
  ill.       Tremor felt indoors. Vibrations feel like a light truck passing by; may not be recognized as an earthquake. Hanging objects swing. (3)
 N.          Hanging objects swing. Vibrations feel like a heavy truck passing by, and the jolt feels like a heavy ball striking the wa:lls. Standing
             cars rock. Windows, dishes and doors rattle. Glasses clink and crockery clashes. Wooden walls and frames crack in the upper range
             of scale 4.                -
 V.          Earthquake felt outdoors, and its direction can be estimated. Sleepers are awakened. Liquids are disturbed, some spilled. Small unstable
             objec.ts are displaced or upset. Doors swing, closing and opening. Shutters and picrures move. Pendulum clocks stop, start or change
             rate. (4)
 VI.         Earthquake felt by everybody. Many are frightened and run outdoors. Persons walk unsteadily. Window, dishes and glassware are
             broken. Knick-knacks and books fall off shelves; pictures fall off walls. Furnirure moves or is overturned. Weak plaster and masonry
            D are cracked. Small bells in churches and schools ring. Trees and bushes are shaken.
 VII.       Difficult to stand. Earthquake noticed by drivers of motor cars. Hanging objects quiver. Furnirure is broken. Damage to masonry
            D, including fallen plaster, loose bricks and stones, cracks in tiles and cornices. Weak chimneys break at roof line. Some cracks in
            masonry C. Waves form in ponds, disrurbing mud at the bottom. Slides and caving in sand and gravel banks. Large bells ring.
            Concrete irrigation ditches are damaged. (5)
 vm.        Steering of motor cars is affected. Partial collapse of masonry C strucrures. Some damage to masonry B; none to masonry A. Fall
            of stucco and some masonry walls. Twisting and falling of chimneys, factory stacks, monuments, towers and elevated tanks. Frame
            structures, if not bolted to foundations, shift. Loose panel walls are thrown out; decayed pilings brake off. Branches brake off trees.
            Changes in flow or in temperature of springs or wells. Cracks in wet ground and on steep slopes. (6)
 IX.        General panic. Masonry D structures destroyed; masonry C heavily damaged, sometimes completely collapsed. General damage to
            foundations. Franie structures, if not bolted, shift off their foundations. Serious damage to reservoirs. Underground pipes are broken.
           ·Conspicuous cracks in the ground. In alluvial areas, sand and mud are ejected, forming sand craters.
X.          Most masonry and frame structures are destroyed. Most foundations destroyed .. Some well-built wooden strucrures and bridges are
            destroyed. Serious damage to dams, dikes, and embankments. Underground pipelines are seriously damaged. Large land.slides. Water
            thrown on banks of canals, rivers, lakes, etc. Sand and mud shifted horizontally on beaches and in flatlands. Rails bent slightly. (7)
XI.         Rails bent greatly. Underground pipelines completely out of service. Many and widespread disrurbances of the ground, including broad
            fissures, earth slumps and land slips in soft, wet ground. Sand- and mud-charged water ejected from fissures in the ground. Sea-waves
            (tidal waves or tsunami) of significant magnitude. Severe damage to wood-frame structures, especially if near to the shock center.
            Severe damage to dams, dikes and embankments. Fey,:, if any, masonry structures remain standing. Large, well-constructed bridges
            destroyed due to damage to their supporting piers or pillars. Wooden bridges are affected less. (8+)
XII.        Damage is nearly total. Lines of sight and level are distorted. Objects are thrown into the air. Great and varied disturbances of the
            grourtd, including numerous shearing cracks, landslides, large rock-falls, and numerous and widespread slumping of river banks. Fault
            slips in firm rock with notable horizontal and vertical offset. Water channels, both at the surface and underground are disturbed and
            modified. Lakes are dammed, rivers are deflected, waterfalls occur. The rolling effect of the seismic waves is actually seen at the
               ound surface.
Masonry A:         Good workmanship, mortar and design. Reinforced, especially later,a.Jly, and bound together with steel, concrete, etc. Designed
                   to resist lateral forces.
Masonry B:         Good workmanship and mortar. Reinforced, but not designed to resist lateral forces.
Masonry C:        Ordinary workmanship and mortar. Not reinforced or designed to resist horizontal forces.
Masonry D:        Weak materials, such as adobe; poor mortar. Low standards of workmanship weak horizontally.
These masonry types are not to be confused with the conventional Class A, B, and C construction types.
