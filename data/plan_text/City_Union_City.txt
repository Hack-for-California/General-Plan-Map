                     COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
               INTRODUCTION
               New development and redevelopment can help define and provide a stronger identity for
               Union City. The City’s overarching community design goal is to strengthen Union City's
               identity by improving the quality of places and images throughout the city. The City can do
               this in several ways. First, the City can preserve the character and identity of its older
               neighborhoods (i.e., Alvarado and Decoto). Over the past four decades this historical
               character has been slowly eroding. Preserving these areas will help to maintain the
               residents’ ties to the past. Second, the City is now moving away from low-density walled
               residential neighborhoods and automobile-oriented street patterns and shopping areas that
               have dominated the built environment over the last forty years and move towards mixed-use
               development with more intensive employment centers and pedestrian oriented/transit-friendly
               development. Third, the City can create better connections between neighborhoods. Fourth,
               Union City has a tremendous potential for gateway enhancement since the city has a number
               of existing gateways that can create an important first impression for those
               motorists/pedestrians entering the City. Fifth, the City can enhance the aesthetic quality of
               the built environment by encouraging variety in architecture, public art programs, thematic
               signage, and streetscape improvements. Sixth, the City can improve the relationship between
               the built and natural environment by ensuring that new development respects the natural
               setting by blending in with the surrounding landscape as well as protecting visual access to
               Union City’s natural features. Lastly, the City can create a more environmentally sustainable
               community by encouraging green development practices in buildings and landscaping. The
               Community Design Element seeks to accomplish these goals by focusing on the following
               general concepts: distinctive districts, important civic corridors, and gateways.
               A. GENERAL
                 Goal         To ensure high quality appearance and harmony between existing and new
                 CD-A.1       uses, while avoiding monotony in style, height, and mass.
               Policies
CD-A.1.1       The City shall encourage development that is visually and functionally compatible with the
               surrounding neighborhoods by:
               a.       Maintaining a height and density of development that is compatible with adjacent
                        developed neighborhoods;
               b.       Accenting entrances to new neighborhoods with varied landscaping, hardscaping,
                        and signage treatment; and
               c.       Providing various points where residents can enter the wetland/baylands and access
                        the internal bicycle and pedestrian circulation systems.

CD-A.1.2          The City shall ensure that the design of
                  new development is bicycle and
                  pedestrian-friendly (e.g., sidewalks that
                  are well shaded and safe from
                  automobile traffic, bicycle facilities) and
                  oriented toward the use of transit.
CD-A.1.3          The City, through the Arts Committee,
                  shall prepare a citywide public art
                  program that encourages the placement
                  art displays (sculptures, fountains, etc.) in
                  public places throughout Union City.            Clubhouse at Monte Vista development

                  development to build or contribute to
                  public art. On projects that provide public art, the art shall be placed in highly visible, high
                  traffic areas such as front yards, plazas, and entryways.
CD-A.1.5          The City shall emphasize Union City’s natural features as the visual framework for new
                  development and redevelopment.
CD-A.1.6          The City shall ensure that the design of all new residential development achieves a sense of
                  visual integration and orderliness, but shall promote diversity in terms of specific design
solutions.
CD-A.1.7          While linear elements such as roads, utility
corridors, and rail lines create physical boundaries for
neighborhoods, the City should make every effort to identify
and implement design solutions that will, physically and
emotionally link new neighborhoods with other residential
neighborhoods and make neighborhood residents feel a part
of the larger Union City community.
CD-A.1.8          T he City shall use different landscaping
themes to help accent and distinguish different
neighborhoods, as well as to signal transitions from public        Entrance to multi-family development on
areas to private areas.                                            Mission Boulevard
CD-A.1.9          The City shall require that entrances to new
neighborhoods be accented with different landscaping, pavement, and signage treatments.
CD-A.1.10         The City shall strive to provide a social, recreational center of focus to enhance
                  neighborhood identity and function.
CD-2                                                                                             Updated March 2006

               B. DISTINCTIVE DISTRICTS
               Union City has a number of distinctive districts—Station District, Central Technology Center,
               Union Landing, International Market Place, Decoto, and Old Alvarado — that serve as
               important residential, shopping, and employment centers. This Element seeks to enhance the
               image of these districts and neighborhoods by improving the aesthetic quality of the built
               environment, creating pedestrian-friendly and transit-friendly environments, and connecting
               the district to surrounding neighborhoods.
                 Goal         To develop and design the Station District at a level of quality commensurate
                 CD-B.1       with its role as a major transit hub, business center, and residential address
                              and to design the Station District so as to signify Union City's rising status as
                              the "Gateway to Silicon Valley."
               Policies
CD-B.1.1       The City shall require that development in the Station District be of the highest architectural
               quality and reflect the image of Union City in the 21st century. The City shall avoid visual
               monotony by encouraging variety in architectural styles.
CD-B.1.2       The City shall prepare design guidelines for the Station District that establish architectural
               continuity, including a strong street orientation, building massing, creating active building
               edges along streets and pathways, continuing the historic street grid pattern and reinforcing
               a pleasant and safe pedestrian street environment.
CD-B.1.3       T he City shall require that the Station District be pedestrian-friendly with a design that
               minimizes the impact of parking on the quality of the streetscape and the neighborhood.

               links to the intermodal facility.
CD-B.1.6       The City shall require that all new projects be designed to achieve visual harmony and quality
               within the Station District. Views to and from the hills should be preserved. A graceful
               transition from the flatlands to the hillsides should be promoted.
CD-B.1.7       The City shall develop a streetscape master plan that outlines a unified design theme
               consisting of landscaping, sidewalks, pedestrian street crossings, and lighting.
CD-B.1.8       The City shall ensure that mixed use development around the intermodal facility includes
               ground-floor retail commercial uses.
CD-4                                                                                      Updated March 2006

City of Union City                                                                      Community Design Element
CD-B.1.9           The City shall ensure that the Station District has strong pedestrian connections to
                   surrounding neighborhoods and to greater Union City. The City shall create strong
                   connections between the intermodal facility and the bikeway/trail system.
CD-B.1.10          The City should ensure overall visual integration of site improvements in the design of
                   commercial, office, and similar non-residential uses, but allow for structural diversity that will
                   result in an attractive and vibrant environment.
CD-B.1.11          The City shall encourage a mix of residential densities within the Station District when such
                   mix will enhance the opportunities for neighborhood design. Specific objectives include
                   unique streetscapes with a sense of openness, landscaping opportunities, and varied building
                   setbacks. Further, mixed densities should be permitted when this approach will allow
                   maximizing open space and recreational opportunities within the neighborhood.
CD-B.1.12          The City shall establish design guidelines for commercial, office, and other business uses that
                   enhance the sense of the Station District as being a special place. The City shall provide for
                   the integration of new uses from site to site and in terms of links to mass transit facilities.

                   to the area. The City should encourage tall mixed-use buildings adjacent to the intermodal
                   facility designed to provide a landmark image for the area. However, in allowing taller
                   buildings, the City should take special care to avoid blocking significant views from adjoining
                   existing and planned uses.
CD-B.1.14          The City shall promote visual excitement within individual projects through building design
                   and the way components of the project are assembled on the site. Massing of structures and
                   arrangement of spaces should add interest, provide separation between public and private
                   areas, and offer relief from parking areas and busy streets.
CD-B.1.15          The City shall ensure that the design of the Intermodal Station provides a focal point for
                   connecting streets and pedestrian-ways.
CD-B.1.16          The City shall ensure the design of the Intermodal Station provides a central geometric focus
                   and form that reflects its civic and regional importance.
CD-B.1.17          The City shall promote the development of visible civic and community uses within the
                   Station District.
CD-B.1.18          The City shall ensure the Intermodal Station includes numerous pedestrian amenities, such
                   as overhead weather protection between transit facilities.
CD-B.1.19          The City shall provide thematic signage and wayfinding signage within the Station District.
CD-B.1.20          The intermodal facility should be a major architectural landmark for Union City.
CD-B.1.21          The City shall ensure that the Station District has clear connections to the citywide network
                   of open spaces.

CD-B.1.22      The City shall strongly encourage BART to incorporate the Intermodal Station District and
               Transit Facility Plan as developed by the Intermodal Action Team and approved by the City
               Council when BART expands the station, constructs the bus facility or develops its property
               for more intensive uses.
CD-B.1.23      The City shall incorporate the Intermodal Station District and Transit Facility Plan land use
               and design recommendations into the site development of all lands within the Station District.
               See Appendix C for the land use plan, transit facility plan and design recommendations.
CD-B.1.24      The City shall require that the design of buildings and landscaping on the west side of Union
               Square screen the service area at the rear of Rite Aid and improve and enhance the
               pedestrian connection between the transit facility on BART property and the Marketplace
               commercial center.
CD-B.1.25      The City shall provide a high level of maintenance to keep public property, streets and
               landscaping clean and in prime condition at the transit facility and in the Station District.
CD-B.1.26      The City shall require that all bike pathways in the Station District be paved with a smooth
               material appropriate for wheelchairs, strollers, skates, etc.
CD-B.1.27      The City shall require that any tunnel connecting the BART property to the PG&E property
               be designed with “mall-like” atmosphere that incorporates retail wherever possible, creates
               an environment that maximizes light and spaciousness, and has high quality finishes.
CD-B.1.28      The City shall encourage that development immediately around the BART station be seven
               or more stories in height and that buildings further away from the BART station decrease
               in height to meet the scale of the existing neighborhoods, as recommended in the Intermodal
               Station District and Transit Facility Plan.
CD-B.1.29      The City shall discourage the use of sound walls and gated communities in the Station
               District, while recognizing that safety and security will need to be addressed.
CD-B.1.30      The City shall require that multi-family housing be designed for the safety and security of
               children, and provide amenities for children, such as playgrounds, within the complex.
CD-B.1.31      The City shall design for the safety and security of children in the development of any
               outdoor play areas within the Station District.

CD-B.3.1           The City should integrate all uses within the Union Landing District by an attractive,
                   well-landscaped circulation system that accommodates public transportation facilities, private
                   vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. In particular, the design should encourage pedestrian
                   movement between activity areas. Further, the City should make attractive pedestrian links
                   to adjacent residential areas outside of Union Landing.
CD-B.3.2           The City should cluster buildings around landscaped pedestrian areas. Buildings should have
                   good visibility afforded to retailers. All buildings should be unified by architectural design,
                   signing, lighting, etc.; and, as appropriate, should be
                   in harmony with the design of similar public
                   facilities, structures and signing.
CD-B.3.3           The City shall require that all public facilities and
                   structures, and other features be unified through

                   D. GATEWAYS
                   Entries into the city limits or “gateways” are
important to Union City’s image because they provide
important "first impressions" for motorists and pedestrians
entering the city. These images are important to patrons of
Union City's shopping districts, businesses that may wish to Gateway on Union City Boulevard entering
                                                                    from Hayward
locate in the city, and residents. The city has several points
of entry, including regional freeway entries and community
gateways, that provide access to key residential and commercial neighborhoods. Through such measures as
streetscape improvements and signage, the city will help define the gateways.
                     Goal         To create positive first impressions for motorists/pedestrians entering the city
                     CD-D.1       through enhancement of the city’s gateways.
                   Policies
CD-D.1.1           The City shall enhance all city gateways by providing city identification signs, additional
                   lighting, and accent planting.
CD-D.1.2           The City shall provide attractive landscaping that reduces the visual impact of sound walls
                   near gateways into Union City.
CD-D.1.3           The City shall consider landscape and sign enhancements along rail corridors to provide
                   attractive city entries for BART and other commuter rail patrons.
CD-D.1.4           In addition to landscape and signage improvements, the City shall site new development to
                   help define the gateways.
                   Implementation Programs
CD-D.1             The City shall develop a gateway streetscaping and sign plan that will outline an
                   improvement program for key entryways into the city.

               E. NATURAL SETTING
               Union City's built environment is bounded by natural features. Union City is blessed with
               beautiful hills, salt marshes, and meandering creeks/streams. Not only do these natural
               features provide important functional benefits such as providing quiet retreats and recreation
               opportunities (i.e., trails), but they are key components for maintaining a strong city identity.
                In order to preserve this identity, the City must ensure that development adjacent to natural
               features responds to the context of views and natural forms. Therefore, the following
               policies emphasize providing visual and physical access to Union City's natural features.
                 Goal         To provide a dramatic backdrop to the city by maintaining views of the hills
                 CD-E.1       as a distinctive visual and environmental feature.
               Policies
CD-E.1.1       The City shall maintain visual access to hillside views by regulating building orientation,
               height, and bulk.
CD-E.1.2       The City shall minimize the viewshed impacts of development at the base of the hillsides.
CD-E.1.3       The City shall respect the natural setting of the hillside area by encouraging hill-edge
               development to incorporate natural landscape features.
CD-E.1.4       To enhance hillside open space views, the City shall orient hill-edge development (i.e.,
               development on flat land at the base of the hillside) towards the hillside.
CD-E.1.5       The City shall, whenever feasible, require all public facilities and new development
               (especially in the vicinity of Mission Boulevard and Whipple Road) to use low-energy
               shielded lights so they are directed downward for better efficiency and to minimize nighttime
               glare that might impair views of the surrounding hillsides and become a nuisance for the
               Masonic Home.
                 Goal         To provide visual and physical access to the bay marsh edge.

CD-E.2.2           The City shall minimize the visual impact of
                   marsh-edge development through the use
                   of buffers such as pedestrian trails, linear
                   parks, and landscaped rights of way.
CD-E.2.3           The City shall ensure that new
                   development respects its natural setting by
                   maintaining     visual harmony with the        View from Union City Boulevard of marshland
                   wetlands area.                                 and Coyote Hills beyond

                     Goal         To enhance creeks as visual and trail resources and make connections
                     CD-E.3       between community parks, schools, residential, and commercial destinations.
                   Policies
CD-E.3.1           Where feasible, the City should restore the natural edges along the city’s creek system by
                   planting natural vegetation.
CD-E.3.2           The City shall work with the Alameda County Flood Control to open up creek edges to
                   pedestrian and bicycle access.
CD-E.3.3           The City shall in collaboration with Alameda County Flood Control prepare a creek system
                   master plan that identifies potential improvements to the creek system.
CD-E.3.4           Wherever practical, the City shall require the frontage of new development to be oriented
                   towards adjacent creeks and provide visual access to creeks.
CD-E.3.5           When possible, the City shall locate open space and parks adjacent to creeks.
CD-E.3.6           The City shall encourage site planning that incorporates the creek edge into the overall
                   development.

               F. ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
               Union City can create a more environmentally and economically sustainable community by
               incorporating green measures into the design, construction, operation and maintenance of
               buildings and landscaping within the city. Green measures include promoting new
               development and redevelopment that encourages resource conservation, energy and water
               efficiency, waste reduction, pollution prevention, indoor air quality, and the preservation of
               the natural environment. Sustainable building, landscaping, and purchasing practices can help
               preserve and protect the natural environment, reduce the cost of operations and
               maintenance, and contribute to the health and productivity of residents, workers, and visitors
               to the city.

       ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
       INTRODUCTION
       A strong economic and fiscal base is critical to developing and maintaining Union City's prosperity.
       Union City has many locational advantages that make it a draw for business, including its potential as a
       transportation nexus; its location along the Nimitz Freeway (Interstate 880) and at the gateway of the
       Silicon Valley; and its proximity to Stanford, U.C. Berkeley, and Palo Alto venture capitalists.
       This strategic location at the edge of Silicon Valley creates an opportunity for Union City to attract light
       industrial establishments which will create more job opportunities for local residents, reduce the need to
       commute, and diversify the local economy away from being a bedroom community and warehouse center.
        But, Union City has a limited supply of vacant land and lacks some of the amenities that are important to
       attract the desired economic base. It is important to note that Union City has made great strides over the
       last several years to add amenities to the community that are important to economic development, such as
       the construction of upscale housing, the expansion of restaurants and the construction of a new hotel.
       These amenities coupled with the city’s diverse population and strong commitment to the local school
       system provide the community qualities needed to attract high-tech and corporate jobs.
       Union City's economic development challenge is to balance its goal to expand its position within Silicon
       Valley with its need to create a stronger sense of community identity. The Economic Development
       Element addresses this balance by identifying a set of economic development goals, policies, and
       implementation programs that focus primarily on six business districts: Station District (encompassing
       Decoto Industrial Park, BART station, and the El Mercado, and Market Place shopping centers), the
       Central Technology Center (i.e., Central Bay Industrial Park), Alvarado Technology Center, Union
       Landing, the International Market Place (i.e., Four Corners), and the Mission Boulevard entryway
       corridor.
       Other retail centers, business parks, and commercial corridors not specifically identified in the economic
       development goals, policies, and implementation steps are also important parts of the City's economy and
       future. But, the Economic Development Element suggests that private sector investment decisions and
       the City's normal zoning and permitting procedures will guide changes in these areas, and that City efforts
       to diversify its economy will focus primarily on the six key business districts.

            B. STATION DISTRICT
            The greater Station District is the community's greatest opportunity for redevelopment of
            underutilized and vacant lands around the BART station. The District consists of three subareas
            that are delineated by rail tracks. The most northeasterly area is the interior of the existing
            Decoto Industrial Park and is bounded by the former Southern Pacific tracks to the southwest and
            single-family residences to the northeast.
            This area is envisioned to support research and development campus (designated RDC). Many
            of the existing businesses have 30-year “longevity” agreements with the City Council. These
            agreements were developed based upon recommendations in the DIPSA Specific Plan.
            Several of the properties, however, are undeveloped or underutilized parcels. Twenty-four acres
            of vacant land are located directly adjacent to the former Southern Pacific rail line (also the
            current Capital Corridor/Amtrak line). Several other parcels in the area are underutilized. The
            Air Liquide operation located on a seven-acre site on Decoto Road at 7th Street is considering
            relocating and the site appears prime for private redevelopment.
ED-4                                                                                      February 2002

 City of Union City                                                              Economic Development Element
         The central area of the Station District is bounded by the former Southern Pacific rail line to the northeast
         and Union Pacific/BART tracks to the southwest. This area includes the PG&E site and the PSSC site.
         PG&E is interested in redeveloping their lands with more intensive uses. The PSSC property is proposed
         to redevelop with residential and research and development/light industrial/office uses. Any development
         on the PSSC property will be a negotiated between the City, property owners, and the appointed Federal
         court representative.
         The lands on the southwest side of the BART station are known as the BART property (the BART
         parking lot) and the Litke property (the bowling alley and the auto repairs businesses), which total
         approximately 20 acres. Litke is interested in redeveloping his property with a multi-family residential
         project. BART is interested in intensifying development on their site and is willing to explore joint
         development opportunities.
         The BART station, located at the center of the Station District, is targeted for expansion into a major
         regional transit hub. The site currently serves BART, AC Transit, Dumbarton Express, and Union City
         Transit. The proposed development of an intermodal facility includes passenger rail service and improved
         bus transfer facilities. Essentially, this area will become a transit hub that connects the East Bay to Silicon
         Valley and the Peninsula, which will, in turn, stimulate more intensive residential, employment, and
         commercial development in the surrounding neighborhood.
         The new intermodal facility centered on the BART station will create market conditions that attract new
         residents and knowledge-intensive firms that want to be located within walking distance of regional
         transit, eating and drinking establishments, fitness centers, and other support services important to the
         "new economy."
         In total, there are approximately 200 acres of lands in the greater Station District area. Approximately
         150 acres are ripe for development or redevelopment over the twenty year life of the General Plan,
         including the vacant 24 acres in the Decoto Industrial Park, the PG&E, Air Liquide, PSSC, BART, and
         Litke properties.
                    Goal             To transform the Station District into a unique place that takes advantage
                    ED-B.1           of transit-oriented development opportunities.
                   Policies
ED-B.1.1           The City shall encourage higher intensity development by allowing additional employment,
                   commercial, and residential space to be developed and redeveloped within walking distance of
                   the intermodal facility.
ED-B.1.2           The City shall support creation of expandable structured parking near the intermodal facility in
                   order to promote more intensive use of the station.
February 2002                                                                                      ED-5

ED-B.1.3     The City shall improve pedestrian and bicycle access (e.g., constructing a pedestrian overpass or
             underpass) to the intermodal facility and improve the traffic management and urban design of the
             properties surrounding the intermodal facility)
ED-B.1.4     The City shall seek businesses that take advantage of public transit.
               Goal         To take a proactive planned approach to the development and
               ED-B.2       redevelopment of the Station District.
            Policies
ED-B.2.1    The City shall take a leadership role in guiding the development and redevelopment of the Station
            District, including the Decoto Industrial Park, the intermodal facility, and adjacent commercial
            and residential properties.
ED-B.2.2    The City shall take a leadership role in transforming the Decoto Industrial Park into a light
            industrial business park in the area bounded by 7th Street, the Southern Pacific railroad tracks,
            Decoto Road and the proposed SR 84 right-of-way. The development of new housing
            immediately adjacent to the light industrial business park should be discouraged without the
            preparation of a design plan that takes into account appropriate buffering between such uses.
              Goal              To attract business tenants and developers to invest and implement the
              ED-B.3            City's economic development objectives.
            Policies
ED-B.3.1    The City shall identify and select developers willing to invest and implement the agreed upon
            vision presented in the General Plan and Economic Development Strategy.
ED-B.3.2    The City shall invest its resources in a public/private partnership with developers to attract
            business to the Station District.
ED-B.3.3     The City shall use business incentives (including redevelopment tax increment revenues) to
             achieve City objectives within the Station District.
ED-B.3.4     The City shall identify Federal, State, local and other public funding sources to make required
             infrastructure and circulation improvements within the Station District.
             Implementation Programs
ED-B.1       The City shall use redevelopment tax increment revenues to improve pedestrian access to and
             from the intermodal facility. Other borrowing sources, such as municipal bonds, should be
             considered if tax increment revenues are insufficient. The following types of improvements
             should be funded:

            C. CENTRAL TECHNOLOGY CENTER AND
                ALVARADO TECHNOLOGY CENTER
            The Central Technology Center, otherwise known as the
            Central Bay Industrial Park, covers 320 acres which are
            mostly built out and occupied by a mix of light
            industrial, food processing, warehouse, and high
            technology firms. The Central Technology Center is the
            busiest and most employment-intensive business park in
            Union City. A few small sites are available for infill
            development. Tenant turnover creates opportunities for
            property upgrades and building reuse.
            The Alvarado Technology Center, located in the northwest part of Union City, is the second
            largest business park. Most of the current uses at this site consist of light industrial and
            warehousing. Most of the nearly 214-acre area is built out, with only 16 acres that are considered
            vacant or underutilized. Similar to the Central Technology Center, this area represents one of
            the City’s best opportunities for conversion to employment-intensive uses such as research and
            development.
            One of Union City's long-term economic
            development challenges is to manage the
            transformation of these areas into true
            technology centers with expanded buyer and
            supplier linkages to Silicon Valley firms. Firms
            that supply San Mateo and Santa Clara County
            technology companies are primary targets to
            attract to Union City. The transformation of
            these areas into true technology centers requires
            retrofitting entire business centers, not just
            individual buildings. The development of a
            range of support services such as cafes,
            restaurants, and health clubs should enhance
            the success of the Central Technology Center
            and Alvarado Technology Center.
              Goal              To actively attract new business establishments to the Central
              ED-C.1            Technology Center and the Alvarado Technology Center with a focus on
                                Silicon Valley firms seeking lower land costs.
            Policies
ED-C.1.1    The City shall seek to attract firms to the Central Technology Center and the Alvarado
            Technology Center and not rely solely on the efforts of private real estate brokers. Instead, the
            City should adopt a proactive effort to market vacant parcels and available buildings to the types
            of firms that meet local economic development objectives.
ED-C.1.2    The City shall develop and maintain a database of warehouse and light industrial buildings
            available for reuse and redevelopment.
ED-8                                                                                     February 2002

ED-C.1.3        The City should encourage additional business support services to be developed within the
                Central Technology Center and the Alvarado Technology Center such as food-oriented retail
                services, childcare services, and health clubs. Business support services should be clustered
                strategically within the technology centers.
                 Goal               To support the conversion of warehouses to light industrial, research
                 ED-C.2             and development, or other higher-intensity employment uses.
                Policies
ED-C.2.1        The City shall promote the conversion of warehouse buildings into more employment-intensive
                light industrial and research and development facilities.
ED-C.2.2        The City shall work with property owners and businesses to devise solutions to parking problems
                caused by warehouse conversion into more employment-intensive uses. Allowance for offsite
                parking, shared parking, and increased transit services should be considered.
ED-C.2.3        The City shall establish express transit connections from the Central Technology Park and the
                Alvarado Technology Center to the intermodal facility.
                 Goal               To develop a business incubator facility that can accommodate
                 ED-C.3             technology industry start-ups and better link Union City to Silicon
                                    Valley.
                Policies
ED-C.3.1        The City shall prepare a business incubator feasibility study.
ED-C.3.2        The City shall identify a site within the Central Technology Center where an existing facility
                could be purchased and retrofitted, or where a build-to-suit incubator could be constructed.
February 2002                                                                              ED-9

            Implementation Programs
ED-C.1      The City shall review and make appropriate zoning and permit requirement changes as they apply
            to the Central Technology Center and Alvarado Technology Center regarding the development
            of flex space along with additional business support services. This includes the allowance of
            building conversion for additional support services such as food oriented retail, health, childcare,
            and others.

ED-C.2      The City shall study the feasibility of warehouse conversion. A warehouse-building owner within
            the Central Technology Center or Alvarado Technology Center could be identified to offer
            his/her facility for a study prototype, and the City should study the feasibility of converting the
            facility to light industrial or other employment-intensive uses. The results should be marketed to
            potential investors.

ED-C.5          The City shall prepare a business incubator study. The study should include the identification of
                possible sites, tenant prospects, a management plan, and financial feasibility analysis. The study
                should also explore potential collaborations with the neighboring cities of Hayward, Fremont,
                and Newark since the facility will likely need public subsidies. The study should also identify
                potential private sector investment partners who can help develop and manage the incubator
                facility.

                D. UNION LANDING
                The development of Union Landing adjacent to Interstate 880 puts Union City on the regional
                retail map. Currently (February 2001), the 104-acre site has yet to be fully built out with
                approximately 75 percent that has been developed. The existing commercial uses are anchored by
                a 25-screen Century Theater complex, a 150,000
                square foot Wal-Mart store, and a 66,000 square
                foot Albertson's supermarket. The properties with
                direct access to the I-880 freeway will soon
                accommodate a new Lowes and Best Buy, which
                will transform Union Landing into a power center
                with multiple anchor tenants. The economic
                development challenge for this area involves
                managing the full build-out and ensuring that the
                area remains competitive as a regional retail
                destination.
                  Goal              To ensure the full build out of Union Landing to include a mix of
                  ED-D.1            businesses.
                Policies
ED-D.1.1        The City shall continue to attract business to Union Landing's available properties.

ED-D.1.2    The City may include some non-retail business in the mix for Union Landing. For example, a
            multiple-story office building may fit well with existing retailers, and provide retailers with an
            additional pool of daytime retail shoppers.
             Goal               To ensure that Union Landing remains a retail destination that is
             ED-D.2             competitive in the regional market place.
            Policies
ED-D.2.1    The City shall use available resources to increase developer fees and tax increment revenues to
            finance infrastructure, urban design, parking, traffic management, and pedestrian flow
            improvements to Union Landing. Ongoing investment in the facilities and infrastructure will be
            needed to ensure that the area adapts to changing market conditions and remains attractive as a
            regional retail destination.
ED-D.2.2    The City shall target sub-regional commercial uses as opposed to community retail uses in Union
            Landing.
ED-D.2.3    The City shall actively seek to attract sales tax-generating uses to Union Landing.

                E. INTERNATIONAL MARKET PLACE
                Located at the intersection of Alvarado Boulevard and Dyer Street are four community and
                neighborhood shopping centers commonly known as the Four Corners. The area is anchored by
                the International Market, Rite Aid, Fremont Bank, three service stations, two free-standing fast
                food restaurants, and about a dozen Asian restaurants and specialty stores.
                The economic development goal for this area is to transform Four Corners into the International
                Market Place, which will take advantage of Union City's ethnic diversity. A successful
                transformation of this area will require a substantial amount of new private and public
                investment.
                 Goal               To expand private investment to develop additional retail space at the
                 ED-E.1             International Market Place.

                from the International Market Place.
ED-E.1.5        The City shall consider using Redevelopment Agency funds, when necessary, in order to
                stimulate private investment.
                GOAL              To attract international food and other retailers to the International
                ED-E.2            Market Place so that consumers from throughout the region will shop in the

                The area along Mission Boulevard between Decoto Road and the Hayward city boundary is a key
                entryway corridor for Union City. The corridor is characterized by poorly maintained,
                underutilized commercial buildings, a trailer park, and scattered housing sites. It is the City's
                intention to transform this corridor so that it becomes a visibly distinctive gateway into Union
                City from Hayward.

ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ELEMENT
   INTRODUCTION
   Sustainability is defined as the ability to “meet the needs of the present without
   compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” The three
   components of a sustainable community are a prosperous economy, a quality
   environment and social equity. As stated in the introduction to the General Plan, Union
   City’s vision to be a “Prosperous and Compassionate City” is a major theme that is
   supported by the Economic Development Element and Youth, Family, Seniors, and
   Health Element. This Element focuses on environmental sustainability, which seeks to
   minimize the impact of daily activities on the natural environment in order to preserve
   and improve the quality of life available to current and future generations.
   Sustainability is a global issue of increasing urgency. The public’s awareness of climate
   change has dramatically increased the need to create sustainable communities. Union
   City has the ability to become more environmentally sustainable by reducing its
   ecological footprint.
   The General Plan has several sections related to achieving environmental sustainability.
   The Community Design Element provides for the restoration of impacted environmental
   resources, such as the City’s creek system, hillside area, and salt marshes. The
   Transportation Element promotes biking, walking, and the use of public transit. The
   Health and Safety Element strives to protect air quality by minimizing emissions of air
   pollutants. The Natural and Historic Resources Element prioritizes the preservation of the
   City’s open space as well as biological and water resources. The Public Facilities and
   Services Element aims to conserve natural resources by reducing the waste stream and
   conserving water.
   While these other Elements contain goals, policies, and implementation programs that
   promote environmental sustainability, this Element focuses the City’s vision to be more
   environmentally responsible. The Element provides a comprehensive policy framework
   to guide the City’s green efforts and provide a foundation upon which to build future
   programs and practices.
   The City will act as a leader, facilitator, and educator within the community to promote
   resource conservation, pollution prevention, and waste reduction. In particular, Union
   City has many opportunities to be more sustainable in the areas of business, design, and
   transportation. This Element highlights the importance of involvement from all members
   of the community including residents, business owners, and developers. Together, we can
   effectuate change and ensure that Union City will be a healthy community for future
   generations.

               One of the major challenges to creating a more environmentally sustainable community
               is reducing automobile dependence. The largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions
               in Union City is vehicle exhaust. Although much of Union City is built out, we have
               remaining opportunities to minimize auto usage by encouraging high-density, mixed-use,
               pedestrian-friendly development. Through development projects, particularly within the
               Station District area, the City has the ability to promote the use of public transportation,
               walking, and bicycling and support the creation of new alternatives to driving.

                HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT
              INTRODUCTION
              To maintain a high quality of life for Union City residents, the City must minimize natural
              hazard risks (e.g., earthquakes, wildfire, flooding) as well as manmade hazards and
              nuisances (e.g., noise, poor air quality, hazardous materials). Union City has several health
              and safety threats that may affect the quality of life its residents including: three major fault
              zones; roadway and air traffic noise; significant levels of CO, ozone, and PM10; and dam
              innundation threats during a major seismic event.
              The purpose of this Element is to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the
              community from any “unreasonable risks” while minimizing damage to structures, property,
              and infrastructure resulting from natural and man-made hazards. In consideration of the
              current energy crisis, the City should also focus attention on reducing energy consumption
              while identifying safe electrical generators for residential and/or business use to meet energy
              shortfalls.
              Background information on terminology used in environmental acoustics and a detailed
              discussion of Federal and State guidelines for evaluating noise are provided in the General
              Plan Background Report.
              A. GENERAL
                Goal        To protect the public health and safety and minimize the damage to

                            hazards.
              Policies
HS-A.1.1      The City shall evaluate proposed projects and land use policy decisions based on the

               B. GEOLOGY AND SOILS
               The City’s Planning Area encompasses two distinctly different geologic and geomorphic
               regions that are separated by the northwest trending Hayward fault zone, located just east
               of Mission Boulevard. The western, urbanized half of the planning area is characterized by
               the low-lying, gently sloping and nearly level alluvial and estuarine landforms that surround
               the San Francisco Bay. The less developed (open space and agricultural uses) portions of
               the Planning Area lie east of the Hayward fault zone and are characterized by the strongly
               sloping and steep upland landforms of the northwest-trending East Bay Hills, which separate
               San Francisco Bay from the Livermore Valley to the northeast.
               The primary limitations of these upland soils to urban development stem from the steep
               slopes on which they occur, which make them highly susceptible to water erosion and
               landsliding. Soils with high shrink-swell potential, which can also impose limitations on
               certain types of urban development, exist in some of the eastern, upland portions of the
               Planning Area as well.
February 2002                                                                                          HS-3

Health and Safety Element                                                                City of Union City
               Soils on the nearly level floodplains and tidal flats that occupy the westernmost portions of
               the Planning Area consist of very deep, poorly-drained clays and silty clays formed from
               fine-grained alluvium. These soils have
               slow permeability, no hazard of erosion
               unless distributed, and are often
               moderately alkaline.          The primary
               limitations of the alluvial soils west of the
               Hayward fault zone to urban development
               stem from their physical attributes, which
               make them susceptible to various types of
               ground-failures including settlement and
               differential settlement, subsidence, and
               earthquake-induced liquefaction. Soils
               with high shrink-swell potential are thicker
               and more extensive on the alluvial
               landforms west of the Hayward fault zone
               than in the uplands east of the fault zone, Hillsides seen from Dry Creek, east of Mission
               and therefore may impose greater Boulevard
               limitations on urban development than in
               the upland areas.
               Segments of three major, northwest-trending fault zones fall within the boundaries of the
               Planning Area: the Hayward fault zone, the Mission fault zone, and the Silver Creek fault
               zone. However, of these three fault zones, only the Hayward fault zone contains fault traces
               that exhibit physical evidence of displacement during historic times. Although the
               likelihood is greatest that the next major San Francisco Bay Area earthquake will occur on
               the Hayward fault, major earthquake events on other active Bay Area faults, such as the San
               Andreas and the Calaveras faults, would also likely affect Union City. The relative intensity
               of ground shaking expected to occur in the Planning Area as a result of characteristic
               earthquake events on some nearby active faults are listed in Table HS-1.
               The most extreme groundshaking is expected to occur as a result of earthquakes on the
               Hayward fault. Groundshaking intensity is expected to be greatest on the alluvial landforms
               that lie west of the Hayward fault zone due to their fine textured sediments and soils. These
               conditions tend to amplify seismic waves to a greater extent than the hard bedrock that
               underlies the upland landforms east of the Hayward fault zone.

                    Liquefaction is a process by which water-saturated soils and sediments lose strength and fail
                    during strong seismic groundshaking. Liquefaction hazards are most commonly associated
                    with water saturated, noncohesive silty soils and sediments located within 50 feet of the
                    ground surface. Liquefaction hazard maps (Association of Bay Area Governments
                    (ABAG), 1983) indicate that the relative hazard or "susceptibility" of soils and sediments
                    in the City's Planning Area to liquefaction is considered low in the steep uplands east of the
                    Hayward fault zone and high to very high on the gently sloping and nearly level alluvial
                    landforms west of the Hayward Fault zone.
                       Goal         To minimize the risks associated with geologic and soils hazards in order to
                       HS-B.1       protect public health, safety, and property.
                    Policies
HS-B.1.1            The City shall require investigations by both registered soils engineers and engineering
                    geologists prior to issuing building permits or discretionary approvals (i.e., general plan
                    amendment, rezoning, conditional use permit, tentative subdivision map, etc.) for any new
                    construction unless waived due to current existing information and location. Soils
                    engineering reports shall specifically address secondary seismic hazards, especially potential
                    for soil liquefaction, ground shaking, lateral spreading, local subsidence and lurch cracking.
                    All such reports shall be independently evaluated, on behalf of the City, for completeness
                    and accuracy.
                    a.        All development proposals for lands west of Union City Boulevard shall coordinate
                              with Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District to evaluate
                              the stability of all levees in order to identify potential hazards and necessary
                              mitigation measures. Such evaluation will be the responsibility of the applicant(s)
                              to prepare.
                    b.        Soils and geologic engineering reports shall be required for sites within the "Special
                              Seismic Studies Zone" and lands east of Mission Boulevard to deal specifically with
                              risks related to primary effects of ground rupture along fault traces and secondary
                              seismic effects of slope instability and erosion control.
February 2002                                                                                                 HS-5
Health and Safety Element                                                                 City of Union City
               c.       For buildings larger than single-family residences, there shall be a soils report and
                        an engineer-of-record. Contract services for structural review of plans, when
                        necessary, should be done at the applicant’s expenses. Soils engineer reports shall
                        address secondary seismic hazards, especially potential for soil liquefaction, lateral
                        spreading and lurch cracking.
HS-B.1.2       The City shall file and maintain geologic and soils reports and information by parcel number
               or street address.
HS-B.1.3       The City shall review and regularly update its geologic hazard mapping based on new
               information, including soils and geologic reports for specific sites and updated maps from
               the State Geologist.
HS-B.1.4       The City shall continue to implement updated editions of the Uniform Building Code
               published by the International Conference of Building Officials.
HS-B.1.5       All environmental analyses submitted to the City under the California Environmental
               Quality Act in support of development proposals shall include sections evaluating seismic
               and geologic hazards.
HS-B.1.6       After approval of a specific plan in response to proposed development in the hillsides, the
               City shall review and amend the Hillside Combining District zoning ordinance to
               incorporate and reflect appropriate changes.
HS-B.1.7       The City shall not develop any lands which are found to contain potential geologic or
               seismic hazards defined as an "unacceptable risk.” An unacceptable risk is a level of risk
               above which specific action by government is deemed to be necessary to protect life and
               property.
HS-B.1.8       The City shall not extend utility service lines
               and streets across known or suspected active
               fault traces or active or historic slide planes.
               The City may permit exceptions when special
               engineering practices or techniques are
               employed that ensure that the extension can
               remain operational after a disaster.
HS-B.1.9       The City shall require all structures designed for
               human occupancy in high risk areas and all
               critical structures throughout the city to meet      New residential construction
               local and State-applied code regulations.
HS-B.1.10      When feasible, the City shall require the upgrading of the structural integrity of older,
               unreinforced, residential and commercial buildings. The City shall not permit major
               alterations of unreinforced masonry structures, other than single-family houses, without
               evaluation by a registered structural engineer of the adequacy of seismic resistance of the
               building in relation to the proposed use.
HS-6                                                                                          February 2002

HS-B.1.11      In the City’s Emergency Plan, the City shall plan for emergency evacuation of those areas
               that could flood as a result of levee failure, and shall include plans of evacuation of affected
               areas.
HS-B.1.12      The City shall formally request State and local water agencies to conduct periodic seismic
               evaluations of all dams, reservoirs, aqueducts (Hetch Hetchy) and water tanks which are
               located within Union City or could affect the City's post-seismic emergency operations.
               Such evaluation should encompass specific potential hazards of fault rupture, dam failure,
               inundation and interruption of water service.

               C. NOISE
               Sound is mechanical energy transmitted by pressure waves in a compressible medium such
               as air. Noise can be defined as unwanted sound. Sound is characterized by various
               parameters that include the rate of oscillation of sound waves (frequency), the speed of
               propagation, and the pressure level or energy content (amplitude). The sound pressure level
               has become the most common descriptor used to characterize the loudness of an ambient
               sound level. The decibel (dB) scale is used to quantify sound intensity. Because sound
               pressure can vary by over one trillion times within the range of human hearing, a logarithmic
               loudness scale (i.e., dB scale) is used to keep sound intensity numbers at a convenient and
               manageable level.
               Since the human ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies within the entire spectrum,
               noise measurements are weighted more heavily within those frequencies of maximum
               human sensitivity in a process called "A-weighting" written as dBA.
               Various noise descriptors have been developed to describe time-varying noise levels. The
               following noise descriptor is used by the city.
               #        Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) - CNEL is the energy average of the
                        A-weighted sound levels occurring during a 24-hour period with 10 dB added to the
                        A-weighted sound levels occurring between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. and 5 dB added to
                        the A-weighted sound levels occurring between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m.
               Noise sources within the city can be grouped into two categories: stationary (uses in a fixed
               location, such as those from industrial land uses) and mobile sources. Like most East Bay
               communities, Union City’s primary source of noise is roadway noise. Secondarily, air
               traffic noise from Bay Area airports is becoming a local concern. Other noise sources
               include rail use (including Bay Area Rapid Transit) and primary stationary sources such as
               industrial operations.
               High noise levels can interfere with a broad range of human activities including
               conversation, listening to television and radio, concentration during mental and physical
               activities, relaxation, and sleep. High levels of noise can also result in hearing loss, either
               total or partial, and either permanent or temporary.

               Policies
HS-C.1.1       The City shall consider the following land uses to be "noise sensitive":
               C        single and multi-family residential;
               C        group homes;
               C        hospitals and extended medical facilities;
               C        schools and other learning institutions;
               C        libraries; and
               C        similar uses as may be determined by the City.
HS-C.1.2       The City shall use the standards in Table HS-2 as the acceptable limits of noise for various
               land uses throughout the community. These standards specify the maximum exterior noise
               levels allowable for developments. For noise sensitive land uses, mitigation shall be
               included in structural design to reduce interior noise levels to a maximum of 45 dBA CNEL.
HS-C.1.3       For proposed development of new noise sensitive land uses as identified in HS-C.1.1, the
               City shall require a detailed noise impact analysis in areas where current or future exterior
               noise levels from transportation sources (i.e., roadway, highway/freeway, rail uses, and
               aircraft noise), or stationary sources exceed the noise standards contained in Table HS-2.
               This study shall be prepared by a qualified acoustical engineer (i.e., a Registered
               Professional Engineer in the State of California with a minimum of three years experience
               in acoustics). The study shall include recommendations and evidence to establish mitigation
               that will reduce noise exposure to an acceptable level.

               D. AIR QUALITY
               Air quality in a given location is described as the concentration of various pollutants in the
               atmosphere, generally expressed in units of parts per million (ppm) or in micrograms per
               cubic meter (ug/m3). Air quality is determined by the type and amount of regulated air
               pollutants emitted into the atmosphere, existing (ambient) air quality conditions, the size and
               topography of the regional air basin, and the prevailing meteorological conditions.
               Comparing it to Federal and State ambient air quality standards defines the significance of
               a given pollutant’s concentration. Both the State of California and the Federal Government
               have established ambient air quality standards for several different pollutants. These
               standards represent the maximum allowable atmospheric concentrations of each pollutant
               that may occur and still protect public health and welfare. For some pollutants, separate
               standards have been set for different periods. Most standards have been set to protect public
               health, but a few pollutants have standards based on additional values such as protection of
               agricultural products, protection of materials, or avoidance of nuisance conditions.

               Union City falls within the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin (SFBAAB). Within the basin
               the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) is responsible for developing
               air quality plans, monitoring air quality, and reporting air quality data for both the city of
               Union City and the surrounding area. Several pollutants are regulated by the BAAQMD;
               however, carbon monoxide, ozone, and particulate matter (e.g., PM10 and PM2.5) are of
               greatest concern due to the SFBAAB’s nonattainment status for ozone and PM10.
                 Goal         To prevent the deterioration of and to improve air quality within the
                 HS-D.1       Union City Planning Area.

               E. URBAN AND WILDLAND FIRES
               Fire hazards in the Planning Area include both grass or brush fires and structural fires. The
               potential for wildland fires is greater in the more open hillside areas in the eastern part of
               the Planning Area.
               The Union City Fire Department provides fire protection services to the City’s Planning
               Area, has signed the California Master Mutual Aid Agreement, and participates in mutual
               aid operations as requested. Levels of fire protection services provided by the Department
               in the Planning Area are discussed in the Public Facilities and Services Element.
                 Goal         To provide increased fire safety through the provision of adequate fire
                 HS-E.1       protection infrastructure, public education, and outreach programs.
               Policies
HS-E.1.1       The City shall time all future development within the city to coincide with the establishment
               of adequate fire control facilities and equipment.
HS-E.1.2       The City shall require sprinkler systems and/or smoke detectors according to Uniform Fire
               Code standards.
HS-E.1.3       The City will endeavor to reduce the risk of
               loss from brushfires in the undeveloped
               hillside areas of the city through such
               measures as landscaping with fire resistant
               plants between residential and open space
               areas, weed control, controlled burns, and
               placement of trails and roads to serve as
               firebreaks. New development within the
               hillside area will only be permitted where
               studies in support of the specific plan for
               that area demonstrate that fire safety can be
               assured. The City Fire Department will
               continue to work with land owners to ensure Residential development in the hills
               adequate land management practices are
               employed to minimize wildland fire hazard.
HS-E.1.4       The City shall require weed abatement, brush clearance and vegetative management for all
               existing properties.
HS-E.1.5       The City shall require new development in the urban/wildland interface to prepare a brush
               clearance and vegetative management program.
HS-E.1.6       The City shall maintain fire roads and keep them passable at all times.
HS-E.1.7       The City shall monitor water fire-flow capability throughout the city and improve water
               availability if any locations have flows considered inadequate for fire protection.

               9        Ongoing
               F. FLOODING
               The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has prepared flood zone maps for
               the City's Planning Area. FEMA-defined 100-year flood hazard areas include: Dry Creek,
               the M Line Channel and along the western Baylands areas of the Planning Area.
               The City’s flooding concerns are associated with potential failures of the Calaveras, Del
               Valle, and Ward Creek dams. Dam failures can result from a number of natural or manmade
               causes such as earthquakes, erosion of the dam face or foundation, landsliding, rapidly rising
               floodwaters, and structural/design flaws. All three dams are located east of the Planning
               Area. Calaveras Dam is owned by the City and County of San Francisco, and the Del Valle
               Dam is owned by the Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District.
               Failure of the Calaveras and Del Valle dams pose the greatest threats; the threat from failure
               of Ward Creek Dam is substantially less.
                 Goal        To provide flood protection which minimizes potential damage, while
                 HS-F.1      creating or enhancing existing recreational opportunities, wildlife habitats,
                             and water quality.
               Policies
HS-F.1.1       The City shall continue to participate in the Federal Flood Insurance Program and comply
               with requirements to gain acceptance into the regular phase of the program. New
               development is prohibited within the channel of Dry Creek and the M Line Channel. New
               development within Special Flood Hazard Areas outside of the channels will be prohibited
               unless mitigation measures are taken to locate improvements above flood elevations as
               required under the Flood Insurance Program.
HS-F.1.2       The City should continue to work with the Alameda County Flood Control District to
               minimize flood hazards in the community.
February 2002                                                                                        HS-15

HS-F.1.3       The City shall encourage Alameda County Flood Control District to periodically clean and
               dredge the creeks and actively encourage East Bay Regional Parks to manage and maintain
               the creeks to avoid the residue of brush from clogging the creek beds.
HS-F.1.4       The City should strive to work with the owners of the Calaveras, Del Valle, and Ward Creek
               Dams to clearly define the risk of potential failures and reasonable actions to minimize risk
               to people and property in the Planning Area.
               Implementation Programs
HS-F.1         The City shall continue to provide information to the public regarding flood zone locations
               Responsibility:
               9        Community Development Department
               9        Public Works Department
               Time Frame:
               9        On-going
HS-F.2         The City shall work with the Alameda County
               Flood Control District to implement measures for
               the abatement of flooding hazards, as appropriate.
               The measures may include, but are not limited to,
               the following: (1) removal or relocation of
               development from flood hazard areas; (2)
               construction of impoundments or channel
               diversions provided that adequate mitigation of any
               environmental impacts can be demonstrated; and
               (3) debris and silt removal programs conducted in
                                                                       Trail along Alameda Creek flood
               a manner so as not to disrupt existing sensitive
                                                                       control channel
               habitat communities.

               9        Ongoing
               F. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
               The release of hazardous materials within the City’s Planning Area can result from several
               different types of occurrences including pesticide or herbicide applications; illegal disposal
               of hazardous waste into sewer/drainage systems, at landfill sites, directly into creeks or
               streams, and dumping along roadways, and as a result of on-site or transportation-related
               accidents. While hazardous materials releases can happen almost anywhere, parts of the
               Planning Area near roadways or industrial land uses have a higher potential for the risk of
               exposure.
HS-16                                                                                        February 2002

City of Union City                                                              Health and Safety Element
                 Goal         To protect the public health and safety by reducing the use, storage, and
                 HS-G.1       disposal of toxic and hazardous substances.
               Policies
HS-G.1.1       The City shall strictly control the use, storage and transport of toxic, explosive or other
               hazardous materials and wastes at facilities within Union City.
HS-G.1.2       The City shall limit locations of hazardous materials storage and use to those areas where
               potential accidents will not cause undue risk to people and property, and where effective
               emergency response can be provided. Actions, as found appropriate, shall include the
               prohibition of certain hazardous materials, combinations of materials or quantities of
               materials in particular land use areas and/or facilities. This shall be accomplished during
               the facility review, permitting and site development review processes.
HS-G.1.3       Where potential for contamination exists or for critical facilities and/or uses, the City shall
               require an applicant for new development to prepare a Phase I and II Environmental Site
               Assessment. The property owner shall:
                        a.       Provide appropriate notification to the City, and any additional responsible
                                 agencies concerning the source(s) of any contaminate(s) found and their
                                 extent.
                        b.       Remediate all environmental hazards and contamination to the most
                                 stringent requirements of Federal, State and local law, code or practice.
HS-G.1.4       The City shall monitor the transportation of hazardous materials within the city limits.
HS-G.1.5       The City shall encourage the appropriate county and state agencies to monitor and
               respond promptly to questions and/or complaints regarding possible public health threats
               related to environmental hazards.
                        Implementation Programs
HS-G.1                  The City shall review the following for compliance with Federal, State and local

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
SECTION 5.1               INTRODUCTION
State Housing Element Law (Government Code Section 65580 (et seq.)) mandates that local governments
must adequately plan to meet the existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the
community. This Union City Housing Element Background Report provides current (as of June 2014)
information on household characteristics, housing needs, housing supply, land inventory for new
development, housing programs, and constraints. It also evaluates progress made since Union City’s last
Housing Element was adopted in 2010. The Housing Element Background Report identifies the nature
and extent of the city’s housing needs, which in turn provides the basis for the City’s response to those
needs in the Policy Document.
The previous housing element, adopted in 2010, served a five-year planning period from June 30, 2009, to
June 30, 2014. This current (2014) update of the Housing Element will serve an eight-year planning
period from January 31, 2015, to January 31, 2023.
Overview of State Requirements
State law recognizes the vital role local governments play in the supply and affordability of housing. Each
local government in California is required to adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan for the
physical development of its city or county. The housing element is one of the seven mandated elements of
the general plan. State law requires local governments to plan to address the existing and projected
housing needs of all economic segments of the community through their housing elements. The law
acknowledges that in order for the private market to adequately address housing needs and demand, local
governments must adopt land use plans and regulatory systems that provide opportunities for, and do not
unduly constrain, affordable housing development. As a result, housing policy in the state rests largely
upon the effective implementation of local general plans, and local housing elements in particular.
The purpose of the housing element is to identify the community’s housing needs; state the community’s
goals and objectives with regard to housing production, rehabilitation, conservation to meet those needs;
and define the policies and programs that the community will implement to achieve the stated goals and
objectives.
State law requires cities and counties to address the needs of all income groups in their housing elements.
The official definition of these needs is provided by the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) for each city and county within its geographic jurisdiction. Beyond
these income-based housing needs, the housing element must also address special needs groups, such as
persons with disabilities and homeless persons.
As required by State Housing Element Law (Government Code Section 65583(a)), the assessment and
inventory for this Housing Element includes the following:
            Analysis of population and employment trends and projections and a quantification of the
             locality’s existing and projected housing needs for all income levels. This analysis of existing
             and projected needs includes Union City’s share of the regional housing need.
            Analysis and documentation of household characteristics, including level of payment
             compared to ability to pay, and housing characteristics, including overcrowding and housing
             stock condition.

Adopted January 27, 2015

            Inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having
             potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning, public facilities,
             and services to these sites.
            Identification of a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a permitted use
             without a conditional use or other discretionary permit.
            Analysis of potential and actual governmental constraints upon the maintenance,
             improvement, or development of housing for all income levels and for persons with
             disabilities, including land use controls, building codes and their enforcement, site
             improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and local processing and
             permit procedures. Analysis of local efforts to remove governmental constraints.
            Analysis of potential and actual non-governmental constraints upon the maintenance,
             improvement, or development of housing for all income levels, including the availability of
             financing, the price of land, and the cost of construction.
            Analysis of any special housing needs for the elderly, persons with disabilities (including
             developmental disabilities), large households, farmworkers, families with female heads of
             household, and families and persons in need of emergency shelter.
            Analysis of opportunities for residential energy conservation.
            Analysis of “at-risk” assisted housing developments that are eligible to change from lower-
             income housing to market rate housing during the next 10 years.
The Housing Element Background Report satisfies State requirements and provides the foundation for the
goals, policies, implementation programs, and quantified objectives. The Background Report sections
draw on a broad range of informational sources. Information on population, housing stock, and economics
comes primarily from the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) pre-approved data package1 as
well as the 2010 U.S. Census, 2012 American Community Survey (ACS), California Department of
Finance (DOF), and Union City records. Information on available sites and services for housing comes
from numerous public agencies. Information on constraints on housing production and past and current
housing efforts in Union City comes from City staff, other local public agencies, and several of private
sources.
General Plan and Housing Element Consistency
The City’s General Plan was adopted in 2002. This Housing Element was prepared to be consistent with
the 2002 General Plan. The Housing Element is closely linked with the following General Plan elements:
Youth, Family, Seniors, and Health (YFSH) Element; Land Use Element; Community Design Element;
and Public Facilities and Services Element. The YFSH Element addresses policy solutions for three of
Union City’s special needs groups: seniors, large households, and the homeless. The Land Use Element
seeks to create new high-density, mixed-use, and transit-oriented development, especially around the
Intermodal Station. The Land Use Element and the Community Design Element seek to provide quality
residential neighborhoods by encouraging high quality amenities in new residential communities, by
1
  ABAG compiled a significant amount of data needed to update the Background Report and received pre-approval
from HCD regarding this data. The pre-approved data does not need to be reviewed again by HCD once the Housing
Element is submitted.

ensuring compatibility with surrounding land use, and by preserving the character of established
neighborhoods (i.e., Old Alvarado and Decoto). The Public Facilities and Services Element ensures the
provision of adequate services (e.g., water, wastewater, and solid waste services, school facilities) to
support existing and future residential development.
The City is initiating an update to the General Plan in 2014. Since the Housing Element will be adopted in
advance of the updated General Plan, the City will review the Housing Element for consistency with the
new General Plan and amend the Element, as necessary, to maintain consistency.
Public Participation
As part of the Housing Element Update process, the City implemented the State’s public participation
requirements set forth in Government Code Section 65583 I(7), which states that jurisdictions “…shall
make a diligent effort to achieve participation of all economic segments of the community in the
development of the housing element.” See Appendix D for a complete summary of public input. The
following is a brief description of the Housing Element workshops and meetings.
Stakeholder Workshop
Consultants and City staff conducted a stakeholder workshop on April 29, 2014, to discuss housing trends
and key issues facing Union City. To advertise the workshop, the City sent an email notice on April 9,
2014 to 33 local agencies, community organizations, and other stakeholders in the city. The City also
posted an advertisement in the newspaper, Union City Patch, hung flyers in the Union City Library, and
advertised on the City’s local television network. Four participants attended the workshop. The
Consultants presented a brief overview of the Housing Element Update process, and then held an
interactive discussion to solicit information on the most critical housing issues in the city and new ways
the City and community might address these issues. The input was used to develop new policies and
programs for the 2015-2023 Housing Element. Appendix C provides a summary of comments from the
stakeholder workshop. A second email was sent to the stakeholder list on August 27, 2014, notifying
them that the Draft Housing Element was available for public review and of the upcoming meetings with
the Planning Commission and City Council.
Planning Commission Study Session
The City held a study session with the Planning Commission on September 4, 2014 to review the Draft
Housing Element, solicit feedback from the Planning Commission, and provide the public an opportunity
to comment on Draft Housing Element.
City Council Study Session
The City held a study session with the City Council on September 23, 2014 to review the Draft Housing
Element, solicit feedback, and provide the public an opportunity to comment on Draft Housing Element.
The City Council authorized City staff to submit the Draft Housing Element to HCD.

Major Findings
The following is a summary of major findings, organized by section of the Background Report.
Existing Needs Assessment
Demographic and Employment Profile
          Union City's population has grown rapidly since incorporation of the Alvarado and Decoto
           neighborhoods in 1959. Since 1990 the population has increased 32.7 percent, resulting in an
           estimated city population of 71,329 in 2013.
          Between 2000 and 2010 Union City grew older, with increasing percentages of residents over
           age 45 and decreasing percentages of residents younger than 45.
          From 2010 to 2013 Union City population grew at a rate of 0.9 percent Average Annual
           Growth Rate (AAGR), which was slightly faster than Alameda County (0.8 percent AAGR)
           and California (0.6 percent AAGR).
          Union City is more ethnically diverse than Alameda County or California. Union City has
           about half the percentage of White Non-Hispanic (21.7 percent) residents compared to
           Alameda County as a whole (45.9 percent) and about a third compared to California (62.5
           percent). In 2012 the largest population group in Union City was Asian Non-Hispanic (52.7
           percent).
          In 2012 Union City had a median household income of $83,066, which was significantly
           higher than both California’s median household income of $61,400 and Alameda County’s
           median household income of $71,516.
          Union City's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent in 2013 was lower than the countywide rate of
           7.3 percent and the state rate of 8.8 percent.
Population, Household, and Employment Projections
          Union City’s population is expected to grow moderately through 2040, with an average
           annual growth rate (AAGR) of 0.6 percent between 2010 and 2040. Although Union City will
           grow by 18.6 percent between 2010 and 2040, Alameda County has a higher AAGR (1.1
           percent). This means that the city will comprise 4.2 percent of the total county population by
           2040, compared to 4.6 percent in 2010.
          According to ABAG projections, Union City is expected to increase the number of jobs by a
           total of 5,100 by 2040, a 0.8 percent AAGR from 2010 to 2040. By 2040 Union City will
           comprise 2.7 percent of the total county jobs, compared to 3.0 percent in 2010.
Household Characteristics and Housing Supply
          Union City is known as a family-oriented community and has a high rate of homeownership.
           Union City’s homeownership rate in 2012 (68.2 percent) is higher than the State (56.0
           percent) and countywide (53.7 percent) averages.
          In 2012 Union City had a population per household of 3.42, higher than the countywide rate
           (2.75) but similar to other nearby jurisdictions.

                                                                                  Adopted January 27, 2015

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
            The rate of overcrowding for renter-occupied households (14.6 percent) is much higher than
             countywide (8.5 percent) and in the state (12.3 percent), according to the 2008-2012 ACS
             estimates, demonstrating that overcrowding is a significant problem relative to the rest of
             Alameda County and California as a whole.
            In 2012, according to the 2008-2012 ACS, Union City had 21,911 housing units with 16,431
             single family units (75 percent) and 4,530 multifamily units (21 percent). Given the high
             percentage of single family homes and tendency for overcrowding, Union City may have a
             need for more multifamily units with adequate capacity for larger families.
            According to the California Department of Finance, Union City had a very low vacancy rate
             in 2009, (1.3 percent), but the vacancy rate rose to 4.6 in 2012. This includes 1.7 percent for
             homeowners and 4.3 percent for renters in 2012. This vacancy rate is slightly lower than the
             ideal rate of 5.3 percent and much lower than the statewide rate of 8.9 percent.
Housing Affordability
            Low-income renters had a higher incidence of overpayment (35.8 percent) than low-income
             owners (28.3 percent). In non-low-income households, 29.6 percent of owners experienced a
             moderate cost burden and 10.9 percent of renters experienced a moderate cost burden.
            A total of 9.9 percent of elderly renters had a moderate housing cost burden and 8.7 percent
             had a severe housing cost burden; however, elderly renter households make up only 8.7
             percent of all households.
            According to income limits calculated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
             Development (HUD), the median family income for a four-person household in Alameda
             County was $88,500 in 2014. The HUD-calculated income limits are used to determine
             eligibility for Section 8 and other Federal programs.
            According to State income limits calculated by the California Department of Housing and
             Community Development (HCD), the median family income for a four-person household in
             Alameda County was $93,500 in 2014. The HCD-calculated income limits are used to
             determine eligibility for certain State housing programs.
            The median home sale price in February 2014 in Union City was $471,900, compared to
             $496,300 in Alameda County. The median sale prices increased by 16.6 percent in Union
             City and 22.3 percent in Alameda County from the February 2013 median prices of $404,800
             and 405,800, respectively.
            A three-person household classified as low-income (at 60 percent of HCD’s median family
             income) with an annual income of up to $50,500 could afford to pay $1,263 monthly gross
             rent (including utilities). The 2014 Fair Market Rent (FMR) for a two-bedroom unit in
             Alameda County is $1,578, which is not affordable to a low-income household earning 60
             percent of the median income.
            Rents in Union City rose slightly between 2006 and 2013. Today, actual rents are typically
             higher than the established fair market rent. The average rent in 2013 was $1,578 for a one-
             bedroom unit and $1,663 for a two-bedroom unit. Fair market rents in 2014 for a one- or two-
             bedroom unit were $1,255 and $1,578, respectively.
Union City Housing Element                                                                         Page 5-5
Adopted January 27, 2015

         For a family of four in Union City, a household making under $65,450 in 2014 would be
          considered a low-income household. In 2010 Union City had a lower proportion of low-
          income owners (22.0 percent) than Alameda County (24.3 percent) and a higher proportion of
          low-income renters (63.6 percent) than the County (58.6 percent).
Special Housing Needs
         The 2013 Alameda County Housing and Community Development Homeless Count
          identified a total of 4,264 homeless people. The count of homeless people in Union City was
          determined to be 70, or 1.64 percent of the total homeless population in Alameda County. Of
          these 69 percent were between the ages of 25 and 60, 33 percent were Hispanic/Latino, 36
          percent were Black or African American, and 88 percent reported having a disability.
         Union City is working in a collaborative effort with service providers and the County of
          Alameda to mitigate zero vacancy rates and overburdened service providers through its
          ongoing funding of the Abode Services, Centro de Servicios, Tri-City Volunteers, and Safe
          Alternatives to Violent Environments (SAVE), as well as its participation in the Alameda
          County EveryOne Home Program.
         There are 307 units of dedicated affordable housing for low-income seniors in Union City.
          Both public and private non-profit property managers have identified that there are waiting
          lists of over 400 applicants per facility and the waiting lists are currently (April 2014) closed.
          The Alameda County Housing Authority has closed the waiting lists for public housing, and
          is not accepting new applications for housing, but hopes to open their waiting list in the last
          quarter of 2014. This indicates that there is a shortage of housing available for low-income
          seniors in Union City, although there are private senior developments with vacancies.
         2012 ACS data shows that the share of large households out of total households in Union
          City (21.7 percent) was significantly higher than the proportion of large households
          countywide (11.0 percent), and higher than the proportion in California as a whole (14.3
          percent of total households). This suggests that there is a stronger need for large units in
          Union City than both Alameda County and statewide to accommodate large households.
Future Needs Assessment
         In its final Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) figures, ABAG allocated 1,106
          housing units to Union City between 2014 and 2022. The total allocation is broken down into
          five income categories: extremely low (158 units or 14.3 percent of total units); very low
          (159 units or 14.4 percent of total units); low (180 units or 16.3 percent of total units);
          moderate (192 units or 17.4 percent of total units); and above moderate (417 units or 37.7
          percent of total units).
Resource Inventory
         In addition to the 2014-2022 RHNA, Union City must account for unaccommodated need
          from the previous RHNA period (2007-2014). After adding the unaccommodated need from
          the 2007-2014 Housing Element, the total RHNA for the 2014-2022 Housing Element is
          1,190 units, including 581 lower-income units, 192 moderate-income units, and 417 above
          moderate-income units.

                                                                                    Adopted January 27, 2015

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
            After accounting for planned projects and capacity on vacant and underutilized land, Union
             City had a surplus for moderate-income units, but a remaining need of 154 lower-income
             units and 210 above moderate-income units.
            In order to accommodate unmet need, the City has identified four potential rezone sites. The
             rezone program could result in capacity for an additional 314 lower-income units and 201
             moderate-income units. However, since some of the sites were, at least in part, counted as
             vacant/underutilized sites under existing zoning, the rezone program would remove 104
             above moderate-income units from the inventory. After accounting for the rezone program,
             the City has a surplus of 160 lower-income units and 241 moderate-income units. The above
             moderate-income deficit of 314 units is accommodated by the surplus in the lower-income
             and moderate-income categories.
            Water and sewer facilities and services are adequate to serve all projected development in
             Union City through the time frame (2023) of the Housing Element.
            Union City operates a number of housing programs. These programs, as well as those
             administered by the State and other local agencies, include repair/rehabilitation loans for
             owner-occupied, single family and mobile homes. Most of these programs are funded with
             Community Development Block Grants (CDBGs), Housing Bond funds, and HOME
             Investment Partnership Program (HOME) funds, and are targeted to households earning 80
             percent or below of area median income (AMI). In addition to programs administered by the
             City, there are other programs that Union City residents can benefit from that are
             administered by HACA, the State, and other agencies.
            Los Robles is an affordable housing project for very low- and low-income families. Although
             the affordability restrictions on Los Robles are renewed annually, it is considered to be low
             risk because it is owned and operated by Ecumenical Association for Housing (EAH), a non-
             profit affordable housing corporation that has been developing, managing, and promoting
             affordable housing since 1968.
Potential Housing Constraints
            As a result of the City’s Affordable Housing Ordinance, adopted in May 2001, 312 affordable
             housing units for very low-, low-, and moderate-income households have been built. In 2006
             the City amended the ordinance to be more flexible in the allowance of in-lieu fees and to
             encourage public/private partnerships. Overall, the ordinance has proven to be a major
             component in the development of affordable housing in Union City.
            The estimated residential development fees for a single family three-bedroom, two-bathroom
             house of 2,000 square feet are approximately $34,204. Compared to the estimated per-unit
             fees for a multifamily unit ($28,864) with an average unit size of 850 square feet, there are
             significant cost savings for a multifamily residential development.
Evaluation
            In partnership with non-profit developers, such as Eden Housing, Inc., Elder Care Alliance,
             and Mid-Peninsula Housing, the City aided in the construction of 345 affordable units
             between 2002 and 2014.

         The City’s rehabilitation program, currently (July 2014) run by the County, has rehabilitated
          over 900 homes since its beginning in 1976.
         The Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Union City was dissolved on
          February 1, 2012, pursuant to Assembly Bill x1 26; the City serves as the Successor Agency
          to the Redevelopment Agency.
         In addition to the Affordable Housing Ordinance, the City has used programs, such as the
          Mortgage Credit Certificate Program, HOME Funds, and Community Development Block
          Grants funds to continue to meet its affordable housing goals.
         The City updated its Zoning Ordinance to meet State law requirements and expand
          opportunities for housing for the homeless and people with disabilities. Emergency shelters
          are now allowed in the PI District. The occupancy restriction has been revised as well.
          Definitions for transitional housing and lodging rooming houses (SROs) were updated and a
          new definition was added for supportive housing.

SECTION 5.2               EXISTING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
This section begins with a description of demographic and employment characteristics of Union City. The
section then discusses projections, household characteristics and housing supply, and housing
affordability. The section also discusses the housing needs of “special” population groups as defined in
State law. Data for Union City, Alameda County, and California are presented for comparison or when
city-level data are not available. This facilitates an understanding of Union City’s characteristics by
illustrating how it is similar to or differs from the county or state in various aspects of demographic,
employment, and housing characteristics and needs.
Demographic and Employment Profile
The purpose of this section is to establish “baseline” population and employment characteristics for Union
City. The main source of the information is the 2010 U.S. Census, but 2000 and 1990 Census data are
also shown to demonstrate trends. Other sources of information include the following: the California
Department of Finance (DOF), the California Employment Development Department (EDD), the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),
the ABAG Pre-Approved Data Package, American Community Survey (ACS), and local economic data
(e.g., home sales prices, rents, wages).

Demographics
Population
Union City's population has grown rapidly since incorporation of the Alvarado and Decoto neighborhoods
in 1959. Since 1990 the population has increased 32.7 percent from 53,762 in 1990 to 71,329 in 2013 (see
Table 5-1).
Union City’s average annual growth rate (AAGR) from 2000 to 2010 (0.39 percent AAGR) was lower
than the Alameda County average (0.46 percent AAGR). Population growth in Union City was also lower
than the neighboring city of Fremont (0.52 percent AAGR), but higher than Newark (0.02 percent
AAGR) and Hayward (0.30 percent AAGR) during this period.

Table 5-2 shows that from 2010 to 2013 Union City’s population grew at an average annual growth rate
(AAGR) of 0.9 percent, which was slightly faster than Alameda County as a whole (0.8 percent AAGR)
and California (0.6 percent AAGR). Population includes data for persons in households and group
quarters. The City does not have a large population living in group quarters, and all population growth
between 2010 and 2013 was in households.

     Age
     Table 5-3 compares Union City’s age group trends between 2000 and 2010. Five age groups increased as
     a percentage of the entire population: the 15-19, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, and 75 and over. Union City’s 55-
     64 age group had the most significant increase from 7.7 percent of the population to 11.9 percent, similar
     to the increase in the 55-64 age group countywide. Following the countywide trend, Union City age
     groups less than 45 years experienced slight declines in population (except the slight increase in the 15-19
     age group, from 6.8 percent to 7.0 percent in Union City and from 6.2 percent to 6.6 percent in Alameda
     County). This trend most likely reflects the aging of the existing population and the lack of families with
     young children migrating to the county and Union City. The percentage of senior households (65 years
     and over) in the city is expected to continue increasing as more baby boomers continue to reach
     retirement age.

     In 2000 the median age of Union City residents was 32.8, which was slightly younger than the
     countywide median of 34.5 and 33.3 for California. In 2010 the median age increased to 36.2 for Union
     City, 36.6 for Alameda County, and 35.2 for California. This suggests that the population of Union City
     and the county as a whole is aging faster than statewide.
     Race and Ethnicity
     According to the 2010-2012 American Community Survey (ACS) three-year estimates, Union City had a
     more diverse population than the county as a whole, as well as the state. Table 5-4 shows in 2012 the
     White population made up only 21.7 percent of Union City’s total population, compared to 45.9 percent
     of the countywide population and 62.5 percent of California’s population. The Asian population was the
     largest racial/ethnic group in Union City at 52.7 percent of total population. The percentage of Asians in
     Union City is higher than the countywide average (26.6 percent) and the state (13.3 percent).

    Income and Employment
    Local demand for housing is significantly impacted by income, employment characteristics, and regional
    job growth. To effectively address the housing and jobs relationship, this section analyzes household
    income and employment characteristics for Union City and Alameda County. Employment data from the
    California Employment Development Department (EDD) is for the Oakland Metropolitan Statistical Area
    (Alameda and Contra Costa Counties).

 Table 5-5 shows the distribution of household incomes for Union City, Alameda County, and California
 for 2012, based on the 2008-2012 ACS. In Union City 19.5 percent of all households earned under
 $35,000 (which is considered very low-income), compared to 29.3 percent of households in the State as a
 whole. At the other end of the income spectrum, 34.0 percent of households in the city (compared to 30.7
 percent of the county) earned over $100,000, which is higher than California as a whole (26.2 percent).

 Employment
 Table 5-6 shows employment by occupation for residents of Union City in 2007 and 2012. Industry
 employment estimates are by place of residence, so estimates do not indicate the number of jobs within
 the city.
 Total civilian employment of Union City workers grew from approximately 31,923 in 2007 to 33,052 in
 2012, an average annual growth rate (AAGR) of 0.7 percent. Alameda County civilian employment
 increased from 700,519 in 2007 to 723,700 in 2012, an AAGR of 0.7 percent. In 2012 39.9 percent of
 civilian workers living in Union City worked in management, professional, and related occupations, and
 26.7 percent worked in sales and offices. These occupations make up the top two occupations for
 residents of Union City. Relatively higher paying jobs are in both categories, except for certain sales
 positions, translating into higher incomes for residents engaged in these activities. The top third
 occupation for residents of Union City was services (15.3 percent), which is generally not as high-paying.

The Employment Development Department (EDD) estimates the total labor force of cities and counties in
California; however, the EDD does not break down employment by industry. The number of jobs that the
EDD reports for Civilian Employment differs from the number of jobs reported for Total Industry
Employment (also known as Wage and Salary Employment). Civilian Labor Force counts the number of
working people by where they live. This includes business owners, the self-employed, unpaid family
workers, private household workers, and wage and salary workers. A person with more than one job is
only counted once.
Based on EDD estimates, the number of employed persons in Union City was 34,000 in October 2000,
32,500 in October 2008, and 33,300 in March 2013. This represents an AAGR of -0.6 percent from 2000
to 2008 and 0.49 percent from 2008 to 2013.

Table 5-7 shows how unemployment rates in Union City, Alameda County, and California varied
between 1990 and 2013. As the table indicates, unemployment rates in Union City were generally lower
than both Alameda County and the state overall. Lower overall unemployment rates in Union City may be
attributed to the strong presence of the manufacturing industry and the more recent trend of technology-
based companies locating in Union City.
Between 1990 and 2013 unemployment in Union City was at its lowest (2.2 percent) in 2000 and at its
highest (10.6 percent) in 2010. Alameda County’s highest unemployment rate was 11.3 percent in 2010
and California’s highest unemployment rate was 12.4 percent. These high unemployment rates in 2010
were reflective of the national and global recession, and the rate of unemployment in Union City is back
to pre-recession levels.

  Population, Household, and Employment Projections
  The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) releases regional projections every two years for
  population, households, total jobs, and employed residents. The following section presents the most
  recent (2013) projections for 2010 to 2040. These projections extend beyond the time horizon for this
  Housing Element.
  Population and Household Projections
  Union City's population is expected to grow moderately through 2040, with an average annual growth
  rate of 0.6 percent between 2010 and 2040. As Table 5-8 indicates, the city's population is projected to
  grow to 82,500 by 2040, representing an increase of 12,984 residents from the city’s estimated 2010
  population of 69,516. Households are expected to grow at about the same rate from 20,433 in 2010 to
  23,650 in 2040, an AAGR of 0.5 percent.
  Although Union City will grow by 18.6 percent between 2010 and 2040, Alameda County has a higher

Employment Projections
As Table 5-9 indicates, the city's total job count is projected to grow to 25,700 by 2040, representing an
increase of 5,100 jobs from 2010. Union City's employment, in terms of total jobs and employed
residents, is expected to grow slower than Alameda County between 2010 and 2040. From 2010 to 2020
Union City is expected to gain 2,900 jobs (an average annual growth rate of 0.8 percent) and 6,330
employed residents (an average annual growth rate of 0.7 percent). When the number of employed
residents increases faster than the number of jobs, it generally indicates that many residents commute out
of the city. By 2040 Union City will comprise 2.7 percent of the total county jobs and 4.0 percent of total
employed residents.

Potential Population Change and Job Growth Impacts on Housing Need
Union City currently (2014) has more employed residents than jobs, and many residents commute outside
the city for work. To improve the jobs-to-households ratio, the city will need to attract more jobs relative
to housing in the future.
Household Characteristics and Housing Supply
This section is broken into an analysis of household characteristics and housing supply. The first section
analyzes household characteristics, such as household population, composition, size, tenure, and
overcrowding. More simply stated, it summarizes the profile of Union City and Alameda County
residents living in private households, whether they are renters or owners, how many people live in a
household, and if the household is overcrowded. The second section analyzes the County’s housing
inventory and supply, including a discussion of vacant units.

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
Household Population
Household population is an important measure for establishing the number of persons residing in private
households. Persons in institutional or group quarters are not included in the values for household
population. As of 2013 Union City had a total household population of 70,811 (Table 5-2). From 2010 to
2013 the average number of persons per household grew from 3.38 in 2010 to 3.44 in 2013, and the
number of households grew from 21,258 to 21,431. Union City had a higher ratio of persons per
household than Alameda County (2.6) and California (2.7).
In terms of planning for the housing needs of all segments of the population, three group quarter
categories hold special interest: inmates of correctional institutions, persons staying in nursing homes, and
persons in other group quarters. From 2000 to 2010 the group quarters population grew in Union City
from 342 to 528 persons. The overwhelming majority of these were residents of homes for the elderly
(e.g., Masonic Home) or other non-institutional group quarters. Only 0.8 percent of all Union City
residents were living in group quarters, compared to 2.6 and 2.3 percent of the population in Alameda
County and California, respectively.
Household Composition
While household population measures the number of persons living in households, household
composition measures the type of households. The Census divides households into two types: family and
non-family. Family households are those that consist of two or more related persons living together. Non-
family households include either persons who live alone or groups composed of non-related individuals.
As shown in Table 5-10, Union City had a larger proportion of family households compared to Alameda
County and California. In 2012 83.0 percent of Union City households were family households compared
to 64.7 percent countywide and 68.6 percent in the state.

Tenure
Tenure is a measure of the rates of homeownership and renter occupancy in a jurisdiction. Tenure for type
of unit and number of bedrooms can help estimate demand for a diversity of housing types.
Home equity is the largest single source of household wealth for most Americans. Median net wealth for
renters is about 3 percent of that of homeowners. The national homeownership rate has risen from around
40 percent before World War II, to 65.6 percent in 1980, 64 percent in 1995, 65 percent in 2002, and 69
percent in 2008. In 2013 the national homeownership rate was about 65 percent. Union City is known as a
family-oriented community and has a consistently high rate of homeownership. As shown in Table 5-11,
the homeownership rate for Union City is higher than Alameda County and the state as a whole.
However, homeownership in Union City decreased from 71.3 percent in 2000 to 66.5 percent in 2010. In
2012, however, it appears that homeownership is beginning to increase again in Union City, with 68.2
percent of households owning a home.
The percentage of renter-occupied units increased in Union City (28.7 to 33.5 percent), Alameda County
(45.3 to 46.6 percent), and the state (43.1 to 44.1 percent) between 2000 and 2010, but decreased slightly
by 2012 (31.8, 46.3, and 44.0 percent, respectively). Both Alameda County and California had rental rates
above 40 percent in 2000 and 2012.

Table 5-12 shows tenure by household size in Union City, Alameda County, and California in 2012.
Union City had a high percentage of large households (5 or more people) for both owners and renters in
2012; 19.2 percent of owner-occupied households were large households, which was 8 percent higher
than countywide and 5.1 percent higher than the California average. However, the difference is greater for
renter-occupied households than owner occupied. Nearly 20.2 percent of renter-occupied households in
Union City were large households, which was 10.4 percent higher than the countywide average and 5.6
percent higher than the California average.

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
Union City’s family-oriented core is highlighted when comparing one- and two-person households. In
2012 14.0 percent of all households in Union City contained one person, while Alameda County and
California had significantly higher proportions of one person households (27.5 percent and 24.3 percent).
Two person households accounted for 27.1 percent of all households in Union City compared to 29.8
percent in Alameda County and 29.9 percent in California.

Table 5-13 shows the number of bedrooms by tenure in Union City, Alameda County, and California in
2012. As shown in the table, 68.4 percent of occupied housing units in Union City contained three or
more bedrooms in 2012. The percentage of occupied housing units with three or more bedrooms in Union
City is significantly higher than the countywide percentage of 50.9 and statewide percentage of 55.4
percent.
Renter-occupied units tend to have a smaller number of bedrooms than owner-occupied units. This was
the case in Union City in 2012, where 84.2 percent of owner-occupied units had three or more bedrooms,
compared to only 33.4 percent of renter-occupied units. However, Union City’s family-oriented
characteristic carried over to renter-occupied units as well; 33.4 percent of rental units in Union City had
three or more bedrooms compared to 22.5 percent countywide and 26.9 percent statewide.

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
Household Size
Average household size is a function of household population (the group quarters population is not
counted) divided by occupied housing units. Larger household sizes mean that more dwelling units with
three or more bedrooms will be needed to accommodate population growth. Household size is also an
important measure of overcrowding.
Census Bureau defines a household as a group of people, related or not, living together in a dwelling unit.
Table 5-14 shows historic household size information for Union City and neighboring communities from
1970 to 2012. Union City has the largest average household size compared to surrounding jurisdictions
and Alameda County as a whole.
Table 5-14 shows that over the last 40 years, Union City consistently had one of the largest household
sizes next to the neighboring jurisdiction of Newark. In 2012 ACS reported that Union City had a
population per household (PPH) of 3.42, significantly higher than other nearby jurisdictions.

Overcrowded Housing
The Census defines an overcrowded unit as one occupied by 1.01 persons or more per room (excluding
bathrooms and kitchens). Units with more than 1.5 persons per room are considered severely
overcrowded. Overcrowding increases health and safety concerns and stresses the condition of the
housing stock and infrastructure. Overcrowding is strongly related to household size, particularly for large
households and especially very large households, and the availability of suitably sized housing.
Overcrowding impacts both owners and renters; however, renters are generally more significantly
impacted.
A typical home might have a total of five rooms (three bedrooms, living room, and dining room). If more
than five people were living in the home, it would be considered overcrowded. There is some debate
about whether units with larger households where seven people might occupy a home with six rooms
should really be considered overcrowded. Nonetheless, units with more than 1.5 persons per room are
considered severely overcrowded, and should be recognized as a significant housing problem.
Union City Housing Element                                                                        Page 5-23
Adopted January 27, 2015
Overcrowding in households typically results from either a lack of affordable housing (which forces more
than one household to live together) and/or a lack of available housing units of adequate size.
While family size and tenure are critical determinants in overcrowding, household income also plays a
strong role in the incidence of overcrowding. As a general rule, overcrowding levels tend to decrease as
income rises, especially for renters (particularly for small and large families). The rate of overcrowding
for very low-income households is generally nearly three times greater than households over 95 percent
of the area median income. As with renters, owner-households with higher incomes have lower rates of
overcrowding.
Table 5-15 compares occupants per room and overcrowding by tenure in Union City, Alameda County,
and California in 2012. Union City had a higher proportion of overcrowded owner-occupied units (more
than 1.01 occupants per room) (3.9 percent) when compared to Alameda County as a whole (3.0 percent),
but was higher statewide with 4.1 percent. Severely overcrowded units (more than 1.5 occupants per
room) were 1.2 percent of owner-occupied units in Union City compared to 0.7 percent of owner-
occupied housing units countywide and 1.0 percent statewide.
In Union City overcrowding is typically more of a problem in rental units than owner units. When broken
out by tenure, renter-households accounted for 32.0 percent of all households in the county; however,
they accounted for 63.4 percent of all overcrowded households in Union City in 2012. To put it another
way, 14.6 percent of renter-occupied households in Union City were overcrowded, in comparison to 3.9
percent of owner-occupied households. Nearly 3.9 percent of rental units in Union City were severely
overcrowded, compared to 1.2 percent of owner-occupied units. The rate of overcrowding for renter-
occupied households (14.6 percent) is much higher than the rate countywide (8.5 percent) and the state
(12.3 percent), demonstrating that overcrowding in Union City, especially in renter-households, is a
significant problem relative to the rest of Alameda County and California.

Housing Supply
While the previous section discussed the characteristics of persons living in households, this section
provides information about the total supply of existing housing in Union City, Alameda County, and
California. This section includes information about the total number of housing units available in Union
City and Alameda County, changes in vacancy, and structural condition of the units.
Housing Units
Figure 5-1 shows the number of housing units by type built in Union City between 1960 and 2014. In
1960 and 1970 Union City’s housing stock was made up overwhelmingly of single family units. Total
units in Union City tripled between 1970 (3,913 units) and 1980 (12,333 units). Between 1970 and 1990
Union City expanded its multifamily housing stock to account for up to 26 percent of the total housing
stock. By 2005 that proportion had decreased to only 19 percent multifamily units. In 2014 Union City
had 21,431 housing units, with 16,491 single family units (77 percent) and 3,941 multifamily units (18
percent). Mobile homes and boats, RVs, vans, etc., accounted for 999 units (5 percent).

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
Table 5-16 compares housing stock by type in Union City to Alameda County and California from 2000
to 2014. The table further categorizes housing units by splitting multifamily into buildings with two to
four units and buildings with five or more units.
As shown in Table 5-16, Union City has a high percentage of single family units when compared to
Alameda County as a whole and California. In 2000 the housing stock was 75.9 percent single family
compared to 61 percent countywide and 64 percent in California. By 2014 the proportion of single family
units increased slightly to 76.9 percent. Although the number of multifamily units increased by 7.2
percent from 2000 to 2014, Union City still had a low percentage of multifamily units compared to
Alameda County as a whole and California. In 2014 multifamily units were 18.4 percent of total units in
Union City compared to 37.9 percent countywide and 30.9 percent in California as a whole. Given the
low percentage of multifamily homes and tendency for overcrowding for renter-occupied units, Union
City may have a need for more multifamily units with adequate capacity for larger families.

Figure 5-2 shows building permit activity in Union City from January 2001 to December 2013. The figure
shows a steady level of single family permits until the end of the housing “bubble” in 2006. Eighty-eight
single family permits were approved in 2001 compared to only 18 in 2008; less than 10 single family
permits were approved each year between 2009 and 2013. Market conditions as well as single family
housing being nearly built out in Union City have led to the decline in single family construction.
Building permit activity for multifamily units in Union City is less indicative of market conditions than it
is of how building permits are pulled for multifamily projects. From 2001 to 2008 there were two major
multifamily projects that pulled upwards of 200 building permits per year. From 2008 to 2013, during the
recession, no multifamily projects that large were approved, and few single family permits were issued.
Overall, Union City has made efforts in the past few years to increase the number of multifamily projects
and to rebuild the downtown core at higher densities with a multi-modal transit station as the catalyst.

Occupancy/Vacancy Rates
Vacancy rates are an indicator of existing housing need. The difference between the current vacancy rate
and optimal vacancy rate is a good measure of whether the market is responding to overall housing needs.
Optimal vacancy rates differ between rental housing and for-sale housing. The Association of Bay Area
Governments has set two rates as the regional vacancy objective. For rental housing a 5 percent vacancy
rate is considered necessary to permit ordinary rental mobility. For for-sale housing a 2 percent vacancy
rate is considered the threshold to permit ordinary mobility. If vacancy rates are below these levels,
residents will have a difficult time finding appropriate units and competition for units will drive up
housing prices. Table 5-17 shows vacancy rates in Union City by tenure. Both homeowner and rental
vacancy rates are lower than the ideal rates.

As shown in Table 5-18, the vacancy rates in Union City and the surrounding area made a slight drop
from 1990 to 2000 and were stable from 2000 to 2009, but rose after 2009. As the table indicates, the
2009 vacancy rate in Union City was 1.3 percent, which is only slightly higher than in 2000. In 2012 the
vacancy rate rose to 3.9 percent. Considering California’s 8.9 percent vacancy rate, Union City’s vacancy
rate is low.

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
Housing Conditions
It is necessary to document the conditions of the housing stock in order to identify the number of potential
substandard housing units (owner and rental) in need of repair, rehabilitation, or replacement. The U.S.
Census provides only limited data that can be used to infer the condition of Union City’s housing stock.
Since housing stock age and condition are generally correlated, one Census variable that provides an
indication of housing conditions is the age of a community’s housing stock. Generally housing older than
30 years will require minimal repairs and improvements. Housing units over 50 years old are more likely
to require major rehabilitation such as roofing, plumbing, and electrical system repairs. Union City's
housing stock is relatively new. As demonstrated in Table 5-19, an estimated 17.9 percent of housing
units in the city are over 30 years old and 7.3 percent are over 50 years old. The large majority of units
were built between 1970 and 1979.

Because Union City's housing stock is relatively young, the overall condition of housing is good. Housing
in need of rehabilitation and/or replacement tends to be concentrated within the Decoto and Old Alvarado
neighborhoods. In 1999 the City conducted a survey of dilapidated or substandard housing in both areas.
The City identified 40 units in the Decoto area and 10 units in the Old Alvarado area in need of
significant rehabilitation. These units were identified based on visual exterior, and in most cases, interior
inspection. Homes showing noticeable signs of decay, such as broken or boarded up windows, cracks or
large holes in walls, broken steps, and missing hand rails were identified and homeowners were
approached and offered help in obtaining government assistance (e.g., rehabilitation loans through the
City). There is no reason to believe that housing conditions have significantly deteriorated since the last
survey. The City’s rehabilitation program, which has been around since 1974, has been enormously
successful for many households in particular and for the community as a whole. Since its inception in
1976, the City has rehabilitated over 900 homes.

Housing Affordability
Housing is classified as “affordable” if households do not pay more than 30 percent of income for
payment of rent (including a monthly allowance for water, gas, and electricity) or monthly
homeownership costs (including mortgage payments, taxes, and insurance). State law (65583(a) (2))
requires “an analysis and documentation of household characteristics, including level of payment
compared to ability to pay.” Identifying and evaluating existing housing needs are a critical component of
the housing element. This requires comparison of resident incomes with the local cost of housing. The
analysis helps local governments identify existing housing cost burdens or unmet housing needs. This
section includes an analysis of housing cost burden, ability to pay for housing, and the cost of housing.
The data in this section uses Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data from HUD’s
State of the Cities Data Systems (SOCDS) website. Income groups are shown in the SOCDS CHAS
tabulation based on the HUD-adjusted area median family income.
Housing Cost Burden
This section provides an analysis of the proportion of households overpaying for housing. Current
standards measure housing cost in relation to gross household income: households spending more than 30
percent of their income, including utilities, are generally considered to be overpaying or cost burdened.
Severe overpaying occurs when households pay 50 percent or more of their gross income for housing. For
owners housing costs include mortgage payment, taxes, insurance, and utilities. This is a share of income
approach to measure housing affordability in terms of the percentage of income that a household spends
for housing. The impact of high housing costs falls disproportionately on extremely low-, very low-, and
low-income households, especially renter households. Lower-income households are defined as those that
earn 80 percent or less of the area median household income. While some higher-income households may
choose to spend greater parts of their income for housing, lower-income households may be limited by a
lack of affordable housing. Low-income households frequently have insufficient resources for other
critical essentials including food and medicine. This is a significant hardship for many workers, families,
and seniors, but it also impacts local economies as money that might otherwise be spent in local stores
generating sales tax revenues are being spent on housing.
In 2010 33.4 percent of households in Union City, over 6,600 households, earned very low or low
incomes. That is, they earned less than 80 percent of the median countywide income. Further analysis of
very low- and low-income households shows that about half were renters (52 percent).
Table 5-20 shows the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (SOCDS CHAS) special tabulation
data from 2010 ACS data. The data reflects the percentage of households with a moderate housing cost
burden (between 30 and 50 percent) and severe cost burden (greater than 50 percent) by income group
and tenure for Union City and Alameda County as a whole. As shown in the table, 24.5 percent of all
Union City households had a moderate housing cost burden in 2010, which was slightly higher than the
countywide average of 22.9 percent.
As would be expected, housing cost burdens were more severe for households with lower incomes.
Among lower-income households, 65.5 percent in Union City had a moderate housing cost burden in
2010 compared to 33.9 percent of non-lower-income households. The percentage of lower-income
households with a moderate housing cost burden in Union City is nearly 2 percent lower (24.2 percent)
than that for the countywide average (26.1 percent). An estimated 41.3 percent of low-income households
had severe housing cost burdens. This is similar to the countywide proportion (43.8 percent).

Union City General Plan Element Update
While low-income households were split relatively evenly between renters and owners, non-low income
households were largely weighted towards owners (11,230 owner households versus 1,965 renter
households). In non-low-income households, the group with the highest proportion of overpayment was
large family owners (42.3 percent), while renters had a very low rate of overpayment (10.7 percent
overall). In non-low-income households, 29.6 percent of owners experienced a moderate cost burden and
10.9 percent of renters experienced a moderate cost burden.
Overall, housing cost burden was generally higher among owner households (32.9 percent of owner
households compared to 30.2 percent of renter households). However, most owners with a cost burden
had a moderate cost burden whereas most renters with a cost burden had a severe cost burden; 16.2
percent of renters had a moderate cost burden and 20.2 percent had a severe cost burden compared to 19.6
percent of owners with a moderate cost burden and 13.3 percent with a severe burden.

Table 5-21 shows housing cost burden information for Union City in 2010 for special housing types by
tenure, and income group.
Elderly households have lower rates of overpayment. Almost 9 percent of elderly renters had a moderate
housing cost burden and about 8 percent had a severe housing cost burden; however, elderly renter
households make up about 5 percent of all households (regardless of tenure or income level). The
information in this table regarding elderly and large households is addressed in more detail in the Special

Ability to Pay for Housing
The following section compares 2014 income levels and ability to pay for housing with actual housing
costs. Each year the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reports the Area
Median Income (AMI) for the Oakland-Fremont Metro Area. The State Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) uses the AMI to set income levels (i.e., extremely low-, very low-, low,
moderate-, and above moderate-income) that are used in affordable housing programs and projects. Since
above moderate-income households do not generally have problems locating affordable units, affordable
units are frequently defined as those reasonably priced for households that are moderate-income or below.
The list below shows the definition of housing income limits as they are applied in California:
            Extremely Low-Income Unit: Affordable to households whose combined income is
             between the floor set at the minimum Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and 30 percent of
             the AMI.
            Very Low-Income Unit: Affordable to households whose combined income is between 31
             and 50 percent of the AMI.
            Low-Income Unit: Affordable to households whose combined income is between 51 percent
             to 80 percent of the AMI.
            Moderate-Income Unit: Affordable to households whose combined income is between 81
             percent to 120 percent of the AMI.
            Above Moderate-Income Unit: Affordable to household whose combined income is above
             120 percent of the AMI.
According to HUD, the AMI for a four-person household in the Oakland-Fremont Metro Area was
$88,500 in 2014. For all income categories income limits are defined for various household sizes based on
a four-person household. Income limits for larger or smaller households are calculated by HUD (See
Table 5-22).

HCD also publishes income limits for Alameda County. Table 5-23 summarizes 2014 HCD-defined
household income limits for very low-, low-, and moderate-income households in Alameda County
(including Union City) by the number of persons in the household. The table also includes the maximum
affordable monthly rents and maximum affordable purchase prices for homes. Households earning the
2014 area median income for a family of four in Union City ($93,500) could afford to spend up to $2,338
per month on rent without overpaying. A three-person household would be classified as low-income if its
annual income was less than $42,100. This household could afford a $1,053 maximum monthly rent.
For renters this is a straightforward calculation, but home ownership costs are less transparent. A
household can typically qualify to purchase a home that is 2.5 to 3.0 times the annual income of that
household, depending on the down payment, the level of other long-term obligations (such as a car loan),
and interest rates. For a very low-income four-person household making $46,750 per year, an estimated
maximum purchase price would be $188,835.
In practice the interaction of these factors allows some households to qualify for homes priced at more
than three times their annual income, while other households may be limited to purchasing homes no
more than two times their annual incomes. These factors - interest rates, insurance, and taxes - are held
constant in the table below in order to determine maximum affordable rent and purchase price for
households of each income category. It is important to note that this table is used for illustrative purposes
only.

that are occupied by recent movers. Adjustments are made to exclude public housing units, newly built
units, and substandard units.
As stated above, a three-person household classified as low-income with an annual income of $50,500 (60
percent of MFI) could afford to pay $1,263 monthly gross rent (including utilities). The 2014 FMR for a
two-bedroom unit in Alameda County is $1,578. Therefore, a low-income three-person household at the
middle of the income range could not afford to rent a two-bedroom unit at the FMR level. A moderate-
income three-person household, making $101,000 could afford to pay $2,946 in rent without overpaying.
This is enough to pay the FMR for a four-bedroom apartment.

Affordable Housing by Income/Occupation
Table 5-25 is an abbreviated list of occupations and annual incomes for Union City residents, such as City
employees, retired individuals, and minimum wage earners. The table shows the amounts that households
at these income levels can afford to pay for rent as well as the purchase prices that they can afford. Few of
the households with a single wage earner shown would be able to afford a three-bedroom unit at the FMR
level of $2,204, shown in Table 5-24, except a computer engineer, police officer, or civil engineer.
Households with a single wage earner employed by the school district would have difficulty purchasing a
home in Union City, where the median sales price in 2014 was $470,000 (according to DataQuick). A
firefighter could afford to purchase a home for an estimated $344,553. Generally, households are
composed of more than one wage earner, which changes the affordability ranges. However, even
households with two wage earners would have difficulty finding a home in their price range in the city. A
household with a firefighter and a librarian, for example, with a combined income of $158,000 could
afford to purchase a home for $639,701. Households with limited or fixed incomes are of particular
interest when examining overall affordability of a city. The FMR rent for a studio unit ($1,035) is more
than six times the amount ($161) that a single person on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) could
afford to pay. Two workers earning minimum wage could afford a monthly rate of $936, which is lower
than the Fair Market Rent for a studio.

Home Sale Prices
Between 1998 and 2008 there was a significant boom and bust in local housing markets. Overall this was
a trend experienced throughout California and the nation due to the high volume of houses purchased in
the early and mid-2000s with sub-prime mortgages. The boom contributed to the “housing bubble” of
inflated sales rates and prices. From January 2002 to January 2006 the median home price in Union City
increased 87 percent, from $356,000 to $664,000, and then fell back to $415,000 by July 2008. This trend
also occurred in the surrounding cities of Fremont, Hayward, and Newark (Figure 5-3). During this time
Union City experienced a higher appreciation in prices than Alameda County as a whole, but by
November 2008 median home prices were very similar; $380,000 in Union City and $370,000 in

               Average Monthly Rents
               Table 5-26 shows average rents over time. According to a report from Real Facts, average rents have
               increased between 2005 and 2013. Based on this survey of average monthly rents, average rental prices
               for all unit sizes would be affordable to a median-income household. However, a low-income household
               could afford to pay $1,403 and so would not be able to afford even the average rent for a studio
               apartment.

Special Housing Needs
Within the general population there are several groups of people who have special housing needs. These
needs can make it difficult for members of these groups to locate suitable housing. The following
subsections discuss these special housing needs of six groups identified in State Housing Element Law
(Government Code, Section 65583(a)(7): elderly, persons with disabilities (including developmental
disabilities), large households, farmworkers, families with single-headed households, and families and
persons in need of emergency shelter. This section also describes the needs of extremely low-income
households. Where possible, estimates of the population or number of households in Union City and
Alameda County belonging to each group are shown.
Homeless Persons
Most families become homeless because they are unable to afford housing in a particular community.
Nationwide about half of those experiencing homelessness over the course of a year are single adults.
Most enter and exit the system fairly quickly. The remainder lives in the homeless assistance system, or in
a combination of shelters, hospitals, the streets, jails, and prisons. There are also single homeless people
who are not adults, including runaway and “throwaway” youth (children whose parents will not allow
them to live at home).
Not all homeless people are the same, but many fall under several categories: the mentally ill, alcohol and
drug users, vagrants, elderly, runaways and abandoned youths, single women with children who might be
fleeing domestic violence, individuals and families who have recently lost jobs, as well as the working
poor – those with jobs but whose income is too small to afford housing. Although each category has
different specific needs, the most urgent need is for emergency shelter and case management (i.e., help
with accessing needed services). Emergency shelters have minimal supportive services for homeless
persons, and is limited to occupancy of six months or less. No individual or household may be denied
emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.
For many, supportive housing, transitional housing, long-term rental assistance, and/or greater availability
of low-income rental units are also needed. Supportive housing has no limit on length of stay and is
linked to onsite or offsite services that assist residents in retaining housing, improving his or her health
status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community.
Transitional housing is usually in buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated with
State programs that require the unit to be cycled to other eligible program recipients after some pre-
determined amount of time. Transitional housing programs provide extended shelter and supportive
services for homeless individuals and/or families with the goal of helping them live independently and
transition into permanent housing. Some programs require that the individual/family be transitioning from
a short-term emergency shelter. The length of stay varies considerably by program, but is generally longer
than two weeks and can last up to 60 days or more. In many cases transitional housing programs will
provide services up to two years or more. The supportive services may be provided directly by the
organization managing the housing or by other public or private agencies in a coordinated effort with the
housing provider. Transitional housing is generally provided in apartment style facilities with a higher
degree of privacy than short-term homeless shelters; may be provided at no cost to the resident; and may
be configured for specialized groups within the homeless population such as people with substance abuse
problems, the mentally ill, domestic violence victims, veterans, or people with HIV/AIDS.

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
It is very difficult to quantify the homeless population in a given community. However, there are
numerous agencies that work with Union City homeless persons on a daily basis. Both Abode Services
and Alameda County Housing and Community Development provide information on the homeless
population.
Abode Services
Using information collected in April 2014 from 4,280 homeless persons served at local facilities from
Fremont, Newark, and Union City, Abode Services reports that approximately 48 percent of adults are
female and 52 percent are male; 1,241 are children; 27 percent are White; 30 percent are Black/African
American; 22 percent are Latino/Hispanic; 4 percent are Asian; 4 percent are Pacific Islander; 5 percent
are multi-racial; and 6 percent are Native American. Furthermore, 29 percent of adults were homeless for
the first time, 25 percent were chronically homeless, 8 percent were veterans, 29 percent were survivors
of domestic violence, and 64 percent had a long-term disability.
Alameda County Housing and Community Development
Beginning in 2003 Alameda County Housing and Community Development has been conducting a
biennial point-in-time homeless count; however, this method requires a relatively large survey sample to
be statistically relevant, and only a few cities within the county have sufficient samples sizes to support
this type of count. The 2013 Homeless Count reflected a total of 4,264 individuals identified as homeless
on the night of January 30, 2013. The County has also implemented a countywide Homeless Management
Information Systems Report (HMIS) system (i.e., electronic database and reporting system), and to date
(2012), more than 40,000 unduplicated clients have been entered from 35 agencies in Alameda County.
The HMIS report reflects a count of 5,844 individuals who were categorized as “literally homeless” on
January 30, 2013. The HMIS data on last known permanent address is used to assign percentages to
cities. The count of homeless in Union City as determined to be 70, or 1.2 percent of the total homeless
population in Alameda County.
Countywide demographic data from the HMIS system can be used to provide a clearer picture of who is
homeless, what their needs may be, and how local government can best serve them. The HMIS system
data has limitations (e.g., does not count homeless in institutions), but gives one of the most accurate
pictures available of the homeless population in Alameda County. According to the HMIS system, in
2013:
            3 percent were between the ages of 18 and 24 and 10 percent were older than 61
            60 percent were male
            33 percent were Hispanic/Latino; 36 percent were Black or African American
            20 percent were employed
            52 percent of adults and 36 percent of children reported having a disability
            7 percent reported being veterans
            52 percent were high school graduates
            20 percent had gone through post secondary education
            48 percent reported that it was their first time being homeless

The following is a list of agencies operating support services, emergency shelters, and transitional and
supportive housing in Union City and the surrounding area:
           Centro de Servicios, Union City: Centro de Servicios has assisted more than 800 families and
            individuals every month since its inception in 1974. This nonprofit corporation is a major
            service provider for the homeless population. The center provides basic necessities, such as
            food, clothing, and blankets as well as referrals, counseling, job listings, and workshops to its
            clients. The organization's major source of funding is Union City's CDBG Program. Staff
            estimates that they assist at least 20-50 homeless or at-risk clients per week from Union City.
            Most (80 percent) of these clients are Latino. Many live in substandard housing, in their cars,
            or at local parks and campgrounds. Staff makes referrals to nearby shelters, especially Sunrise
            Village in Fremont and Second Chance in Newark.
           Second Chance, Newark: Second Chance is a counseling and recovery agency that operates
            five outpatient centers and a short-term emergency shelter. This emergency shelter has 30
            beds for single men and women and for families. Supportive services are provided on-site.
            During 2013 approximately 3,000 people were served.
           Abode Services (formerly known as Tri-City Homeless Coalition), Fremont: Abode Services
            works to provide housing and services to homeless people in the community as they work to
            help people remain stably housed and live as independently as possible. In 2013 they served
            more than 4,000 adults and children across their programs in Alameda and Santa Clara
            Counties, offering three main types of services: emergency shelter and street outreach
            services, supportive housing for formerly homeless families and individuals, and supportive
            services, such as mental health services and employment support. They provide extensive
            services to Tri-City residents, including permanent supportive housing, emergency shelter
            and services at Sunrise Village Emergency Shelter in Fremont, and social and health services
            though the HOPE Project Mobile Health Clinic. Their programs serve a wide variety of
            people, including families with children, at risk youth exiting foster care, veterans and their
            families, and people who are chronically homeless. Since 2010 they have created homes for
            almost 3,000 households experiencing homelessness.
           SAVE (Safe Alternatives to Violent Environments): SAVE is a non-profit community-based
            organization founded in 1976 to address domestic violence. They provide supportive services,
            advocacy and education, and emergency housing. In 2012 SAVE provided shelter to 243
            women and children through programs including an emergency shelter, 12-18 month
            transitional housing, subsidized housing programs, and motel vouchers.
           Family Emergency Shelter Coalition (FESCO), Hayward: FESCO operates an emergency
            shelter, the Marquis House, with 24 beds; a transitional co-housing facility, the Banyan
            House, with eight family units; and four transitional rental units. The Marquis House serves
            about 120 adults and over 200 children per year.
           Emergency Shelter Program, Hayward: The Emergency Shelter Program operates a 32-bed
            shelter for women and children and a child care center. The shelter serves approximately 220-
            260 women and children each year, and provides referrals for over 5,000 women and children
            per year.

                                                                                     Adopted January 27, 2015

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
             Human Outreach Agency, Hayward: Human Outreach Agency provides supportive services
              and housing for single men. The Flagg Street House is a 20-bed supportive housing program
              that provides shelter for up to 90 days.
Many of the service providers listed above report that they have zero vacancy rates and are forced to turn
homeless adults and families away on a weekly basis. Union City is working in a collaborative effort with
service providers and the County of Alameda to mitigate this problem through its ongoing funding of
Abode Services, Centro de Servicios, Tri-City Volunteers, and Safe Alternatives to Violent Environments
(SAVE), as well as its participation in the EveryOne Home program.
Farmworkers
There is no estimate of the number of agricultural workers living in Union City. The 2012 ACS estimate
for farmworkers combines Union City residents who are employees in agriculture with those who work in
forestry, fisheries, hunting, and mining (these figures do not include seasonal workers). As of 2012 30
Union City residents, or 0.1 percent of employed residents, worked in these sectors. The U.S. Census of
Agriculture (2012) reported 804 hired farm labor workers in Alameda County. Of these 355 laborers
worked 150 days or more and 449 worked less than 150 days. It is likely that many of the Union City
residents working in agriculture are employed by landscaping nurseries, landscaping services, and
gardens in the East Bay Area. Given that there are no significant agricultural operations in Union City,
farmworker housing is not a significant housing need in the city.
Persons with Disabilities
Persons with disabilities typically have special housing needs because of their physical and/or
developmental capabilities, fixed or limited incomes, and higher health costs associated with their
disabilities. A disability is defined broadly by the Census Bureau as a physical, mental, or emotional
condition that lasts over a long period of time and makes it difficult to live independently. While there is
limited data available on the housing needs of persons with disabilities in Union City, data on the number
of persons with disabilities and the types of these disabilities from the 2012 ACS one-year estimates are
useful in inferring housing needs. The Census Bureau defines six disabilities: hearing, vision, cognitive,
ambulatory, self-care, and independent living. Independent living does not apply to the 5-17 age group.
Table 5-27 shows information from the 2012 ACS on the disability status and types of disabilities by age
group for persons five years and older in Union City, Alameda County, and California. As shown in the
table, 10 percent of the total population in Union City five years and older had one or more disabilities in
2012, slightly higher than the 9.7 percent in Alameda County, and lower than the 10.9 percent in
California. In terms of the three age groups shown in the table, 3.1 percent of Union City’s population 5
to 17 years of age, 6.8 percent of the population 18 to 64 years of age, and 35.2 percent of seniors (65
years of age and older) had one or more disabilities in 2012. These percentages are slightly lower the
statewide averages for all age groups.
Table 5-27 also provides information on the exact nature of these disabilities. The total disabilities
number shown for all age groups in Union City (14,666) exceeds the number of persons with disabilities
(6,541) because a person can have more than one disability. Among school age children the most frequent
disability was cognitive (81.8 percent). For persons age 18 to 64 years, the most frequent disabilities were
independent living (51.1 percent) and ambulatory (50.9 percent), followed closely by cognitive (46.3
percent). Finally, for seniors ambulatory and independent living disabilities were the most frequent (59.5
percent and 58.2 percent, respectively).

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
Developmental Disabilities
SB 812, which took effect January 2011, amended State housing element law to require an evaluation of
the special housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities. A "developmental disability" is
defined as a disability that originates before an individual becomes 18 years old, continues or can be
expected to continue indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual. This includes
intellectual disabilities, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism.
Table 5-28 shows developmental disabilities by type. According to the California Department of
Developmental Services, as of November 2013, there were a total of 572 residents with developmental
disabilities served by the Regional Center of the East Bay in Union City. Of the total 23.8 are under the
age of 14, 15.9 percent are between the ages of 15 and 22, 49.3 percent are between the ages of 23 and 54,
8 percent are between 55 and 64, and 3.0 percent are older than 65 years. Most developmentally-disabled
residents in Union City have an intellectual disability (67.7 percent) and many are autistic (26.7 percent).
Many developmentally disabled residents of Union City receiving services lived in a group home facility
(217 residents or 37.9 percent), but most lived in their own home (337 or 58.9 percent). Many
developmentally disabled persons are able to live and work independently. However, more severely
disabled individuals require a group living environment with supervision, or an institutional environment
with medical attention and physical therapy. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood,
the first housing issue for the developmentally disabled is the transition from living with a
parent/guardian as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
Table 5-28 only shows residents served by the Regional Center of the East Bay. It is possible the count is
much higher. The Housing Consortium of the East Bay (HCEB) estimates 1,200 individuals with
developmental disabilities in Union City. This includes 302 individuals younger than the age of 14, 184
between the ages of 15 and 22, 576 ages 23 to 54, 104 ages 55 to 65, and 34 above the age of 65.
According to HCEB, there will be 402 more housing units needed for residents with developmental
disabilities in Union City by 2023.

Housing Needs for Persons with Disabilities
Persons with disabilities in Union City have different housing needs depending on the nature and severity
of the disability. Physically disabled persons generally require modifications to their housing units, such
as wheelchair ramps, elevators or lifts, wide doorways, accessible cabinetry, and modified fixtures and
appliances. If a disability prevents a person from operating a vehicle, then proximity to services and
access to public transportation are particularly important. If a disability prevents an individual from
working or limits income, then the cost of housing and the costs of modifications are likely to be even
more challenging. Those with severe physical or mental disabilities may also require supportive housing,
nursing facilities, or care facilities. In addition, many disabled people rely solely on Social Security
Income, which is insufficient for market rate housing.
Living arrangements for disabled persons depend on the severity of the disability. Many persons live
independently with other family members. To maintain independent living, disabled persons may need
special housing design features, income support, and in-home supportive services for persons with
medical conditions. Special design and other considerations for persons with disabilities include single-
level units, availability of services, group living opportunities, and proximity to transit. While regulations
adopted by the State require all ground floor units of new apartment complexes with five or more units to
be accessible to persons with disabilities, single family units have no accessibility requirements.
Severely mentally-ill persons are especially in need of assistance. Mentally-disabled individuals are those
with psychiatric disabilities that impair their ability to function in the community to varying degrees. The
National Institute for Mental Health (2010) estimates that in 2009, 45.9 million adults age 18 and older,
(20 percent) suffered from mental illness. If accurate for Union City, nearly 14,325 residents have some
form of mental disability that requires special housing accommodations, medical treatment, and/or
supportive services.
Community Resources for Independent Living (CRIL), a Hayward-based, nonprofit organization, serves
people with physical, mental, and developmental disabilities throughout Southern Alameda County. The
program director for CRIL reports that in 2013/2014 the organization assisted approximately 14 disabled
people from Union City in their search for housing out of a total of 42 consumers. The number of
disabled served by CRIL has gone up, as has the number of consumers seeking assistance in their search
for housing. CRIL staff cites accessibility and affordability as the primary obstacles to finding adequate
housing for their clients, many of whom rely on SSI as their sole source of income. Due to the high cost
of land, many multi-story developments are being built, which can provide accessibility constraints for
physically disabled people. In addition, a number of landlords have stopped taking Section 8 vouchers
because they will profit more by providing market-rate housing. The program director for CRIL notes that
many disabled people who were in housing are now in danger of losing their housing.
Many of the affordable housing projects in Union City have accommodations for persons with physical
disabilities. Dyer Complex and Nidas Court, the two public housing projects operated by PACH Inc.,
offer units to both senior and disabled persons. Adrienne Village Apartments offers four wheelchair
accessible units and Mission Gateway, Greenhaven, Mission Sierra, Rosewood Terrace, and Wisteria
Place each offer accessible units.

Reasonable Accommodation
State and Federal laws prohibit housing discrimination against the disabled in land use practices and
decisions, such as applying special requirements that limit the ability of disabled individuals to live in the
residence of their choice. Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and
Housing Act direct local governments to make reasonable accommodations (i.e., modifications or
exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations when such accommodations may be
necessary to afford disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For example, it
may be reasonable to accommodate requests from persons with disabilities to waive a setback
requirement or other standard of the Zoning Ordinance to ensure that homes are accessible for the
mobility impaired. Whether a particular modification is reasonable depends on the circumstances.
The City recently (2014) amended its Zoning Ordinance to include a reasonable accommodation
procedure for an individual seeking equal access to housing. Chapter 18.115 of the code outlines this
process.
Definition of Family
There are a number of State and Federal rules that govern the definition of family, including the Federal
Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, the California Fair Housing and Employment Act, the California
Supreme Court case City of Santa Barbara v. Adamson (1980), and the California Constitution privacy
clauses. The laws for families have a few primary purposes: to protect people with disabilities, to protect
non-traditional families, and to protect privacy. According to HCD and Mental Housing Advocacy
Services there are three major points to consider when writing a definition of family:
             Jurisdictions may not distinguish between related and unrelated individuals.
             The definition may not impose a numerical limit on the number of persons in a family.
             Land use restrictions for licensed group homes for six or fewer individuals must be the same
              as those for single families.
The City defines a “family” as “one or more persons occupying a dwelling and living as a single not-for-
profit housekeeping unit as distinguished from a group occupying a hotel, club, boardinghouse, fraternity,
or sorority house.” This definition is not considered restrictive.
Senior Households
Seniors are defined as persons 65 years and older and senior households are those households headed by a
person 65 years and older. Seniors have special housing needs based on factors such as age, health, self-
care capacity, economic status, family arrangement, and homeownership. Particular needs for the elderly
include smaller and more efficient housing, barrier-free and accessible housing, and a wide variety of
housing with health care and/or personal services. Various programs can help meet the needs of seniors,
including, but not limited to, congregate care, supportive services, rental subsidies, shared housing, and
housing rehabilitation assistance. For elderly with disabilities, housing with features that accommodate
disabilities can help ensure continued independent living. Elderly with mobility/self-care limitation also
benefit from transportation alternatives. Senior housing with these accommodations can allow more
independent living.
Table 5-29 shows information on the number of seniors, the number of senior households, and senior
households by tenure in Union City, Alameda County, and California in 2010. There were 7,710 people

 in Union City 65 years or older in 2010. Seniors represented 11.1 percent of the population in Union City
 in 2010 compared to 11.1 percent countywide and 11.4 percent statewide. In 2010 there were
 approximately 3,633 households in Union City headed by a householder age 65 or older. Senior
 households represented 17.7 percent of all households in Union City, compared to 18.4 percent in
 Alameda County and 20.4 percent in California. Senior households have a high homeownership rate. In
 Union City 72.0 percent of senior households owned their homes in 2010, compared to 66.5 percent of all
 households. Approximately 1,016 (28.0 percent) of senior-headed households were renters.
 As shown in Table 5-29, in 2010 there were 3,110 individuals age 65 or older with disabilities (35.2
 percent), of which 956 (10.8 percent) had self-care limitations and 1,810 (20.5 percent) had disabilities
 that interfered with independent living.

 Table 5-30 shows overpayment for seniors compared to all households by tenure in 2010. Union City had
 a higher percentage of senior homeowners overpaying for housing (35.4 percent) than countywide (32.7
 percent) and California (33.3 percent). However, the percentage of senior renters who are overpaying is
 significantly less in Union City (39.3 percent) compared to countywide (54.6 percent) and California
 (58.6 percent). This may be due to the fact that the great majority of seniors in Union City are
 homeowners and that rental housing is less common in the city as a whole.

Union City also has three affordable, privately-owned senior rental projects with a total of 209 affordable
units. More information on these properties can be found in Table 5-41 which displays subsidized and
restricted affordable housing projects. Wisteria Place and Rosewood Terrace each have a waitlist of over
400 people and are not accepting new applications. Some market-rate senior housing developments,
including the Acacia Creek Retirement Community, have vacancies
PACH Inc. owns and operates two public housing projects for seniors and disabled people in Union City:
Dyer Complex (50 one-bedroom units); and Nidus Court (50 one-bedroom units), both affordable to 30
percent of median income or flat rate. These complexes provide a total of 98 units for seniors.
As indicated above, the number of affordable housing units for seniors includes 209 privately-owned
subsidized housing units, and 98 units of public housing, for a total of 307 units. There are currently
(April 2014) thousands of applications on the Section 8 and public housing waiting lists. The waiting list
is currently (April 2014) closed, but Alameda County Housing Authority hopes to open their waitlist in
the last quarter of 2014. This indicates that there is a severe shortage of housing available for low-income
seniors in Union City.
Large Households
HUD defines a large household as one with five or more members. Large families may have specific
needs that differ from other households due to income and housing stock constraints. The most critical
housing need of large households is access to larger housing units with more bedrooms than a standard
three-bedroom dwelling. As a result large households may be overcrowded in smaller units. In general,
housing for large households should provide safe outdoor play areas for children and should be located to
provide convenient access to schools and child care facilities.
Table 5-31 shows the number and share of large households in Union City, Alameda County, and
California in 2012. According to 2012 ACS, 2,689 owner-households, or 20.2 percent of the total owner-
households in Union City, had five or more members; this proportion is even higher for renters (24.6
percent). The number of large owner households (2,689) was higher than the number of large renter
households (1,681).
The share of large households out of total households in Union City (21.7 percent) was significantly
higher than the proportion of large households in Alameda County (11.0 percent), and higher than the
proportion in California as a whole (14.3 percent of total households). As discussed previously and shown
in Table 5-13, 33.4 percent of the renter-occupied units in Union City in 2012 had three or more
bedrooms. The figure is much larger than 22.5 percent in Alameda County and 26.9 percent in California.
However, the statistics presented earlier in the chapter on overcrowding show that 14.6 percent of rental
units in Union City are overcrowded compared to 8.5 percent in Alameda County (see Table 5-15). This
suggests that there may be a need for large rental units in Union City.

Families with Single-Headed Households
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a single-headed household contains a household head and at least
one dependent, which could include a related or unrelated child, or an elderly parent. Female-headed
households have special housing needs because they are often either single-parents or single-elderly
adults living on low- or poverty-level incomes. Single-parent households with children often require
special consideration and assistance as a result of their greater need for affordable housing, accessible day
care, health care, and a variety of other supportive services. Single-parent households also tend to receive
unequal treatment in the rental housing market. Moreover, because of their relatively lower household
incomes, single-parent households are more likely to experience difficulties in finding affordable, decent,
and safe housing.
Table 5-32 shows the number of single-parent headed households in Union City, Alameda County, and
California in 2012. As shown in the table, there were 863 female-headed households in Union City,
representing 4.3 percent of all households; and 451 male-headed households, representing 2.2 percent of
all households in Union City. A total of 1,314 (6.5 percent) households in Union City were single-headed.
This percentage is less than the percentage countywide (8.6 percent) and in California (10.0 percent).

    Extremely Low-Income Households
    Extremely low-income households are defined as those households with incomes under 30 percent of the
    County’s median income. Extremely low-income households typically consist of minimum wage
    workers, seniors on fixed incomes, the disabled, and farmworkers. This income group is likely to live in
    overcrowded and substandard housing conditions. This group of households has specific housing needs
    that require greater government subsidies and assistance, housing with supportive services, single room
    occupancy (SRO) and or shared housing, and/or rental subsidies or vouchers. In recent years rising rents,
    higher income and credit standards imposed by landlords, and insufficient government assistance has
    exacerbated the problem. Without adequate assistance this group has a high risk of homelessness.
    For a family of four in Union City, a household making under $28,050 in 2014 would be considered an
    extremely low-income household by HCD. As shown in Table 5-33, Union City had a lower percentage
    (10.1 percent) of extremely low-income households than countywide (14.8 percent) and statewide (14.1
    percent) in 2010. Union City had a lower proportion of extremely low-income owners (4.5 percent) than
    countywide (6.1 percent) and statewide (6.8 percent), as well as a lower proportion of extremely low-
    income renters (24.8 percent) than countywide (25.5 percent); however, this is higher than the statewide
    average of extremely low-income renters (23.9 percent). Table 5-33 also shows that in 2010, a total of
    1,335 extremely low-income households had a cost burden greater than 50 percent, which was lower
    (66.9 percent) than countywide (68.5 percent) and similar to the statewide average (66.8 percent). Based
    on Union City’s 2014-2022 Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), there is a projected need for
    158 extremely low-income housing units (which assumes 50 percent of the very low-income allocation).

SECTION 5.3               FUTURE NEEDS ASSESSMENT
HCD is required to allocate each region’s share of the statewide housing need to Councils of
Governments (COG) based on Department of Finance (DOF) population projections and regional
population forecasts used in preparing regional transportation plans. The COG develops a Regional
Housing Need Plan (RHNP) allocating the region’s share of the statewide need to cities and counties
within the region. The RHNP promotes the following objectives:
            Increase the housing supply and the mix of housing types, tenure, and affordability in all
             cities and counties within the region in an equitable manner;
            Promote infill development and socioeconomic equity;
            Protect environmental and agricultural resources; and encourage efficient development
             patterns; and
            Promote an improved intraregional balance between jobs and housing.
Housing element law recognizes the most critical decisions regarding housing development occur at the
local level within the context of the periodically updated general plan.
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
This section describes projected future housing needs for Union City based on the 2014-2022 Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) adopted by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) on
July 18, 2013. ABAG allocates a “fair share” by income category based on projected housing need for
each jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction is required to report to HCD on how the fair share allocation can be
accommodated within the planning period. The allocations are intended to be used by jurisdictions when
updating their housing elements as the basis for assuring that adequate sites and zoning are available to
accommodate at least the number of units allocated. In addition to the 2014-2022 RHNA, Union City
must account for unaccommodated need from the previous RHNA period (2007-2014). See Appendix B
for a calculation of unaccommodated need from the 2007-2014 RHNA.

Union City General Plan Element Update
Table 5-34 shows the current and projected housing needs for the period from January 1, 2014, to October
31, 2022, for Union City. As shown in Table 5-34, ABAG allocated 1,106 new housing units to Union
City. The allocation is equivalent to a yearly need of approximately 126 housing units for the 8.8-year
time period. Adding the unaccommodated need of 84 lower-income units from the 2007-2014 RHNA, the
city has a total need of 1,190 units and a yearly need of approximately 135 units. Of the total 1,190
housing units, 773 units are to be affordable to moderate-income households and below, including 158
extremely low-income units, 159 very low-income units, 264 low-income units, and 192 moderate-
income units.

SECTION 5.4                RESOURCE INVENTORY
Section 5.4 assesses the availability of land and services to meet the unaccommodated RHNA described
in Section 5.3. This section discusses Union City's planned projects, capacity on vacant/underutilized sites
under existing zoning, and capacity on sites that could potentially be rezoned to higher densities.
Projects Planned Since January 1, 2014
Since the RHNA projection period runs from January 1, 2014, to October 31, 2022, Union City’s RHNA
can be reduced by the number of new units planned, built, or approved since January 1, 2014. As shown
in Table 5-35, there are two developments planned as of January 1, 2014: Block 3 of the Station District
and Pulte Homes Cabello project.
Union City’s Station District is a transit-oriented community that encompasses approximately 100 acres
around the Union City BART Station. The Intermodal Station provides direct and easy access to BART,
local and regional bus service (Union City Transit, AC Transit and Dumbarton Express), and future
connections to passenger rail services that will link to Sacramento, San Jose, Silicon Valley, and the San
Joaquin Valley. Phase 1 of the project, which includes 155 apartment units for very low-, and extremely
low-income families and two manager units, is now built and occupied. Block 3 (Phase 2) of the Station
District is planned for 242 market-rate apartment units. The proposed project is currently being reviewed
by the City, but it is anticipated that the project will be approved early in the planning period. Based on a
Union City Housing Element                                                                          Page 5-59

     projected rent schedule for the project, 215 of the units will be affordable to moderate-income households
     and 27 will be affordable to above moderate-income households.
     The Pulte Homes Cabello Project includes 45 homes at 4500 Cabello Street on an eight acre property that
     once housed Cabello Elementary School, which has been closed since 2007. The New Haven Unified
     School District sold the property in 2013 to Pulte Homes in an effort to generate funds to offset district
     budget cuts. The proposed homes would range in size from 2,900 to 3,341 square feet on 5,000 square
     foot or larger lots. The proposed project is currently being reviewed by the City, but it is anticipated that
     the project will be approved early in the planning period. All 45 units are inventoried as above moderate-
     income units.

     Sites Inventory
     An adequate supply of land for residential construction is one of the most critical resources necessary to
     meet future housing demand. State law governing the preparation of housing elements emphasizes the
     importance of an adequate land supply by requiring that each housing element contain “an inventory of
     land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having potential for
     redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to these
     sites” (Government Code Section 65583(a)(3).
     The residential land inventory is required “to identify sites that can be developed for housing within the
     planning period and that are sufficient to provide for the jurisdiction’s share of the regional housing need
     for all income levels” (Government Code Section 65583.2(a)). The phrase “land suitable for residential
     development” in Government Code Section 65583(a) (3) includes all of the following:
                 Vacant sites zoned for residential use;
                 Vacant sites zoned for nonresidential use that allows residential development; and
                 Underutilized sites that have zoning that allows residential development and are capable of
                  being developed at a higher density.

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
In order to calculate the number of units that will accommodate its share of the regional housing need for
lower-income households, a jurisdiction is required to do either of the following (Government Code
Section 65583.2I(3)):
            Provide an analysis demonstrating how the adopted densities accommodate this need. The
             analysis shall include, but is not limited to, factors such as market demand, financial
             feasibility, or information based on development project experience within a zone or zones
             that provide housing for lower-income households.
            Use the “default density standards” that are “deemed appropriate” in State law to
             accommodate housing for lower-income households given the type of the jurisdiction. Union
             City is classified as a “metropolitan jurisdiction” and the density standard is defined as “sites
             allowing at least 30 units per acre.” HCD is required to accept sites that meet this density
             standard as appropriate for accommodating Union City’s share of the regional housing need
             for lower-income households.
The extent to which the City has “adequate sites” for housing affordable to very low- or low-income
households will depend, in part, on General Plan and zoning standards, particularly typical density,
parking, building coverage, height, and setback standards.
Once the City has demonstrated that it has the theoretical development capacity to accommodate the
RHNA, it has two obligations. First, the City must maintain a “no net loss” policy of its residential
development capacity over the eight-year housing element time frame. Sites listed in the adopted Housing
Element land inventory may not be down-zoned to lower-density residential uses, rezoned to non-
residential uses, or approved for fewer units than the number included in the site inventory unless the City
makes a finding that there is sufficient remaining capacity to meet the RHNA. If there is not sufficient
capacity, the City must upzone/rezone alternative sites prior to the density reduction or rezone on the
inventoried site. Second, the City must continue to allocate available funding resources to and facilitate
the development of affordable housing, as it has done frequently in the past. The City is not obligated to
ensure construction of low-income housing on any particular site within its city limits.
Methodology
The following criteria were used to identify vacant and underutilized sites:
            Location: Only parcels within city limits were included in the inventory.
            Vacancy: Vacant parcels were initially selected based on the County Assessor’s use codes in
             the parcel database. Vacancy status was verified through aerial photographs and field
             observation. Since the Assessor’s use codes are not completely accurate for all parcels, the
             vacant parcel list was supplemented with additional entries from City staff.
            General Plan land use designations: Only parcels with the following land use designations
             that allow for residential development were retained in the inventory (see also Table 5-36):
                 Residential (3 to 6 du/acre) (R 3-6)
                 Residential (6 to 10 du/acre) (R 6-10)
                 Residential (10 to 17 du/acre) (R 10-17)
                 Residential (17 to 30 du/acre) (R 17-30)

Adopted January 27, 2015

             Residential (30 to 60 du/acre) (R 30-60)
             Station Mixed-Use (CSMU) (60-165)
             Retail Commercial (CR)
         Zoning districts: Only parcels with the following zoning districts that allow for residential
          development were retained in the inventory (see also Table 5-36 and Table 5-47):
             RS 10000 Single Family Residential District
             RS 8000 Single Family Residential District
             RS 7000 Single Family Residential District
             RS 6000 Single Family Residential District
             RS 6000(D) Single Family Residential District
             RS 4500 Single Family Residential District
             R 5000 Decoto Residential District
             511 Area District
             RM 3500 Multifamily Residential District
             RM 2500 Multifamily Residential District
             RM 1500 Multifamily Residential District
             CSMU Station Mixed Use Commercial District
             CN Neighborhood Commercial District
             CC Community Commercial District
             CS Specially Commercial District
         Size: All vacant residential or mixed use-zoned parcels were inventoried; however, only
          parcels or clusters of parcels larger than 0.8 acres are identified in this Housing Element
          inventory, assuming that parcels smaller than this size would not be economically feasible for
          developing affordable housing. While this 0.8-acre minimum excludes some parcels that
          could potentially be developed for higher-density housing, it enabled the inventory to focus
          on the most developable parcels. When parcels had an appropriate land use designation or
          zoning that only covered a part of a parcel, only the parts of the parcel allowing for
          residential development were included in the inventory.
         Density: The General Plan land use designation density ranges are stated as the allowable
          range of dwelling units per gross acre.
         Adequacy: All parcels (or portions of parcels) that met the criteria above were reviewed by
          City staff to confirm vacancy status, ownership, adequacy of public utilities and services,
          possible environmental constraints (e.g., flood zones and steep slopes), and other possible
          constraints to development feasibility.
         Buildout Capacity: The City assumes that development will occur at 85 percent of
          maximum buildout capacity. The City evaluated the implementation of its current
Page 5-62                                                                      Union City Housing Element
                                                                                Adopted January 27, 2015

Union City General Plan Element Update
             multifamily development standards and on-site improvement requirements and determined
             that the imposition of setback, building height, and parking requirements, as well as site
             improvement requirements listed in Section 5.5 Potential Housing Constraints do not allow
             maximum densities to be achieved. The City does not have any performance standards for the
             mixed-use designation that dictate how much residential, commercial, or office can be
             included in the development. Mixed-use sites will have commercial uses only on the ground
             floor, and are therefore capable of meeting 85 percent of maximum density. This is further
             demonstrated by projects that have been approved and constructed at densities at or above 85
             percent. The following is a list of project examples that meet this criteria:
                 o    Station Center Family Housing: This mixed-use project has commercial on the
                      ground floor with residential units above. The project has a total of 157 units, of which
                      155 are affordable units. It was approved in 2009 and is located in the Station District
                      and has a CSMU General Plan and zoning designation. The project has a density of 73
                      units per acre. At the time the project was approved, the maximum density in the
                      CSMU was 80 units per acre, so this development was 91 percent of the maximum
                      density allowed.
                 o    Avalon Bay Communities: This project, built in 2006, is also located in the Station
                      District and has a CSMU General Plan and zoning designation. The project has a total
                      of 438 units. It has a density of 76 units per acre. At the time the project was
                      approved, the maximum density in the CSMU was 80 units per acre, so this
                      development was 95 percent of the maximum density allowed.
            Residential Capacity in the Station District: The City assumed a different residential
             development capacity for the mixed-use site in the CSMU zoning district. The CSMU zoning
             district, which is the Station Mixed-Use General Plan (CSMU) designation, is a high-density
             (i.e., up to 165 units per acre) transit-oriented development area. Since the density allows for
             a broad range, the Housing Element uses a conservative assumption of 55 percent of
             maximum capacity in this district, or 88 units per acre.
            Market Feasibility of Developing Underutilized Sites. Union City is a nearly built out city.
             However, it is located in a region with significant demand for new residential development.
             Much of the recent and proposed residential developments in Union City have been on
             underutilized sites that have existing uses. The most significant example of new development
             on underutilized land is the Station Area, where hundreds of new housing units have been
             built, and hundreds more are planned, on more than 80 acres of previously contaminated
             underutilized land that once contained a steel plant and other industrial uses. The proposed
             project at 4500 Cabello, shown in Table 5-35 above, is also on an underutilized site. The
             project proposed to build 45 homes on a 7.85-acre parcel that is currently developed with an
             elementary school. With limited vacant land, much of the development that will occur in the
             future will be on underutilized sites.
Land Use Category and Affordability
Table 5-36 summarizes the land use designations and corresponding zoning districts that are used in the
land inventory. Each land use designation corresponds with at least one zoning district, in some cases
more than one. For example R17-30 and R30-60 land use designations could have the same zoning
district, RM 1500.
Union City Housing Element                                                                            Page 5-63
Adopted January 27, 2015

For R3-6 and R6-10 designations, which correspond with R, RS, and 511 districts, one primary dwelling
unit and one secondary dwelling unit are allowed on each site; units constructed in these districts are most
likely affordable to only above moderate-income households. In regard to moderate-income households,
the R10-17 land use designation is most likely to accommodate these households. The R10-17 land use
designation is consistent with the RM2500 and RM3500 zoning districts which allow 2,500 and 3,500
square feet of site area per dwelling unit, respectively, and can accommodate a range of 10 to 17 units per
acre.
The CR designation includes three zoning districts: Neighborhood Commercial District (CN),
Community Commercial (CC), and Specialty Commercial (CS). Residential uses above ground floor
commercial uses are a permitted use in the Old Alvarado and Mission Boulevard neighborhoods for CN,
CC, and CS districts with densities of up to 30 units per acre. The R17-30, R30-60, and CSMU
designations and their corresponding zoning districts, have density ranges (i.e., between 17 to 30 du/acre
for the R17-30 designation, 30 to 60 du/acre for the R30-60 designation, and 60 to 165 du/acre for the
CSMU designation) that accommodate lower-income households. In addition, lower-income housing can
be provided by housing types, such as manufactured or modular homes or secondary dwelling units,
which are allowed under single family land use designations and zoning districts.

Union City General Plan Element Update
Capacity on Vacant and Underutilized Sites Under Existing Zoning
Union City is nearly built out and has a limited supply of land. In order to accommodate the City’s
RHNA, the City will need to rezone several sites. Table 5-37 shows the location, size, number of parcels,
and the estimated number of potential housing units that may be accommodated on vacant and
underutilized sites under existing zoning.
Table 5-37 shows that there is a total of 30.9 acres of land that could accommodate an estimated 562
units, including 427 lower-income units and 135 above moderate-income units. There are seven vacant
and underutilized sites that, under existing zoning, provide residential capacity in Union City:
            Sites that begin with the letters “LI” are inventoried for “lower-income” units. There are four
             “LI” sites (LI-1, LI-2, LI-3, and LI-4) included in this section.
            Sites that begin with the letters “AM” are inventoried for “above moderate-income” units.
             There is one “AM” site (AM-1) included in this section.
            Sites that begin with the letters “PR” are “potential rezone” sites. There are two “PR” sites
             (PR-2 (portion) and PR-4) included in this section. These sites are included in Table 5-37
             because they are currently zoned for residential uses. The expected units on these sites are
             based on existing zoning.
While these sites provide enough capacity in the above-moderate income category to meet the City’s total
RHNA, they leave an unmet need of 154 lower-income units (i.e., low-, very low- and extremely low-
income) and 210 above moderate-income units. In order to meet this need, the sites inventory includes
four potential rezone sites, summarized in Table 5-38. The potential rezone sites are sites that the City
will consider rezoning to higher densities to accommodate the RHNA. The locations of
vacant/underutilized sites and potential rezone sites are shown in Figure 5-4.
Site LI-1: Station District Block 2
Station District Block 2 is the site with the most residential potential. The site was included in the 2010
Housing Element and remains vacant. The 3.5-acre site is located within Union City’s Intermodal Station
district, which is an ABAG Priority Development Area (PDA), and will be eligible for capital
infrastructure funds, planning grants, and technical assistance, which will help remove impediments to the
development of the site. The site has a CSMU General Plan and zoning designation, which allows up to
165 units per acre. For purposes of reducing reliance on this site in the inventory, the City is assuming 55
percent of the maximum allowed density, or 88 units per acre. This results in 318 expected units, all of
which are inventoried as lower-income units based on the allowed density.
The Intermodal Station District and Transit Facility Plan, adopted in February 2002, sets land use
regulations for the land within the Station District, including Block 2. Windflower Properties, LLC has
Disposition and Development Agreement with Union City for developing Block 2 which includes
performance benchmarks. Site LI-1 is included in Table 5-37 and shown in Figure 5-5.
Site LI-2: Union City Boulevard South
The Union City Boulevard South is a three-parcel site totaling 2.1 acres. This site was included in the
2010 Housing Element and remains vacant. It is located in the Old Alvarado neighborhood. The site is
designated CR and zoned CS, which allows up to 30 units per acre in a mixed-use development. City staff
has received preliminary development plans over the last several months for this site that propose an
Union City Housing Element                                                                          Page 5-65

attached townhome product type. This product type is yielding a lower unit count than the assumed 85
percent used in some of the other development estimates. Although none of these projects have moved
forward, a lower unit count of 40 is assumed for this site, all of which were inventoried as lower-income.
Site LI-2 is included in Table 5-37 and shown in Figure 5-6.
Site LI-3: Silver Dollar
Silver Dollar is a 0.5-acre parcel that is mostly vacant. There are two single family homes and the vacant
Silver Dollar Bar on the parcel. The site is designated CR and zoned CS, which allows up to 30 units per
acre in a mixed-use development. Assuming 85 percent of the maximum allowed density, this site can
accommodate 13 units, all of which were inventoried as lower-income. Site LI-3 is included in Table 5-37
and shown in Figure 5-7. The existing bar has been vacant for approximately seven years and the building
is dilapidated. City staff has received several inquiries within the last few months regarding potential
redevelopment of the site to accommodate a mixed-use residential project.
Site LI-4: Mission Boulevard
Mission Boulevard is made up of seven vacant parcels totaling 2.2 acres between Mission Boulevard and
2nd Street. This site was included in the 2010 Housing Element and remains vacant. It is designated CR
and zoned CC, which allows up to 30 units per acre in a mixed-use development. Assuming 85 percent of
the maximum allowed density, this site can accommodate 56 units, all of which were inventoried as
lower-income. Site LI-4 is included in Table 5-37 and shown in Figure 5-8.
Site AM-1: Turk Island
Turk Island is a 6.2-acre parcel site that was included in the 2010 Housing Element. This vacant site is
overlain by six feet of landfill material that must be removed prior to development. Additional site
constraints include high voltage wires running on the western part of the site; however, in discussions
with interested developers, the high voltage wires were never brought up as an issue. The site is
designated R3-6 and Zoned 511, which allows up to six units per acre. Assuming 85 percent of the
maximum allowed density, this site can accommodate 31 units, all of which were inventoried as above
moderate-income. Site AM-1 is included in Table 5-37 and shown in Figure 5-9.
Site PR-2 (portion): Whipple Road
Whipple Road (portion) is a single parcel that is part of the larger six-parcel PR-2 Potential Rezone Site.
The parcel included in the vacant/underutilized sites inventory is the largest of the six and is the only
residentially-zoned parcel within the PR-2 Potential Rezone Site. The City does not have any applications
in process for this property and it is unclear if the owners are interested in redevelopment. However this
site was listed in the 2002 and 2010 Housing Elements. The existing zoning of R6-10 allows up to 10
units per acre. Assuming 85 percent of the maximum allowed density, this site can accommodate 25 units,
all of which were inventoried as above moderate-income. Site PR-2 (portion) is included in Table 5-37
and Figure 5-11. Since the PR-2 (portion) is part of the larger PR-2 potential rezone site, it is also
included in Table 3-38, and the capacity for higher-density residential if rezoned is described on page 5-
82.

Site PR-4: Cal Trans
The Cal Trans site is a collection of five parcels totaling 37.5 acres located south of Alvarado Niles Road
on the southern edge of the city limits. This site is vacant and has few development constraints. The site is
owned by Cal Trans and a portion of the site is planned for the East-West Connector Project, which will
provide improved access between I-880 and Mission Boulevard. Cal Trans will not need all of the site for
the connector, and the Housing Element only identifies the capacity on remnant properties that will be left
over once the connector is completed.
All five parcels on this site have some acreage designated for residential development. In Table 3-37 the
acreage available for residential development is shown in the column with total acres in parenthesis. Only
13.9 of the 37.5 total acres are currently zoned for residential development, all of which is R3-6. The
remainder is either OS or PI. Assuming 85 percent of the maximum allowed density of six units per acre,
this site can accommodate 79 units under existing zoning, all of which were inventoried as above
moderate-income. Site PR-4 is included in Table 5-37 and shown in Figure 5-13. It is also included as a
potential rezone site in Table 5-38, and the capacity for higher-density development if rezoned, is
described in more detail on page 5-83.

   Represents the maximum number of units allowed for the specified land use designation.

   Expected units are calculated as 85 percent of the maximum density for all designations and zones except CSMU and site LI-2. This accounts for a realistic unit
 capacity based on requirements for infrastructure improvements and densities achieved in past projects. Expected units in the CSMU designation/zone are calculated
 as 55 percent of the maximum allowed density of 165 units per acre to reduce reliance on this site to meet the RHNA. LI-2 expected density is based on preliminary
 development plans for the area.

Union City General Plan Element Update
Proposed Sites for Rezoning
While the sites identified in Table 5-37 provide enough capacity in the moderate-income category, they
leave a remaining need of 154 lower-income units and 210 above moderate-income units. In order to meet
this need, the City has identified four potential rezone sites, summarized in Table 5-38. When the new
zoning is adopted, these sites will allow the City to meet its RHNA in all categories. The rezone program
is supported through Program HE-A.a. The City will complete the rezoning within two years of adoption
of the Housing Element and monitor the availability of vacant land.
Two of the potential rezone sites (PR-1 and PR-3) are currently zoned for non-residential uses. If rezoned,
these sites would provide new capacity that was not previously counted in Table 3-37. The other two
rezone sites (PR-2 and PR-4) are, at least in part, currently zoned for residential uses. The capacity from
these sites under existing zoning was counted towards the RHNA in Table 3-37. The rezone program
would upzone these sites to higher densities. In these cases the expected units under existing zoning are
removed and the expected units under their potential zoning are added to the inventory. As a result, 104
above moderate-income units were removed from the inventory. The total residential potential on all four
sites, if rezoned, is 515 units, including 314 lower-income units and 201 moderate-income units. The
potential sites for rezoning are summarized in Table 3-38.
Site PR-1: Alameda Creek
The Alameda Creek Site is a single parcel site located adjacent to an existing neighborhood on the
southern edge of the city limits. The parcel was included in the 2010 Housing Element as a potential
rezone site. This parcel, owned by the Alameda County Water district, can accommodate residential
development on at least 3.5 acres of the 10.4-acre site. This site is currently designated and zoned OS and
the East-West Connector is planned to run through a portion of the site. A minimum of 3.5 acres could be
rezoned to RM1500 to accommodate lower-income households. Assuming 85 percent of the maximum
allowed density of 30 units per acre, this site could accommodate 89 units after the rezoning, all of which
are inventoried as lower-income. Site PR-1 is included in Table 5-38 and shown in Figure 5-10. (Note:
This site was identified in the 2009 Housing Element as a potential site to rezone.)
Site PR-2: Whipple Road
The Whipple Road Site is made up of six parcels totaling 5.21 acres. The largest parcel (APN: 486-18-70)
is currently designated R6-10 and zoned R5000. Since this parcel has residential zoning in place, it was
included as an underutilized site in Table 5-37. The PR-2 site includes this parcel and four others that are
all currently designated CR and zoned CN. Under the rezone program, all five parcels would be
designated R17-30 and zoned RM1500. This would allow up to 30 units per acre. Assuming 85 percent of
the maximum allowed density of 30 units per acre, this site could accommodate 133 units, all of which
are inventoried as lower-income. Since a portion of this site (i.e., APN 486-18-70) was counted in Table
5-37 as an underutilized R6-10 site, 25 above moderate-income units are removed from the inventory as a
result of this rezoning. Site PR-2 is included in Table 5-38 and shown in Figure 5-11.
Site PR-3: Alvarado Niles Road
The Alvarado Niles Road site is made up of four parcels totaling 5.21 acres. This site is currently
designated and zoned Agriculture. There are residences on all four parcels and one parcel is currently
(2014) used for farming. The parcel used for farming is surrounded by urban development on all sides.
Staff has received inquiries in the past regarding the development of this property for multi-family

residential similar to what is developed along the northerly property line. Under the rezone program all
four parcels would be designated R17-30 and zoned RM1500, allowing for up to 30 units per acre.
Assuming 85 percent of the maximum allowed density, this site could accommodate 133 lower-income
units after the rezoning. Site PR-3 is included in Table 5-38 and shown in Figure 5-12.
Site PR-4: Cal Trans
The Cal Trans site is a collection of five parcels totaling 37.5 acres located south of Alvarado Niles Road
on the southern edge of the city limits. This site is vacant and has few development constraints. All five
parcels have some acreage designated for residential development. In Table 3-38 the acreage currently
available for residential development is shown in the column with total acres in parenthesis. There are
13.9 of the 37.5 total acres currently zoned for residential (R3-6) development. The remainder is either
OS or PI. Since this parcel has residential zoning in place, it was included as a vacant site in Table 5-37.
Under the rezone program the residential portion of all four parcels would be designated R10-17 and
zoned RM2500, while the OS and PI areas would remain the same. This would allow up to 17 units per
acre. Assuming 85 percent of the maximum allowed density, this site could accommodate 201 units, all of
which are inventoried as moderate-income. Since this site was counted in Table 3-37 as a vacant site, 79
above moderate-income units are removed from the inventory as a result of this rezoning. Site PR-4 is
included in Table 5-38 and shown in Figure 5-13.

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
Projection of Second Units
Second units can be an important source of affordable housing since they can be constructed relatively
cheaply because of no associated land costs and most often do not require government subsidies to bridge
the affordability gap. In addition, second units provide other benefits, such as supplemental income to the
homeowner and “lifecycle housing” for seniors.
State law allows jurisdictions to rely on second units to accommodate a portion of the regional housing
need. In order to do so the element must include an estimate of the potential number of second units that
are likely to be developed in the planning period based on an analysis that considers various factors,
including community need for second units and the number of second units built in the past. Given the
built out nature of Union City, there is a growing need for second units to meet housing demand.
While no second units were built during the previous Housing Element planning period, this was more a
reflection of market conditions during the recession and less a reflection of the demand or feasibility of
building second units in Union City. The City has recently begun to receive more inquiries for second
units. Assuming an average of two units per year from January 1, 2014, to October 31, 2022, there will be
an estimated 17 second units built during the RHNA planning period.
While second units are affordable by design and many may be rented at rates affordable to lower-income
households, the Housing Element takes a conservative approach and counts the projection of second units
toward the moderate-income RHNA.
RHNA Summary
Table 5-39 provides a summary of Union City’s ability to meet the 2014-2022 RHNA. After adding the
unaccommodated need from the 2007-2014 Housing Element, the total RHNA for the 2014-2022
Housing Element is 1,190 units, including 581 lower-income units, 192 moderate-income units, and 417
above moderate-income units. After accounting for planned projects and capacity on vacant and
underutilized land, Union City had a 40-unit surplus for moderate-income units but a remaining need of
154 lower-income units and 210 above moderate-income units.
The rezone program described in this Housing Element could result in capacity for an additional 314
lower-income units and 201 moderate-income units. However, since some of the sites were, at least in
part, counted as vacant/underutilized sites under existing zoning, the rezone program would remove 104
above moderate-income units from the inventory. After accounting for the rezone program, the City has a
surplus of 160 lower-income units and 214 moderate-income units. The above moderate-income deficit of
314 units is accommodated by the surplus in the lower-income and moderate-income categories.

Union City General Plan Element Update
Adequacy of Public Facilities, Services, and Infrastructure
This section addresses the adequacy of public facilities, services, and infrastructure to accommodate
planned residential growth. Public services and facilities are not expected to pose a constraint on
residential development within the time frame of the Housing Element (i.e., 2015-2023). The following
paragraphs summarize the current (2014) status of each of those services essential to residential
development.
Water
Union City is served by the Alameda County Water District (ACWD), which obtains its water supply
from both surface water and ground water sources. The district's service area also includes Fremont and
Newark and covers a total area of 105 square miles. ACWA currently (2012) serves 82,533 customers out
of the total population of its service area (331,387). The ACWD currently (2012) produces an average of
43 million gallons per day. However, maximum production capacity is 63 million gallons per day.
Seventy percent of supplies are used by residential customers, with the remainder used by commercial,
industrial, institutional, and large landscape customers.
ACWD meets district water demands from the following sources:
             The State Water Project (40 percent);
             San Francisco PUC – Hetch Hetchy (20 percent); and
             Alameda Creek Watershed Runoff (40 percent).
Long-range water planning for the ACWD service area is provided in the district's Integrated Resources
Plan (IRP), adopted in 2014. Due primarily to water conservation, ACWD’s daily water demand today is
roughly 10 million gallons less than was predicted in 2005. Based on the IRP, ACWD has capacity to
meet demand for the next 35 years, under multiple scenarios.
Although the ACWD has no control on water service hookups, there are no constraints on providing
service in its service area relative to pipe sizes, age of pipes, or other infrastructure issues.
Sewer
The Union Sanitary District (USD) provides wastewater collection and treatment services for Union City,
Fremont, and Newark. They operate over 789 miles of sanitary sewers and 9.9 square miles within Union
City, out of 60.1 square miles of total service area. The 2012 Average Dry Weather Flow (ADWF) was
24 million gallons per day (MGD) out of its permitted plant capacity of 33 MGD. Peak flow capacity in
wet weather is 85 MGD. Districtwide, 97.2 percent of USD’s customers are domestic or residential, 1.5
percent are commercial, and 1.2 percent are industrial. The annual sewer service charge was
approximately $320 in 2014, which is the third lowest out of 27 Bay Area agencies and communities.
USD operates the Alvarado Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is located within the city limits, just west
of Union City Boulevard, south of its intersection with Alvarado Boulevard. USD recently (2012)
received the National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA) Gold "Peak Performance Award."
The Union Sanitary District has capacity to meet projected need through the Housing Element Planning
Period. There are currently (July 2014) no plans to expand capacity.

Inventory of Local, State, and Federal Housing and Financing
Programs
Federal, State, and local agencies and private developers have a long history of active involvement and
cooperation in the provision of affordable housing and the improvement of housing conditions in Union
City. Because of the high cost of new construction, more than one source of public funds is required to
construct an affordable housing development. Union City does not act as a developer in the production of
affordable units, but relies upon the private sector to develop new units with the assistance of these
various funding sources.
Local Funding and Housing Programs
This section describes funding sources and local housing programs operated by the City, Alameda
County, and the Alameda County Housing Authority
Former Redevelopment Agency and Successor Agency
Union City’s Redevelopment Agency was dissolved on February 1, 2012. Prior to the dissolution of
redevelopment, the Low- and Moderate-Income Housing Fund (LMIHF) was the main source of housing
funds used to support the City’s housing programs. State law required that the Redevelopment Agency
deposit 20 percent of the gross tax increment revenues from redevelopment project areas into the LMIHF
to be used exclusively for housing for persons of low- and moderate-income. With the elimination of the
Redevelopment Agency, there will be no future funding for the LMIHF from property tax increment.
The City of Union City acts as the Housing Successor Agency of the Former Redevelopment Agency. As
the Housing Successor, the City oversees bond proceeds of the former Redevelopment Agency. In 2014
the Successor Agency conveyed approximately $2.6 million in 2010 Housing Bonds to the City of Union
City. The funding is being used as follows:
           $1.6 million to upgrade and repair backbone infrastructure through the Repair and
            Replacement program at the Tropic Mobile Home Park. This freed up funds for the Tropics
            Mobile Home Park owners to continue to operate the Rental Assistance program, which
            provides grants ranging from $86 to $176 a month to 122 very low- and extremely low-
            income households; and
           $1 million for the Union City Home Rehabilitation Program, which will provide grants
            ranging from $500 to $35,000 to very low- and extremely low-income households for home
            rehabilitation.
Housing Authority of the County of Alameda
The Housing Authority of the County of Alameda (HACA) exercises housing authority responsibilities
for Union City as well as for the balance of Alameda County, excluding Oakland, Berkeley, Livermore,
and the City of Alameda, which all contain their own housing authorities. It manages the Section 8
Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP), Section 8 Project-Based Voucher Program (PBV), Section 8
Moderate Rehabilitation Program, and public housing. HACA operated four public housing complexes in
Union City, with a total of 194 units; however, in 2014 the management of 158 units including Nidus
Court, Dyer Street, and 58 scattered sites moved to PACH, Inc., an affiliate of HACA. The Housing

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
Authority now owns and operates only 36 units of conventional public housing for very low-income
families in Union City.
These units now receive Project-Based Voucher (PBV) assistance so that the units remain affordable.
Many of the tenants remained in place while others chose to move with use of a Housing Choice
Voucher. Vacancies for the PBV units were filled by persons from the HACA waiting list. There are
currently (2014) 640 applicants on their combined waiting list that may receive Housing Choice
Vouchers, and 2,107 that may be assisted in their public housing units. HACA is only accepting
applications from applicants in need of supportive services offered at a particular PBV project and
displaced families. They anticipate opening the waitlist before 2015.
There is a total of 7,021 vouchers used in HACA’s jurisdiction; 797 of these vouchers are in Union City.
Table 5-40 shows the breakdown of the vouchers in Alameda County by income.

Currently (April 2014), HACA does not own any vacant land in Union City, nor does it plan to construct
any more affordable housing in Union City at this time.
Additional Local Funding and Programs
The City's financial support of private sector applications for funding to outside agencies is very
important. Funding provided by Union City can be used as matching funds required of some programs.
Local funding is also used for leverage. City support of private sector applications enhances the
competitive advantage of each application for funds. The Redevelopment Agency used to be the primary
source of local funds before it was dissolved in 2012. Union City is acting as the successor agency.
In 2001 the City adopted an inclusionary housing program, which includes an in-lieu fee provision,
although the emphasis of the program is for the developers to actually build the affordable units. More
information on the inclusionary housing program is in the affordable housing ordinance section.
The City provides first-time homebuyer assistance with a revolving pool of funds used to leverage private
bank funding. The initial funding for the revolving loan guarantees came from the now abolished
Redevelopment Agency.
The City supports and funds ECHO housing to provide fair housing counseling and other services. The
City also participates in the monitoring of activities contained in the HOME Consortium’s Analysis of
Impediments to Fair Housing.
The City contracts with the County of Alameda for housing rehabilitation and minor home repairs. The
City’s rehabilitation program, currently (July 2014) implemented by the County, has rehabilitated over
900 homes since its beginning in 1976.

Adopted January 27, 2015

In the area of homeless and special needs population assistance, the City uses general funds to support
agencies that address homeless issues and special needs.
As part of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), the City encourages local lenders to provide
favorable lending terms for projects that involve the provision of affordable rental and ownership
housing. Staff works with local lenders to increase lending in lower-income census tracts. The City also
encourages lenders to improve the quality and diversity of products that they offer clients in the
community.
In most cases other entities, including for-profit and non-profit developers, apply for funds or other
program benefits. For example, nonprofit developers apply directly to HUD for Section 202 and Section
811 loans, as did Eden Housing for the Rosewood Terrace and Wisteria Place senior projects. Union City
does not act as a developer in the production of affordable units, but relies upon the private sector to
develop new units with the assistance of these various funding sources. The City can help sponsor grant
and loan applications, provide matching funds, or furnish land at below market cost. However, there are
also programs, such as Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP), to which the City would apply directly.
State and Federal Programs
Funding available from the State of California and the Federal government is in a constant state of flux.
The three programs described below are long-standing sources.
Community Development Block Grant Program
The Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) is the largest Federal housing-related
program for affordable housing. It is a “pass-through” program that allows local governments to use
Federal funds to alleviate poverty and blight.
CDBG funds are used for a variety of housing efforts, including activities aimed at reducing costs for
private development, housing acquisition, and rehabilitation through short- and long-term loans, and fair
housing activities. Historically, Union City has received between $450,000-$700,000 annually through
CDBG funding. However, the amount of CDBG funding has decreased significantly in recent years. In
2013 and 2014 the City received about $450,000 in CDBG funds.
California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA)
CalHFA provides a variety of tax-exempt bond financing for the creation and preservation of affordable
housing. They also provide first-time homebuyer loans for lower- and moderate-income households.
The Residential Development Loan Program (RDLP) is project-specific funding that offers a deferred, 3
percent interest rate loan with a maximum term of five years to local government agencies for financing
site acquisition, predevelopment, and construction costs to facilitate the development of affordable infill,
owner-occupied housing projects. The Program also directly links RDLP-financed projects to CalHFA's
California Homebuyer's Downpayment Assistance Program (CHDAP) to provide subordinate loans to
eligible first-time homebuyers. The program had an estimated $175 million from Proposition 46 and
Proposition 1C in December 2007.
The City’s down payment assistance program will be using CalHFA loans wherever possible for its first
time homebuyer’s program.

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
California HOME Investment Partnership Act
The California HOME Investment Partnership Act is a formula-based block grant program similar to
CDBG. HOME funds are intended to provide incentives for the acquisition, construction, and
rehabilitation of affordable rental and ownership units. The City is required to provide matching funds. In
2013 Union City participated in the Alameda County HOME consortium’s application for funds from
HOME. About $88,000 in HOME funds were used to augment the City’s Housing Rehabilitation in 2013.
Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program
The Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program is a Federal and State housing subsidy program
that provides tax credits to the private sector for the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of
affordable rental housing. To be eligible for a tax credit, 20 percent of the units in a housing development
must rent to very low-income households earning less than 50 percent of area median income, or 40
percent of the units must rent to households with incomes of less than 60 percent. Federal law requires
that developments maintain the restrictions for 30 years or longer, but State law requires that
developments retain these levels of affordability for at least 55 years. To be successful, tax credit projects
require an additional subsidy that can include no- or low-cost land, local government contributions, or
density bonuses and other concessions. There are four projects in Union City with a total of 518 low-
income units that were built using tax credits: Vintage Court Senior Apartments, Mission Gateway,
Station District Family Housing (Mid-Pen), and Los Robles Apartments.
Alameda County Mortgage Certificate Program
The Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) Program provides assistance to first-time homebuyers for the
purchase of owner-occupied single family homes, townhomes, and condominiums by reducing the
amount of Federal income taxes otherwise due (but not to exceed the amount of Federal taxes owed for
the year after other credits and deductions have been taken). The unused tax credits can be carried
forward three years, until used.
The Federal income tax advantage provided by the MCC for a homebuyer who keeps the same mortgage
loan and lives in the same house in Alameda County will be equal to 15 percent of the mortgage interest
paid annually on a dollar-for-dollar basis. This means the total of 15 percent of the mortgage interest is
deducted directly from the annual tax debt of the participants. The remaining 85 percent of their mortgage
interest is taken as a deduction from their gross income in the usual manner. This allows participants to
qualify for a greater mortgage amount with the same income. There are requirements to qualify for a
MCC Certificate, including income eligibility requirements.
The City participates in Alameda County’s Mortgage Certificate (MCC) Program, which provides a tax
credit to subsidize the mortgage interest rate for qualified first-time home buyers. Between 1/2010 and
6/2014, 6 MCC’s were administered in Union City.
Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers
The Federal Section 8 program provides rental assistance to very low-income households in need of
affordable housing. The Section 8 program assists a very low-income household by paying the difference
between 30 percent of the gross household income and the cost of rent. Section 8 assistance is structured
as vouchers; this allows the voucher recipients to choose housing that may cost above the fair market rent
Union City Housing Element                                                                         Page 5-101
Adopted January 27, 2015

as long as the recipients pay for the additional cost. As described earlier, HACA administers the HUD
Section 8 program and currently manages 797 Section 8 vouchers and units in Union City.
Assisted Housing Projects Eligible for Conversion
The expiration of housing subsidies may be the greatest near-term threat to California’s affordable
housing stock for low-income families and individuals. Rental housing financed 30 years ago with
Federal low interest mortgages are now, or soon will be, eligible for termination of their subsidy
programs. Owners may then choose to convert the apartments to market-rate housing. Also, HUD Section
8 rent supplements to specific rental developments may expire in the near future. In addition, State and
local subsidies or use restrictions are usually of a limited duration.
State law requires that housing elements include an inventory of all publicly assisted multifamily rental
housing projects within the local jurisdiction that are at risk of conversion to uses other than low-income
residential within 10 years from the Housing Element adoption deadline (i.e., by January 2025). Of the
multifamily housing complexes in Union City that receive government assistance, as shown in Table 5-
41, one is considered “low risk” of conversion (Los Robles) and the rest are not considered “at risk.”

Adopted January 27, 2015
Preservation Options for At-Risk Properties
State law requires that housing elements include a comparison of the costs to replace the at-risk units
through new construction or to preserve the at-risk units. Preserving at-risk units can be accomplished by
facilitating a transfer of ownership to a qualified affordable housing organization, purchasing the
affordability covenants, and/or providing rental assistance to tenants.
Los Robles is considered “low risk” because it is owned and operated by EAH, a non-profit affordable
housing corporation that has been developing, managing, and promoting affordable housing since 1968.
EAH acquired the property in 1996 and preserved it as affordable housing using a HUD Capital Grant and
Preservation Technical Assistance Grant. Los Robles receives Federal assistance through Section 236 of
the National Housing Act. It is very unlikely that the property will convert to market-rate.
Acquisition and Rehabilitation
One method of ensuring long-term affordability of low-income units is to transfer ownership to a
qualified nonprofit or for-profit affordable housing organization. This transfer would make the project
eligible for re-financing using affordable housing financing programs, such as low-income housing tax
credits and tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds. These financing programs would ensure affordability for
at least 55 years. Generally, rehabilitation often accompanies a transfer of ownership. Los Robles is
currently owned and operated by a non-profit dedicated to developing, managing, and promoting
affordable housing, so transfer of the property is unlikely.
Based on listings of for-sale multifamily developments in Hayward and San Leandro (no listings in Union
City were found), a multifamily unit might cost $157,111 on average. For a 140-unit development like
Los Robles, this would total $21,995,521. Assuming that it would cost about $20,000 per unit for
renovations or rehabilitation, the total rehabilitation cost would be $2,800,000. Overall it would cost an
estimated $24,795,521 or $177,110 per unit for a qualified non-profit or for-profit affordable housing
organization to acquire and rehabilitate Los Robles.
Replacement (New Construction)
If Los Robles were lost as affordable housing, it could be replaced by constructing a new complex with
the same number of units. Station Center Family Housing is a recent (2012) affordable complex that cost
$65.3 million for a 157-unit complex. This totals $415,924 per unit; or for a 140-unit development similar
to Los Robles, a total of $58,229,299.
Rent Subsidy
Rent subsidies can also be used to preserve affordability of housing. Through a variety of funding
sources, the City could potentially provide rental vouchers similar to those provided through the Housing
Choice Vouchers program (formerly Section 8). The amount of a rent subsidy would be equal to the
difference between the HUD defined fair market rent (FMR) for a unit and the cost that would be
affordable to a lower-income household based on HUD income limits. Table 5-42 shows this calculation.
The total cost to subsidize the units would be estimated at $1,659,120 annually, or $49,773,600 over 30
years.

Summary of At-Risk Analysis
In summary, the above analysis shows the costs of the different scenarios to be as follows:
       Acquisition and rehabilitation: $24,795,521, or $177,110 per unit
       Replacement: $58,229,299, or $415,924 per unit
       Rent Subsidy: $1,659,120 annually ($49,773,6000 over 30 years)
Replacing or acquiring and rehabbing at-risk units is costly. While rent subsidies have lower annual costs,
the funds required to supplement lost assistance are significant over the long term and there are no
available funding programs to provide subsidies. Fortunately, Los Robles is at low risk of converting to
market rate, and there are Federal and State funding sources available to preserve existing affordable
housing projects should this occur.
California Government Code Section 65863.10 requires that owners of Federally-assisted properties must
provide notice of intent to convert their properties to market rate at twelve months prior to, and again at
six months prior to the expiration of their contract, opt-outs, or prepayment. Owners must provide notices
of intent to public agencies, including HCD, the local public housing authority, and to all impacted tenant
households. The six-month notice must include specific information on the owner’s plans, timetables, and
reasons for termination. Under Government Code Section 65863.11, owners of Federally-assisted projects
must provide a Notice of Opportunity to Submit an Offer to Purchase to Qualified Entities, non-profit or
for-profit organizations that agree to preserve the long-term affordability if they should acquire at-risk
projects, at least one year before the sale or expiration of use restrictions. Qualified entities have first right
of refusal for acquiring at-risk units. Qualified entities are non-profit or for-profit organizations with the
legal and managerial capacity to acquire and manage at-risk properties that agree to maintain the long-
term affordability of projects. Table 5-43 contains a list of qualified entities for Alameda County that
could potentially acquire and manage properties if any were to be at risk of converting to market rate in
the future.

    Energy Conservation
    State Housing Element Law requires an analysis of the opportunities for energy conservation in
    residential development. Energy efficiency has direct application to affordable housing because the more
    money spent on energy, the less available for rent or mortgage payments. Many times lower-income
    households must choose between basic needs such as shelter, food, and energy. Union City receives both
    electricity and natural gas services from Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E).

Union City General Plan Element Update
Land use patterns impact transportation-related energy use. Factors that influence decisions about vehicle
use include density, mix of uses, proximity to transit, and street design. Making land use decisions that
support biking, walking, and transit is key to reducing transportation-related energy use. The City has
supported transit-oriented development in the Intermodal Station District including the recent (2012) 157-
unit development with 155 affordable housing units and two manager units in the Station District.
Residential energy-efficiency outreach has been a priority for the City. Most notably, Rising Sun Energy
Center completed its first summer of managing a California Youth Energy Service (CYES) program site
office in Union City. With the use of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) grant funds, the
City contracted with Rising Sun to promote energy conservation and sustainable living via an
employment program for youth ages 15 to 22. The CYES program trained and employed nine youth in
2011 and provided “Green House Calls” to 231 homes. They also continued work with Stopwaste.Org on
the Energy Upgrade California residential energy-efficiency retrofit program and held a joint meeting in
Hayward on September 15, 2011, for multifamily property owners. The City provided a full-page color
Energy Upgrade ad in the Fall Leisure Services Activity Guide, 17,000 of which were mailed to Union
City residents.
Solar activity has continued to increase. To incentivize solar energy, the City established a fixed fee for
residential and commercial solar permits. In 2011 14 residential solar installations totaling 111 kw were
completed, up from eight installations totaling 27 kw in 2010.
All new buildings in California must meet the standards contained in Title 24, Part 6 of the 2013
California Code of Regulations (Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential
Buildings). These regulations were established in 1978 and most recently updated in 2013. Energy
efficiency requirements are enforced by local governments through the building permit process. All new
construction must comply with the standards in effect on the date a building permit application is made.
The City continues to enforce State requirements, including Title 24 requirements, for energy
conservation in residential development, primarily through the Building Division of the Economic and
Community Development Department.
Union City also adopted a Green Building and Landscaping Practices Ordinance in 2006 to incorporate
green measures into design, construction, demolition, renovation, operation, and maintenance of buildings
and landscaping within the city. This Ordinance established a requirement to submit documentation of the
green building and landscaping practices used in civic and public-private partnership projects.
Any City-sponsored project, City/public agency partnership, and/or public-private partnership over $3
million must incorporate green building measures from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design (LEED) system, the Alameda County Residential Green Building Guidelines, or a City-approved
equivalent. The LEED Rating System is a national program targeted to the top 25 percent of green home
builders that provides a rating for the sustainability of a variety of building types. It was developed by the
US Green Building Council. Projects must achieve at least a Silver LEED rating. Notably, the Station
Center Family development achieved a LEED Platinum certification, the highest level.
SECTION 5.5              POTENTIAL HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
State housing law requires the City to review both governmental and non-governmental constraints to the
maintenance and production of housing for all income levels. Since local governmental actions can
restrict the development and increase the cost of housing, State law requires the Housing Element to
Union City Housing Element                                                                          Page 5-109
Adopted January 27, 2015

“address and, where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental constraints to the
maintenance, improvement, and development of housing” (Government Code Section 65583(c) (3)).
Potential Governmental Constraints
Local governments have little to no influence on the national economy or the Federal monetary policies
that influence it. Yet these two factors have some of the most significant impacts on the overall cost of
housing. The local housing market, however, can be encouraged and assisted locally. One purpose of the
Housing Element is to require local governments to evaluate their past performance in this regard. By
reviewing local conditions and regulations that may impact the housing market, the local government can
prepare for future growth through actions that protect the public’s health and safety without unduly
adding to the cost of housing production.
It is in the public interest for the government to regulate development as a means of protecting the general
welfare of the community. At the same time government regulations can potentially constrain the supply
of housing available in a community if the regulations limit the opportunities to develop housing, impose
requirements that unnecessarily increase the cost to develop housing, or make the development process so
arduous as to discourage housing developers.
State law requires that housing elements contain an analysis of the governmental constraints on housing
maintenance, improvement, and development (Government Code, Section 65583(a) (4)). The Housing
Element must also analyze potential and actual constraints upon the development, maintenance, and
improvement of housing for persons with disabilities, including those with developmental disabilities. See
Appendix B for an analysis by the City of compliance with SB 520.
Union City’s primary policies and regulations that could affect residential development and housing
affordability include land use controls, development processing procedures and fees, impact fees, on- and
off-site improvement requirements, and building and housing codes and enforcement. This section
discusses these standards and assesses whether any serve as a constraint to affordable housing
development.
General Plan Land Use Designations and Zoning
All land use in Union City, including residential development, is regulated by the Union City General
Plan and the City's Zoning Ordinance. Land use controls provided in the General Plan Land Use
Designations and the Zoning Ordinance can influence housing production in a number of ways. The
permitted and conditionally permitted uses in each district guide new development and provide both
developers and the general public with an understanding of how vacant or underutilized land will develop
in the future. This includes the density of development that will occur within a particular zone, the
compatibility of planned uses in a given area, and the range and type of buildings and uses that will be
located throughout the city. The General Plan and Zoning Ordinance establish the amount and distribution
of land allocated for different uses.
General Plan
By definition local land use controls constrain housing development by restricting housing to certain
sections of the city and by restricting the number of housing units that can be built on a given parcel of
land. The 2002 General Plan sets forth the City’s policies regarding local land development. These
policies, together with existing zoning regulations, establish the amount and distribution of land allocated

for different uses. The General Plan has seven land use designations that allow for residential use. They
are as follows:
            Residential—3 to 6 Dwelling Units per Acre (R 3-6): The purpose of this designation is to
             provide areas for single family detached residential uses and activities normally associated
             with single family neighborhoods. The lot size range for this designation is 6,000 to 10,000
             square feet.
            Residential—6 to 10 Dwelling Unit per Acre (R 6-10): The purpose of this designation is to
             provide areas for a variety of moderate intensity single family uses including detached, semi-
             attached, and attached single family housing, mobile home parks, and zero lot line
             developments. The lot size range for this designation is 3,500 to 6,000 square feet.
            Residential—10 to 17 Dwelling Units per Acre (R 10-17): The purpose of this designation is
             to provide areas intended for moderate-density residential use patterns including duplexes and
             multifamily dwellings of greater intensity. The lot size or site area per dwelling unit for this
             designation is as small as 2,400 square feet.
            Residential—17 to 30 Dwelling Units per Acre (R 17-30): The purpose of this designation is
             to allow for multifamily housing at densities greater than other residential designations. The
             lot size or site area per dwelling unit for this designation is as small as 1,450 square feet.
            Residential—30 to 60 Dwelling Units per Acre (R 30-60): This designation is intended to
             allow high-rise, high-density housing in areas near mass transit stations to promote transit-
             oriented development. Where applied, development densities shall not be less than 30 units
             per acre. The lot size or site area per dwelling unit for this designation is as small as 726
             square feet.
            Station Mixed Use-Commercial (CSMU)—60 to 165 Dwelling Units per Acre: This
             designation is primarily commercial in nature and is intended to promote retail and office
             opportunities. High-density residential land use between 60 and 165 units per acre is also
             appropriate where it will promote, in a coordinated manner with the commercial
             development, the purpose of this designation. The site area per dwelling unit is 264 square
             feet for residential land use
            Retail Commercial (CR)—The purpose of this designation is to provide areas for retail outlets
             and services demanded by neighborhood, community, or sub-regional/regional markets.
             Residential uses located above first-floor retail in the Old Alvarado district and along Mission
             Boulevard are considered acceptable.
Zoning
Table 5-44 summarizes the development standards for each residential zoning district. An analysis of the
residential standards indicates that overall these requirements are no more restrictive than those used in
other communities, and in many instances are less restrictive. The lot size, lot frontage, setback, and
building height requirements are reasonable for each zone since they balance the need for privacy with the
need to allow the maximum possible density.
Union City's Zoning Ordinance sets forth the standards that regulate all land use within the city. The
Zoning Ordinance includes two basic residential districts (RS and RM), each of which provides for a

mixed-use commercial districts that allow for residential development above retail (CN, CC, CS). The RS
districts provide primarily for single family residential development with five minimum lot sizes
specified: RS-4500, RS-6000, RS-7000, RS-8000 and RS-10000. The RM districts are designed for
multifamily developments with three density ranges specified: RM-1500, RM-2500 and RM-3500. The
R-5000 district, which is limited to the Decoto Area, is designed to encourage "...the consolidation of
small, substandard lots into reasonable building sites, permitting single family dwellings in low silhouette
with maximum open space in compensation for such consolidation.”
The second special mixed-use district is the Station Mixed-Use Commercial District (CSMU). The
purpose of CSMU district is to establish a mixed-use town center/central business district of high-density
residential, commercial, office, and research and development uses that will serve as an important
regional center, while providing strong pedestrian connections throughout the district. A minimum of 60
units per acre is required and a maximum of 165 units per acre is permitted. The minimum site area per
dwelling unit is 264 feet. Development must comply with the design criteria in Section 18.38.150 of the
Municipal Code. By 2014 over 800 units of housing have been completed within a half-mile of the
Intermodal Station, including 216 townhouses by KB Homes, 438 apartments by Avalon Bay, and 155
affordable units by MidPen Housing. Union City’s Redevelopment Agency partnered with MidPen to
create a mixed-use development that includes retail, housing, a public playground and a shared
public/private parking garage. The MidPen project is also a LEED Platinum building.
The third special residential district is the 511 Area District, which is applied to the 511 Area on the
western side of the city and is based on the Specific Plan adopted for the area. The 511 Area District is
intended to allow for flexible approaches to providing single family residential development while
balancing these opportunities with concerns for environmental constraints and resources. The district
allows for a wide range of single family development types, including attached, semi-attached, zero-lot-
line, and detached units. Nearly all of the area in this district is built out.
Residential uses within the Old Alvarado and Mission Boulevard neighborhoods are permitted uses when
located above ground floor commercial uses for the CC and CS districts. The CC, Community
Commercial, district provides for the larger community’s retail, service, and office needs, while
remaining compatible with residential uses. The CS, Specialty Commercial district, promotes a mix of
small, convenience retail, commercial, office, and entertainment uses for the Old Alvarado neighborhood,
including residential.
The City has found that the permitted densities are adequate to promote a variety of housing types in
Union City. The development standards associated with each zoning district do not create unnecessary
barriers to the construction or rehabilitation of housing for all income groups and special needs
households. The land use designations and zoning standards ensure that quality development can occur
while providing for the health and safety of Union City residents.

Zoning for a Variety of Housing Types
State Housing Element Law (Government Code Section 65583(c) (1) and 65583.2(c)) requires that local
governments analyze the availability of sites that will “facilitate and encourage the development of a
variety of types of housing for all income levels, including multifamily rental housing, factory-built
housing, mobile homes, housing for agricultural employees, supportive housing, single-room occupancy
units (SROs), emergency shelters, and transitional housing.” This section discusses relevant regulations
that govern the development of the types of housing listed above as required by Government Code
Section 65583(a) (3).
Multifamily Housing
Multifamily units are permitted uses in all 3 RM districts: RM 3500, RM2500, and RM 1500. RM 3500
and RM2500 allow for lot coverage of 40 percent with maximum height of 30 feet, or up to 2 stories. RM
1500 allows for heights up to 75 feet, or 3 to 4 stories. Single family houses are not permitted in RM
districts, since the minimum dwelling units per site is 2. The RM districts do not present any potential
constraint to the development of multifamily housing.
Manufactured Housing and Mobile Homes
Sections 65852.3 and 65852.4 of the California Government Code specify that a jurisdiction shall allow
the installation of manufactured homes on a foundation on all “lots zoned for conventional single family
residential dwellings.” Except for architectural requirements, the jurisdiction is only allowed to “subject
the manufactured home and the lot on which it is placed to the same development standards to which a
conventional single family residential dwelling on the same lot would be subject.” The architectural
requirements are limited to width, floor height, façade, roof overhang, roofing material, and siding
material.
The only two exceptions that local jurisdiction are allowed to make to the manufactured home siting
provisions are if: 1) there is more than 10 years difference between the date of manufacture of the
manufactured home and the date of the application for the issuance of an installation permit; or 2) if the
site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and regulated by a legislative body pursuant to
Government Code Section 37361.
Union City Municipal Code (Section 18.32.020) permits manufactured homes or mobile homes in RS
(i.e., RS 10000, RS8000, RS7000, RS6000, RS4500, RS5000) districts as the sole principal residence, but
the unit must be provided with a continuous concrete foundation, permanent utility connections, and
conform to all applicable building, plumbing, and electrical and fire codes. Union City’s Municipal Code
is consistent with State law and provides for the construction of manufactured homes or mobile homes.
Mobile Home Parks
Section 65852.7 of the California Government Code specifies that mobile home parks shall be a permitted
use on “all land planned and zoned for residential land use.” However, local jurisdictions are allowed to
require use permits for mobile home parks.
Where requirements for manufactured homes or mobile homes are covered in Title 18 of the Municipal
Code, mobile home park requirements are detailed in Title 16 of the Municipal Code. Union City’s

Union City General Plan Element Update
Municipal Code allows mobile home parks in any residential or agricultural districts with the granting of
a use permit. The minimum site area for a mobile home park development is 20 acres.
Housing for Farmworkers
The provisions of Section 17020 (et seq.) of the California Health and Safety Code relating to employee
housing and labor camps supersede any ordinance or regulations enacted by local governments. Such
housing is allowed in all jurisdictions in California pursuant to the regulations set forth in Section 17020.
Section 17021.5(b) states, for example:
         “Any employee housing providing accommodations for six or fewer employees shall be deemed a
         single family structure with a residential land use designation for the purposes of this section.
         For the purpose of all local ordinances, employee housing shall not be included within the
         definition of a boarding house, rooming house, hotel, dormitory, or other similar term that
         implies that the employee housing is a business run for profit or differs in any other way from a
         family dwelling. No conditional use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance shall be
         required of employee housing that serves six or fewer employees that is not required of a family
         dwelling of the same type in the same zone.”
Section 17021.6, concerning farmworker housing, states that:
         “No conditional use permit, zoning variance, or other zoning clearance shall be required of
         employee housing that serves 12 or fewer employees and is not required of any other agricultural
         activity in the same zone.”
SB 1802 (2006) amended Section 17021.6 of the Health and Safety Code to provide that group housing
for 36 or fewer farmworkers does not require a conditional use permit or public hearing. Union City’s
Municipal Code does not specifically prohibit or constrain the provision of farm labor housing. Farm
labor and employee housing is treated like any other single family home or group housing project,
depending on the type of development. Ranch and farm dwellings appurtenant to a principal agricultural
use are permitted in the Agricultural (A) district. Minimum requirements include: lot size (20 acres); lot
width (300 ft.); front yard (25 ft.); side yard (15 ft.); and rear yard (35 ft.). The absence of regulations for
farmworker housing does not act as a constraint to its production.
Emergency Shelters, Transitional Housing, Supportive Housing, and Other Group
Living
Emergency Shelters
SB 2, passed in 2007 and in effect as of January 1, 2008, amended State Housing law (California
Government Code Sections 65582, 65583, and 65589.5) regarding shelter for homeless persons. This
legislation requires local jurisdictions to strengthen provisions for addressing the housing needs of
homeless persons, including the identification of a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as
a permitted use without a conditional use permit.
Emergency shelters “may only be subject to those development and management standards that apply to
residential or commercial development within the same zone” along with a list of exceptions that may be
made. Local governments that already have one or more emergency shelters within their jurisdiction or
“pursuant to a multijurisdictional agreement” that accommodates that jurisdiction’s need for emergency

Adopted January 27, 2015

shelter are only required to identify a zone or zones where new emergency shelters are allowed with a
conditional use permit.
The City amended its Zoning Ordinance in 2014 to comply with State law. The Union City Municipal
Code defines emergency shelters as:
         “a publicly or privately operated housing facility maintained to provide supervised temporary,
         short-term residence for homeless individuals or families offering programs that provide
         counseling, social services, and case management, either on or off site. No facility shall be used
         for more than six months by any individual or family.”
The City allows emergency shelters in the Private Institutional (PI) zone by right. In addition to the
development standards in the underlying zoning district, the following standards apply to emergency
shelters:
    1. Facility shall comply with applicable Federal, State, and local licensing standards and
         requirements for any program incidental to the emergency shelter.
    2. Facility shall comply with applicable State and local uniform housing and building code
         requirements.
    3. On-site management shall be provided at all times.
    4. On-site security shall be provided during all hours when the shelter is open.
    5. Exterior lighting shall be provided on pedestrian pathways and parking lot areas on the property.
         Lighting shall reflect away from residential areas and public streets.
    6. Secure areas for personal property shall be provided.
    7. Emergency shelters shall not exceed 20 beds.
    8. The maximum term for people staying at an emergency shelter is 6 months in a consecutive 12-
         month period.
    9. A minimum of one parking space for each six beds at maximum capacity. Plus one parking space
         for each two employees shall be provided.
    10. A facility management plan shall be submitted by the operator of the emergency shelter and
         approved by the Economic and Community Development Department prior to establishment of
         the use that addresses: management experience, good neighbor issues, transportation, client
         supervision, client services, and food services. The plan shall include a floor plan that
         demonstrates compliance with the physical standards of this section. The operator of the
         emergency shelter shall submit a statement on an annual basis (measured from the date of the
         original establishment of the use), that the facility is operating in compliance with the approved
         management plan or shall submit an updated management plan, for review and approval by the
         Economic and Community Development Department, that reflects any changes from the
         approved version. The City Council may establish a fee by resolution, to cover the administrative
         cost of review of the required management plan.
The PI district also allows, with a conditional approval, other similar uses such as churches, private
educational facilities, private nonprofit and service organizations, and continuing care retirement
communities. Development regulations allow for minimum building size of 15,000 square feet, 60 percent

lot coverage, and building heights up to 35 ft. (or 50 feet with a use permit). As shown in Table 5-45,
currently (2014), there are three sites of PI vacant land totaling 191 acres, much more than necessary to
provide an emergency shelter. The largest site, which is adjacent to the Acacia Creek assisted living
facility, would likely be subdivided to provide a smaller lot size for development of an emergency shelter.
The minimum lot size in the PI district is 15,000 square feet.

Existing religious facilities throughout the city on non-vacant PI sites could also accommodate an
emergency shelter. There are over 10 religious facilities on lands with a PI Zoning designation in Union
City. Some provide schools, some have larger parking lots, and some have a venue available for rent.
Emergency shelters are often provided in connection with religious institutions. The existing institutions
within the city located on property with a PI Zoning designation would be allowed to accommodate an
emergency shelter by-right.
Transitional Housing
Transitional housing is designed to assist homeless individuals and families in moving beyond emergency
shelter to permanent housing. California Health and Safety Code Section 50675.2(h) defines “transitional
housing” as:
          “buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under program requirements
          that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible
          program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than six
          months.”
SB 2 added specific new requirements for local governments to meet in terms of planning for transitional
facilities. Government Code Section 65583(a) (5) states that “transitional housing and supportive housing
shall be considered a residential use of property and shall be subject only to those restrictions that apply to
other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone.”
The City amended its Municipal Code in 2014 to define transitional housing as:
          “rental housing operated under the Multifamily Housing Program, as described in Section 50675
          ct. al. of the Health and Safety Code, that calls for the termination of assistance and recirculation
          of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined point in time,
          which shall be no less than six months and in no case more than two years. Transitional housing
          units are residential uses subject only to those requirements and restrictions that apply to other
          residential uses of the same type in the same zone.”
Union City Housing Element                                                                           Page 5-117
Adopted January 27, 2015

The City removed the requirement for a use permit for transitional housing. The City now complies with
State law regarding transitional housing.
Supportive Housing
Supportive housing is permanent rental housing linked to a range of support services designed to enable
residents to maintain stable housing and lead fuller lives. Typically a part of the housing is targeted to
people who have risk factors such as homelessness, or health challenges, such as mental illness or
substance addiction. Supportive housing comes in all shapes and sizes. It could be a renovated motel
offering furnished single-room occupancy (SRO) apartments; a multifamily development where tenants
with disabilities live alongside other families with low incomes; a small, more service-intensive building;
or scattered-site apartments. Whatever the configuration, all of the housing allows tenants to access
support services that enable them to live as independently as possible.
California Health and Safety Code Section 53260(c) defines “supportive housing” as:
         “housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population, and that is
         linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the tenant to retain the housing, improve his or her
         health status, maximize their ability to live and, when possible, to work in the community. This
         housing may include apartments, single-room occupancy residences, or single family homes.”
The City updated its Municipal Code in 2014 to define supportive housing as
         “housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by a target population, as defined by
         State law, that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in
         retaining the housing, improve his or her health status, and/or maximizing his or her ability to
         live and, when possible, to work in the community. Supportive housing units are residential uses
         subject only to those requirements and restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same
         zone.”
The City now complies with State law regarding supportive housing.
Secondary Dwelling Units
A secondary dwelling unit is an additional self-contained living unit, either attached to or detached from
the primary residential unit on a single lot. The unit typically has cooking, eating, sleeping, and full
sanitation facilities. Secondary dwelling units can be an important source of affordable housing since they
can be constructed relatively cheaply and have no associated land costs. Secondary dwelling units can
also provide supplemental income to the homeowner, allowing the elderly to remain in their homes or
moderate-income families to afford houses.
To encourage establishment of secondary dwelling units on existing developed lots, State law requires
cities and counties to either adopt an ordinance based on standards set out in the law authorizing creation
of secondary dwelling units in residentially-zoned areas, or where no ordinance has been adopted, to
allow secondary dwelling units on lots zoned for single family or multifamily use that contain an existing
single family unit subject to ministerial approval (“by right”) if they meet standards set out by law. Local
governments are precluded from totally prohibiting secondary dwelling units in residentially-zoned areas
unless they make specific findings (Government Code, Section 65852.2).

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
In Union City secondary dwelling units are permitted within all single family residential districts (i.e., RS
10000, RS 8000, RS7000, RS6000, RS4500, R 5000), subject to following criteria:
            Only one secondary dwelling unit is allowed per parcel;
            The unit must be located within the area of the lot allowed for the principal dwelling units
             and conform to required yard setbacks of the zoning district (with a few exceptions);
            The floor area of the secondary dwelling unit must generally be between 275 and 800 square
             feet;
            The secondary dwelling unit must be clearly subordinate to and compatible with the principal
             dwelling unit;
            The unit shall contain no more than 25 percent of the floor area of the principal unit before
             the conversion to allow the proposed secondary unit;
            The unit can be either attached or detached to the principal dwelling; and
            Within the 511 Area District, secondary dwelling units are allowed in R3-6, R3-10, R5-10,
             and R7-10 districts.
There are no provisions in the Zoning Ordinance that are a constraint to the creation of secondary
dwelling units. Prior to the recession, the City had begun to see new developments incorporate secondary
dwelling units in the design of primary units. While there have been very few secondary dwelling units
built since 2008, there has recently been an increase in inquiries and applications for second units.
Single-Room Occupancy Units
Single-room occupancy (SRO) units can provide affordable private housing for lower-income individuals,
seniors, and persons with disabilities. An SRO unit is usually small, between 200 to 350 square feet.
These units can serve as an entry point into the housing market for formerly homeless people.
The City updated its Municipal Code in 2014. SROs fall under the definition of “lodging rooming house.”
As defined by the Municipal Code: “a “lodging rooming house” is a building other than a hotel where
lodging is provided for three (3) or more persons for compensation pursuant to previous arrangements but
not open to the public or transients. This definition also encompasses Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
housing.” A lodging rooming house is permitted in RM 1500.
Design Review
Review of a project’s design can potentially be a major constraint to the supply of new housing. Usually
design review pays special attention to areas within the city that have high historical, architectural, and/or
cultural value. The design review process allows decision-makers to hold projects to certain design
standards that are intended to preserve and enhance community character. The City reviews the design of
new projects through the site development review and administrative site development review processes.
Site Development Review applications are decided on by the City Council with the Planning Commission
functioning as a recommending body. Administrative Site Development applications are decided on by
the Planning Commission or the Zoning Administrator.
The City does not have a separate design or architectural review committee that would place additional
conditions on residential projects beyond that of the standard development review processes.

Adopted January 27, 2015

Site Development Review and Administrative Site Development Review
Site development review approval is required for construction of multi-unit or multifamily developments.
Administrative site development review approval is required for the construction of individual single-
family residences including secondary dwelling units. Union City provides a unique opportunity for
applicants to have applications reviewed prior to the formal submittal process, which is referred to as a
“preliminary application process.”
This process allows applicants to submit a preliminary application package for feedback on site design,
improvements, and other relevant regulations. Since this process saves applicants time and money, and
improves the quality of the formal applications submittal packages, thereby reducing City staff time
required for review, it does not act as a constraint to the development of housing and facilitates a
streamlined development review process. Figure 5-14 shows a flyer that the City publishes to clearly
describe the development review process to project applicants.
Chapter 18.76, Site Development Review, of the Union City Municipal Code requires that specific
findings be made by the City Council in order to approve a Site Development Review application. These
findings include:
            Consistency with the General Plan and any applicable specific plans;
            Consistency with the purposes of Title 18 (i.e. Zoning Ordinance) and the requirements of the
             district in which the site is located; and
            Consistency with the purpose of Site Development Review as outlined in Section 18.76.010
             of the Union City Municipal Code.
Site Development Review is limited to the physical aspects of the development and does not grant the
City discretion over the use itself. The intent is to ensure proposed development is consistent with the
General Plan and Zoning Ordinance requirements. In conducting Site Development Review, the City uses
design criteria for residential development, which are listed in Chapter 18.32, Residential Districts, of the
Union City Municipal Code. The design criteria require all residential development to be articulated on all
elevations. A higher degree of articulation must be provided on the front elevation defined as the
elevation that faces the front property line and includes the main entry point to the residence. City staff
estimates that 90 to 95 percent of Site Development Review or Administrative Site Development review
applications are approved.

                                         PRELIMINARY REVIEW 
The Preliminary Review Process is a free review in which department representatives look over your project 
    proposal and suggest changes that are geared towards helping you develop an approvable project. 
    Submit completed preliminary application form and required application materials (see checklist) by 
                    Thursday morning for staff to review on the following Monday afternoon. 
     Staff will review the preliminary proposal at its interdepartmental Development Review Committee 
                                                 (DRC) meeting. 
     Your project planner will contact you and will give you comments from the DRC meeting. In most 
          cases, multiple reviews are required before staff will recommend that you apply formally. 
    Your project planner will inform you when he/she feels your project is ready to move forward to the 
                                            Formal Review Process. 
                                              FORMAL REVIEW 
  The Formal Review Process is the review in which the decision maker (Zoning Administrator, Planning 
      Commission, and/or City Council) takes an action (approval or denial) on your project proposal. 
      Submit completed formal application form and all required application materials (see checklist), 
    along with all applicable fees (see fee schedule). Your project planner will review your submittal for 
                             completeness and will inform you of any missing items. 
         Once complete, staff will review the formal proposal at two (DRC) meetings and will obtain 
     conditions of approval from all applicable Departments and Agencies. The adopted conditions of 
        approval are the items you are responsible for completing in exchange for establishing your 
        approved project. Once approved, the conditions of approval are binding, unless appealed. 
        Your project planner will send out notices to the property owners 300 feet around the subject 
     property and, if required, will publish an advertisement in the newspaper to inform residents of the 
                    pending Zoning Administrator decision and/or scheduled public hearing.

Union City General Plan Element Update
 Open Space Requirements
The City has a policy in the General Plan that sets park standards. The policy requires, “three acres for
each 1,000 residents to be devoted to neighborhood and community park and recreation purposes.” This
standard is not excessive and is typical of many jurisdictions in the Bay Area.
The Zoning Ordinance requires that units in the RM districts have a usable open space/landscaped area of
at least 300 square feet per unit and must meet the following criteria outlined in Section 18.32.115 of the
Zoning Ordinance:
    1. The usable open space can be common space accessible to more than one dwelling unit or may be
        private space for the exclusive use of individual units.
    2. At least one-half of the required space must be provided at ground level exclusive of front yard
        setback areas, and not more than one-half of the requirement may be satisfied by balconies or roof
        decks.
    3. Each square foot of private open space can be considered equivalent to two square feet of common
        space, and may be so substituted, except in the RM 3500 district where one foot can be considered
        equivalent to one- and-one-half square feet of common space.
    4. Common usable open space must have a minimum area of 300 square feet.
    5. Private usable open space at ground level must have a minimum area of 150 square feet.
    6. Open space located in parking area, driveway, or service area or space with a slope greater than 10
        percent is not counted.
In addition to the open space required per unit, there are requirements for multi developments.
            Projects located in the RM 2500 and RM 3500 districts are required to provide landscaped
             areas in at least 40 percent of the total site area.
            Projects located in the RM 1500 district must provide at least 25 percent of the site area as
             landscaped.
            Residential Projects in the CSMU district are required to provide 25 percent of the area as
             common open space.
            For condominiums, private outdoor space must also be provided for each unit, as follows:
                 First floor unit: 120 square feet, fenced patio
                 Units above first floor: 60 square feet of fenced balcony
                 25 percent of the site area devoted to common open space
These standards are typical of many jurisdictions in the Bay Area and would not significantly reduce the
affordability of multifamily housing units.
Affordable Housing Ordinance
In May 2001 the City Council adopted the Affordable Housing Ordinance to ensure that all residential
development provides a range of housing opportunities for all identifiable economic segments of the
community. The goals of the ordinance are as follows:
Union City Housing Element                                                                       Page 5-123
Adopted January 27, 2015

           Enhance the public welfare by ensuring that future residential developments contribute to the
            attainment of the affordable housing goals set forth in the Housing Element’s Policy
            Document;
           Increase the production of residential units in Union City that are affordable to households of
            very low-, low-, and moderate-income;
           Facilitate a cooperative effort between Union City and the housing development community
            for the provision of affordable housing to all economic segments of the community; and
           Ensure that units affordable to households of very low-, low-, and moderate-income are
            distributed throughout the City’s various neighborhoods.
The following are the major requirements of the ordinance:
           All new housing developments in the city consisting of seven or more units, must make 15
            percent of those units available to and affordable to very low-, low- and moderate-income
            households;
           Housing developments consisting of six units or less may pay a proportional in-lieu fee for
            their housing requirement rather than producing the affordable units;
           Any tentative map, use permit, or site development permit approving residential construction
            projects over seven units shall contain conditions sufficient to ensure the affordable units are
            included;
           All affordable units in a project or phase of a project shall be constructed concurrently with
            non-affordable units;
           All affordable units shall reflect the range of numbers of bedrooms provided in the project as
            a whole, and shall not be distinguished by exterior design, construction, or materials;
           When affordable housing units are required in single family developments, duplexes may be
            built on corner lots in the development. If a single family residential development does
            include corner lot duplexes, no more than 50 percent of the affordable housing requirement
            for that project can be satisfied with the use of duplex units;
           The City Council, at its discretion, may waive the requirements of this ordinance if there are
            unusual development costs with the property (e.g., environmental contamination) that would
            otherwise prevent the project from proceeding;
           Under certain specified conditions, housing development applicants can provide the units off-
            site (not physically contiguous to the development); and
           All residential developments providing affordable units pursuant to the requirements of the
            Affordable Housing Ordinance shall receive “priority processing” by which housing
            developments shall be reviewed and checked for all required City permit and other approvals
            in advance of other pending developments.
As a result of the ordinance, 312 affordable housing units for very low-, low-, and moderate-income
households have been built, as shown in Table 5-46. In 2006 the City amended the ordinance to be even
more flexible in the allowance of in-lieu fees and encouraging public/private partnerships to develop

The City has used the general guidelines mentioned above with developers prior to the adoption of the
Affordable Housing Ordinance without creating constraints to those projects. Furthermore, since the
adoption of the ordinance, the City has been working with developers to implement the requirements of
the ordinance without any undue concerns/problems. Therefore, the Affordable Housing Ordinance is not
expected to serve as a constraint to new residential development within Union City.
There is one provision of the Affordable Housing Ordinance that needs to be updated in response to a
recent court case that determined inclusionary units are to be counted as qualifying units for the density
bonus ordinance. The City’s Affordable Housing Ordinance currently excludes them. The Housing
Element includes a program to update the Affordable Housing Ordinance to allow inclusionary units to be
counted for the purposes of the density bonus ordinance.
Permit Processing Times
The minimum amount of time for processing permits is established by requirements for environmental
review, public notice, and by the meetings of the Planning Commission and City Council. While there is
little room for processing permits any faster than the City already does, the current practice of automatic
review of some Planning Commission permit decisions by the City Council does add several weeks to the
total permit processing time. This practice is atypical of cities the size of Union City. Ultimately, the
maximum amount of time for processing residential development permits is set by State law (California
Government Code 65920 et. seq.). Some of the average times have increased by three to six months due
to infill complexity and extra notification of State requirements.

The processing time needed to obtain development permits and required approvals varies depending on
the scope of the project. Smaller projects typically require less time than larger projects. The City strives
to keep its permit procedures streamlined and processing times minimal. The Administrative Site
Development Reviews are generally completed in a reasonable time frame of six to eight weeks and is not
a significant constraint. Variance or Use Permits are generally completed in a reasonable time frame of
three to six months and are not a significant constraint.
Permit Fees and Exactions
Housing construction imposes short- and long-term costs on communities. Short-term costs include the
cost of providing planning services and inspections. New residential developments can also result in
significant long-term costs relating to the maintenance and improvement of the City’s infrastructure,
facilities, parks, and streets. To offset these community costs, the City collects various fees from
developers. These include fees for planning and zoning approvals, subdivision map act approvals,
environmental review, plan check services, and building permits, among others.

Residential Development Fees
The City also collects impact fees to cover the costs of providing the necessary services and infrastructure
related to new development projects. Since the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, local governments in
California have come to rely increasingly on impact and connection fees to finance infrastructure. Union
City charges several fees on residential development at the building permit stage, as shown in Table 5-49.
The estimated residential development fees for a single family three-bedroom, two-bathroom house of
2,000 square feet are approximately $34,204. Compared to the per unit fees for a multifamily unit
($28,864), there are significant cost savings for multifamily residential development. The City is able to
provide services at a lower per unit cost for higher-density projects based on the internal cost savings for
services such as water system connections, which are more economical for larger projects.
The fees listed in Table 5-49 are typical of communities of similar size and situation.

  There are many variables related to these costs, including whether the electricity is put in overhead or
underground, and the distance from the hookup lines to the residential facility. PG&E could not supply a
precise average cost, but stated that $5,000 for gas and electricity combined could be considered a
conservative average price. Looking at a range of prices, PG&E stated that $13,000 dollars (including a 34
percent tax for franchise) was charged for an electricity hookup alone, that needed to be hooked up across
the street and underground, while a lower price of $1,500 to $3,000 could be the combined charge for
electrical and gas hookup where the distance to the hookup is short. PG&E estimated that 75 percent of
projects requiring new gas service cost between $1,000 and $6,000 and 75 percent of projects requiring
new electric overhead service cost between $1,000 and $5,000. The fee for putting in a meter costs $50.

Union City General Plan Element Update
The City has investigated the implications of revising their standards to allow for deviations that might
reduce the cost of residential development. It concluded that such deviations might compromise City
efforts to assure the continued improvement of the quality of development within the city. It is the City's
opinion that its development fees and standards do not constitute an unreasonable or unnecessary
constraint on housing production.
On- and Off-Site Development Standards
The City requires certain public improvements for residential subdivisions. In 1976 the City adopted these
standards to ensure that minimum levels of design and construction quality are maintained and adequate
levels of street and facility improvements are provided. Title 17.32 of the Municipal Code describes the
public improvements that must be agreed to prior to acceptance and approval of the final subdivision
map, as follows:
            Street grading, installation of curbs and gutters, provisions for drainage and construction of
             drainage structures necessary to the proper use and drainage of the streets and/or to the public
             safety and convenience;
            Paving of streets and alleys as required;
            Installation of sidewalks as required;
            Provision for a water system with mains of sufficient size and having a sufficient number of
             outlets to furnish adequate water supply for each lot of the subdivision in accordance with the
             standards adopted by the City and with sufficient fire hydrants, gated connections and
             appurtenances to provide adequate fire protection in accordance with the standards of the Fire
             Department of the City;
            Sanitary sewer facilities and connections for each lot to a sewage system approved by the
             City Engineer and the sanitary district concerned;
            An approved type of street lighting system;
            Planting of trees as required;
            Installation of street signs as required;
            Installation of a system of monuments and bench marks approved by the City Engineer;
            The payment of such fees as established by the City Council pursuant to resolution to cover
             the pro rata share of the cost of traffic signals as required by the City;
            Installation of paths and trails including directional signing.
The City’s on- and off-site development standards have been in place since 1976, and do not represent a
constraint to the development of housing. In addition to general public improvement standards, the
Municipal Code has specific standards for residential streets and parking, as described in the paragraphs
below.
Residential Streets
The Union City Municipal Code requires standard improvements for streets; these requirements were
originally adopted in 1969 and have been amended most recently in 2008. It enforces standard
improvements including: street paving, concrete curbs, gutters, and sidewalks, trails, and pathways, a

development’s pro rata share of sanitary sewers, storm drains and catch basins, water mains, fire hydrants,
ornamental street lighting, standards with underground wiring, traffic signals, undergrounding of all
existing overhead or new utilities, and such other specific improvements. All of these improvements must
be constructed and installed in accordance with City specifications and design, under the inspection of
and to the approval of the City’s Public Works Director. These requirements are similar to other
jurisdictions and do not represent a constraint to the development of housing.
Parking
Since off-street parking often requires large amounts of land, parking requirements are one of the
development standards that can most negatively impact the development of affordable housing. The cost
of land associated with parking, in addition to the costs of construction, paving, and maintenance, drive
up the overall cost of development, requiring more funds to assist in the development of affordable
housing. Parking standards in some jurisdictions have been arbitrarily established and do not necessarily
represent the needs of the people living in the developments. This is especially true for senior and
affordable housing developments where occupants are less likely to require more than one parking space.
As shown in Table 5-50, Union City’s off-street parking requirements for residential uses vary by number
of bedrooms, except units in the RS district, which require two covered spaces regardless of size. Studio
and one-bedroom units in the RM district or condominium conversion projects are required to have 1.5
off-street spaces, of which 1 will be covered. Two-bedroom units are required to have two spaces, one
must be covered. In condominium conversion projects 1.5 must be covered.
In the CSMU district, parking requirements vary based on ownership or rental units and number of
bedrooms. Any rental unit in CSMU must have 1.5 covered stalls per unit, except for affordable
development, which can reduce the parking requirement to 1.3 open stalls per unit. Parking requirements
for ownership units range from 1.5 covered spaces for studio and one-bedroom units to two covered
spaces for two-bedroom units. Given the proximity of the CSMU district to transit, the parking
requirements in the CSMU district may be excessive. Staff is in the process of revising the parking
standards for the CSMU Zoning District to require one parking space per unit.
The number of parking spaces can be reduced by up to 10 percent by replacing spaces with bicycle
parking facilities. Off-street parking can be reduced at a rate of one parking space for each six additional
bicycle parking facilities provided. In RM 1500 and RM 2500 zoning districts, a minimum of one bicycle
parking facility shall be provided for every three units. Senior housing must provide 0.5 covered parking
spaces per bedroom. This requirement can be decreased by the Planning Commission if it is found that the
senior housing will not create as great a need for parking.
The Station District has reduced parking standards and mandatory bicycle and motorized cycle parking
requirements. Bicycle facilities must be designed and installed in conformance with design criteria,
although enclosed storage space for units can incorporate space for bicycles. Parking can also be reduced
to one space per unit and the parking in-lieu fee can be used for the construction of a public parking
structure.

SB 1818 imposes statewide parking standards that a jurisdiction must grant upon request from a
developer of an affordable housing project that qualifies for a density bonus. When local parking
requirements are higher, the statewide parking standards supersede the local requirements. The developer
may request these parking standards even if they do not request the density bonus. The parking standards
are summarized in Table 5-51. These numbers are the total number of parking spaces including guest
parking and handicapped parking.

Union City’s parking standards are similar to those in other jurisdictions and, therefore, do not represent a
development constraint above-and-beyond that of other cities. Additionally, the City offers reduced
parking standards in the Station District and as an incentive for providing bicycle facilities. The City’s
parking requirements do not impose a significant constraint on the production of housing.
Density Bonus
State Density Bonus Law (Government Code Section 65915-65918) requires the city to provide certain
incentives to developers that provide affordable or senior housing. Cities and counties are required to
grant a density bonus and other incentives or concessions to housing projects that contain one of the
following:
            At least 5 percent of the units are restricted to very low-income residents;
            At least 10 percent of the units are restricted to lower-income residents;
            At least 10 percent of the units in a for-sale common interest development are restricted to
             moderate-income residents;
            The project donates at least one acre of land to the city or county for very low-income units,
             and the land has the appropriate general plan designation, zoning, permits and approvals, and
             access to public facilities needed for such housing;
            The project is a senior citizen housing development (no affordable units required); or
            The project is a mobile home park age-restricted to senior citizens (no affordable units
             required).
The amount of the density bonus is set on a sliding scale, based upon the percentage of affordable units at
each income level, with a maximum density bonus of 35 percent for projects that include either 10 percent
very low-income units, 20 percent lower-income units, or 40 percent moderate-income units.
In addition to the density bonus, the City is also required to provide at least one incentive or concession to
a project that qualifies for the density bonus. An incentive or concession is defined as:
            A reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning code or architectural
             design requirements, such as a reduction in setback or minimum square footage requirements;
             or
            Approval of mixed-use zoning; or
            Other regulatory incentives or concessions which actually result in identifiable and
             financially sufficient cost reductions.
The number of required incentives or concessions is based on the percentage of affordable units in the
project, as follows:
            For projects with at least 5 percent very low-income, 10 percent lower-income, or 10 percent
             moderate-income units, one incentive or concession is required.
            For projects with at least 10 percent very low-income, 20 percent lower-income, or 20
             percent moderate-income units, two incentives or concessions are required.
            For projects with at least 15 percent very low-income, 30 percent lower-income, or 30
             percent moderate-income units, three incentives or concessions are required.

Union City General Plan Element Update
Upon the developer's request the City must also allow the parking standards shown above in Table 5-51.
Zoning Section Code 18.33.060, Development Options, contains the City’s density bonus regulations.
The City allows for density bonus of at least 25 percent and at least one other concession or incentive or
other incentives of equivalent financial value to developers of housing developments that reserve at least
10 percent for very-low income households, 20 percent of their units for lower-income households, or 50
percent for qualifying senior citizens. All units developed with the density bonus must be affordable for a
minimum of 30 years.
The City’s Municipal Code lists more stringent requirements than State law’s minimum requirements for
the percentage of very low-, low-, and moderate-income units. However, the Municipal Code does not
state that the 25 percent density bonus is a maximum. It states that “the City, upon request, may approve
an increase in the number of units permitted in a proposed residential development …when such an
increase in density is consistent with State density bonus law per Section 65915 of the State Government
Code”; however, the City still must decrease the percentage requirements to qualify for a density bonus.
The dwelling units or parcels designated to meet the City’s mandatory inclusionary housing requirement
(i.e., 15 percent) do not count toward qualifying the proposed development for a density bonus. As
described earlier, the Housing Element includes a program to amend the Affordable Housing Ordinance
to count inclusionary units toward the Density Bonus Ordinance.
Building Codes and Enforcement
Building codes and their enforcement influence the style, quality, size, and costs of residential
development. Such codes can increase the cost of housing and impact the feasibility of rehabilitating older
properties that must be upgraded to current code standards. In this manner building codes and their
enforcement can act as a constraint on the supply of housing and its affordability.
Building and housing codes establish minimum standards and specifications for structural soundness,
safety, and occupancy. The State housing law requires cities and counties to adopt minimum housing
standards based on model industry codes. In addition to meeting the requirements of State housing law,
local governments enforce other State requirements for fire safety, noise insulation, soils reports,
earthquake protection, energy conservation, and access for the physically handicapped. The enforcement
of building and housing codes for all homes is per the minimum standards and requirements set forth in
the codes listed in Table 5-52. Standards for rehabilitation are no more rigorous than those contained in
the California Health and Safety Codes and Uniform Building Codes.
Other amendments to the California Uniform Code include changes in permit fees, violation penalties, the
requirement for automatic sprinkler systems, the rules for premises identification, and structural changes
with regard to seismic concerns.
Building codes and their enforcement can increase the cost of housing and impact the feasibility of
rehabilitating older properties that must be upgraded to existing code standards. In this way building
codes and their enforcement can act as a constraint on the amount of housing and its affordability.
However, the codes enforced by Union City are similar to cities in the region and are necessary to
promote the minimum standards of safety and accessibility to housing (see Table 5-52). Therefore, the
codes are not considered to be an undue constraint on housing investment.

In some cases energy conservation requirements may increase construction costs and, therefore, the initial
sales prices and cost of rent. However, these increased costs are often offset by the long-term reductions
in the utilities component of housing operation costs. Accessibility modifications may also increase initial
sales prices and rents, but will help address the housing needs of elderly and handicapped persons.
Potential Non-Governmental Constraints
The availability and cost of housing is strongly influenced by market forces over which local
governments have little or no control. Nonetheless, State law requires that housing elements contain a
general assessment of these constraints, which can serve as the basis for actions to offset their effects.
This section describes primary non-governmental constraints to the development of new housing in Union
City.
Financing Costs
Mortgage interest rates have a large influence over the affordability of housing. Higher interest rates
increase a homebuyer’s monthly payment and decrease the range of housing that a household can afford.
Lower interest rates result in a lower cost and lower monthly payments for the homebuyer. Besides
lowering monthly interest payments for new buyers, lower interest rates allow existing homeowners to
refinance their homes, thereby lowering monthly housing costs and perhaps preserving their ownership
status. When interest rates rise, the market typically compensates by decreasing housing prices. Similarly,
when interest rates decrease, housing prices begin to rise. There is often a lag in the market, causing
housing prices to remain high when interest rates rise until the market catches up. Lower-income
households often find it most difficult to purchase a home during this time period.
As shown in Figure 9-7, mortgage rates decreased from 2007, hitting a historic low in 2013 of 3.41
percent for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. In 2013 interest rates started to increase; but still remain
historically low as of 2014. The mortgage banking crisis that began in 2008 affected the availability of

construction financing and mortgage loans. Lenders that had once offered mortgage loans more freely
became much more restrictive after 2008. Lenders required down payments of 20 percent and credit
scores higher than 680 to receive competitive interest rates. These restrictions placed homeownership out
of reach for many, though in 2013 lenders began to ease the qualifications required for a competitive
mortgage rate. As the economy continues its slow recovery, lenders may continue to make mortgage
loans more accessible, although they may never be as easy to obtain as they were prior to 2008.

Development Costs
Development costs differ for every project based on location, land cost, site improvement costs, fees,
construction costs, and labor rates. The following paragraphs describe some of these costs in greater
detail.
Land Costs
There is a shortage of residential land available in Union City. Depending on the location, environmental
constraints, development potential, and access, raw land in Union City ranged in price in 2009 from
$400,000 per acre to $1.8 million per acre. In July 2014 only three sites were available on trulia.com: a
5.79 acre lot zoned for RS-6000-H for $1.5 million, a 0.46 acre lot zoned RS-6000 for $499,000, and a
0.5 acre parcel zoned CN for $1.1 million. Cost per acre for these three sites ranged from $258,895 to
$2.2 million.

Adopted January 27, 2015
Land in Alameda County can be used as a price comparison. There were a total of 42 lots for sale on
landandfarm.com that were available for residential use ranging from 0.1 acres to 147 acres. Costs ranged
from $69,000 to $7,990,000 (average cost $1,735,628), for an average cost per acre of $1,047,570.
The cost of land is a major factor in the cost of housing. The land cost per developed unit can be lowered
through the development of high-density housing. Costs associated with the acquisition of land include
both the market price of raw land and the cost of holding the property throughout the development
process. Land acquisition costs can account for over half of the final sales price of new homes in small
developments and in areas where land is scarce.
Site Improvement Costs
Upon securing raw land, a residential developer must make certain site improvements to “finish” the lot
before a home can actually be built on the property. Many of these costs are associated with development
impact fees required by the City (see Table 5-49), but also include such improvements as connections to
existing utility systems, rough grading, construction of streets, installation of water and sewer lines, and
construction of curbs, gutters, and sidewalks. Site improvement costs in Union City were estimated to be
around $32,000 per unit for a multifamily complex. According to a local affordable housing developer,
the City pro-actively works with developers interested in constructing affordable housing to bridge the
funding gap.
Construction Costs
Housing construction costs can act as a constraint to the affordability of new housing. However, the cost
of construction varies with the type, size, location, and amenities of the development. Entry-level homes
have fewer amenities than other higher priced units. The costs of constructing housing in the Bay Area are
generally high. Costs are further compounded for affordable housing developers because they are required
by State law to pay “prevailing wages.” A local affordable housing developer stated in 2009 that
affordable units can cost from $245 to $260 per square foot to construct.
In 2013 RS Means (a reliable published source for construction industry costs) estimated that the hard
construction costs in the Oakland area could total $135 per square foot for typical four- to seven-story
multifamily residential construction and $114 per square foot for one- and two-family residential
construction. This equals a rough estimate of $135,000 for a 1,000 square foot apartment and $228,000
for a 2,000 square foot single family home.
However, these costs do not include the costs of structure parking for high-density developments, such as
transit-oriented development. According to Carl Walker Inc., an engineering and parking consulting firm,
the median construction cost for a new parking structure in March 2014 was about $18,000 per space or
$54.05 per square foot. This can significantly affect the price of constructing new developments. For
example, the recent Station Center Family Housing development, which included structured parking, cost
$415,924 per unit to construct.
Because construction costs are similar in the city to those in other Bay Area cities, the cost of construction
is not considered a major constraint to housing production.

Union City General Plan Element Update
SECTION 5.7 GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
Since incorporation in 1959, Union City has undergone dramatic change. From a small town composed of
the Alvarado and Decoto neighborhoods, Union City has become a lively, thriving city of over 71,000
people. Over the last 50 years, Union City's housing supply has increased in size more dramatically than
all but a handful of Bay Area communities.
Since 2010, the adoption date of the last Housing Element, the City has encountered a number of new and
ongoing challenges, including California law eliminating the Redevelopment Agency, State, and Federal
cuts in funding for affordable housing; a significant national recession; a limited supply of available land;
and very low vacancy rates. These conditions provide a challenge to a City committed to expanding
housing opportunities for all income levels while maintaining its diversity of ethnicity, nationalities, age,
income groups, and lifestyles, as well as maintaining a viable economic base. Consequently, the City
must find ways to provide necessary housing within the context of limited public resources and a
shrinking land supply.
The City has also had many successes since 2010, including a new 157-unit affordable, mixed-use, LEED
Platinum housing development in the Intermodal Station District. This award-winning development won
the prestigious 2013 Urban Land Institute (ULI) Global Award for Excellence and Congress for the New
Urbanism 2014 Grand Prize. While the Redevelopment Agency was a critical component in the
transformation of this brownfield site, the City continues to work with its partners to develop the Station
District into a robust, mixed-use, transit-oriented community. The Station District now includes over
1,000 housing units within a quarter-mile radius of the BART, and hundreds more units are planned
within the timeframe of the Housing Element.
Under California law, the Housing Element must include the community's goals, policies, quantified
objectives, and housing programs for the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing. The
focus of the goals, policies, and programs in this Housing Element is to meet the housing needs of all
income groups while preserving and enhancing existing neighborhoods, creating standards for high
quality housing, removing impediments to housing growth, and reducing living expenses that are
indirectly related to housing, such as transportation costs and energy costs.
This Housing Element includes eight goal statements. Under each goal statement, the element sets out
policies that guide the City toward reaching its goals. Implementation programs are listed at the end of
each goal section and describe the proposed action, the City agencies or departments with primary
responsibility for carrying out the program, and the timeframe for accomplishing the program.
The following definitions describe the nature of the statements of goals, policies, implementation
programs, and quantified objectives as they are used in the Housing Element Policy Document:
Goal: Ultimate purpose of an effort stated in a way that is general in nature and immeasurable.
Policy: Specific statement guiding action and implying clear commitment.
Implementation Program: An action, procedure, program, or technique that carries out policy.
Implementation programs also specify primary responsibility for carrying out the action and an estimated
timeframe for its accomplishment. The timeframe indicates the calendar year in which the activity is

Adopted January 27, 2015
scheduled to be completed. These timeframes are general guidelines and may be adjusted based on City
staffing and budgetary considerations.
Quantified Objective: The number of housing units that the City expects to be constructed, conserved, or
rehabilitated and the number of households the City expects will be assisted through Housing Element
programs based on general market conditions during the time frame of the Housing Element.
The housing element law recognizes that in developing housing policy and programs, identified housing
needs may exceed available resources and the community's ability to satisfy these needs. The quantified
objectives of the housing element, therefore, need not be identical to the identified housing need but
should establish the maximum number of housing units that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and
conserved over the eight-year time frame.
A. New Housing Development
Union City is a nearly built out city and the supply of vacant land has dwindled over the last decade. For
the 2015-2023 Housing Element cycle, the City has been assigned a Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA) of 1,106 new housing units in the following income categories: 158 extremely low-, 159 very
low-, 180 low-, 192 moderate-, and 417 above moderate-income units. In order to accommodate these
units during the Housing Element planning period, the City will need to rezone land for higher-density
residential development. Development will need to build out at the higher end of the allowable density
ranges to ensure the remaining land is used efficiently.
Zoning is only part of the equation. Housing is expensive to build, particularly in the Bay Area where
land costs and construction costs remain high. The following policies and implementation programs are
meant to provide opportunities and encourage the development of new housing to meet the City’s share of
the projected regional housing need for residents of all income levels.
Goal
Goal A.          To provide opportunities for a broad range of housing types to meet the needs of all
                 Union City residents.

                 65863, the City shall consider the potential impact on the City’s ability to meet its share
                 of the regional housing need when reviewing proposals to downzone residential
                 properties, reclassify residentially-designated property to other uses, or develop a
                 residential site with fewer units than what is assumed for the site in the Housing Element

HE-A.5           The City shall encourage the consolidation of parcels designated for multifamily
                 residential development when it facilitates efficient development of the parcels.
HE-A.6           The City shall continue to ensure that City policies, regulations, and procedures do not
                 add unnecessarily to the costs of producing housing while assuring the attainment of
                 other City objectives.
HE-A.7           The City shall continue to promote the expeditious processing and approval of residential
                 projects that meet General Plan policy and City regulatory requirements.
HE-A.8           The City shall encourage the development of new mixed-income and mixed-use

                 years of adoption of the Housing Element. Rezoned sites may include those identified as
                 “potential rezone sites” in the Housing Element, or will include other sites that provide at
                 least the same capacity. Consistent with Government Code Section 65583.2(h), the City
                 shall ensure that the rezoned sites are large enough to accommodate a minimum of 16
                 units per site, will permit owner-occupied and rental multifamily residential uses by-right
                 (without a conditional use permit, planned unit development permit, or other
                 discretionary action), and that at least 50 percent of the remaining need will be
                 accommodated on sites zoned for exclusively residential uses.

B. Affordable Housing
The shortage of affordable housing is an issue facing many communities in California, especially in the
Bay Area. Building affordable housing has become even more challenging with the elimination of the
Redevelopment Agency, which deprived the City of its largest source of funding for affordable housing.
The Affordable Housing Ordinance has been very successful in ensuring affordable housing is built
alongside market-rate housing. In addition to the Affordable Housing Ordinance, the City has built
partnerships with the Alameda County Housing Authority and non-profit developers (e.g., Eden Housing,
Inc., Elder Care Alliance, and Mid-Peninsula Housing), which have served as a model for the production
and management of affordable housing.
The policies and programs in this section are intended to encourage the development of new affordable
housing and assist in the preservation of existing affordable units.
Goal
Goal B.          To encourage construction and maintenance of affordable housing in Union City.
Policies
HE-B.1           The City shall give priority to multifamily housing project applications that provide
                 affordable housing on-site to ensure that they are expedited.
HE-B.2           The City shall continue to provide financial and regulatory incentives and use State and
                 Federal funding assistance for the production of affordable housing.

Adopted January 27, 2015
HE-B.3     The City shall ensure, through conditions of approval, that residential units that are
           required to sell or rent at below-market rates and are included within a housing
           development are produced simultaneously with market-rate housing.
HE-B.4     The City shall continue to implement the Affordable Housing Ordinance.
HE-B.5     In accordance with the provisions of State law, the City shall grant density bonuses for
           qualifying projects as an incentive for the development of lower-income and senior
           citizen housing.
HE-B.6     The City shall support and facilitate the construction of secondary dwelling units on
           single family designated and zoned parcels as a means of proving affordable housing.
HE-B.7     The City shall continue to work with local non-profit organizations and the Alameda
           County Housing Authority to acquire and bank properties for the development of
           affordable housing.
HE-B.8     The City shall strive to preserve as many assisted, at-risk units as possible, given the
           availability of funding.
H-B.9      The City shall defer certain fees on affordable housing developments until issuance of a
           Certificate of Occupancy (COO) to help offset development costs for affordable housing.

                 required to be maintained as affordable units pursuant to the City’s Affordable Housing

                 controls and respond to any Notice of Intent or Plan of Action that may be filed on local
                 projects, which are required at least 12 months prior to the proposed termination date.
                 This period of time allows the opportunity for the City or a non-profit affordable housing
                 organization to consider options to continue the affordability of the project. The City
                 shall continue to cooperate with the owners of housing developments with units that have
                 been set aside for lower-income households in accordance with the requirements of
                 Federal subsidy programs and ensure that the owner has met the tenant noticing
                 requirements as set forth by California State Government code Sections 65863.10 and
                 65863.11. Within three years prior to the expiration of the owners' Federal set-side
                 obligations, the City shall initiate negotiations to extend below-market-rate controls by
                 offering City-provided incentives.
                 The City shall restructure existing regulatory agreements, whenever possible, to allow the
                 City or its designee the opportunity to purchase the property at the conclusion of the rent
                 restrictions. Where permanent preservation of existing or new subsidized units is not
                 possible, the City shall minimize displacement of current tenants by negotiating anti-
                 displacement policy or relocation mitigation with the owner, whenever possible.

C. Housing Services and Assistance
There are several programs available to Union City residents to assist in obtaining and maintaining

program, while Alameda County or the Housing Authority operates other programs, such as the Section 8
rental assistance program. With limited funding available to build new affordable housing developments,
programs that assist residents in securing affordable housing within the housing market are an essential
component of the City’s strategy for providing adequate affordable housing.

D. Neighborhood Preservation/Housing Rehabilitation
The City of Union City has had long-term success in developing affordable housing in the city. The City
Council and community has been consistently supportive of affordable housing. By careful design and the
enforcement of design standards, which ensure compatibility with surrounding neighborhoods, affordable
housing projects have been assets to the neighborhoods surrounding them.
While it is important to encourage the development of new affordable housing, reinvestment in the
existing supply of housing is equally important. Although Union City’s housing stock is relatively new,
there are older neighborhoods (most notably Decoto and Old Alvarado) that have dilapidated or
substandard housing in need of rehabilitation and/or replacement.
The policies and programs in this section encourage the continued reinvestment in older neighborhoods
and the preservation and improvement of the existing housing stock.
Goal
Goal D.         To maintain healthy neighborhoods by improving the condition of the existing housing
                stock and by ensuring new development is compatible with the existing character and
                integrity of residential neighborhoods.
Policies
HE-D.1          The City shall seek to eliminate incompatible land uses or blighting influences from
                residential neighborhoods through cooperative neighborhood improvement programs,
                targeted code enforcement, and other available regulatory measures.
HE-D.2          The City should continue to preserve historic structures, conserve and protect the existing
                housing stock, provide adequate new housing, and avoid incompatible land uses in the
                Decoto and Old Alvarado neighborhoods.
HE-D.3          The City shall strive to minimize the demolition of existing multifamily housing unless

E. Equal Opportunity Housing and Discrimination Prevention
California State Law ensures all households have the right to rent or purchase housing without
discrimination. The City has continued to ensure equal housing opportunity through the enforcement of
fair housing practices and the dissemination of fair housing information throughout the community. The
City’s support for ECHO Housing in the operation of its fair housing counseling services has proven to be
an effective means for addressing housing issues and ensuring fair housing in the city. The policies and
programs in this section support the continuation of fair housing policies and programs in Union City.
Goal

F. Special Needs
Within the general population there are several groups of people who have special housing needs. These
special needs can make it difficult for members of these groups to locate suitable housing. In Union City,
special needs groups include homeless persons, single-parent households, seniors, persons with
disabilities, and large families.
As the number of seniors in Union City continues to increase, the City will need to encourage age-
appropriate housing types and facilities to meet the growing need. Based on information from the
Housing Authority, there is a severe shortage of housing available for low-income seniors in the region,
which is demonstrated by the waiting lists of several hundred persons for many of the existing senior
housing facilities within the city.
According to homeless service providers in the Tri-City area, there appears to be a strong need for
additional support services, emergency shelters, and transitional and supportive housing in Union City
and the surrounding area. Several providers have reported zero vacancy rates and have been forced to turn
homeless adults and families away on a weekly basis. Union City has been working in a collaborative
effort with service providers and the County of Alameda to mitigate this problem through its ongoing
funding of Abode Services, Centro de Servicios, and Safe Alternatives to Violent Environments (SAVE)
as well as its participation in the EveryOne Home program.
Single-parent households with children often require special consideration and assistance because of their
greater need for affordable housing, accessible day care, health care, and a variety of other supportive
services. Single-parent households are more likely to experience difficulties in finding affordable, decent
and safe housing because of their relatively lower household incomes.

G. Sustainability and Residential Energy Conservation
Energy efficiency has direct application to affordable housing. The more money spent on energy, the less
there is available for rent or mortgage payments. High energy costs have particularly detrimental effects
on low-income households that do not have enough income or cash reserves to absorb cost increases and
must choose between basic needs such as shelter, food, and energy.
The City’s current Green Building Ordinance encourages energy efficiency in new development beyond
State requirements. It stipulates that new City-sponsored public-private partnership projects over $3
million must achieve a Silver rating in the US Green Building Council’s LEED rating system.
While new construction can help achieve energy conservation goals, nearly 40 percent of the housing
stock in Union City was built before California’s energy code, Title 24 Part 6, was adopted in the 1980s.
Consequently, the existing building stock offers considerable opportunity for cost-effective energy
efficiency retrofits to decrease energy consumption. The City plans to achieve energy-efficiency
improvements in both existing and new buildings through a combination of education, incentives, and
regulations.
Beyond the design of building, the location of new residential development can have an effect on
transportation-related energy consumption. Transit-oriented development (TOD) refers to the creation of
compact, walkable communities centered around high-quality light rail, train, or bus transit systems.
Union City’s Intermodal Station District offers the potential to become a world-class TOD project.
Locating the majority of the City’s new growth within the Intermodal Station District and adjacent areas
will considerably reduce automobile dependence and the community’s and region’s transportation-related
energy consumption.
Goal
Goal G.          To encourage energy efficiency and appropriate weatherization in all new and existing
                 housing.

 Quantified Objectives
 One of the requirements of State law (California Government Code Section 65583[b]) is that the Housing
 Element contain quantified objectives for the maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development
 of housing. State law recognizes that the total housing needs identified by a community may exceed
 available resources and the community’s ability to satisfy this need. Under these circumstances, the
 quantified objectives need not be identical to the total housing needs. The quantified objectives shown in
 Table 5-56 represent targets. They are estimates based on experience, anticipated funding levels, and
 housing market conditions. The quantified objectives are not designed to be minimum requirements.
 In the past, the City relied heavily on Redevelopment Set-Aside funds to fund affordable housing
 development. When the State of California abolished redevelopment agencies through AB1x 26, the
 primary source of funding for affordable housing throughout California was eliminated. This action by
 the State, and the effect of the significant economic downturn on general City revenues, has left the City
 with limited and very constrained resources to meet affordable housing needs.
 The quantified objectives are based largely upon implementation programs that have measurable
 outcomes. However, the Housing Element contains several policies and implementation programs that
 reduce barriers and create opportunities for affordable housing. These policies and programs are essential
 to meeting the City’s housing needs, but are more qualitative and difficult to quantify.

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
APPENDIX B: AB 1233 UNACCOMMODATED NEED CALCULATION
When the analysis of a local government’s sites inventory does not demonstrate adequate sites to
accommodate the RHNA, State law requires that the Housing Element include a program to identify
additional capacity to accommodate any unmet need. The sites inventory in the adopted 2010 Housing
Element contained an unmet need of 312 lower-income units from the 2007-2014 RHNA.
To meet this remaining need, the Housing Element included Programs HE-A.4 and HE-A.5 to increase
adopted densities and rezone parcels:
            HE-A.4: The City shall amend the CSMU designation/district in the General Plan and
             Zoning Ordinance to allow up to 165 units per acre.
            HE-A.5: The City shall revise the zoning code to create two additional districts at 29-45 units
             per acre (RM1000) and 45-60 units per acre (RM725) in the Specialty Commercial (CS) and
             Community Commercial (CC) districts. This will be done through an overlay zone in order to
             encourage affordable housing for lower-income households at maximum densities of 45 and
             60 units per acre.
The City implemented Program HE-A.4, “upzoning” (i.e., increasing the maximum density) in the CSMU
district from 120 units per acre to 165 units per acre. This created capacity for an additional 135 lower-
income units, meeting 48 percent of the remaining need. However, the City was not able to complete the
rezoning of site “Vacant 3” (i.e., Site PR-1 in the 2015 Housing Element) or adopt the RM 750 and RM
1000 zoning districts during the previous Housing Element planning period. The City did, however,
increase the maximum allowed density in the RM 1500, CS, and CC zones from 29 units per acre to 30
units per acre, which met the default density standard for lower-income units. While this “upzoning” only
increased capacity on CS and CC zoned sites in the Housing Element inventory by one unit/acre, it
qualified these sites to count toward the lower-income RHNA rather than the moderate-income RHNA.
Table B-1 shows the sites that were subject to a rezone or “upzone” program in the 2010 Housing
Element, the actions taken by the City related to these sites, and the capacity on the site before and after
the upzoning. Table B-2 summarizes the capacity for all income categories before and after the upzoning,
and identifies an unmet need of 86 lower-income units that must be accommodated during the 2014-2022
RHNA period.

Union City General Plan Element Update
APPENDIX C: STAKEHOLDER WORKSHOP SUMMARY
On April 29, 2014, the City of Union City conducted a Stakeholder Workshop on the Housing Element
Update. To advertise the workshop, the City sent an email notice to local agencies, community
organizations, and stakeholders in the city. Table C-1 provides a list of contacts. The City also posted an
advertisement in the newspaper, Union City Patch, hung flyers in the Union City Library, and advertised
on the City’s local television network. Four stakeholders attended the Workshop.
At the workshop City staff and the Housing Element consultants from Mintier Harnish presented a brief
overview of the Housing Element Update and facilitated an interactive discussion to solicit ideas from
participants about the most critical housing issues facing Union City residents and new ways the City and
community might address these issues.
The following is a summary of the issues and ideas discussed at the workshop. The input provided at the
workshop was used to shape the Housing Element policies and programs.
Major Housing Issues and Barriers to Affordable Housing
            The number one issue is a lack of funding for housing programs.
            It is possible that some projects may be approaching their 15-year limits for Low Income
             Housing Tax Credit funding and could convert from affordable housing to market rate.
            It is more difficult to find incentives to build smaller units, such as micro-units.
            Most housing funds target large family units or special needs populations; there needs to be
             more diverse housing configurations for different household types.
            State funding does not support workforce housing.
Opportunities and Potential Solutions for Providing Housing
            There should be a focus on acquiring and preserving existing affordable units that are at risk
             of converting to market rate; this way the small amount of available resources can be used
             most effectively to provide affordable housing.
            Cities should collaborate to establish a multijurisdictional fund dedicated to preserving and
             avoiding market rate conversion.
            The State should make it easier to count preserved units towards a municipality’s RHNA.
            The City could facilitate private and public partnerships to encourage more affordable
             housing.
            The City needs to set inclusionary housing in-lieu fees that encourage building units at higher
             densities.
                 o   The Inclusionary Housing Ordinance was last updated in 2006; the City is currently
                     looking for more creative ways to increase the stock of affordable housing (e.g., profit
                     sharing).
            The City could collect housing impact fees on commercial development.

Adopted January 27, 2015

         The City could put pressure on the County to dedicate the majority of Boomerang Funds to
          affordable housing.
         A percentage of funding from transportation initiatives should go to housing.
             o   The City could advocate for Transit Oriented Development dollars.
             o   Transportation agencies have incentives to do this in order to address SB 375.
         The City could advocate for cap and trade funding for housing.
         Secondary units can be a source of affordable housing in built out communities.
             o   The City currently has very few limitations on second units (e.g., no additional
                 parking standards for second units), and permits approximately five second units per
                 year.
             o   These units can be counted towards the RHNA.
             o   There should be more research on micro-units.
         The City could look into expanding the spectrum for care for seniors.
             o   There is a direct nexus between health care and housing.
             o   Senior housing needs to be more affordable.
             o   Mercy Housing is experimenting with health care dollars to build affordable
                 supportive housing.
         In regards to site selection, the City should look at single-story retail that could be rebuilt as
          mixed-use and high density residential (e.g., Alvarado-Niles Corridor).

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
APPENDIX D: SB 520 ANALYSIS QUESTIONS
In accordance with SB 520 (Chapter 671, Statutes of 2001), Union City has analyzed the potential and
actual governmental constraints on the development of housing for persons with disabilities and
demonstrated the City’s effort to remove such constraints.
The following shows the City’s responses to the “SB 520 Analysis Tool” prepared by HCD.
Overview
             Does the locality have any processes for individuals with disabilities to make requests for
              reasonable accommodation with respect to zoning, permit processing, or building laws?
         The City recently (2014) amended its Zoning Ordinance to include a reasonable accommodation
         procedure for an individual seeking equal access to housing. Chapter 18.115 of the code outlines
         this process.
             Describe the process for requesting a reasonable accommodation.
         A request for reasonable accommodation is submitted on an application form or in the form of a
         letter to the Economic and Community Development Department Director.
         The request is reviewed by the Economic and Community Development Department Director if
         no approval is sought other than the request for reasonable accommodation. A request for
         reasonable accommodation submitted for concurrent review with another discretionary land use
         application shall be reviewed by the decision-maker for that discretionary application.
             Has the locality made any efforts to remove constraints on housing for persons with
              disabilities, such as accommodating procedures for the approval of group homes, ADA
              retrofit efforts, an evaluation of the zoning code for ADA compliance or other measures that
              provide flexibility?
         The City updated its Municipal Code in 2014 to allow supportive housing in all residential zones.
         The City allows group homes of six or fewer residents by right wherever single family homes are
         allowed, and allows group homes of seven or more in Civic Facilities and Private Institutional
         districts with a CUP.
             Does the locality make information available about requesting a reasonable accommodation
              with respect to zoning, permit processing, or building laws?
When information is requested regarding reasonable accommodations, Building Division staff will
provide the required forms and work with them throughout the process.
Zoning and Land Use
             Has the locality reviewed all of its zoning laws, policies, and practices for compliance with
              fair housing law?
         The City’s zoning laws, policies, and procedures were reviewed for compliance with fair housing
         law as part of the Alameda County HOME Consortium Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing
         Choice (January 2010). The City has adopted a Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance and
Union City Housing Element                                                                         Page D-1
Adopted January 27, 2015

        amended the Zoning Ordinance to comply with State law regarding emergency shelters,
        transitional housing, and supportive housing.
            Are residential parking standards for persons with disabilities different from other parking
             standards? Does the locality have a policy or program for the reduction of parking
             requirements for special needs housing if a project proponent can demonstrate a reduced need
             for parking?
        Parking requirements for uses that accommodate persons with disabilities are no different than
        other parking standards. All uses are required to comply with the parking-related ADA
        requirements listed in the Building Code. The City does not currently have a policy or program to
        address the reduction of parking requirements for disabled housing. Senior housing must provide
        0.5 covered parking spaces per bedroom. This requirement can be decreased by the Planning
        Commission if it is found that the senior housing will not create as great a need for housing.
            Does the locality restrict the siting of group homes? How does this affect the development
             and cost of housing?
        The Union City Municipal Code does not contain the term group home, but instead uses the term
        “community care facility.” A community care facility is defined as, “any facility, place or
        building where non-medical care and supervision of children, adolescents, adults or elderly
        persons is conducted under license from the California State Department of Social Services, but
        not including hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, rest homes, foster homes, large
        family day care homes or pre-schools.” It appears that group homes fall within this definition.
        Within residential zoning districts, community care facilities that house less than six people (i.e.,
        small) are permitted by right. Facilities that house more than six people (i.e., large) can be
        established subject to use permit approval. For properties in the civic facilities zoning district,
        large community care facilities are permitted as a matter of right. For properties in the private
        institutional zoning district, both large and small community care facilities are allowed subject to
        use permit approval.
            What zones allow group homes other than those residential zones covered by State law? Are
             group homes over six persons also allowed?
        The Union City Municipal Code does not contain the term group home, but instead uses the term
        “community care facility.” A community care facility is defined as, “any facility, place or
        building where non-medical care and supervision of children, adolescents, adults or elderly
        persons is conducted under license from the California State Department of Social Services, but
        not including hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, rest homes, foster homes, large
        family day care homes or pre-schools.” It appears that group homes fall within this definition.
        Within residential zoning districts, community care facilities that house less than six people (i.e.,
        small) are permitted by right. Facilities that house more than six people (i.e., large) can be
        established subject to use permit approval. For properties in the civic facilities zoning district,
        large community care facilities are permitted as a matter of right. For properties in the private
        institutional zoning district, both large and small community care facilities are allowed subject to
        use permit approval.

                                                                                    Adopted January 27, 2015

Housing
Union City General Plan Element Update
            Does the locality have occupancy standards in the zoning code that apply specifically to
             unrelated adults and not to families? Do the occupancy standards comply with fair housing
             laws?
         Chapter 18.08 of the Union City zoning ordinance defines family as, “one (1) or more persons
         occupying a dwelling and living as a single not for profit housekeeping unit as distinguished from
         a group occupying a hotel, club, boardinghouse, fraternity or sorority house.” This definition
         complies with Federal and State fair housing laws.
            Does the land-use element regulate the siting of special need housing in relationship to one
             another? Specifically, is there a minimum distance required between two (or more) special
             needs housing?
         The General Plan Land Use element does not regulate the siting of special need housing in
         relationship to one another. Consistent with Section 1520.5. (a) of the California Health and
         Safety Code, the City will exercise its right to request denial of a license by the State Department
         of Social Services to operate a residential care facility based on overconcentration. Per Section
         1502 of the California Health and Safety Code “residential facility" is defined as any family
         home, group care facility, or similar facility determined by the Department of Social Services
         director, for 24-hour nonmedical care of persons in need of personal services, supervision, or
         assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living or for the protection of the
         individual.
Permits and Processing
            How does the locality process a request to retrofit homes for accessibility (i.e., ramp request)?
         The City processes accessibility retrofit permits identical to any other building permit.
            Does the locality allow group homes with fewer than six persons by right in single family
             zones? What permits, if any, are required?
         Yes, the City allows community care facilities with fewer than six persons by right in single family
         zones. If any building upgrades or additions are proposed to a single family residence to
         accommodate a group home, a building permit and administrative site development review
         approval may be required as stipulated by the Union City Municipal Code.
            Does the locality have a set of particular conditions or use restrictions for group homes with
             greater than 6 persons? What are they? How do they affect the development of housing for
             persons with disabilities?
         Where conditionally permitted, the City requires a use permit to establish a large community care
         facility. The City does not have a set of particular conditions for these types of facilities. Each use
         permit application is reviewed and conditioned on a case-by-case basis to mitigate or lessen any
         impacts to the surrounding neighborhood.
            What kind of community input does the locality allow for the approval of group homes? Is it
             different than from other types of residential development?
         Any group homes that require use permit approval prior to establishment will be subject to the
         public hearing and notice requirements listed in the Union City Municipal Code. These
Union City Housing Element                                                                              Page D-3
Adopted January 27, 2015

        requirements provide an opportunity for public input. Uses that are permitted as a matter of right
        are not subject to the public hearing and notice requirements listed in the Municipal Code.
           Does the locality have particular conditions for group homes that will be providing services
            on-site? How may these conditions affect the development or conversion of residences to
            meet the needs of persons with disabilities?
        As stated previously, the City does not have a set of particular conditions for these types of
        facilities. Each use permit application is reviewed and conditioned on a case-by-case basis. To
        date, the City has not received any feedback from the public that conditions applied to use permit
        applications for community care facilities has negatively impacted the development or conversion
        of residences to meet the needs of persons with disabilities.
Building Codes
           Has the locality adopted the Uniform Building Code? What year? Has the locality made
            amendments that might diminish the ability to accommodate persons with disabilities?
        The City has adopted the 2013 California Codes. No amendments have been made that would
        diminish the City’s ability to accommodate persons with disabilities.
           Has the locality adopted any universal design elements in the building code?
        The City has not adopted any universal design elements. Each building permit application is
        reviewed individually.
           Does the locality provide reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities in the
            enforcement of building codes and the issuance of building permits?
        Yes, the current (2014) Building Codes adopted by the City provide for reasonable
        accommodations to individuals with disabilities.

number of families accepted by willing private landlords. This type of subsidy is said to be “tenant
based.”
Housing Unit: The place of permanent or customary abode of a person or family. A housing unit may be
a single family dwelling, a multifamily dwelling, a condominium, a modular home, a mobile home, a
cooperative, or any other residential unit considered real property under State law. A housing unit has, at
least, cooking facilities, a bathroom, and a place to sleep. It also is a dwelling that cannot be moved
without substantial damage or unreasonable cost.
Impact Fee: A fee, also called a development fee, levied on the developer of a project by a city, county,
or other public agency as compensation for otherwise-unmitigated impacts the project will produce.
Inclusionary Zoning: Provisions established by a public agency to require that a specific percentage of
housing units in a project or development remain affordable to very low-, and low-, or moderate-income
households for a specified period.
Implementation Program: An action, procedures, program, or technique that carries out general plan
policy. Implementation programs also specify primary responsibility for carrying out the action and a
time frame for its accomplishment.

median income for the county. Under State housing statutes, these categories are defined as follows:
Extremely Low (< 30% of area median) Very Low (31-50% of area median); Low (51-80% of area
median); Moderate (81-120% of area median); and Above Moderate (over 120% of area median).
Infill Development: Development of vacant land (usually individual lots or left-over properties) within
areas that are already largely developed.
Jobs/Housing Balance; Jobs/Housing Ratio: The availability of affordable housing for employees. The
jobs/housing ratio divides the number of jobs in an area by the number of employed residents. A ratio of
1.0 indicates a balance. A ratio greater than 1.0 indicates a net in-commute; less than 1.0 indicates a net
out-commute.

possession to another (a lessee) for a specified period of time (term) and for a specified consideration
(rent).
Low Income Housing Tax Credits: Tax reductions provided by the Federal and State governments for
investors in housing for low-income households.
Manufactured Housing: Housing that is constructed of manufactured components, assembled partly at
the site rather than totally at the site. Also referred to as modular housing.
Market-Rate Housing: Housing which is available on the open market without any subsidy. The price
for housing is determined by the market forces of supply and demand and varies by location.
Mean: The average of a range of numbers.
Median: The mid-point in a range of numbers.

definition). Jurisdictions may expand the Census definition in defining units with physical defects.
Population. People or inhabitants of a region or area.
Poverty Level: As used by the U.S. Census, families and unrelated individuals are classified as being
above or below the poverty level based on a poverty index that provides a range of income cutoffs or
"poverty thresholds" varying by size of family, number of children, and age of householder. The income
cutoffs are updated each year to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index.
Project-Based Rental Assistance: Rental assistance provided for a project, not for a specific tenant. A
tenant receiving project-based rental assistance gives up the right to that assistance upon moving from the
project.

housing authorities. A low-income family applies to the local public housing authority in the area in
which they want to live.
Quantified Objective: The housing element must include quantified objectives which specify the
maximum number of housing units that can be constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved by income level
within a five- year time frame, based on the needs, resources, and constraints identified in the housing
element (§65583 (b)). The number of units that can be conserved should include a subtotal for the number
of existing assisted units subject to conversion to non-low-income households. Whenever possible,
objectives should be set for each particular housing program, establishing a numerical target for the

effective period of the program. Ideally, the sum of the quantified objectives will be equal to the
identified housing needs. However, identified needs may exceed available resources and limitations
imposed by other requirements of state planning law. Where this is the case, the quantified objectives
need not equal the identified housing needs, but should establish the maximum number of units that can
be constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved (including existing subsidized units subject to conversion
which can be preserved for lower- income use), given the constraints.
Redevelop: To demolish existing buildings; or to increase the overall floor area existing on a property; or
both; irrespective of whether a change occurs in land use.
Redevelopment Agency: California Community Redevelopment Law provided authority to establish a
Redevelopment Agency with the scope and financing mechanisms necessary to remedy blight and
provide stimulus to eliminate deteriorated conditions. The law provided for the planning, development,
redesign, clearance, reconstruction, or rehabilitation, or any combination of these, and the provision of
public and private improvements as may be appropriate or necessary in the interest of the general welfare
by the Agency. Redevelopment law required an Agency to set aside 20 percent of all tax increment
dollars generated from each redevelopment project area for increasing and improving the community’s
supply of affordable housing. The City of Union City’s Redevelopment Agency was dissolved as of
February 1, 2012. The City of Union City acts as the Housing Successor Agency of the Former
Redevelopment Agency. As the Housing Successor, the City oversees bond proceeds of the former
Redevelopment Agency.
Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP): The Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP) is based on State of
California projections of population growth and housing unit demand and assigns a share of the region’s
future housing need to each jurisdiction in California. These housing need numbers serve as the basis for
the update of the Housing Element in each California city and county.
Regional Housing Needs Share: A quantification by a COG or by HCD of existing and projected
housing need, by household income group, for all localities within a region.
Rehabilitation: The repair, preservation, and/or improvement of substandard housing.
Residential, Multiple Family: Usually three or more dwelling units on a single site, which may be in the
same or separate buildings.
Residential, Single family: A single dwelling unit on a building site.
Rezoning: An amendment to the map and/or text of a zoning ordinance to effect a change in the nature,
density, or intensity of uses allowed in a zoning district and/or on a designated parcel or land area.
Secondary dwelling unit: A self-contained living unit, either attached to or detached from, and in
addition to, the primary residential unit on a single lot. "Granny Flat" is one type of secondary dwelling
unit intended for the elderly.
Section 8 Rental Assistance Program: A Federal (HUD) rent-subsidy program that is one of the main
sources of Federal housing assistance for low-income households. The program operates by providing
"housing assistance payments" to owners, developers, and public housing agencies to make up the
difference between the "Fair Market Rent" of a unit (set by HUD) and the household's contribution
toward the rent, which is calculated at 30 percent of the household's adjusted gross monthly income
(GMI). Section 8 includes programs for new construction, existing housing, and substantial or moderate
housing rehabilitation.

                               LAND USE ELEMENT
              INTRODUCTION
              With its great regional access, a variety of housing stock, and tremendous opportunities for
              new job growth, Union City has become a vital part of Silicon Valley. Union City has several
              districts that can be redeveloped to meet the various strategic dimensions necessary for Union
              City to achieve such a goal. This Land Use Element focuses particularly on five planning
              districts -- the Station District, Central Technology Center, Alvarado Technology Center,
              Union Landing, and International Market Place District. Generally, these areas are
              underutilized and have obsolete uses or offer unique opportunities to enhance the services and
              quality of places for the community.
              Other areas of the City that are specifically addressed in the Land Use Element include
              Mission Boulevard, Union City Boulevard, Horner/Veasy Street, the Caltrans property and
              the Hillside Area. These sites are seen as key areas that will develop or redevelop through the
              life of the General Plan.
              Within the regional setting, Union City has several physical constraints that present unique
              challenges in planning for future growth within the community. These constraints include
              sensitive wetland habitat along the western city limits, steep topography on the eastern side of
              the City (roughly half the area of the City), and limited available land. Infill and
              redevelopment have emerged as the primary means for accommodating future growth.
              Therefore, the focus of this element is on working within those physical constraints to
              enhance the best qualities of the existing districts within the community.
              The Land Use Element is divided into two major parts. The first major part describes the
              City’s Land Use Diagram, the land use designations that appear on the diagram, and related
              development standards. This section prescribes the locations of various land uses and sets out
              standards for future development and redevelopment. The second major part sets out goals,
              policies, and implementation programs. The diagrams, designations, standards, goals,
              policies, and programs in this element set the basic framework to guide the type, location,
              intensity, and quality of future development and the protection of Union City’s natural and
              built environment.
              LAND USE DIAGRAM AND STANDARDS
              The most familiar part of any general plan is the map, or land use diagram, showing the types
              and locations of existing and future development that the plan envisions. In order to
              accurately interpret the development implications of the various designations shown on the
              diagram, the reader must understand the intent of and the standards for each designation. The
              following sub-sections first describe how the standards are expressed generally, then outline
              the standards for each of the designations shown on Union City’s General Plan Land Use
              Diagram.

Land Use Element                                                                      City of Union City
             LAND USE DIAGRAM
             The Land Use Diagram designates land uses for the entire Planning Area. State planning law
             requires that the general plan cover all territory with the boundaries of the adopting city or
             county as well as “any land outside its boundary which in the planning agency’s judgment
             bears relation to its planning” (Government Code Section 65300). To carry out this directive,
             most cities formally delineate a “planning area” boundary in their general plans. For the
             purposes of the Union City General Plan, Union City’s Planning Area is coterminous with the
             City’s existing city limits.
             Figure LU-1 shows the Union City General Plan Land Use Diagram. A full-scale copy of the
             map is available at the Union City Community Development Department.
             LAND USE INTENSITY STANDARDS
             State planning law requires general plans to establish “standards of population density and
             building intensity” for the various land use designations in the plan (Government Code
             Section 65302(a)). To satisfy this requirement, the General Plan includes such standards for
             each land use designation appearing on the Land Use Diagram. These standards are stated
             differently for residential and non-residential development. Following are explanations of
             how these standards operate.
             Residential Uses
             Standards of development density for residential uses are stated as the allowable range of
             dwelling units per gross acre. The term Agross acre@ includes all land (including streets and
             rights-of-way) designated for a particular residential use, while net acreage excludes streets
             and rights-of-way. In urban areas, net acreage is normally 20 to 25 percent less for a given
             area than gross acreage. In rural areas and open space areas, the difference between net and
             gross can be as low as five percent. Net acreage is the standard typically used in zoning,
             while gross acreage is more commonly used in general plan designations.
             Standards of population density for residential uses can be
             derived by multiplying the maximum allowable number of
             dwelling units per gross acre by the average number of person
             per dwelling unit assumed for the applicable residential
             designation. Citywide in 2000, there were approximately 3.63
             persons per dwelling unit.
                                                                            Various Building Configurations Representing a

City of Union City                                                                   Land Use Element
               Non-Residential Uses
               Standards of building intensity for non-residential uses such as commercial and industrial
               development are stated as maximum floor-area ratios (FARs). A floor-area ratio is the ratio
               of the gross building square footage on a lot to the net square footage of the lot (or parcel).
               For example, on a lot with 10,000 net square feet of land area, an FAR of 1.00 will allow
               10,000 square feet of gross building floor area to be built, regardless of the number of stories
               in the building (e.g., 5,000 square feet per floor on two floors or 10,000 square feet on one
               floor). On the same 10,000-square-foot lot, an FAR of 0.50 would allow 5,000 square feet of
               floor area, and an FAR of 0.25 would allow 2,500 square feet. The diagram to the right shows
               graphically how various building configurations representing an FAR of 1.00 could cover a
               lot.
               LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
               The General Plan includes 16 residential, commercial, industrial, and other land use
               designations that depict the types of land uses that will be allowed throughout the City. Table
               LU-1 identifies all of the designations along with their corresponding development intensity
               standards.
               The land use designations are implemented largely through zoning. Table LU-2 shows which
               zoning districts are deemed compatible, conditionally compatible, or incompatible with the
               various General Plan land use designations.
               Land Use Designations
               Residential
               (Section updated July 22, 2014, AG-02-14)
               Residential - 3 to 6 Dwelling Units per Acre (3-6)
               The purpose of this designation is to provide areas for single family detached residential uses
               and activities normally associated with single family neighborhoods. Where found
               appropriate, innovative single family design alternatives are encouraged. This low density
               residential designation is the preferred residential land use designation for the City. As a
               result, it is the "anchor" land use in areas where adequate urban services are available and the
               City envisions future residential development. The lot size range for this designation is 6,000
               to 10,000 square feet.
               Residential - 6 to 10 Dwelling Unit per Acre (6-10)
               The purpose of this designation is to provide areas for a variety of moderate intensity single
               family uses including detached, semi-attached and attached single family housing, mobile
               home parks, and zero lot line developments. Activities consistent with the prevailing single
               family character of the area are also appropriate in this designation. This designation is
               applied in areas of predominantly single family character where a greater diversity of housing
               type is intended. The lot size range for this designation is 3,500 to 6,000 square feet.
February 2002                                                                             LU-3

             Residential - 10 to 17 Units per Acre (10-17)
             The purpose of this designation is to provide areas intended for moderate density residential
             use patterns including duplexes and multifamily dwellings of greater intensity. This
             designation is located in transitional areas between higher intensity uses and lesser intensity
             single family areas. The site area per dwelling unit for this designation is as small as 2,400
             square feet.
             Residential - 17 to 30 Dwelling Units per Acre (17-30)
             The purpose of this designation is to allow for multifamily housing at densities greater
             than other residential designations. This designation is intended to allow for those
             structural forms that promote higher density living styles. As a result, this designation is
             located in areas where a mixture of higher intensity activities is desired. It is typically
             applied near major transportation routes and facilities, and near core shopping areas. This
             designation also serves as a transitional land use between single family and higher
             intensity non-residential areas. The site area per dwelling unit for this designation is as
             small as 1,450 square feet.
             Residential - 30 to 60 Dwelling Units per Acre (R30-60)
             This designation is intended to allow high-rise, high density housing where there public
             transit is readily available. Where applied, development densities shall not be less than 30
             units per acre. The site area per dwelling unit for this designation is as small as 726 square

             Station Mixed Use-Commercial (CSMU)
             (Section updated November 2010, AG-01-08)
             The purpose of this designation is to define an area of visual prominence through high
             intensity development. In order to promote Union City's identity, high aesthetic, and design
             standards are necessary to make the area attractive to people as a place to shop, work, and,
             where appropriate, live. The designation is primarily commercial in nature and is intended to
             promote retail and office opportunities. High density residential land use between 45 and 165
             units per acre is also appropriate where it will promote, in a coordinated manner with the
             commercial development, the purpose of this designation.
             This designation is applied to the immediate vicinity of the intermodal facility because the
             opportunity to connect with regional and subregional transportation providers would support a
             higher density of uses. The minimum site area per dwelling unit is 264 square feet for
             residential and the minimum parcel size is 5,000 square feet for commercial. The floor area
             ratio (FAR) for buildings in this area is between 1.0 and 4.0 (with an average of 2.0), and
             increasing density as the parcels near the BART station.

City of Union City                                                                    Land Use Element
               Retail Commercial (CR)
               The purpose of this designation is to provide areas for retail outlets and services demanded by
               either neighborhood, community, or subregional/regional markets. Office uses may be an
               appropriate land use activity in order to provide an efficient use of Retail Commercial areas.
               Uses should be appropriate to the type of market being served. Neighborhood commercial
               centers emphasize those uses which provide convenience goods and services for the
               surrounding residential area. Retail commercial centers serving community-wide or regional
               needs include uses which may either be neighborhood oriented activities grouped together on
               a larger scale or uses that demand a larger market area. Specialty-oriented retail commercial
               areas contain specialized uses that require a market area larger than the community to prosper.
                The retail commercial designation is therefore oriented toward freeways, major arterials, and
               neighborhood areas. Retail commercial activities should be located and designed to minimize
               impacts on surrounding residential areas. In the Old Alvarado district and along Mission
               Boulevard, residential uses located above first floor retail would be acceptable to create a
               mixed-use development. In the Alvarado-Niles Road/Decoto Road area, office uses above the
               first floor would be acceptable. Minimum area of this designation is 5,000 square feet for
               neighborhood activities, 10 acres for community commercial activities, and 2 acres for
               specialty commercial activities. The minimum parcel size for this designation is 5,000 square
               feet. The floor area ratio (FAR) for buildings in this area is between 0.20 and 1.00.
               Visitor and Thoroughfare Commercial (CVT)
               The purpose of the Visitor and Thoroughfare Commercial designation is to provide areas for
               commercial activities oriented to serve the traveling public. It is intended to be located near
               freeway interchanges and high capacity major arterials in such a fashion as to provide safe and
               convenient access and minimize conflicts with nearby residential land uses. Permitted uses
               include, but are not limited to, hotels, motels, restaurants, service stations, and convenience
               stores. The minimum area for this designation is one acre. The minimum parcel size for this
               designation is 5,000 square feet. The floor area ratio (FAR) for buildings in this area is
               between 0.35 and 2.00.
               Office Commercial (CO)
               The purpose of the Official Commercial designation is to provide areas for professional and
               administrative services and offices. Uses permitted under this designation generally include
               the following: medical offices and clinics; law firms; accountant offices; insurance, real estate,
               and financial; governmental offices; social services; and non-profit organizations. Retail
               commercial activities that compliment or are accessory to the primary uses of the designation
               are also appropriate. Because of the potential intensity of uses, this designation should be
               located on major arterials, oriented away (by design or location) from residential areas. The
               minimum area for this designation is one-half acre. The minimum parcel size for this
               designation is 5,000 square feet. The floor area ratio (FAR) for buildings in this area is
               between 0.30 and 1.50.

Land Use Element                                                                                       City of Union City
             Industrial
             General Industrial (MG)
             The purpose of the General Industrial designation is to provide space for a broad range of
             heavier industrial uses. Typically the designation is applied where large land acreage is
             available. It is also applied where the impacts associated with unsightliness, noise, odor, and
             traffic, and the hazards associated with certain industrial uses, will not impact on residential,
             commercial, other less intense use areas, or on such uses as schools and transportation
             facilities, such as BART. General Industrial area uses are assumed to have moderate nuisance
             characteristics. Hazardous materials manufacturing or distribution is undesirable in this area.
              Performance standards are applied to ensure minimum potential for adverse effects, that any
             unavoidable adverse effects are contained on-site, and that the general objective of a high
             standard of property and use maintenance will be met throughout the City. The minimum
             parcel size for this designation is one acre in size. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for
             buildings in this area is 0.75.
             Light Industrial (ML)
             The purpose of the Light Industrial designation is to provide space for manufacturing and
             industrial uses which evidence no or very low nuisance characteristics. The designation is
             applied to areas where nuisance characteristics of noise, odor, traffic generation,
             unsightliness, or hazardous materials manufacturing or storage are undesirable. Light
             Industrial areas typically include high quality industrial park developments. Rail and truck
             facilities serve many light industrial uses. Also located in these areas are non-industrial uses
             which support or are adjunct to industrial uses and which are compatible with the primary
             industrial use. Non-industrial uses may include administrative, sales, service, and educational
             uses. All outdoor areas will have landscaping and screening. Further, other performance
             standards are applied to ensure minimum potential for adverse effects, that any unavoidable
             adverse effects are contained on-site, and that the general objective of a high standard of
             property and use maintenance will be met throughout the City. The minimum parcel size for
             this designation is 20,000 sq. ft. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for buildings in this
             area is 1.0.
             Special Industrial (MS)
             The purpose of the Special Industrial designation is to provide space for the lightest industrial
             operations and non-manufacturing uses that support nearby manufacturing that exhibit
             virtually no nuisance characteristics. Non-manufacturing uses include educational,
             administrative, sales and service activities. This designation provides for a smaller scale of
             uses, on smaller sites than would typically be found in Light Industrial designated areas. In
             Special Industrial designated areas nuisance characteristics of noise, odor, traffic generation,
             unsightliness or hazardous materials storage or handling are avoided, and almost all uses will
             be conducted entirely within enclosed buildings.
             This designation typically includes small scale, high quality industrial park developments. It
             is often applied as a buffer adjacent to major thoroughfares where large landscaped setbacks
             are provided and as a transition area between higher intensity industrial uses and residential,
             commercial or other lower intensity uses. Performance standards will be applied to eliminate,
             or minimize to the extent reasonably possible, any potential for adverse effects, and to ensure

City of Union City                                                                   Land Use Element
               that the general objective of a high standard of property and use maintenance will be met
               throughout the City. The minimum parcel size for this designation is 20,000 sq. ft. The
               maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for buildings in this area is 1.0.
               Research and Development Campus (RDC)
               (Section updated December 2002)
               The designation is intended to provide a flexible range of activities which either have very
               low or no nuisance characteristics. Prototypes for this designation would be "flex" space that
               can be adapted to office, research and development, and service/sales uses. In addition, it
               allows for manufacturing uses consistent with the Light Industrial designation. This
               designation is applied where a master plan intends to intensify industrial development over a
               period of years. The minimum parcel size for this designation is five acres. The minimum
               floor area ratio (FAR) for buildings in this area is 0.40. Buildings must be a minimum of two
               stories with two floors that can be fully occupied upon completion of construction.
               Applications for the development of sites within a 2000 foot radius of the BART station must
               include a master plan that demonstrates how the FAR can be intensified up to a minimum of
               0.5, and preferably up to 0.65, as market demand warrants The maximum floor area ratio
               (FAR) for buildings in this area is 2.0.
               Resource
               Open Space (OS)
               The purpose of this designation is to conserve lands that should remain as open space for
               passive and active recreation uses, resource management, flood control management and
               public safety. Uses that would typically be appropriate in this land use designation include
               but are not limited to public parks, playgrounds, golf courses and driving ranges, parkways,
               vista areas, wetlands, wildlife habitats and outdoor nature laboratories; stormwater
               management facilities; and buffer zones separating urban development and ecologically
               sensitive resources.
               Agricultural (A)
               The purpose of this designation is to conserve lands that should remain as open space because
               of their value for agricultural production. Uses that would typically be appropriate in this
               land use designation include but are not limited to agricultural activities and other low
               intensity open space type uses. The minimum parcel size for this designation is 20 acres.
               Public/Institutional
               Civic Facility (CF)
               This designation is applied to the City's major public buildings and facilities owned by City,
               County, State, Federal, or other public agencies that serve the general public. Uses include
               but are not limited to wastewater treatment facilities, water tanks, electrical substations,
               public educational facilities, community centers, libraries, museums, government offices and
               courts (e.g., Civic Center), transit facilities and stations, and public safety facilities (e.g.,
               police and fire stations).

             Private Institutional (PI)
             The purpose of this designation is to provide appropriate locations for private institutional
             uses. Uses include but are not limited to cemeteries, churches, private educational facilities,
             private non-profit and service organizations, and continuing care retirement communities.
             Areas designated as Institutional on the Caltrans property on Alvarado-Niles Road, and on the
             Accinelli/Cerruti property on Lowry Road are Afloating zones.@ Final location of the
             institutional use can be modified as part of the development applications for these properties.
             Land for institutional uses is identified in the Horner/Veasy Street area through policy
             statements. The minimum acreage that must be maintained for institutional uses in these
             specific areas is as follows:
                       Accinelli/Cerruti Property (APN: 543-201-4-2 and 5-2):             8 acres

               B. STATION DISTRICT
               The Economic Development Strategy calls for mixed-use investment around the existing
               BART station and future intermodal facility. The Station District area contains over 175
               acres of land that could develop to its maximum capacity during the life of the General
               Plan. The Station District refers to those lands within the DIPSA bounded by Seventh
               Street, Alvarado-Niles Road, Decoto Road and the city of Fremont. Of this, as much as
               100 acres could be committed for development in the next few years casting the future of
               the area for Union City's foreseeable future. Nowhere else in the Western United States is
               there the same potential to leverage the synergy between a burgeoning regional economy,
               regional accessibility, and available
               land.
               The City envisions the creation of a
               mixed-use district with an emphasis on a
               town center/central business district with
               residential, commercial, office and
               research and development uses serving as
               an important regional employment center.

               be developed in the short, rather than long term.
LU-B.4.2       The City shall support efforts for timely development of circulation and other needed
               infrastructure improvements to eliminate bottlenecks that limit opportunities for achieving

LU-B.4.7     Should the service stations at Alvarado-Niles Road and Decoto Road be displaced, the City
             shall plan for appropriate nearby zones to accommodate the uses.
               Goal         To encourage a variety of densities and types of residential uses in the area to
               LU-B.5       help achieve City housing goals, ensure proper relationships to adjoining
                            lands, and to support existing and future commercial uses within and nearby
                            the Station District.
             Policies
LU-B.5.1     The City shall locate high density/mixed-income residential uses close to the intermodal
             facility.
LU-B.5.2     Where necessary, the City shall provide a transition from existing or planned lower density
             residential uses to new office, light industrial, and service commercial areas and/or retail
             commercial use areas. Land use intensity/density should be highest adjacent to the intermodal
             facility and transition to lower intensity/density land use toward the edge of the Station District.
LU-B.5.3     The City shall provide a sufficient variety of housing development to accommodate different
             family sizes including a sufficient number of rental and for sale units for larger families.
               Goal         To provide, or ensure the provision of, affordable housing in concert with the

                            Redevelopment Area requirements.
             Policies
LU-B.6.1     The City shall require all new development to comply with the affordable housing
             requirements of the Housing Element and the Redevelopment Plan.
LU-B.6.2     The City shall allow for phased development of affordable housing if necessary to ensure the
             economic viability of the project and the other objectives of this plan.

City of Union City                                                                      Land Use Element
LU-B.6.3       The City shall locate affordable housing throughout the city and not concentrate it in selected
               neighborhoods.
                 Goal         To guide all new development in the Station District in such a way as to
                 LU-B.7       ensure harmony with existing and potential uses both within the Station
                              District and in adjacent neighborhoods.
               Policies
LU-B.7.1       Where appropriate, the City should ensure that new development is integrated with adjoining
               uses by creating connections and minimizing the separation that results from the road corridors,
               rail lines, and flood control channels in the area. However, there should be distinct visual
               separation and noise buffering between new residential uses and existing industrial uses that
               are to be preserved under the terms of the DIPSA Specific Plan.
LU-B.7.2       The City shall strive to relocate old industrial uses in the Station District that act as a deterrent
               to new development in the area.
LU-B.7.3       Landscaping, design, a walkway system and other elements should be used to integrate new
               uses with existing uses. Cohesive links should be established between neighborhoods. In
               particular, a safe pedestrian link should be developed between the Guy Emanuele School and
               the Decoto neighborhood northwest of Decoto Road.
LU-B.7.4       The City shall require that all new development proposals include detailed plans for integrating
               new construction and uses with existing and planned uses on adjoining sites. In particular,
               residential development proposals shall include measures to ensure that new development is
               compatible with existing industrial uses. New residential development shall be designed to
               include buffering between new and existing uses. Existing industrial uses shall not be required
               to participate in such buffering or otherwise be adversely affected by the addition of residential
               uses. However, should existing industrial uses choose to expand, they shall comply with the
               normal design and site development review requirements of the City.
                 Goal         To balance residential, commercial and light industrial land uses so as to
                 LU-B.8       achieve a high quality of life for the Station District and minimize adverse
                              impacts on the greater community.
               Policies
LU-B.8.1       The intermodal facility shall be designed and linked to reduce the need for area residents to use
               private automobiles for daily work, shopping and service needs.
LU-B.8.2       The City shall create opportunities for mixed uses within the Station District so that people can
               live close to work, shopping, and service activities.
LU-B.8.3       The City should ensure that Station District land uses are in balance with citywide uses to help
               ensure that Union City will be a complete community, serving the diverse needs of its
               residents.

               Goal        To increase and diversify local employment opportunities, and retain existing
               LU-B.9      and accommodate new light industrial uses that are compatible with City
                           objectives for safety, environmental quality, visual quality, and revenue
                           enhancement.
             Policies
LU-B.9.1     The City shall view existing industrial businesses as part of the mixed use program that is
             essential for growth and development envisioned in this district.
LU-B.9.2     The City shall work with leaders of the Station District business community to establish and
             implement a program for achieving appropriate business diversity and providing for the long
             term support of successful and compatible business activities.
               Goal          To encourage timely removal of any existing industrial operations that cause
               LU-B.10       significant risk to existing or planned land uses, and when necessary
                             financially support timely clean-up of sites contaminated by wastes from
                             previous hazardous materials users.
             Policies
LU-B.10.1    In those instances where an existing use cannot be modified to eliminate characteristics that
             conflict with existing or planned uses, the City should, as feasible, support relocation of the
             business.
LU-B.10.2    The City should give high priority to using redevelopment funds where needed to remove
             incompatible uses.
LU-B.10.3    Efforts should be made, within the provisions of existing Federal and State regulations, to force
             operators and/or property owners to clean-up their own sites to acceptable levels of safety.
             Public funds should be used only when other financial support is not available and when it is
             determined that timely redevelopment of the area cannot proceed without public investment.
             Implementation Programs
LU-B.1       The Redevelopment Agency shall provide capital improvement in the DIPSA area as
             provided in the DIPSA Specific Plan.

      C.     CENTRAL TECHNOLOGY CENTER AND
             ALVARADO TECHNOLOGY CENTER
             The Economic Development Strategy recommends increasing the tax base, density, and quality
             of jobs in the Central Bay Industrial Park. Currently, this 468-acre area is comprised primarily
             of warehouse uses. There are about 5.9 million square feet developed at an average FAR of
             0.35.
             Similarly, the Alvarado Technology Center (formally known as the Alvarado Business Park)
             offers tremendous opportunities for employment intensification and a stronger tax base. The
             Alvarado Technology Center has approximately 4 million square feet of building area, with
             approximately 3.5 million square feet of warehousing and light manufacturing.
             The City’s intention is to encourage conversion of existing warehouses to light industrial and
             research and development uses. The goal is to create new Silicon Valley addresses -- the
             Central Technology Center and Alvarado Technology Center. The City would increase
             employment without loss of square footage, encourage higher quality development, and
             provide a social and business focus desirable for the next generation technology centers. It
             would require a concerted effort by the City to work with property owners.
                Goal         To actively pursue an incentive approach that will encourage the conversion
                LU-C.1       of existing warehouses to light industrial and research and development uses
                             that will ultimately create new Silicon Valley addresses in Union City.
             Policies
LU-C.1.1      The City shall pursue an aggressive marketing and business retention effort to attract the
              development of job-intensive, high-tech industrial uses.
LU-C.1.2      The City shall pursue converting existing warehousing and distribution facilities to light
              industrial and research and development uses.
LU-C.1.3      The City shall actively recruit a community college small scale satellite facility to locate in the
              Central Technology Center to support the needs of local businesses by providing a better
              prepared workforce.
LU-C.1.4      The City shall investigate alternative solutions such as structured parking, shared parking or
              the creation of a parking district to address parking problems that may be created by
              intensification of employment in the technology centers.
LU-C.1.5      The City shall analyze the traffic impacts of new development within the Central Technology
              Center.
LU-C.1.6      The City shall establish express transit connections from the Central Technology Center and
              the Alvarado Technology Center to the intermodal facility.

                D. UNION LANDING
                (Section updated January 2005)
                Union Landing is a 104-acre area located between I-880
                and Dyer Street, south of the Whipple Road I-880
                interchange and north of the Alvarado-Niles Road I-880
                interchange. As of November 2000, most of Union
                Landing had been committed to development. The
                project demonstrates how the City can work with
                large-scale projects to meet fiscal and commercial
                service objectives. Build-out as a regional shopping
                destination, this district will require an on-going
                commitment to quality reinvestment to keep the area
                fresh and competitive.
                                                                               Shops at Century center in Union
                                                                               Landing
                In the past, the city has had a limited retail commercial base. Full buildout of this area will
                help enhance community identity, provide a greater balance between regional and community-
                oriented shopping opportunities, reduce a significant sales tax leakage out of the community,
                and improve the balance and amount of revenue sources for the City.
February 2002                                                                               LU-27

Land Use Element                                                                                     City of Union City
               Goal           To continue to encourage and support the development of Union Landing as
               LU-D.1         the major retail center of the city and a retail center of regional and sub-
                              regional significance.
              Policies
LU-D.1.1      The City shall require that Union Landing be primarily devoted to commercial uses and
              activities serving regional markets. These regional uses should be located in areas having the
              highest visibility and good access from I-880.
LU-D.1.2      The City shall ensure that community-serving development
              will not detract from the development of the regional and
              sub-regional development types or detract from other
              community centers established elsewhere in Union City.
LU-D.1.3      The City shall require development of a variety of retail and
              commercial uses in Union Landing to broaden the
              shopping base and maximize the opportunity for long-term
              economic success.
LU-D.1.4      In order to assure that all development and performance           Office Max development in Union Landing
              standards established for the applicable development type         with freeway pylon sign in background
              are met, the City shall require all new uses proposed for Union Landing to comply with the
              development types described in LU-D.7.1.
LU-D.1.5      The City shall construct a public plaza within Union Landing.
               Goal            To encourage the development of uses, features and conditions in Union
               LU-D.2          Landing that will allow the area to become the major commercial and
                               entertainment center of Union City, including opportunities for daytime and
                               evening uses.
              Policies
LU-D.2.1      The City shall require development in Union Landing to incorporate landscaped areas that can
              become the focus of appropriate activities. When practical, pedestrian areas should be linked
              together to encourage a leisurely shopping environment.
LU-D.2.2      The City shall require the street system in Union Landing to focus on pedestrian links. All key
              entry points to the Union Landing District should be enhanced to attract people to the area.
LU-28                                                                                                    February 2002
City of Union City                                                                    Land Use Element
LU-D.2.3        The City shall encourage developers to adopt street
                names that reflect the heritage of Union City. The
                naming and signing in the area should help to set a
                positive image for the "Union City" name.
LU-D.2.4        The City shall require that restaurants and
                commercial entertainment uses be located adjacent
                to pedestrian areas and linked by pedestrian ways.
                Commercial kiosks could be developed in the area
                for selling flowers, newspapers, snacks, that would
                enhance the area for pedestrians.
LU-D.2.5        The City shall allow up to three free-standing
                fast-food restaurants only within the Community
                Commercial area in Union Landing and upon the
                issuance of a use permit. The end user should be a
                business not currently located in Union City.
                                                                         Pedestrian walkway in Union Landing
                  Goal           To discourage uses, and avoid actions that would be detrimental to the
                  LU-D.3         achievement of Goals LU-D.1 and LU-D.2.
                Policies
LU-D.3.1        The City shall not permit uses in Union Landing that could jeopardize the viability of the
                desired commercial activities or that could detract from the goal of setting a positive image. In
                particular, the City shall not permit the following uses:
                a.        New or used car, truck, RV, outdoor sales lots and/or repair facilities, except when
                          developed within an Auto Mall activity area;
                b.        Residential uses, unless they are located above the ground floor of a commercial
                          development in which retail commercial, service and/or office uses comprise at least
                          70 percent of the total floor area of the building;
                c.        Any form of industrial use;
                d.        Free-standing fast-food restaurants, except those located in areas intended for
                          Community Commercial pursuant to Policy LU-D.7.1.c;
                e.        Automobile service stations; and
                f.        "Strip center" type developments that caters to convenience retail normally found in
                          neighborhood centers.
LU-D.3.2        The City shall discourage temporary or interim uses unless it can be demonstrated that such
                uses are needed to achieve the long-term goal of a viable retail center.
February 2002                                                                                  LU-29
Land Use Element                                                                                       City of Union City
 LU-D.3.3     The City shall prohibit in Union Landing establishment of any major institutional or
              community facilities that require large land areas.
                 Goal         To ensure, to the extent practical, that all new development in Union
                 LU-D.4       Landing will be economically viable, that it will generate revenues to the
                              City in excess of City costs to service development, and that it will create
                              new jobs within the city.
             Policies
LU-D.4.1     The City shall require all proposals for development where the end user is not part of the
             application for development to provide data sufficient to demonstrate to City officials that:
             a.       The developer has provided a written schedule for completing the project in a
                      reasonable time period;
             b.       Adequate long-term management of the project has been provided for vis-a-vis
                      operating Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions (CC&R's) or other similar
                      maintenance agreements; and
             a.       The applicant/end user shall participate with the Alameda County Training and
                      Employment Board.
LU-D.4.2     The City should approve projects based on its determination that the mix of uses can provide
             greater revenue than service costs and an "elastic" revenue stream to the City. That is, the mix
             of uses should be such that given changing economic times the income to the City can remain
             relatively constant, including fulfilling reasonable expectations with regard to income growth.
LU-D.4.3     The City should require that each development proposal where an end user is not an applicant
             be accompanied by a specific and professionally-prepared marketing plan. This plan should
             show how the developer intends to market the project to tenants, and market the tenants and
             activities to the public. Where the development is intended to include a free-standing
             fast-food restaurant, a use permit application shall only be accepted by the City when located
             in the Community Commercial area and the end-user has been identified.
                Goal        To encourage unified development of Union Landing to achieve coordinated
                LU-D.5      improvements and interconnections between development types.
             Policies
LU-D.5.1     The City shall require all public improvements required for a project to be constructed to the
             standards necessary to meet the needs for full development of the entire Union Landing.
LU-D.5.2     The City shall require that all public improvements needed to serve full development of the
             area be paid for proportionally by all area developers based on the implementation program
             LU-D.1.
LU-30                                                                                                      February 2002
City of Union City                                                                     Land Use Element
LU-D.5.3       If necessary to assemble enough land for a viable project, and/or eliminate existing
               undesirable uses, the City should apply its redevelopment powers, including eminent domain,
               to the extent possible. Such actions should only be taken if landowners refuse to cooperate.
LU-D.5.4       When appropriate, the City should use its redevelopment powers to provide capital
               improvements and otherwise facilitate site development.
                Goal         To identify and, to the greatest extent possible, minimize the potential adverse
                LU-D.6       effects of development in Union Landing on surrounding areas.
               Policies
LU-D.6.1       The City shall require traffic circulation, road widening, and other street improvements
               (especially to streets surrounding Union Landing) to have a minimum adverse effect on
               adjoining properties and neighborhoods.
LU-D.6.2       The City should encourage all development projects to provide adequate private security
               services.
LU-D.6.3       The City shall require all development to be designed to incorporate the best available
               technology for fire safety.
LU-D.6.4       The City shall carefully consider the impacts of noise from I-880 in siting development and in
               the design of buildings.
LU-D.6.5       The City shall require that the impacts of light and glare from new development on adjacent
               residential areas be minimized.
LU-D.6.6       The City shall require that adequate finished grade elevations be provided to protect
               development from flood hazards.
LU-D.6.7       The City shall seek to continuously improve parking and circulation within Union Landing,
               including, but not limited to, modifying parking lot circulation, exploring the need for a
               parking garage, and supporting valet parking in the theater center.
                Goal         To allow the development of various forms of commercial activities
                LU-D.7       recognizing changing market conditions while organizing these activities into
                             distinctive areas within Union Landing.
               Policies
LU-D.7.1       The City shall allow the following five types of commercial development in Union Landing:
               a.       Sub-Regional Commercial -
               Subregional commercial developments shall provide commercial acreage for large-scale
               general retailers and big-box retail centers designed to attract shoppers from a wide market
               area, including from areas outside the City. Subregional commercial developments shall be
               identified by the inclusion of one or more large-scale, single-tenant retail buildings of over one
               hundred thousand square feet in floor area. Subregional commercial developments shall have
February 2002                                                                                   LU-31
Land Use Element                                                                                        City of Union City
              the ability to draw shoppers from multiple trade areas by providing a wide variety of products
              and merchandise not typically found in local neighborhood commercial establishments. Such
              variety may be achieved by the development of adjoining groups of two or more large-scale
              general retailers or big-box retail centers or through the development of a wide breadth of
              smaller, specialized retail stores that feature products with broad, multi-area appeal adjacent to
              a single or small collection of large-scale anchor stores. The sub-regional commercial
              development type should be organized in an area of at least 20 acres in size to provide for
              large-scaled and smaller retail uses developed within individual buildings. High quality design
              and architectural detail is expected from this type of development. It is critical that this form
              of development be situated in such a manner to take advantage of good visibility from I-880 as
              well as access from the freeway interchanges at Whipple and Alvarado-Niles Roads. Thus,
              this development type should be located either at the northern end of The Union Landing
              District or at the eastern end with good access to Dyer Street and/or Alvarado- Niles Road.
              b.       Sub-Regional Specialty Commercial -
              Subregional specialty commercial developments shall provide a variety of specialized
              commercial uses which shall attract shoppers from a subregional market area, including from
              areas outside of the City. Subregional specialty commercial developments should provide a
              mix of retail in a development design that emphasizes pedestrian access, high-quality design
              and the promotion of subregional drawing power. Such drawing power may be created, in
              part, through the promotion of novel, unique, or uncommon products not normally found in
              local neighborhood commercial establishments. Single-use developments such as an indoor
              multiplex theater or hotel may also be considered under this development type provided that
              the project is located and designed in such a way as to complement adjacent pedestrian-
              oriented commercial development. This type of development, which should be clustered in an
              area of at least 15 acres, is intended for a variety of uses in an environment that emphasizes
              pedestrian access and high quality design. This development type needs to take advantage of
              good access from arterials such as Dyer Street or Alvarado-Niles Road. Freeway visibility is
              not as critical for this development type as for others. As a result, appropriate locations for this
              form of development would be either on the eastern, central or southern portion of The Union
              Landing District.
              c.       Community Commercial -
              Community commercial development shall provide high-quality designed, pedestrian-oriented
              centers with uses serving the everyday needs of those who live or work in Union City. Such
              development should provide uses which complement rather than compete with other
              community centers in Union City. As a result, the City shall favor services and business types
              that would add to Union Landing's image as a premier regional or subregional center. This
              type of development shall be situated on the Syufy property at the intersection of Dyer Street
              and Alvarado-Niles Road, and extend up to the east side of Union Landing Boulevard
              including the gas station parcel, the transit center parcel and the In-N-Out fast food restaurant.
              Other locations in The Union Landing District shall be developed for other development types
              specified in this policy.
              d.       Office Commercial -
              This development type is intended to allow office buildings within a specific area so that
              office uses may contribute to the Union Landing District but not encroach into prime retail
              areas. An office cluster is identified at the corner of Union Landing Boulevard and Alvarado-
LU-32                                                                                                        February 2002
City of Union City                                                                    Land Use Element
                Niles Road which will preserve the development opportunities for the regional, subregional
                and community commercial activity areas.
LU-D.7.2        The City shall consider the use of "pad" commercial development. Pads are a form of
                development intended to provide opportunities for smaller, stand-alone commercial uses on
                individual parcels. Pads are typically located at the periphery of a development on parcels of
                two acres or less. This type of use is considered ancillary and should only be proposed in
                conjunction with a comprehensive development plan.
LU-D.7.3        There should be no further spread of Community Commercial in Union Landing beyond
                the currently designated area.
LU-D.7.4        To maintain flexibility and maximize the utilization of the area, the City shall require that
                ancillary types of development including office and "pad" commercial development be

              E. INTERNATIONAL MARKET PLACE
              The Economic Development Strategy identified the demand for additional commercial
              services in the western half of the city. During General Plan Update workshops, the
              community informed the City that they wanted to enhance the existing commercial centers,
              rather than build additional ones. The Four Corners area was identified as an opportunity site
              for increasing commercial services for the community and ethnic specialty foods.
              The International Market Place (formally known as Four Corners) district includes parcels
              located on all four corners of Alvarado Boulevard and Dyers Street. There are 27.4 acres with
              286,400 square feet of development zoned for community commercial uses. Densities reflect
              the standards of the 1970s suburbs with a low floor area ratio (0.24).
              The City’s objective for the International Market Place emphasizes a commercial "density
              node" which will function as a community town center for Union City's west side. This would
              include a higher floor area ratio for commercial development and could increase the amount of
              commercial space by as much as 20,000 square feet. In addition, this area would add up to
              20,000 square feet of public facility uses.
               Goal            To redevelop the Four Corners commercial center as the new International
               LU-E.1          Market Place with new commercial services and an emphasis on ethnic

                F. MISSION BOULEVARD
                Mission Boulevard is a traditional community service area and gateway district to Union City.
                The area has served the Decoto neighborhood and passersby for several decades.
                The area currently has about 66,000 square feet of development at a very low
                density/intensity. Overall objectives for the Mission Boulevard include intensifying
                community commercial services and enhancing the image of the district. The City’s approach
                assumes there will be a proactive effort to increase the density and energy along Mission
                Boulevard. It assumes the area will be redeveloped as a mixed-use commercial and residential
                district with 35,627 square feet of new commercial space and approximately 120 new
                dwelling units.

                G. UNION CITY BOULEVARD
                The Union City Boulevard area between Old Alvarado and Whipple Road has about 55 acres
                of land, most of which is developed with warehouse and industrial uses. As of November
                2000, there was about 912,300 square feet of development in the area at an average floor area
                ratio of 0.32. There are approximately eight acres that are vacant.
                The City intends to develop/redevelop this area as a street-oriented, light industrial, business
                district with more intensive uses. The City’s goal is to emphasize higher job density through
                warehouse conversion to flex space, infill commercial development, and design a more
                deliberate connection to Union City Boulevard as a business address.
                Development/redevelopment of this area has the potential to produce an additional 115,399
                square feet of light industry/R&D through the conversion of warehouse to flex space and an
                additional 46,260 square feet of commercial through infill, both of which could create a total
                of 1,532 new jobs. The City would also like to create stronger linkages to Old Alvarado as a
                commercial service amenity/center.

                    (updated April 28, 2009, AG-01-09)
      The Horner/Veasy Area lies within the Redevelopment Project Area and consists of approximately 19-
      acres of underutilized land (including two acres of public streets) on the west side of Union City north
      of the Union Sanitary District (USD) Plant. The Area is bounded by the Alameda County Flood
      Control District dredging basin on the north, Whipple Road on the East, Benson Road on the South,
      and Old Alameda Creek on the West.
      The Horner/Veasy Area is currently developed with a mix of industrial uses and existing non-
      conforming single family residences. The City’s vision of the Horner/Veasy Area is a job-intensive and
      revenue enhancing light industrial/manufacturing area. The Horner/Veasy Area varies from that of the
      City’s other industrial parks due to its limited size and parcel configuration. The Horner/Veasy Area is
      less suited for warehouse/distribution uses, which require larger parcel configurations than the
      Horner/Veasy Area offers.
LU-38                                                                                                     February 2002

City of Union City                                                                        Land Use Element
The Horner/Veasy Area is best suited for light industrial/manufacturing uses, which can be accommodated by
free standing buildings on multiple parcels or a cluster of multi-tenant industrial buildings on a single,
consolidated parcel. The City’s vision for successful infill development of the Horner/Veasy Area integrates
land use, infrastructure and economic factors to promote productive development on vacant and underutilized
sites.
The Horner/Veasy Area faces significant physical and infrastructure challenges to future development.
Currently, Benson Road, Horner Street and Veasy Street are unimproved public roads that lack curbs, gutters,
sidewalks, and drainage improvements. Preliminary environmental assessments have indicated that the
Horner/Veasy area may have contaminated soil. The Horner/Veasy Area lies within a California Seismic Hazard
Zone identified as having the potential for liquefaction. The Area is also located in a Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) Special Flood Hazard Area, which is subject to inundation from the 100-year
flood. Based on current FEMA flood elevations, imported soil would be required to bring development sites out
of the 100-year flood plain. The Alameda County Flood Control Water Conservation District (ACFCWCD)
recently stated its intentions to rebuild a levee along the San Francisco Bay along bayfront stretching from
Hayward on the north to Alameda Creek to the south by 2013. If completed to a sufficient height, the rebuilt
levee could effectively remove this area out of the designated flood zone.
The ACFCWCD facilities along Whipple and Benson Roads are at capacity, and the District has indicated that
no additional storm water run-off from the Horner/Veasy Area can enter the drainage canals along Whipple and
Benson Roads. Runoff must be retained on site or pumped into the Old Alameda Creek. To facilitate future
development, a storm drain pump will likely be required to deliver storm drainage runoff through the new levee
to Old Alameda Creek on the westerly boundary of the Horner/Veasy Area.
The City supports a unified plan concept to transform the underutilized Horner/Veasy Area into a job intensive
light industrial development. Overcoming the significant engineering challenges in the Area, which include but
are not limited to, lack of utilities, soil conditions, likely contamination, potential for flooding, and drainage
constraints, will be significantly more difficult and more expensive for individual property owners to accomplish
than under a unified plan. The unified plan concept could result in significant cost savings over a multiple
developer scenario and would allow for greater flexibility in determining site layout and the development
potential of the Horner/Veasy Area. For example, under a unified plan concept, the City could consider
abandoning Horner Street and Veasy Street in favor of private roads and driveways, which would create two
additional acres of developable land.
Complementing land use and infrastructure improvements, revenue enhancing uses are a consideration in
achieving productive infill development in the Horner/Veasy Area.
                        Goal              To encourage light industrial/manufacturing uses that are compatible

                 with City and utility provider standards.
LU-H.2.8         The City may assist property owners to form a benefit district to finance the cost of
                 improvements and infrastructure in the area and necessary off-site improvements.
LU-H.2.9         As part of a unified plan, the City may consider abandoning public roads, when possible,
                 in favor of private roadways to facilitate a more efficient land plan; however, the City shall
                 require that access to the Union Sanitary District gate on Veasy Street be maintained.
LU-H.2.10        The City shall coordinate with the Alameda County Flood Control and Water
                 Conservation District and require new development and major modifications to existing
                 development to adequately address site run-off.

LU-H.2.11           In the likely event that a storm water pump station is needed to facilitate future
                    development, the City shall require that it be privately owned and maintained, if feasible.
LU-H.2.12           The City shall require that adequate finished grade elevations be provided to protect
                    structures from flood hazards.
LU-H.2.13           The City shall coordinate with the Union Sanitary District on their future expansion plans.

                I. CALTRANS PROPERTY
                The 35-acre Caltrans Property is located south of Alvarado-Niles Road on the eastern end of
                the city. The City recognizes this site as an important future gateway and potential open space
                resource and would like to develop the site with residential and recreational uses. There is a
                tremendous opportunity to develop the park so that it could complement Quarry Lakes and
                extend into Fremont. Some portion of the land would also be developed as single-family
                residential. The availability of the Caltrans property is dependent on the construction and
                configuration of Route 84 connections to Union City.
February 2002                                                                                LU-41
Land Use Element                                                                                       City of Union City
               Goal         To create a community park site that serves as a gateway to Union City along
               LU-I.1       Route 84.
              Policies
LU-I.1.1      The City shall make efforts to purchase the Caltrans property and expand Arroyo Park.
LU-I.1.2      The City shall ensure that Arroyo Park is functionally linked to Quarry Lakes (in the city of
              Fremont) by park and open space areas along Alameda Creek.
LU-I.1.3      The City shall strive to design the park so that it buffers residential uses from State Route 84
              and provides recreation facilities to serve the neighborhood and the community as space
              allows.
LU-I.1.4      The City shall allow single-family residential to develop on the remainder of the Caltrans
              property, if any, that is not utilized for park or SR 84.
              J. HILLSIDE AREA
              The Hillside Area, consisting of roughly 6,100 acres to the north and east of Mission
              Boulevard in Union City, and approximately 1,000 acres in an adjacent area in Fremont, is
              largely undeveloped and located at the edge of existing urban development. The area’s
              development is guided and regulated by the Hillside Area Plan, adopted on July 25, 1995. The
              area includes the East Bay Regional Park District’s Dry Creek Pioneer Regional Park. The
              Plan area within Union City was the subject of the City’s Measure B, passed by Union City
              voters in 1989 which required the preparation of an Area Plan. The Plan implements the goals
              of Measure B which include the following: establishing a density limit for development;
              preserving the area’s natural appearance; encouraging the continuation of agricultural uses;
              preserving critical natural ecological systems; protecting the watershed; identifying and
              preserving archaeological, historical, and cultural resources; providing a continuous flow of
              open space; encouraging cluster development that harmonious with the natural environment;
              providing high quality residential housing; providing adequate city services; providing general
              guidelines and standards for reviewing any development; requiring developers to pay their fair
              share of on-site and off-site costs; and ensuring traffic from new development does not
              overburden streets in the area.
              The Area Plan is primarily a policy document with policies that guide land use, circulation,
              municipal service provision, and resource preservation in the Hillside area. The policies of
              this Plan were incorporated into the Union City General Plan.
              The planning process for the Hillside Area is iterative, which means that several phases of
              planning will occur before development occurs in the area. Measure B requires that a Specific
              Plan be prepared prior to any development that takes place in portions of the Hillside Area that
              were designated for agriculture at the time the Measure was adopted. At that time, some of
              the policies in this Area Plan may need to be re-evaluated in accordance with the additional
              level of detail that the Specific Plan process will include.
              As a result, specific densities for development in the development areas and the environmental
              review for the Area Plan does not include site specific analysis of environmental factors.
              These steps will be completed during the future Specific Plan process.

City of Union City                                                                   Land Use Element
                Following the passing of Measure B, the people of the city of Union City voted for and passed
                another ballot measure -Measure II- in November 1996 that ensures that the development
                policies of the Hillside Area Plan may not be changed without a public debate and a vote of
                the people of Union City. The 53 development policies that appear in the Hillside Area Plan
                are protected from any amendment or appeal by the City Council. This measure seeks to
                prevent transitory short-term decisions that may jeopardize the original intent of the Hillside
                Area Plan, which is to protect the hillside area from environmentally-destructive hillside
                development.
                 Goal         To provide for the orderly development of the Hillside Area that protects and
                 LU-J.1       enhances the area’s natural resources.
                Policies
LU-J.1.1        The City shall allow development of the Hillside Area according to the Hillside Area Plan
                policies listed in Appendix B.
                K. ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
                The effectiveness of the General Plan ultimately depends on how it is implemented and
                maintained over time. State law requires that most actions of local governments affecting the
                physical environment be consistent with the general plan, and sets out guidelines for the plan’s
                monitoring, updating, and amendment.
                The following section contains goals, policies, and implementation programs to ensure that the
                City of Union City maintains a high level of attention to the General Plan by providing for
                routine review and update of the Policy Document and Background Report and ensuring that
                other City regulations and ordinances are consistent with the General Plan.
                 Goal          To provide for the ongoing administration and implementation of the General
                 LU-K.1        Plan.
                Policies
LU-K.1.1        The City shall review and amend, as necessary, applicable ordinances and regulations to
                ensure consistency with the General Plan.
LU-K.1.2        The City shall review the General Plan annually and amend it as deemed necessary.
LU-K.1.3        The City shall not amend the General Plan more than four times per year. Each
                amendment, however, may include multiple changes. Any amendments require Planning
                Commission and City Council public hearings.

NATURAL AND HISTORICAL RESOURCES
                              ELEMENT
   INTRODUCTION
   Union City is surrounded by a diverse and unique mix of natural resources ranging from
   beautiful hills to salt marshes and meandering creeks. These resources are fundamental in
   defining the character and future growth patterns of Union City. In addition, the city has
   a network of recreational and historical resources. It is critical that these resources are
   recognized and preserved for the purposes of educating the public and retaining the
   character of Union City.
   The purpose of this Element is to protect and enhance the natural and historical resources
   that make Union City a unique place. This element includes a summary of existing
   conditions and a description of the goals, policies, and implementation measures designed
   to address the following subjects: biological resources, water resources, historic resources,
   and open space preservation.
   Information on water supply and storm drainage is contained in the Public Facilities and
   Services Element.
   A. BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
   Union City has a variety of plant and wildlife that includes 12 special status plant species
   and 13 special status wildlife species. The species can be found along the wetland areas
   on the western fringe of the city, along the eastern hillsides, and among habitat interwoven
   through urban development.
   Along Dry Creek on the Meyers property
   (now East Bay Regional Park land) and near
   Whipple Road, in the northern part of the
   planning area, and along the small creek that
   runs near Smith Street and Dyer Street, there
   is riparian habitat (e.g., oaks, box elder, and
   willows). Other areas of riparian habitat (e.g.,
   elderberry shrubs, pepper trees, box elders,
   and willows) border a small drainage east of
   I-880. These communities are               also
   considered sensitive natural communities by
                                                      Gates to the Meyer property on May Road,
   the California Department of Fish and Game
                                                      above Mission Boulevard
   (DFG).
Natural and Historical Resources Element                                                  City of Union City
               Freshwater marshes consisting of young willows and cattails occur near Alvarado-Niles
               Road and the Alameda Creek area. Freshwater marshes and wetlands have water at or near
               the surface, have soils differing from those of adjacent uplands, and vegetation adapted to
               wet conditions. Often, freshwater wetlands can be important waterfowl habitat. Terns are
               among the wildlife present at this location. On Dry Creek, wildlife such as robins can be
               observed. Swallows are present under bridges along this creek, where they potentially nest.
               Wetlands are subject to Corps jurisdiction under section 404 of the Clean Water Act
               (CWA). In addition, DFG has adopted a no-net-loss policy for wetlands.
               Areas of non-freshwater marsh are located in the western part of the city boundary, near
               salt evaporators. Swallows, terns, stilts, and red-winged blackbirds are a few of the species
               found in this habitat. In the northwestern part of the Planning Area, there are salt-influenced
               seasonal wetlands, with vegetation such as pickleweed. Pickleweed is considered potential
               habitat for the Federally-endangered salt marsh harvest mouse. Other salt-influenced
               wetlands are found in the northwestern portion of the City's Planning Area.
               The eastern part of the Planning Area is characterized by non-native annual grasslands.
               Non-native grasslands can host threatened species and species of special concern, such as
               the burrowing owl, the red-legged frog and the Alameda whipsnake.
                 Goal           To protect, restore, and enhance important biological habitats and their
                 NHR-A.1        associated plant, wildlife, and fish species throughout Union City and to
                                educate people as to this need.
               Policies
NHR-A.1.1      The City shall define the following as sensitive
               habitat areas: riparian woodland and scrub,
               freshwater marsh/wetland areas, non-freshwater
               marsh/wetland areas, and grassland areas.
NHR-A.1.2      The City shall maintain information on
               biological resources in the Planning Area,
               including maps that identify the locations of
               environmentally-sensitive habitats and special
               status species as reported to the City or
               available from information published by               West side of Turk Island
               regulatory agencies. This information shall be
               used by the City to inform and guide review of
               proposed development.
NHR-A.1.3      On sites that have the potential to contain critical or sensitive habitats, or special-species,
               or are within 100 feet of such areas, the City shall require the project applicant to survey
               the site by a qualified biologist at the proper time of year. A report of the findings of this
               survey shall be submitted to the city as part of the application process. Appropriate

NHR-A.1.4       On sites with the potential to contain wetland resources, the City shall require that a
                wetland delineation be prepared using the protocol defined by the U.S. Army Corps of
                Engineers. The applicant shall submit a report on the findings of this survey to the City as
                part of the application process. Appropriate mitigation measures will be incorporated into
                the project as necessary to protect the resources.
NHR-A.1.5       Any proposal that would create new parcels or lots shall demonstrate that the resulting
                parcels/lots provide adequate building space outside of critical biological areas and areas
                inhabited by special-status species.
NHR-A.1.6       The City shall cooperate actively in regional efforts to restore wetlands ecology and stream
                and river resources.
NHR-A.1.7       The City shall cooperate with other public agencies and organizations to acquire
                conservation easements on privately-owned lands in order to preserve important wildlife
                corridors and to provide protection of State or Federal special-status species and the
                habitats they occupy and use.
NHR-A.1.8       The City shall work to inform and educate the public about the natural resources in the city
                and the steps that can be taken to help protect, enhance, restore, and enjoy these resources.

                residents.
NHR-A.1.11      The City shall create compatible points of access for the public to view and understand the
                importance of the ecosystems of the hills and wetlands.
NHR-A.1.12      The City shall provide signage and strategically locate fences to prevent humans and
                dogs from adversely affecting wetlands.
NHR-A.1.13      The City shall continue to require a burrowing owl study on all development projects that
                incorporate vacant, unpaved parcels, or parcels adjacent to possible owl habitat.
NHR-A.1.14      The City shall encourage the Alameda County
                Flood Control District to enhance the viability
                of habitat areas along the city’s creek system
                by restoring the natural vegetation and

               B. WATER RESOURCES
               Within Union City, groundwater resources are used to supply 75 percent of the water used
               in the City. This groundwater comes from a single groundwater basin called the Niles
               Cone. It is critical that the City protects this vital resource from contamination and that the
               City protects the watershed areas that recharge this groundwater basin. In addition to
               groundwater resources, it is also imperative that the City protect surface water from
               sedimentation and other contaminants.
                Goal             To protect and enhance the natural qualities of Union City’s
                NHR-B.1          groundwater, surface water, and streams, and to ensure sufficient water
                                 supplies of good quality for all beneficial uses.
               Policies
NHR-B.1.1      The City shall work with Alameda County Flood
               Control in an effort to ensure protection of the
               natural conditions along stream and creek
               corridors.
               a.      In areas already disturbed, efforts should
                       be made to restore the natural character
                       to the extent possible.
               b.      The development of trails along the
                       corridors should be encouraged, and               Dry Creek channel with pedestrian
                       streamside rest areas should be provided          path beyond
                       that include indigenous streamside
                       vegetation.
               c.      New projects for flood and erosion control should be designed to preserve the
                       natural creekside condition where possible. Alteration of streambeds and adjacent
                       vegetation is to be permitted only as a means of erosion or flood control as
                       permitted by the City and in such a manner as to enhance the area within the city.

City of Union City                                             Natural and Historical Resources Element
NHR-B.1.2       The City shall require that an erosion control plan be prepared and approved prior to the
                issuance of a grading permit. This plan shall be prepared in keeping with standards for
                non-point source pollutants applied by the Regional Water Quality Control Board.
NHR-B.1.3       The City shall take or encourage actions to protect the Niles Cone water-bearing aquifers.
                Particular attention shall be paid to the use of recharge wells, salt water barriers, and
                importation of water necessary to maintain the water levels at surface elevations adequate
                to prevent salt water intrusion. Efforts should ensure maximum opportunity for surface
                runoff to recharge groundwater basins, including the use of checkdams, ponding, or
                retention basins, where compatible with policies for stream and creek protection.
NHR-B.1.4       The City shall evaluate public and private development projects, including golf courses, to
                determine the effects of the projects on on-site and downstream drainage patterns and
                associated ecological systems. Larger projects may require on-site detention or retention
                facilities, or other permanent filtration systems to maintain existing storm flows and
                velocities in natural drainage systems and allow for enhanced infiltration.
NHR-B.1.5       Within its authority, the City shall ensure that flood control facilities built in natural areas
                be designed to use "soft" channel structures (i.e., avoid lined channels and culverts) that
                maintain to the greatest extent possible natural vegetation and infiltration.
NHR- B.1.6      The City shall ensure, through review and inspection, that erosion control is being handled
                correctly on construction sites.
NHR-B.1.7       The City shall encourage the use of state-of-the-art treated effluent to water parks, school
                grounds, and golf courses.
NHR-B.1.8       The City shall evaluate proposed projects to ensure that impermeable surfaces are
                minimized.
NHR-B.1.9       The City shall encourage the use of earthen drainage swales to manage on-site drainage and
                permeable surfaces for walkways and private driveways and patios.
                Implementation Programs
NHR-B.1         The City shall continue to update and review the water conservation standards for

               developments and new areas with large landscaped areas (such as parks and golf courses).
               In areas where reclaimed water can be provided in the future, the City shall require
               landscape irrigation to be installed so that the system could be used with reclaimed water
               (i.e., dual piping).

               Union City has a number of historic properties that provide an important link in
               reconstructing the City’s past. The City completed an inventory (i.e., Union City Cultural
               Resources Survey) of historical resources. The City has begun the process of designating
               certain sites as local historic properties.
                Goal             To protect, to the extent possible, the City’s significant archeological
                NHR-C.1          and historical resources.
               Policies

               D. OPEN SPACE PRESERVATION
               For the purposes of the General Plan, open
               space is defined as all of the space above the
               surface of the earth or water which is not
               occupied by structures or man-made
               impervious surfaces. Open space, therefore,
               is three-dimensional. Its boundaries are
               defined by land forms, prominent vegetation,
               and buildings and other structures. The
               concept of three-dimensionality is important
               in Union City where the open space
               experiences vary from the eastern hillsides to
               the flatlands of the Bay plain. The policies in    Kennedy Park
               this section call for protecting and enhancing
               open spaces within the Planning Area and
               the quality of views to and from them.
                Goal              To provide for a continuous system of open spaces for the preservation,
                NHR-D.1           enhancement and protection of open space land.
               Policies
NHR-D.1.1      The City shall integrate, wherever possible, the local open space system with the open
               space systems of nearby communities and the region.
NHR-D.1.2      The City shall maintain open space areas to guide the form of urban development and to
               establish open space between incompatible land uses.
NHR-D.1.3      The City shall provide adequate open space within existing and proposed urban use areas
               and relate the open space to those areas so as to enhance living conditions in the entire city.
NHR-D.1.4      The City shall establish priorities for the acquisition and protection of open space.
NHR-D.1.5      The City shall explore various methods for protecting open space resources including, but
               not limited to, regulation, full acquisition, transfer of development rights, and less than fee
               purchase.
NHR-8                                                                                         February 2002

NHR-D.1.6       The City shall identify areas to be maintained as open space and relate such areas to the
                open space plans and proposals of adjacent jurisdictions.
NHR-D.1.7       The City shall provide a legal basis for retaining open spaces through means that will be
                economically feasible for public and private interests.
NHR-D.1.8       The City shall evaluate all development
                projects in terms of open space qualities.
                All identified significant open space
                resources (i.e., habitat for wildlife and rare,
                threatened, or endangered plant species,
                etc.) will, where feasible, be protected or
                avoided through conditions of approval and
                project design. Removal of vegetation
                should be minimized, and replanting
                required to maintain soil stability, prevent
                erosion, and maximize regeneration.
                                                                Hillsides of east Mission Boulevard
                a.       Existing wildlife habitats should be protected in a natural and undeveloped state
                         as part of open space areas and as a means of preserving and attracting wildlife.
                         Depleted habitats adaptable to restoration should also be included as open space.
                b.       Only limited development will be allowed within designated open space areas.
                         Development of an open space area will be permitted only in select areas and will
                         be limited to facilities needed in conjunction with low density recreational areas
                         or select public facilities.
NHR-D.1.9       The City shall protect major visual features, such as ridgelines and valley sides in the
                eastern hillsides and the critical wetland areas at the western end of the city through
                regulation or public acquisition of fee title or lesser interest.
NHR-D.1.10      The City shall require new development to incorporate nearby and distant open space views
                into the project design. Landscaped open space shall be included in new developments,
                including in commercial and industrial areas and along streets and trails. Use of
                drought-tolerant landscaping shall be encouraged in site development review. Specimen
                trees and significant stands of existing trees will be protected to the extent possible in the
                design of new development.
NHR-D.1.11      The City shall designate areas that are potentially hazardous to public health and safety, in
                relation to the development of occupied structures, as open space. Areas that fall into this
                category include:
                a.       Areas of geologic instability.
                b.       The 960-foot buffer area between Union Sanitary District Treatment Plant and the

               b.       Open space;
               c.       Flood control management;
               d.       Passive recreation in a natural or near-natural state;
               e.       Active recreation areas where public health and safety can be adequately protected
                        for the types of uses proposed.
NHR-D.1.12     When in the public interest, the City will seek funds for the acquisition of open space,
               either in fee or as an easement, from Federal, State, and other governmental sources, as well
               as private sources. Where appropriate, conservation or open space easements will be
               required of new development in order to protect unique natural features or other
               environmentally significant resources identified during CEQA review, such as steep
               hillsides, natural stream courses, or unique plant of animal community or habitats.
NHR-D.1.13     The City shall strive to separate incompatible uses in new developments with open space.
               Incompatible uses include residential and industrial uses. Open space may be in the form
               of a park, landscaped greenbelt, or natural corridor.
NHR-D.1.14     In designated open space areas, the man-made structures shall be subordinate to and not
               conflict with the quality of the open space. The City shall prohibit inappropriate uses of
               open space (i.e., off-road motorized vehicles) to prevent environmental damage and
               preserve the quality of the open space. Further, grading, tree removal or other disturbance
               within designated open space areas
               shall only be permitted when plans for
               such activities have been approved by
               the City and found necessary for
               protection or enhancement of the open
               space, or to provide for safe and
               enjoyable public use of the open space
               resource.
NHR-D.1.15     The City shall provide a variety of open
               spaces including open space for public
               use and enjoyment and for the
               protection of agricultural and wildlife     Hillsides as seen from Mission Boulevard
               habitats and scenic vistas.           The
               following are aspects of this policy:
               a.       Within the limits of availability of land, an equitable geographical distribution of
                        open space throughout the city should be provided for the benefit of all residents
                        of the city.

                        accessible open space should be utilized for leisure time facilities.
                d.      Observation areas with outstanding vistas are to be included as permanent elements
                        of the open space plan and be coordinated with hiking trails.
NHR-D.1.16      The City shall protect open space from intrusion by public projects.
                a.      Planned open space is to be protected from intrusion by massive public works
                        projects such as freeways and utility systems wherever possible. When protection
                        is not possible, such projects shall be designed to permit compatible recreational
                        development.
                b.      Public utilities should be consolidated and located to avoid scenic areas. Wherever
                        feasible, power and pipe utility lines should be consolidated to prevent further
                        severance of the open space. Utility lines and pipelines in open space areas should
                        be located so as to permanently avoid marring areas of outstanding beauty.
NHR-D.1.17      The City shall permit amendments from agricultural designations especially upon

   PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES ELEMENT
              INTRODUCTION
              Union City's development and quality of life is dependent on a network of public facilities
              and services. Each type of service has a unique set of constraints and must adapt to growth
              and change differently. Generally, Union City’s public facilities and services will be
              adequate to handle future growth under the General Plan. However, there are several
              facilities/services that may require expansion including: (1) wastewater treatment capacity,
              which is not expected to meet future growth over the lifetime of the General Plan; (2) solid
              waste disposal facility, since the current landfill is nearing capacity; (3) law enforcement,
              which will require an additional staff and facilities; (4) schools, which will likely need
              expansion to meet projected future growth and mandated
              class size reductions; (5) library facilities, which may
              need expansion to keep pace with population growth; (6)
              fire stations, which will require additional staff,
              equipment and facilities as the community continues to
              develop; and (7) City Hall expansion, as the need for
              administering City services grows with the population.
              This element contains goals, policies, and implementation
              programs that establish the framework for the provision of
              public facilities and services to meet the demand created
              by existing and future development in Union City.
              Transportation facilities and services are addressed in the
              Transportation Element and recreation facilities are
              addressed in the Natural and Cultural Resources Element.
                                                                              Ruggieri Senior Center
              A. GENERAL
               Goal              To ensure the timely development of public facilities and the
               PF-A.1            maintenance of adequate service levels for these facilities to meet the
                                 needs of existing and future city residents.
              Policies
PF-A.1.1      The City shall ensure through the development review process that adequate public
              facilities and services are available to serve new development when required. The City
              shall not approve new development where existing facilities are inadequate to support the
              project unless the applicant can demonstrate that all necessary public facilities (including
              water service, sewer service, storm drainage, transportation, police and fire protection
              services) will be installed or adequately financed and maintained (through fees, special
              taxes, assessments, or other mean).
PF-A.1.2      The City shall require all new development and major modifications to existing
              development to construct necessary on-site infrastructure to serve the project in accordance
              with City standards.
February 2002                                                                                         PF-1

PF-A.1.3         When reviewing applications for land use designation changes (i.e., zone change, General
                 Plan Amendment, specific plan amendment), the City shall analyze the impacts of the
                 proposed land use designation changes on all aspects of the infrastructure system within
                 the city and require mitigation as legally appropriate. This shall include consultation with
                 other service providers, such as the Alameda County Water District (ACWD) and the
                 Union Sanitary District (USD), who have infrastructure within the city.
PF-A.1.4         The City shall ensure that the provision of streets, sewer, water, drainage and other needed
                 infrastructure is coordinated in a logical manner between adjacent developments so as to
                 reduce design, construction and maintenance costs.
PF-A.1.5         The City shall ensure through the development review process that public facilities and
                 infrastructure are designed and constructed to meet ultimate capacity needs, pursuant to a
                 master plan, to avoid the need for costly retrofitting. This does not apply to any
                 infrastructure requirements of the ACWD and the USD.
PF-A.1.6         The City shall consider applying Federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
                 funds for child care facility construction.

                  PF-B.1            maintained through the use of equitable funding methods.
                 Policies
PF-B.1.1         The City shall review its Capital Facilities Fee (Residential Impact Fee) annually and adjust
                 the fee as allowed by the Zoning Ordinance to provide adequate public facilities and
                 services.
PF-B.1.2         The City will identify and pursue alternative funding sources, including grant funding, that
                 can be used for capital improvement project construction, staffing, and ongoing
                 maintenance of public improvements.

PF-B.1.3        The City shall require, to the extent legally possible, that new development pays the cost
                of providing new public facilities and services and/or the cost for upgrading all existing
                facilities that are used. Exceptions may be made when new development generates
                significant public benefits (e.g., low-income housing, significant primary wage earner
                employment) and/or when alternative sources of funding can be identified to offset
                foregone revenues.
PF-B.1.4        Where some services are provided by other public entities, such as the Alameda County
                Water District (ACWD) and the Union Sanitary District (USD), the City shall coordinate
                construction efforts with these agencies to provide appropriate levels of service and
                minimize redundant construction costs.
PF-B.1.5        The City shall require all new development or major modifications to existing development,
                to construct or provide a fair share contribution toward the construction of any off-site
                improvements necessary to off-set project impacts and/or support the project.
PF-B.1.6        The City shall plan and design for the expansion of City Hall to accommodate the
                continued expansion of City services.
PF-B.1.7        The City shall acquire 3-D computer modeling capabilities.
PF-B.1.8        The City shall continue to assess all development fees as adopted by the City Council for
                the DIPSA Specific Area Plan area.
PF-B.1.9        The City shall analyze the feasibility of establishing a replacement fund for capital
                equipment, such as fire equipment, dispatch system, etc.
                Implementation Programs
PF- B.1         The City shall annually review and update its development fees to ensure adequate funding
                to deliver and maintain the service levels set out in this General Plan.

                C. WATER SUPPLY
                Water in Union City is provided by the Alameda County Water District (ACWD), which
                stores water in 11 reservoirs and tanks. Of these, Patterson Reservoir (15 million gallons)
                and Decoto Reservoir (15 million gallons) and the Appian Way Tank (750,000 gallons) are
                nearest to Union City. ACWD has two treatment facilities: the Mission San Jose plant,
                southeast of Union City near Fremont, with a capacity of 8.5 million gallons per day, and
                Water Treatment Plant 2, in the same area, with a capacity of 21 million gallons per day.
February 2002                                                                                        PF-3
Public Facilities and Services Element                                                      City of Union City
                 ACWD carries out long-range planning for its service area through the district's Integrated
                 Resources Plan (IRP), which was adopted in 1995. In addition to planning for the
                 continued maintenance of reliable water supply within its service area, the IRP promotes
                 conservation as a significant component. ACWD's goal is that new water supply
                 alternatives and conservation will enable the district to ensure that shortages during a dry
                 year will reach no more than 10 percent.
                 One new water delivery project is planned for the Union City area. ACWD plans to
                 construct Phase 2 of the 24-inch Niles-Decoto pipeline, which would extend from the
                 Nimitz Freeway along Alvarado-Niles Road beyond the Union City limits to Mission
                 Boulevard. The district has also proposed installing several salinity barriers along the
                 western boundary of Union City and farther southward. Any property outside the current
                 city limits would need to be annexed to the ACWD service area before service could be
                 provided.
                    Goal            To ensure that there will be a safe and reliable water supply sufficient
                    PF-C.1          to meet the future needs of the city.
                 Policies
PF-C.1.1         The City shall coordinate its review of development proposals with the ACWD to ensure
                 that new development can be adequately served by the District's water supply system.
PF-C.1.2         With concurrence of the ACWD, water distribution systems are to be interconnected
                 ("looped") wherever feasible to facilitate the reliable delivery of water anywhere in the city.
PF-C.1.3         The City shall only approve new development where an adequate public water supply and
                 conveyance system exists or will be provided by the ACWD.
PF-C.1.4         The City shall promote efficient water use and reduced water demand by:
                 a.       Requiring water-conserving design and equipment in new construction;
                 b.       Encouraging water-conserving landscaping and other conservation measures;
                 c.       Encouraging the retrofitting of existing development with water-conserving
                          devices;
                 d.       Providing public education programs;
                 e.       Distributing outdoor lawn watering guidelines; and
                 f.       Working with ACWD, promote water audit and leak detection programs.
PF-C.1.5         The City shall maintain a regular program for inspecting and testing fire hydrants.
PF-C.1.6         The City shall request the ACWD to periodically inform the City of current system
                 capacity, surplus available to new users, and service or capacity increases (scheduled or
                 anticipated to be scheduled).

                The City shall work with the ACWD to develop a list of water conservation technologies,
                methods, and practices that maximize the beneficial use of water resources. The City shall
                work with the ACWD in reviewing and updating the list periodically to eliminate practices
                that no longer prove beneficial. New conservation technologies shall be promoted as they
                become available. Where appropriate, the City shall adopt those technologies, methods, and
                practices which are beneficial in the Planning area.

                D.       WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT
                The Union Sanitary District (USD) provides wastewater collection and treatment services
                for Union City and the cities of Fremont and Newark. The total service area is 60.2 square
                miles, with Union City making up 9.9 square miles. USD operates the Alvarado
                Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is located within Union City limits just west of Union
                City Boulevard south of Horner Street. Based on 1997 land use projections, the District has
                sufficient capacity to meet demand. No new projects are identified in USD's 5-year Capital
                Improvement Program, but the district expects to plan for projects in the next 20 years as
                the city approaches buildout.
                  Goal             To ensure adequate wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal.

                 E.       STORMWATER COLLECTION AND DRAINAGE
                 Stormwater collection service in Union City is provided by the City. In general, streets in
                 Union City include storm drainage facilities, with the exception of a few steeply sloped
                 streets in the hills east of Mission Boulevard. All newly constructed housing tracts have
                 storm drains that connect to the City's system. The system is adequate to meet the needs
                 of current development.
                 No major improvements or expansions are planned. Ongoing maintenance has kept the
                 collection and drainage system in good repair.
                  Goal                To collect and dispose of stormwater in a manner that minimizes
                  PF-E.1              inconvenience to the public, minimizes potential water-related damage,
                                      and enhances the environment.

                 F. SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL
                 Waste Management, Inc., provides solid waste collection and disposal services for Union
                 City. Waste is transported to the Tri-Cities Landfill in Fremont, along with solid waste
                 from the cities of Fremont and Newark. The Tri-Cities Landfill is nearing capacity and is
                 expected to close in December 2001. Fremont is considering a possible expansion of the
                 facility or construction of a new waste transfer station. Union City and Newark are
                 awaiting Fremont's decision and will then consider participating in the selected option. No
                 independent solid waste disposal options are being pursued by the City at this time.
                   Goal                To ensure the safe and efficient disposal or recycling of solid waste
                   PF-F.1              generated in Union City in an effort to protect the public health and
                                       safety and reduce impacts on landfills.

                 to use recycled products in their
                 manufacturing processes and
                 consumers to buy recycled products.
PF-F.1.6         The City shall strive to maintain the
                 diversion of 50 percent of all waste

                Natural gas and electrical services to Union City are provided by Pacific Gas and Electric
                Company. In 2000 it became apparent that there would be significant energy shortages
                statewide . Energy prices surged on the wholesale market as demand increased and
                suppliers were required to purchase energy at escalated costs. While the energy issue is
                complex, it is clear that the State will be taking several steps to address the energy shortage.
                Some of the steps to be taken include approving the construction of new power plant
                facilities to increase the power supply, establishing new regulations to encourage
                conservation, and providing incentives for residences and businesses to upgrade structures
                to be more energy efficient. While there are no local capacity restrictions for gas or
                electricity, the City is affected by the statewide shortage of energy.
                  Goal             To promote adequate levels of energy service provided by utility

PF-G.1.2        The City shall promote technological improvements and upgrading of utility services in
                Union City to serve existing and future needs while minimizing noise, electromagnetic, and
                visual impacts on existing and future residents.
PF-G.1.3        The City shall investigate the feasibility of requiring developers to incorporate solar cells
                on new industrial, commercial and parking structures for the purposes of providing
                electrical energy and reducing energy demands.
PF-G.1.4        The City shall develop sustainability guidelines to enable the community to maintain its
                quality of life standards in the long term.

                 I. LAW ENFORCEMENT
                 To accommodate expected growth in Union City, law enforcement facilities and staffing
                 will need to be increased. To accommodate this growth it is expected that 10 new full-time
                 equivalent (FTE) law enforcement personnel and approximately 2,000 square feet of new
                 facilities (200 square feet per FTE law enforcement personnel) would be needed. The
                 existing staffing level is 1.4 FTE personnel per 1,000 population.
                  Goal               To provide adequate law enforcement services to deter crime and to
                  PF-I.1             meet the growing demand for services associated with increasing
                                     populations and commercial/industrial development in the city.
                 Policies
PF-I.1.1         The City Police Department should strive to increase its staffing ratio to be consistent with
                 the current average of cities within Alameda County. Staffing levels for 2001 are 2.1 (1.4
                 sworn officers and .7 non-sworn support staff) per 1,000 population.
PF-I.1.2         The City Police Department should strive to achieve an average response time of four (4)
                 minutes or less for Priority 1 calls, critical life threatening emergencies.
PF-I.1.3         The City should provide police facilities, equipment and personnel sufficient to maintain
                 the above service standards and using new law enforcement technologies.
PF-I.1.4         The City shall consider public safety issues in all aspects of commercial and residential
                 project design, including crime prevention through environmental design.
PF-I.1.5         The City shall continue to implement the Community Oriented Policing and Problem
                 Solving program and philosophy.

                 K. SCHOOLS
                 Educational needs of Union City residents are served by the New Haven Unified School
                 District (NHUSD), which also serves south Hayward. In all, the district has approximately
                 13,300 students attending 13 schools: eight elementary schools serving grades kindergarten
                 through five; three middle schools serving grades 6-8; one high school; and one adult
                 school.
                 The NHUSD recently completed an overall restructuring and master plan based on the City
                 of Union City's buildout projections. As a result, one new elementary school was recently
                 completed ( Delaine Eastin Elementary School) on the west side of Union City Boulevard.
                 This is expected to be the last new school constructed in Union City. In addition to
                 constructing a new school, NHUSD may add a performing arts center to the James Logan
                 High School campus. The facility will provide space for drama and music classes and will
                 also serve as a community resource.
                 In addition to the public schools, several academic private schools operate within the city,
                 including Our Lady of the Rosary, Purple Lotus Society, Semore School, and Union City
                 Christian Academy.
                  Goal               To ensure that adequate school facilities are available and

                L. LIBRARIES
                The Union City branch of the Alameda
                County Library, located in the William
                Cann Civic Center, serves the city and
                the nearby residents outside the city
                limits. As of June 30, 1999, the city had
                20,665 registered borrowers, 90.8
                percent of whom were residents. The
                existing facility was designed to serve a
                population of approximately 50,000,
                well below the current population. The
                service level of the library facility is
                0.24 square feet per capita (12,000
                square feet of space for a design Union City Library
                capacity of 50,000 people). The facility
                is 0.5-0.75 square foot per capita below the current size standard for facilities in the county
                library system. The Capital Facilities Fee Technical Report identifies library expansion as
                a needed project, but no specific project has yet been proposed.

                         TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
INTRODUCTION
A city is both defined and constrained by the network of highways, roads, railroads, sidewalks, trails, and
transit services that move its residents and goods throughout the city. Mobility within Union City is relatively
good compared to many surrounding cities. The General Plan provides for the development of new roadway
connections and the widening and improvement of existing roadways to serve new development. However,
the overall goals of the Transportation Element are to enhance the regional accessibility of Union City through
major transit improvements and to provide alternatives to automobile travel with particular emphasis on the
reduction of single-occupant auto trips. As Union City looks to the future, one key objective will be to
prepare a Transit First policy to respond to the increasing traffic congestion that is inevitable with increased
densities and growth.
The Transportation Element establishes the goals, policies and programs for automobile travel (streets and
highways), public transit, bicycle and pedestrian travel, parking, and goods movement (truck and rail).
CIRCULATION DIAGRAM AND STREET STANDARDS
T his section of the Transportation Element describes the existing street and roadway system and
improvements proposed to the system.
EXISTING ROADWAY SYSTEM AND PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS
The roadway system in Union City can be defined by the functional classification of roadways. The roadway
types range from freeways to six-lane arterials to two-lane local streets. The Circulation Diagram for Union
City is shown on Figure TR-1.
The only freeway in Union City is Interstate 880, which runs north-south as an eight-lane freeway through
the center of the city. The freeway system in Union City is largely built out. There are no new freeways
or interchanges planned within the city limits.
The only new highway projects are the State Route (SR) 84 extension proposed to be constructed on the
eastern side of the City near the Union City/Fremont city limits as shown in Figure TR-1, and the proposed
widening of SR 238 (Mission Boulevard) to six lanes. The SR 84 extension project is a new four- to six-lane
parkway that, when completed, will extend from Mission Boulevard to I-880 in Fremont and to the Dumbarton
Bridge. Also planned is an extension of 11th Street from Decoto Road to the proposed SR 84. These
connections will provide important alternatives for through traffic in the Decoto Road corridor. SR 84 is
planned to have a grade separation at the former Southern Pacific Railroad line and BART/Union Pacific
Railroad line, and will provide regional access to the BART station area. This roadway will clearly strengthen
the development potential of the Station District.

Alvarado Boulevard. All other streets in Union City are classified as collector streets or residential streets
as shown on Figure TR-1.
Table TR-1 identifies the major roadways (arterials) in Union City, including for each the existing number
of lanes, the existing daily traffic (ADT), and the approximate daily capacity. Vehicle capacity is determined
by factors such as the number of lanes, the number and types of intersections, the frequency of driveways
and roadway geometric constraints.
The City plans for minor widening and intersection improvements on arterial roads in Union City along with
three proposed extensions: 11 th Street, Dyer Street, and Lowry Road. Intersection improvements are also
planned for Mission Boulevard (SR 238), Decoto Road, Alvarado-Niles Road, Whipple Road, and Union City
Boulevard. The City is proposing to improve access in the western part of Union City by constructing the
Whipple Road overcrossing. There are also several new traffic signals that are being planned for installation
along various roadways in Union City. Intersection improvements should include but not be limited to 1)
pedestrian friendly light timing (3 ft. per second), 2) signal preemption for buses, police, fire, ambulance, and
3) sound cues for visually impaired people.

City of Union City                                                                        Transportation Element
ROADWAY CLASSIFICATION AND STANDARDS
The City’s roadway network is designed to support the land use development reasonably anticipated under
the Land Use Element of the General Plan and to reserve adequate right-of-way for development beyond
2020. The General Plan seeks to maintain the City’s relatively good traffic flow and operating conditions
while allowing for future growth in the area. The City’s most important policy tool for ensuring that roadways
are properly upgraded and maintained is the roadway classification system and its associated standards.
Roadways serve two functions that conflict from a design standpoint: to provide mobility and to provide
property access. High and constant speeds are desirable for mobility, while low speeds are more desirable
for property access and pedestrian safety, particularly in residential areas. A functional classification system
provides for specialization in meeting the access and mobility requirements of the development that would be
permitted under the General Plan. Local streets emphasize property access; arterials emphasize high mobility
for through traffic; and collectors attempt to achieve a balance between both functions. The hierarchy of the
functional classifications in the City consists of freeways, state highways, arterials, primary collectors,
industrial roadways, residential collectors, and minor residential streets as described below and illustrated in
Figure TR-2.
Freeways
Freeways, such as Interstate 880, are very limited access, high speed travelways that are included in the State
and Federal highway systems. Freeway design standards are established by the California Department of
Transportation. Freeway access is limited to designated interchanges and no direct access is permitted for
any use.
State Highways
State Highways are intended to have limited access and moderate to high travel speeds. In Union City the
only State Highways are Mission Boulevard (SR 238) and proposed SR 84. The right-of-way for Mission
Boulevard is 120 feet with six-foot sidewalks provided. Limited direct access to industrial, commercial, and
high-density residential uses are permitted as approved through a site plan review. Major cross street
intersections are signalized with multiple turn lanes. Otherwise, there is right-turn only access restrictions or
left-turn staging in the median at occasional collector streets. SR 84 will be a four to six lane divided roadway
with separate turn lanes and traffic signals at major intersections. As with Mission Boulevard, SR 84 would
have limited access to industrial, commercial, and residential uses.
Arterials
Arterials are moderate-speed through streets which have various configurations. Average daily traffic on
an arterial usually ranges over 10,000 vehicles per day. Arterials will usually have four to six travel lanes with
separate left-turn lanes. The right of way for these streets should range from 84 to 110 feet. Access to an
arterial should be primarily accomplished through primary collector and residential collector streets. Limited
direct access to industrial, commercial, and high density residential uses are permitted as approved through
a site plan review.

Transportation Element                                                                          City of Union City
Primary Collectors
Primary collector streets are intended to transfer traffic from collector and minor residential streets to an
arterial. Average daily traffic on a primary collector will usually average less than 10,000 vehicles per day.
They normally have a two-lane configuration with six-foot sidewalks and a right-of-way of 68 feet. Primary
collector streets should provide direct linkages to neighborhood shopping areas. Direct access for low-density
residential, commercial, and industrial uses and developments should be permitted consistent with adopted
improvement standards.
Industrial Roadways
Industrial roadways are intended to provide access to industrial uses and developments and to transfer traffic
from collector streets to arterials. Average daily traffic on industrial roadways will usually average less than
10,000 vehicles per day. They normally have a two-lane configuration with five foot sidewalks and a right-of-
way of 64 feet. Direct access should be permitted consistent with adopted improvement standards.
Residential Collectors
Residential collector streets are intended to carry moderate volumes of traffic from local streets to primary
collectors and arterials. Average daily traffic on a residential collector normally averages 500 - 4,000 vehicles
per day. They normally have a two-lane configuration with five-foot sidewalks and a right-of-way of 60 feet.
Direct access should be permitted consistent with adopted improvement standards.
Minor Residential Streets
Minor residential streets are intended to serve as low capacity streets primarily serving low density residential
uses. Average daily traffic on a minor residential street averages less than 1,000 vehicles per day, although
most local street average less than 500 vehicles per day. Minor residential streets should have a two-lane
configuration with a right-of-way of 56 feet, although narrower rights-of-way should be permitted in certain
circumstances such as cul-de-sacs or other places where property constraints exist. Direct access should
be permitted consistent with adopted improvement standards.
Table TR-2 and Figure TR-2 shows the functional hierarchy of streets and street standards for each
functional class in Union City, and Table TR-3 list the roadways falling within each functional class, except
for minor residential streets.
Typical City Street Standards
The City uses the Caltrans specifications for all basic street standards. These typical dimensions are as
follows:
•         Street lane widths - 11-14 feet
•         Striped bicycle lane - 5 feet minimum
•         On-street parking - 7 feet minimum
•         Sidewalks - 5 feet minimum

          Note: Standards for state routes were not included because the standards for such roadways vary extensively.
          A state route could include a narrow two-lane highway or a major arterial, such as Mission Boulevard.

                TRANSPORTATION POLICIES
                Throughout this section, the terms circulation and transportation refer to the movement
                of people by all modes of travel.
                A. STREET AND HIGHWAY SYSTEM
                The existing street system provides the primary means of movement and transportation in
                and through Union City. The existing roadway system in Union City ranges from freeways
                to six-lane arterials to two-lane local streets. The roadway system is intended to provide
                safe, efficient accessibility for residents and businesses while maintaining traffic safety and
                keeping through traffic from using smaller local streets in residential areas.
                This section includes goals, policies, and programs that are intended to improve and maintain
                the citywide network of arterial and collector streets.
                  Goal        To establish a safe, convenient, and efficient roadway system that minimizes
                  TR-A.1      peak hour traffic congestion.
                Policies
TR-A.1.1        The City shall prepare and adopt a Transit First policy to encourage and promote the use of
                public transit and provide alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles.
TR-A.1.2        The City shall monitor traffic flow problems and shall, to the extent feasible, improve
                capacity through improvements such as traffic signals, intersection widening, lane
                configurations, and basic traffic controls.
TR-A 1.3        The City shall continue to implement its policy that traffic Levels of Service (LOS) will not
                exceed mid-range LOS D at all signalized
                intersections on arterial and collector streets,
                with the exception of intersections on major
                regional routes, including I-880, Mission
                Boulevard (SR 238) and the Route 84/Decoto
                Road corridor. Levels of Service are described
                in Table TR-4.
TR-A.1.4        The City shall periodically review the need for
                rail-street grade crossings, and shall construct
                grade separated crossings, such as on Whipple
                Road, Dyer Street, Decoto Road and Alvarado          Union City bus at the BART station
                Boulevard as deemed necessary and financially
                feasible.
TR-8                                                                                                  February 2002
City of Union City                                                                     Transportation Element
TR-A.1.5     The City shall continue its Pavement Management Program to maintain the integrity of the road
             system.
TR-A.1.6     The City shall establish truck routes that will minimize noise impacts and safety hazards on the
             community. The City shall require all new projects in the Central Technology Center to use
             Whipple Road as a truck route. The City shall discourage the use of Alvarado-Niles Road as a
             truck route (see Figure TR-3).
TR-A.1.7     The City shall identify preferred routes for truck service to businesses that are convenient and
             in conformance with A.1.6 above.
TR-A.1.8     The City shall annually review emergency vehicle access on “designated” private property (areas
             required to provide fire and emergency vehic le access) and ensure property management
             maintains these access routes.

                   LEVEL OF SERVICE DEFINITIONS FOR SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS
 The CRITICAL MOVEMENT ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY 1, which is described in Transportation Research Board’s
 Circular 212, defines Level of Service (LOS) for signalized intersections in terms of the ratio of critical movement traffic
 volumes to an estimate of the maximum capacity for critical volume at an intersection. For the Critical Movement
 Methodology the LOS for intersections is determined by the ratio of critical movement volume to critical movement capacity
 (volume-to-capacity ratio = V/C) for the entire intersection. The 1997 HIGHWAY CAPACITY MANUAL2 methodology
 for analyzing signalized intersections measures the performance by the control delay per vehicle in seconds. Six categories
 of LOS are defined, ranging from LOS “A” with minor delay to LOS “F” with delays averaging more than 80 seconds
 during the peak hour.

                V/C Range                               0.71 - 0.80                 occasionally may have to wait through more
                Average Stop Delay (seconds)            20.1 - 35.0                 than one red indication. Acceptable delay.

   While forecast demands can exceed maximum capacity, actual measured volumes theoretically cannot. Since traffic
 inefficiencies arise at capacity demand conditions, the calculated V/C ratios for LOS “F” conditions can be substantially below a
 V/C of 1.00.

                B. PUBLIC TRANSIT AND RAIL SYSTEM
                Union City is served by three bus transit systems, Union City Transit (UC Transit), AC
                Transit, and the Dumbarton Express. UC Transit, as well as the other bus services in the
                area, are closely tied to the Union City BART station. All UC Transit routes, except Route
                5, begin and end at the BART station. Over a third of UC Transit’s system wide boardings
                occur at that location.
                Three rail lines run through Union City (the Mulford line west of I-880 and the Union Pacific
                and former Southern Pacific line east of I-880) and provide service to industrial customers.
                The Capitol Corridor passenger rail travels through Union City on the former Southern
                Pacific line but does not stop.
TR-14                                                                                           February 2002

City of Union City                                                                         Transportation Element
                   The transit system should provide
                   convenient transfers between UC Transit
                   and other modes of travel.             Several
                   improvements are planned for UC Transit,
                   including a proposed transit center at Union
                   Landing to replace the current transfer
                   point at Alvarado Boulevard and Dyer
                   Street. This transit center will provide
                   service for UC Transit, AC Transit and
                   paratransit.
                   There are several planned transit
                   improvements for both rail and bus services
                   in the Station District. The bus transfer Elevated BART tracks on Decoto Road
                   facility is proposed to be expanded to 19
                   bus bays for use by AC Transit, UC Transit and other bus service providers. Facilities will
                   also be provided for paratransit, shuttles, taxis, and auto dropoff and pickup.
                   The Capitol Corridor passenger rail service (Amtrak) is proposed to have a station adjacent
                   to BART on either the former Southern Pacific line or the Union Pacific line. This would
                   be a significant asset to the City, and one of very few BART/Amtrak connections in the Bay
                   Area. Dumbarton Rail, the Altamont Commuter Express (ACE), and the Silicon Valley
                   Rapid Transit Commuter Rail could also make rail connections at BART. Lastly, the
                   California High-Speed Rail Authority has begun its environmental review process to identify
                   appropriate routes for a bullet-type train between the Bay Area and the Los Angeles area.
                   Two of the possible alignments run through the Station District near the intemodal facility
                   area.
                   Given Union City's geographic location between the East Bay and Silicon Valley and the
                   cluster of existing and proposed transit providers, the City has a unique opportunity to
                   become an important regional transit hub. Building an intemodal facility will assist in making
                   this idea a reality. The construction of SR 84 as a four to six-lane parkway through eastern
                   Union City will provide strong regional access to the Station District and future transit
                   improvements around BART.
                   This section includes goals and policies intended to improve and increase the number of
                   existing transit routes, the frequency of service, and the overall level-of-service. The future
                   transit services and facilities in Union City are shown on Figure TR-4.
                     Goal         To provide an efficient, convenient public transportation system for residents

TR-B.1.16          The City shall implement transit improvements recommended in the Union City Short Range
                   Transit Plan to reduce congestion on arterial roadways.
                     Goal             To promote Union City as a major transit hub through development of a
                     TR-B.2           regional intemodal facility.
                   Policies
TR-B.2.1           The City shall take the lead in facilitating development of a regional intemodal facility
                   centered on the existing BART station. The intemodal facility should be a vibrant center of
                   activity with a regional presence that encourages increased transit ridership.
TR-B.2.2           The intermodal facility should be an architectural landmark for the City of Union City and
                   transit providers. It should heighten and improve the experience of using public transit for
                   patrons.
TR-B.2.3           The intermodal facility should be operationally functional, safe, and accessible for all transit
                   providers and transit patrons.
TR-B.2.4           The intermodal facility, including the BART station, should be developed as a double-sided
                   facility that provides clear, convenient, and improved access between the City, the
                   surrounding district, and all transit modes.
TR-B.2.5           The design of the intermodal facility and
                   the Station District should provide sufficient
                   space for all transit modes and transit
                   functions and meet all applicable trans it
                   design standards. Opportunities for shared
                   uses and efficiencies should also be
                   explored.
TR-B.2.6           The design of the intermodal facility should
                   include passenger and transit operator
                   amenities, and incorporate opportunities for
                   joint development or community services
                   where appropriate.
                                                                    Union City BART station
TR-B.2.7           The design of the intermodal facility should
                   anticipate the future expansion of transit services.
TR-B.2.8           The design of the intermodal facility should allow for flexible responses to evolving transit
                   operations.
TR-B.2.9           The intermodal facility should include convenient access to shared parking that has minimal
                   impact on the quality of the pedestrian environment.
February 2002                                                                                                TR-17

TR-B.2.10       The intermodal facility should provide pedestrians and cyclists with safe and direct
                connections to surrounding districts in order to minimize conflicts with automobiles and buses.
TR-B.2.11       The Station District should be easily accessible to other neighborhoods in Union City,
                especially for pedestrians and bicycles.
TR-B.2.12       The Station District should be designed to allow for improved access to the intermodal
                facility for transit providers and patrons.
TR-B.2.13       The City shall ensure that the design of 11th Street and the proposed SR 84 extension support
                the land uses in the Station District.
TR-B.2.14       The City should separate bus traffic, auto traffic and pedestrian traffic to the extent feasible
                at the intermodal facility to ensure safety and on-time performance.
                Implementation Programs
TR-B.1          The City shall implement the biannual Union City Transit Short-Range Transit Plan, including
                route revisions, administrative and operational changes, maintenance and other

                       Union City’s network of sidewalks, trails, and on-street bikeways provide alternatives
                       to automobile travel. Walking and bicycling trips help reduce pollution and traffic
                       congestion, and when linked with transit can provide access to destinations within Union
                       City and regional destinations beyond the City’s limits. Walking and biking facilities also
                       provide recreational opportunities that
                       encourage a healthy lifestyle and
                       contribute to a healthy citizenry. This
                       section includes goals and policies
                       intended to enhance Union City’s
                       bicycle and pedestrian networks, and to
                       promote bicycling and walking as both
                       means of transport and recreation.

        YOUTH, FAMILY, SENIORS, AND HEALTH
                                         ELEMENT
              INTRODUCTION
              Union City has identified services and programs for youth, families and seniors as key to
              the community’s quality of life. Over the past decade, one of Union City’s high priorities
              has been expansion of existing services and development of new programs to meet the
              special needs of its residents. Union City currently has both larger family size relative to
              its neighbors and a large youth population under age 18. In addition, the number of seniors
              is growing. Union City faces unique challenges in sustaining existing programs and
              developing new service and delivery systems. New and expanded services for seniors, such
              as adult daycare, are needed. There is increasing demand for affordable quality childcare,
              especially for infants. Assistance is needed for working families who may care for both
              children and seniors. Union City recognizes the benefit of working in partnership with
              others groups and organizations that provide social services to the community.
              While the need for increased social services grows as the population increases, Union City
              currently (2001) assists several community-based organizations that provide health,
              education and social services, including , but not limited to:
              •        Filipinos for Affirmative Action
              •        Spectrum Community Services
              •        International Institute of the East Bay
              •        Tri-City Homeless Coalition
              •        Shelter Against Violent Environments
              •        City of Fremont Senior Support
              •        Centro de Servicios
              •        Union City Police Activities League
              •        TCCC - Early Intervention Program
              •        TCCC - Teen Parent Program
              •        Tri-City Volunteers
              •        St. Joseph’s Center for the Deaf
              •        Easter Seals/Alzheimer Care
              •        Bay Area Community Services
              •        Life Elder Care
              •        Housing Authority/HOPE Program
              •        Union City Historical Museum
              These community service organizations, along with other public and private service
              organizations, such as Kaiser Permanente, St. Rose Hospital, the Red Cross and Tiburcio
              Vasquez Health Center and the City of Union City Leisure Services Department currently
              provide services for youth, seniors, and families. Most health care and social services are
              provided through private and non-profit organizations.
February 2002                                                                                    YFSH-1

Youth, Family, Seniors, and Health Element                                        City of Union City
The Leisure Services Department focuses primarily on
recreational, educational and after-school care/extended day
care needs. Some health screening services are provided
through the Senior Center as well as the Union City Fire
Department. Additionally, the Community Resource
Centers that are managed by the Police Department provide
recreational and educational programs with the assistance of
the Leisure Services Department.
Faith-based organizations and community groups also fill a
need in providing a wide range of services to their Kennedy Park Playground
congregations and the community, including recreation
programs, education programs, schools, childcare and senior care, and family enrichment programs.
Community groups also address the needs of the city’s culturally diverse population
                 A. GENERAL
                   Goal            To continue to place high priority on programs and facilities that
                   YFSH-A.1        serve youth, families, and seniors.
                 Policies
YFSH-A.1.1       The City shall continue to support the extensive recreation programs and facilities operated
                 by the Leisure Services Department.
YFSH-A.1.2       The City shall continue to use public funds to assist community and health services provided
                 by non-profit agencies.
YFSH-A.1.3       The City shall continue to support the extensive collaboration among the New Haven School
                 District, the Leisure Services Department, and non-profit organizations in providing services
                 to the community.
YFSH-A.1.4       The City shall continue to seek to establish new collaborations with other agencies and
                 private non-profit organizations in order to meet the needs of youth, families, seniors, and
                 the disabled.
                 Implementation Programs

              B. YOUTH AND FAMILIES
              Union City has the highest count of persons per household among cities in Alameda County.
              This statistic not only reflects a large youth population, but also extended families that may
              live in one home. In many households with children, both parents are working, which
              requires families to use before and after school care provided by the City’s Leisure Services
              Department in coordination with New Haven Unified School District. For families with
              children under five, daycare is provided through the private sector (private organizations or
              family daycare), NHUSD (in partnership with Tri-Cities Children’s Center) and other public
              agencies (Head Start). All of these facilities are required to meet the standards of
              Community Care Licensing.
              Within city government, the Leisure Services Department takes the lead in serving the
              recreational, educational and daycare (after school and extended care) needs of youth and
              families through extensive programing and partnerships with NHUSD, other city
              departments, and outside organizations.
                Goal             To meet the quality of life needs of Union City’s youth and families
                YFSH-B.1         through recreational, educational, housing, health care and child care
                                 opportunities.
              Policies

              to ensure that their needs are being met.
YFSH-B.1.2    The City shall continue to publish the Leisure Services Department Activity Guide to notify
              children and their parents of new and existing recreational facilities and programs. The City

              with a multi-cultural emphasis.

              programs such as tutoring for grades 6-12, youth
              occupational training, youth mentoring, and
              school readiness for pre-school aged children.

              the disabled population.                               Kennedy Community Center
YFSH-B.1.7    The City shall ensure that there is adequate public transit service to recreational facilities
              in Union City.
February 2002                                                                                        YFSH-3

YFSH-B.1.8     The City shall strive to expand its efforts of
               collaboration with the New Haven Unified

               neighborhoods in which schools are located.

               vacations.
YFSH-B.1.12 The City shall consider the impact of residential and commercial development projects
               (exceeding specific size thresholds) on the supply of child care. Mitigation may take the
               form of providing on-site or off-site facilities, in-lieu fees to provide facilities and/or
               supplement child care provider training; or other measures to address supply, affordability
               or quality child care.
YFSH-B.1.13 When reviewing applications for land use designation changes (i.e., zone change, General
               Plan Amendment, specific plan amendment), the City shall thoroughly analyze the impacts
               of the proposed changes on the licensed child care system.

               Union City’s senior population will continue to grow in the coming years as the current
               “baby boom” population ages. By 2020 the senior population is expected increase to
               approximately 13,000 people. In November 1998, the City opened the Ralph and Mary
               Ruggieri Senior Center. The facility, which is operated by Union City Leisure Services
               Department, provides extensive programs to serve the senior population, such as health
               screening, educational classes, recreational classes, and a lunch program. In addition, the
               City built 45 units of very low income senior housing directly west of the senior center.
               The last phase of this senior housing complex will add an additional 133 units. The private
               sector has successfully constructed low income senior housing at the corner of Decoto and
               Perry Roads. In addition, the Alameda County Housing Authority operates 100 senior units
               in Union City. Although Union City has significantly expanded senior services and senior

               E. PARKS AND PRIVATE RECREATION AREAS
               Union City’s recreational opportunities are provided by both public and private entities and
               include a variety of recreational programs and facilities for citizens of all ages.
               The City's urbanized area contains a variety of parks, sports fields, community facilities,
               trails, and open space areas. The City maintains a system of 25 parks that range from small
               mini-parks to larger community parks. The smaller mini-parks are used to address limited
               or unique recreational needs and provide low-use recreational facilities such as picnic sites
               and play equipment. The larger community parks provide recreational opportunities for
               more active-uses and include court areas, multi-use sports fields, and performance areas.
               Recreational programs within the Planning Area are also provided by a variety of private
               organizations and facilities including local churches, homeowners associations, apartment
               complexes, and private health clubs or recreation centers. Examples of these facilities
               include the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on Alvarado-Niles Road, which
               owns and manages a small Little League-sized baseball diamond, and the El Dorado and
               Contempo housing complexes, which maintain small house pools.
               Union City completed a Parks and Recreation Master Plan in 1999. Included in the master
               plan is a detailed inventory of existing facilities. The City maintains parks with a wide
               range of outdoor facilities such as sports fields, tennis courts and playgrounds, and
               community facilities (such as City Hall, Kennedy, Holly, Teen Workshop, Teen Center, and
               the Senior Center). As the community continues to grow, the pressure on existing
               community facilities will also grow. Over time, the City will need to find ways to
               maximize the existing facilities, and build or acquire new facilities to address the needs of
               the population.
