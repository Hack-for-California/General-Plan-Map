     The Plan covers the major strategies for future housing by defining where it is
     located and how intensely the land is used. Housing growth will focus in the
     North Bayshore, El Camino Real and San Antonio Change Areas. These areas
     offer housing opportunities near jobs, services and public transportation. In
     many cases, new housing that will be useful for the city's increasingly older
     residents who do not drive, but need to shop and take advantage of other
     services. ...

     NORTH BAYSHORE CHANGE AREA
     VISION
     The North Bayshore Change Area continues its role as a major high-technology
     employment center, and emerges as a model of innovative and sustainable
     development that protects and stewards biological habitat and open space within
     the Change Area and North Bayshore as a whole.
     In 2030, sensitive species of Shoreline at Mountain View Regional Park remain
     and thrive. Shoreline at Mountain View, the Stevens and Permanente creeks,
     Charleston Basin wetlands, and the Stevens Creek Trail remain unique and
     defining features of the area. Businesses and development respect and enhance
     the nearby wildlife, wetlands, trees and habitat areas that make the area unique.
     Workers and visitors enjoy nature and views of open space, the bay and
     mountains.
     A more intensive mix of commercial and residential land uses promotes
     sustainable growth with additional services for people who live or work nearby.
     Start-ups and small businesses create an economically diverse area. New
     development incorporates highly sustainable design features and materials.
     Shoreline Boulevard is the spine of North Bayshore, with a mix of office,
     commercial and residential land uses and ground-floor pedestrian activity. The
     North Shoreline Boulevard and Highway 101 area is revitalized as a gateway
     destination with a mix of stores, services, entertainment and hotels.
     North Bayshore’s pattern of large blocks has new pedestrian and bicycle
     connections. These make it easier and more sustainable and efficient for
     employees to move around in an active campus environment. Improved
     transportation services connect to the Mountain View Transit Center and other
     city destinations.
     A network of well-distributed plazas, greens and public spaces enhances North
     Bayshore’s vast open space while stewarding the area’s sensitive species and
     habitats. The area uses strategies to adapt to rising sea levels.

           Introduction
What is a General Plan?
A general plan is a city’s road map for the future. It describes a
community’s aspirations and identifies strategies for managing
preser vation and change. The State of California requires ever y
city and county to have a general plan to guide growth. General
plans typically include goals, policies, implementing actions and
supporting graphics. These components work together to convey
a long-term vision and guide local decision making to achieve that
vision. The general plan also plays an important role in regulating
land use. Its policies and maps form the foundation for City ordi-
nances, guidelines and plans.
This comprehensive update of the City’s 1992 General Plan
provides goals and policies that reflect present-day community
values and priorities and compliance with current state laws and
local ordinances.

                                        almost 55,000 in 1970. This rapid
                                        growth transformed Mountain View into
                                        a city with complete ser vices and new

                                        took place, different areas of the city
                                        began to take shape, each with a
                                        unique character. These included quiet

Looking to the Future
The goals and policies of the Mountain
View 2030 General Plan provide vital
direction for the future. They set forth
the City’s commitment to make appro-
priate decisions and allocate necessar y
resources to support that direction.
Implementing actions are the specific
to-do steps required to carr y out the
Plan’s goals and policies. These actions
are included in a companion Action Plan
that will help carr y out the broader goals
and policies.
The General Plan provides a framework
for anticipating future trends through
its vision, goals and policies. However,
it may need to be amended at times
to address new issues and informa-
tion. The Action Plan will be reviewed
regularly by the City and community to
ensure the General Plan is achieving
its goals. Based on this review, General
Plan actions may be amended, added or
deleted.

   General Plan Themes
   General Plan goals, policies and actions direct how Mountain View will achieve its
   vision for 2030. The following section describes major General Plan themes and
   overarching strategies that support the community’s preferred future. As the City
   carries out its General Plan, these themes and strategies should ground decision
   making and ensure that overall planning direction remains on course. More details
   related to each of the overarching strategies can be found within specific General
   Plan Elements, as noted in parentheses.
   quality of life
   The Mountain View community enjoys an excellent quality of life with its strong
   and diverse neighborhoods, vibrant Downtown, excellent schools, well-maintained
   community facilities and infrastructure and many open space and recreational
   opportunities. The General Plan seeks to maintain this high-quality environment
   by preser ving the land uses within most neighborhoods and establishing policies
   to help enhance and support their distinct characters. Most of the General Plan
   change in the city is focused in the North Bayshore area and along transit corridors
   in the East Whisman, El Camino Real and San Antonio areas.
   Overarching strategies to support Mountain View’s quality of life include:
   §§ Preser ving neighborhood character and increasing City revenues to help fund
       community facilities and other improvements. (Land Use and Design)
   §§ Continuing the unique partnership and cooperation between the City and the
       Mountain View Whisman School District to meet shared open space, recreational
       and educational needs. (Parks, Open Space and Community Facilities)
   §§ Expanding parks and open space to support population growth. (Parks, Open
       Space and Community Facilities)
   §§ Supporting non-automotive transportation measures. (Mobility)
   §§ Identifying new funding sources to ensure the continued maintenance and
       improvement of the city’s infrastructure. (Infrastructure and Conser vation)
10 Sustainability
   A sustainable community is one that meets current needs without compromising
   the ability to meet the needs of future generations. Sustainability is an important
   underlying value identified by the Mountain View community. Greenhouse gas reduc-
   tion and global climate change are especially critical challenges. This General Plan
   includes a comprehensive set of goals and policies to achieve a more sustainable
   future for Mountain View while contributing to regional and global sustainability
   initiatives.

The City’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program, developed concurrently with the
General Plan, includes incremental measures the community can undertake to
address its emissions over time. The North Bayshore area, next to San Francisco
Bay, is particularly vulnerable to future rise in sea level. The General Plan calls for
adapting to this future change through further targeted studies and by coordinating
with regional agencies on flood-prevention strategies.
Overarching strategies to support Mountain View’s sustainability include:
§§ Focusing future growth around major transportation corridors to increase transit
    ridership. (Land Use and Design)
§§ Creating flexible mixed-use land use designations to support “village centers,”
    which are neighborhood mixed-use and commercial centers within walking
    distance of neighborhoods. (Land Use and Design)
§§ Developing building, water and energy conser vation measures. (Land Use and
    Design; Infrastructure and Conser vation)
§§ Encouraging more bicycling and walking through improved connections and
    facilities. (Mobility)
DIVERSITY
Mountain View is a place that embraces and celebrates its diversity including its
mix of cultures, range of ages and incomes and broad spectrum of groups with
special needs. The city’s population is expected to become more diverse in the
future, with an increased senior population and further changes in its cultural and
ethnic makeup. Increased diversity shapes how and where change in the community
should be focused. It also influences how City ser vices and programs are planned
and delivered to address a range of needs.
Overarching strategies to support Mountain View’s diversity include:
§§ Involving all community stakeholders in planning processes. (Land Use and
    Design)                                                                              CHAPTER 1

§§ Identifying locations for a range of housing supported by public transportation              11
    options. (Housing; Land Use and Design)
§§ Continuing innovative housing approaches for lower-income populations.

   HEALTH AND WELLNESS
   Mountain View residents generally enjoy good health, particularly related to neigh-
   borhood quality and access to healthy foods and health care. However, there are
   opportunities for improvement, especially for certain groups with specific health
   needs or impairments, such as the elderly or those with chronic diseases. Rates of
   obesity, diabetes, asthma and other conditions show the need for positive change in
   the environment.
   Overarching strategies to support Mountain View’s health and wellness include:
   §§ Reducing risk factors for conditions such as obesity by improving bicycle and
       pedestrian infrastructure to encourage active, non-automotive transportation
       options. (Mobility)
   §§ Creating a land use pattern that improves access to healthy foods, ser vices and
       community spaces. (Land Use and Design)
   §§ Maintaining and expanding open space and recreational opportunities for resi-
       dents to enjoy physical and social activities in a natural environment. (Parks,
       Open Space and Community Facilities)
   §§ Continuing to monitor and improve the community’s air, soil and water quality.
       (Infrastructure and Conser vation)
   §§ Implementing policies to create a safer community. (Public Safety)
   §§ Enhancing safe and affordable housing. (Housing)
   Economic prosperity
   Mountain View has long been home to research facilities and for ward-thinking
   companies. This supports economic growth with significant new local jobs, a diversi-
   fied tax base and worldwide recognition as a hub of technology and innovation. A
   strong and diverse economy is vital in helping the City continue to generate the
   revenue required to provide high-quality ser vices and programs.
   Overarching strategies to support Mountain View’s economy include:
12
   §§ Supporting business needs through increased land use intensities and highly
       sustainable, well-designed business districts. (Land Use and Design)
   §§ Improving the overall economic base and diversity of businesses and increasing
       the City’s future revenues. (Land Use and Design)
   §§ Improving transportation ser vices between North Bayshore and the Mountain
       View Transit Center. (Land Use and Design)

             CHAPTER 2
        Planning Areas
The City of Mountain View is organized into several geographic areas
called planning areas. During General Plan outreach meetings,
residents and stakeholders discussed the assets, opportunities,
challenges and overall vision for the areas. This input helped guide
the development of policy, planning and design approaches for these
areas of the city (Figure 2.1).
Different planning areas have conditions that may make it neces-
sar y to adjust how the General Plan is carried out in each area. While
most of Mountain View’s land uses and character will be preser ved,
some of the planning areas include community-identified change areas
where land use change is targeted out to 2030.
This chapter presents a snapshot of the land use and character
of each of the planning areas, including the major policy direction
envisioned for each area. The Land Use and Design Element covers
detailed policy direction to guide development citywide and specific
information about each of the change areas.
The chapter is organized by area as follows:

Land Use and Design

               CHAPTER 3
                Land Use
              and Design
Mountain View boasts an impressive variety of land uses. They
include the vibrant Downtown mixed-use core, the distinct neigh-
borhoods and commercial corridors, the notable industrial areas
and the many high-quality parks, open spaces and public facilities.
As Mountain View carries out the General Plan, it aims to keep its
distinct character and grow an even more vibrant community with
inviting streets and public spaces, preser ved and walkable neigh-
borhoods, exceptional parks and a dynamic economy.
This Element shows how land is used now, discusses for ward-
thinking land use principles that will shape future planning
decisions and outlines allowable uses and intensity of develop-
ment for each parcel of land.
At the heart of this Element are goals and policies, both citywide
and for specific change areas, where major growth and devel-
opment are expected to occur until 2030, the Plan’s horizon.
Together, these goals and policies make up a strategic approach
to help the City leverage its many strengths and actively manage
its critical resources–land use, transportation, housing, economics
and natural environments–in a more sustainable manner.
                                                                             CHAPTER 3
The Element begins with a Context section, followed by a section    Land Use and Design
that outlines Mountain View’s Land Use Principles (page 46).

   Change Areas
   Extensive community input helped identify where Mountain View could significantly
   change over the life of the General Plan, and what the change could look like in the
   built environment, open spaces, natural habitats and community connections. Each
   change area is part of its own larger planning area.
   The General Plan change areas include (Figure 3.8):
     North Bayshore
     East Whisman
     El Camino Real
     San Antonio
     Moffett Boulevard
   The General Plan identifies new land uses and intensities for change areas,
   primarily in commercial and industrial zoned areas along corridors and in commer-
   cial locations. Changes in these areas include greater commercial intensities and
   residential densities than under the 1992 General Plan and new, more intensive
   mixed-use designations.
   After an introduction to form and character, the rest of this section presents a
   vision, goals and policies and form and character for each change area.
   The vision descriptions present a high-level snapshot of how these areas may
   change over time to help Mountain View achieve its General Plan vision. Citywide
   General Plan goals and policies also apply to change areas.
   Form and Character
   This section further describes the principles for design and development in change
   areas–how they will develop and look. These are not policy mandates. They rein-
   force General Plan policies, and will guide Zoning Ordinance and precise plan
   updates, the development review process and capital improvement projects in
   change areas.
   Form and character includes four key topics:
56
   Pedestrian and Bicyclist Environment shows how the network of blocks and streets
   accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. Pedestrians, bicyclists and drivers use
   streets to different degrees, depending on the context.
   Site Layout and Design describes how development projects are designed, including
   buildings, landscaping, parking and access.
   Plazas and Shared Space addresses how areas such as plazas, courtyards and
   trails can be incorporated into change areas.
   Building-to-Street Relationship refers to how buildings are designed and positioned
   in relation to the street.

            Vision
            The North Bayshore Change Area continues its role as a major high-technology
            employment center, and emerges as a model of innovative and sustainable
            development that protects and stewards biological habitat and open space
            within the Change Area and North Bayshore as a whole.
            In 2030, sensitive species of Shoreline at Mountain View Regional Park
            remain and thrive. Shoreline at Mountain View, the Stevens and Perman-
            ente creeks, Charleston Basin wetlands, and the Stevens Creek Trail remain
            unique and defining features of the area. Businesses and development
            respect and enhance the nearby wildlife, wetlands, trees and habitat areas
            that make the area unique. Workers and visitors enjoy nature and views of
            open space, the bay and mountains.
            A more intensive mix of land uses promotes sustainable growth with addi-
            tional services for people who live or work nearby. Start-ups and small
            businesses create an economically diverse area. New development incorpo-
            rates highly sustainable design features and materials.
            Shoreline Boulevard is the spine of North Bayshore, with a mix of land uses
            and ground-floor pedestrian activity. The North Shoreline Boulevard and
            Highway 101 area is revitalized as a gateway destination with a mix of stores,
            services, entertainment and hotels.
            North Bayshore’s pattern of large blocks has new pedestrian and bicycle
58          connections. These make it easier and more sustainable and efficient for
            employees to move around in an active campus environment. Improved trans-
            portation services connect to the Mountain View Transit Center and other city
            destinations.
            A network of well-distributed plazas, greens and public spaces enhances
            North Bayshore’s vast open space while stewarding the area’s sensitive
            species and habitats. The area uses strategies to adapt to rising sea levels.

            Vision
            The Moffett Boulevard Change Area transforms into a revitalized corridor
            supporting a flexible mix of land uses.
            In 2030, Moffett Boulevard is an important gateway to Downtown with a
            strong connection to NASA Ames. Commercial, mixed-use and residential
            buildings engage the landscaped, well-lighted street while respecting the
            character of surrounding neighborhoods. Moffett Boulevard has plazas and
            other gathering areas for people. It’s easy for people to walk or bicycle across
            Central Expressway and to get to surrounding areas.

         Floor Area Ratio and Dwelling Units per Acre
         Building intensity is measured in floor area ratio (FAR), the ratio of a building or
         project’s floor area to its land area. FAR is typically used to measure the intensity of
         commercial, office and industrial uses. For example, a 45,000 square foot building
         on a 60,000 square foot parcel has an FAR of 0.75, regardless of the number
         of stories. FAR is also the development standard used to measure density and
         intensity in mixed-use areas; dwelling units per acre is provided to help estimate
         the expected population.
80       Consistent with the designations from the 1992 General Plan, density in residential
         neighborhoods is measured by the number of dwelling units per acre (DU/acre). For
         example, 12 units on a half-acre project results in a density of 24 DU/acre.
         While FAR and DU/acre are standard ways to measure building intensity or
         residential density, form and character statements in the broad land use categories
         in this section guide how buildings are best integrated into their surroundings.
         Form and character guidance is described within the General Plan’s land use
         policies, and within change area descriptions.

             CHAPTER 4
                Mobility
Mountain View’s mobility needs are fulfilled by a range of travel modes
–including driving, walking, bicycling and public transit. Streets, side-
walks and trails ser ve a variety of social, recreational, ecological and
accessibility goals. This Mobility Element reinforces the City’s signifi-
cant long-term strategy to improve access for all means of travel and
streets designed for all users.
Citywide mobility is essential to Mountain View’s economy, health,
community life and long-term sustainability. The vision for community
mobility includes an increasingly important focus on walking, bicy-
cling and public transit. These travel modes reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and improve Mountain View’s overall health, wellness and
livability.
The Element begins with a Context section, followed by a Street Types
section (page 105) that illustrates how Mountain View’s streets can
accommodate different travel priorities based on location, function
and context. Then, a Looking For ward section (page 109) highlights
opportunities, challenges and key strategies. The final section outlines
the specific goals and policies for each topic area (page 110).

that connects to the region and the rest of the city through a network         95
of roads, transit routes and paths for bicycles and pedestrians. The
community highly values walking, bicycling and transit even though
they represent a small portion of overall travel (Figure 4.1).
The General Plan’s mobility goals and policies respond to current
conditions and direct change. They reflect the community’s desire to

   enhance its long-standing strategy of Citywide Land Use and
   supporting alternative ways of travel Access to Services
   and transit-oriented development.     Land use, community design and

        The Bicycle Network
        The City’s bicycle network consists of four different types of bikeway facilities:
                            Bike Paths (Class I) – A completely separate right-of-way for
                            the exclusive use of bicyclists and pedestrians with minimal
                            roadway crossings. They are especially suitable for younger or less
                            experienced riders. Examples include the Stevens Creek Trail,
                            Permanente Creek Trail and Hetch Hetchy Trail.
                            Bike Lanes (Class II) – A striped lane on a street with signs for
                            one-way, bicycle-only travel. Bike lanes are the most common type
                            of bikeway in the city. Examples include sections of Middlefield
                            Road, Evelyn Avenue and Grant Road.
                            Bike Routes (Class IIIa) – Neighborhood or low-speed streets where
                            the travel lane is wide enough and there is limited traffic to allow
                            both bicyclists and cars. Examples include La Avenida Street and
                            Calderon Avenue.
                            Bike Boulevards (Class IIIb) – Modified bike routes offering
                            especially convenient and efficient through-routes for bicyclists of
                            all skill levels. Examples include the Mayfield-Whisman Bicycle
                            Boulevard and a connection between Downtown and the Sylvan
                            and Dale/Heatherstone areas.

        What are TSM and TDM?
        The terms Transportation Systems Management (TSM) and Transportation Demand
        Management (TDM) are often used to describe a mix of strategies that keep the effects
        of transportation, fuel consumption and emissions to a minimum.
        TSM strategies generally aim to improve traffic conditions and reduce cut-through
        traffic in neighborhoods through strategic right-of-way improvements and operational
        efficiencies such as intelligent transportation systems and signal-timing optimization.
        TDM strategies are designed to reduce vehicle trips and parking demand by offering
        incentives for using other ways to travel. Multi-modal transportation infrastructure
        supports successful TDM implementation. Transportation Management Associations
        (TMA) will allow employers, developers and property owners to collaboratively and
        efficiently provide alternative transportation options in key areas of the city.
        These strategies work together to align transportation system performance with
        greenhouse gas reduction strategies and can include a wide variety of measures such
        as:
        §§   Neighborhood/Site Design – Bicycle and pedestrian network improvements, car-
             sharing programs, traffic calming and site design to support alternative travel
             modes.
        §§   Parking Policies – Parking supply limits, unbundled parking and public parking
             pricing.
        §§   Transit System Improvements – Network expansion, service frequency and speed
             and transit access improvements.
        §§   Commute Trip Reduction Programs – Transit fare subsidies, employee parking cash-
             outs, alternative work schedules, workplace parking pricing, shuttles or employer-
             sponsored vanpools.

Infrastructure and Conservation

               CHAPTER 5
         Infrastructure
    and Conser vation
Mountain View’s infrastructure–water, sewer, storm drain and street
systems–and its natural resources–creeks, habitats, and water and
energy resources–are crucial parts of ever yday community life. Though
these fundamental systems often go unnoticed, residents, businesses
and visitors rely on them to continue Mountain View’s exceptional
quality of life. This Element intends to ensure that the city’s infra-
structure is well planned, regularly maintained and replaced to
support community needs and that Mountain View conser ves, main-
tains and protects its natural resources.
The city’s infrastructure and the conser vation of its natural resources
are integral to helping it become more environmentally sustainable.
Innovative conser vation strategies will help the City save water and
energy, reduce waste, promote greener and healthier buildings,
improve air and water quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
In accomplishing these improvements, the City will create a more

            Open Space
        and Community
                Facilities
Parks and open space, community facilities, recreational programs
and the arts are all important to Mountain View. They enhance the
city’s neighborhoods and Downtown and offer recreation, social inter-
action and community-building activities and programs. Parks, open
space and natural areas benefit human health and the environment
through opportunities for physical exercise and access to nature for
people, and habitats for plants and animals.
Mountain View is committed to continuing these ser vices and
benefits. This Element directs development and maintenance of an
exceptional system of high-quality parks, open space, community
facilities, programs and support ser vices. The City’s 2008 Parks and
Open Space Plan (POSP) provides detailed, shorter-term actions that
carr y out this Element’s long-range goals and policies. Both the POSP
and the City’s 2008 Recreation Plan will be updated periodically to be
consistent with the General Plan.
The Element begins with a Context section, followed by a Looking
For ward section (page 148) that highlights opportunities, challenges
and key strategies. The final section outlines the specific goals and
policies (page 149) for each topic area.
                                                                                   CHAPTER 6

the Center itself with per formances
in nearby parks. The City also actively
supports visual arts through programs
that include requiring public art in new
public projects.
Trees, Gardens and Landscaping
Trees, gardens and landscaping provide
aesthetic, environmental and health
benefits. Trees produce oxygen, improve
air quality, remove greenhouse gases
from the atmosphere and provide shade
and cooling. Trees and landscaped
areas also help reduce stormwater
runoff and supply habitat for birds,
insects and animals. Fruit trees and
vegetable gardens reflect Mountain
View’s agricultural past and can offer
healthy local food as well as a source
of physical activity for gardeners.
The City maintains a comprehensive
inventor y of street and park trees and
manages their maintenance, replace-
ment and expansion. Mountain View’s
Heritage Tree Ordinance ensures that
trees are protected or replaced when
removal is unavoidable. The City also
sponsors two community gardens–the
Senior Garden and the Willowgate
Community Garden. Use of drought-
tolerant and salt-tolerant plants, many
of which are natives, minimizes the
amount of water needed for public and                CHAPTER 6

             CHAPTER 7
                  Noise
Protecting the community from excessive or harmful noise is an impor-
tant part of sustaining a high quality of life. The purpose of this Noise
Element is to guide policies for addressing exposure to current and
projected noise sources in Mountain View. The Element covers State
Government Code requirements and the State Office of Noise Control
Guidelines.
The Element begins with a Context section, followed by a Land Use
Compatibility section which outlines acceptable noise standards for
the City’s land use categories (page 162). Then, a Looking For ward
section highlights oppor tunities, challenges and key strategies
(page 165). The final section sets for th the specific goal and
policies (page 166) for each topic area.
Context
To help guide decisions on land use, this Element outlines policies
to decrease noise and reduce its effects. Noise contour maps in this
section show areas of the city exposed to freeway, railway and other
major noise sources. By highlighting these areas and establishing
noise and land use compatibility standards, the City can reduce
                                                                          CHAPTER 7
conflicts between noise and land use and lessen noise sources that            Noise

162Using the Outdoor Noise Environment Guidelines (Table 7.1, next page)
    This chart provides general guidance for siting new land uses, given future noise environments.
    If a site’s noise environment is in the “normally acceptable” range, conventional construction should be adequate
      to achieve interior noise levels compatible with activities characteristic of the land use. Figure 7.3 provides
      guidance for the approximate location of “normally acceptable” noise environments in 2030.
    The Noise Policies contain specific standards for noise levels in residential developments. These policies ensure
      that noise levels for housing are limited, both indoors and in outdoor active-use areas.

    Goal and Policies
    The Noise (NOI) goal is a broad statement describing the City’s future direction. Poli-
    cies provide more specificity for achieving this goal. Actions for implementing this
    goal and these policies are detailed separately in the General Plan’s Action Plan.
    Goal NOI-1: Noise levels that support a high quality of life in Mountain View.
    Policies
        NOI 1.1: Land use compatibility. Use the Outdoor Noise Environment Guidelines as
        a guide for planning and development decisions (Table 7.1).
        NOI 1.2: Noise-sensitive land uses. Require new development of noise-sensitive
        land uses to incorporate measures into the project design to reduce interior and
        exterior noise levels to the following acceptable levels:
           •	 New single-family developments shall maintain a standard of 65 dBA Ldn
               for exterior noise in private outdoor active use areas.
           •	 New multi-family residential developments shall maintain a standard of 65
               dBA Ldn for private and community outdoor recreation use areas. Noise
               standards do not apply to private decks and balconies in multi-family
               residential developments.
           •	 Interior noise levels shall not exceed 45 dBA Ldn in all new single-family
               and multi-family residential units.
           •	 Where new single-family and multi-family residential units would be
               exposed to intermittent noise from major transportation sources such
               as train or airport operations, new construction shall achieve an interior
               noise level of 65 dBA through measures such as site design or special
               construction materials. This standard shall apply to areas exposed to
               four or more major transportation noise events such as passing trains or
               aircraft flyovers per day.
        NOI 1.3: Exceeding acceptable noise thresholds. If noise levels in the area of a
        proposed project would exceed normally acceptable thresholds, the City shall
        require a detailed analysis of proposed noise reduction measures to determine

              CHAPTER 8
          Public Safety
Policing and fire protection are fundamental City ser vices. Public
safety responsibilities evolve as the community’s needs change.
Today they place greater emphasis on crime prevention, technology,
hazardous materials and planning for major disasters including earth-
quakes, floods and fires.
The Element begins with a Context section, followed by a Looking
For ward section that highlights opportunities, challenges and key
strategies (page 175). The final section outlines the specific goals and
policies for each topic area (page 176).
Context
In 2011, Mountain View had about 100 police officers and 70 fire-
fighters. The administrative offices of the Police Department and
the Fire Department are headquartered in the Police-Fire Building on
Villa Street. Response time to calls for ser vice is one of the primar y
measures of how well the departments ser ve the community. Both
departments also manage other programs to ensure Mountain View’s
safety and security.
The Context section is organized according to these topics:                CHAPTER 8
