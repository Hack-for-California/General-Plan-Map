VISION STATEMENT, PURPOSE AND
REQUIREMENTS
Vision Statement & Purpose
On December 1, 2003, the City of Sonora adopted the following vision statement
which reflects the city’s vision for development within and around the City of Sonora
as reflected in this City of Sonora General Plan 2020 (hereinafter, Sonora General
Plan 2020 or General Plan 2020):
                 City of Sonora Vision Statement
           The City of Sonora has an obligation to provide the community
          with a clean, safe and secure environment in which to live and
             work, and to preserve and promote its historic character.
General Plan Requirements
California has required local jurisdictions to develop plans to guide growth and
development since 1937.
Pursuant to Government Code Section 65300, state law requires that a city prepare,
and its legislative body adopt, a comprehensive long-term general plan for the
physical development of the city and of any land outside of its boundaries which, in
the judgment of the planning agency, bears relation to its planning.
Pursuant to Government Code Section 65302, the general plan must include the
following seven elements:
        •      Land Use Element
        •       Circulation Element [included as two separate elements in Sonora
               General Plan 2020: Circulation (Transportation) and Public Facilities
               and Services]
        •      Housing Element
        •       Conservation Element (included as the Conservation & Open
               Space Element in Sonora General Plan 2020)
        •       Open Space Element (included as the Conservation & Open Space
               Element in Sonora General Plan 2020)

        •      Noise Element
        •      Safety Element
In addition to these mandatory elements, Sonora General Plan 2020 includes five
non-mandatory elements:
        •       Air Quality
        •       Cultural Resources
        •       Economics

Chapter 1.                      Land Use
1.1.       Requirements
The land use element is a required element of the general plan and is considered to
be the most important element of the general plan. All other elements of the general
plan relate directly to the land use element.
Government Code Section 65302(a) states that a general plan shall include a land
use element which designates the proposed general distribution and general location
and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space,
including agriculture, natural resources, recreation and enjoyment of scenic beauty,
education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and
other categories of public and private uses of land.
The land use element shall include a statement of the standards of population
density and building intensity recommended for the various districts and other
territory covered by the plan.
The land use element shall identify areas covered by the plan which are subject to
flooding and shall be reviewed annually with respect to those areas.
The land use element shall designate, in a land use category that provides for timber
production, those parcels of real property zoned for timberland production pursuant
to the California Timberland Productivity Act of 1982, Chapter 6.7 (commencing with
Section 51100) of Part 1 of Division 1 of Title 5. It is noted that there are no
commercially significant timberlands located within the city limits. Therefore, this
land use designation is inapplicable to the City of Sonora.

As illustrated in the preceding table, the City of Sonora can expect its population to grow to
between 5,144 and 5,948 individuals by the year 2020. Applying the county’s projected
growth rate, the city’s projected population would be approximately 5,656 individuals.
For the purposes of General Plan 2020 and this analysis, the population for the City of
Sonora is expected to reach between 5,144 and 5,948 resident individuals in the city limits.
          Based on historical growth rates over the long term, the City of Sonora
           anticipates its resident population will reach between 5,144 and 5,948
          individuals by 2020— an increase of between 480 and 1,284 individuals
As the county seat, and the major employment and commercial center of Tuolumne County,
the City of Sonora sees a daily influx of non-resident population that increases the city’s
daytime population. The city estimates that the daytime population could increase to
between 22,000 and 25,000 individuals.

1.4.     Goals, Policies and Implementation Programs
Land Use: General
Goal:
   1.A         Provide a well-organized and orderly development pattern that maintains and
               enhances the City of Sonora’s social, economic, cultural, environmental, and
               aesthetic resources while managing growth so that adequate facilities and
               services can be provided in pace with development.
Policies:
   1. A.1      Ensure an adequate amount of land planned for urban development to
               accommodate projected population growth in areas where the appropriate
               level of services are or can be made available.
   1.A.2       Make efficient use of land and promote a functional development pattern with
               varied and compatible land uses.
   1.A.3       Ensure that the extent of development shall be related to the property’s
               environmental constraints.
   1.A.4       Protect the public, existing and planned land uses, and the environment from
               natural and development hazards.
Implementation Programs:
   1.A.a       Establish, Maintain and Update Zoning Districts
               Establish and maintain new zoning districts and update existing zoning
               district regulations consistent with the density and intensity standards
               established in this element.
   1.A.b       Update the Sonora General Plan
               Update or provide a thorough review of the Sonora General Plan 2020, as
               necessary.

   1.A.c       Monitor Land Availability
               Monitor the supply of land available within the city for future development to
               ensure that there is an adequate supply available to implement the goals,
               policies and implementation programs of the general plan. Monitoring may
               be accomplished by updating the city’s Geographic Information System land
               use files when rezoning or general plan amendments are approved.
               Related Programs: Chapter 1 (Land Use) - Implementation Program 1.E.b, Chapter 3

               Implementation Program 10.A.a.
   1.A.d       Establish Criteria for General Plan Amendments
               In reviewing and application to amend the Sonora General Plan 2020 Land
               Use Map, the Sonora Planning Commission and Sonora City Council shall
               consider the overall consistency of the proposal with the goals, objectives
               and policies of Sonora General Plan 2020 including, but not limited to:
                            i.  What physical, social, or economic factors exist that were not
                                considered at the time of Sonora General Plan 2020 adoption
                                and the evaluation of the proposal based on new information
                           ii.  Existing reasonable alternative sites in the vicinity that are
                                planned for the use and can accommodate the proposal
                          iii.  The potential for the proposal to encourage undesirable

Land Use: Special Planning Areas7
Goal:
   1.J.         Encourage new development which creates a diverse, walkable, compact,
                vibrant project with integrated design compatible with the physical
                characteristics of the property.8
Policy:
   1.J.1        Provide a flexible framework for the development of properties that have
                unique or unusual characteristics and do not fit into the conventional zoning
                pattern including vacant land requiring unusually environmentally and
                aesthetically sensitive development.
Implementation Programs:
   1.J.a        Develop a Special Planning Zoning District 9
                Develop a Special Planning Plan Zoning District consistent with the Special
                Planning (SP) general plan land use designation promoting development
                which includes some or all of the principles of Traditional Design.          The
                Special Planning Zoning District may consider discerning between principles
                applicable to those developments which are primarily commercial in nature
                and those which are primarily residential in nature. Examples of Special
                Planning development principles may include, but are not limited to:
                             i. Walkability - most things within a 10-minute walk of home and
                                work, pedestrian-friendly street design
                            ii. Connectivity - interconnected streets, high quality pedestrian
                                network
                           iii. Diversity – diversity of complementary uses
                          iv.   Quality Architecture and Urban Design – integrated
                                appearance consistent with the character of the city and
                                design recognizing the physical characteristics of the parcel

                         vi.      Increased Density – more buildings, residences, shops and
                                  services located closer together for ease of walking (increased
                                  density would be inapplicable to development which does not
                                  promote walkability)

                                  high quality of life
               Development in this zone should require the preparation of a Specific Plan
               (as defined in Government Code Section 65450 et seq), or an equivalent plan
               for developments in excess of 10 acres.               The SP Zoning District shall

   1.J.c        Establish Incentives for Coordinated Planning within the Special
                Planning (SP) Zone 10
                Develop incentives to encourage multiple landowners to coordinate their
                planning and development efforts to create well-design projects. Incentives
                may include:
                                i.  Allowing a relatively greater range of permitted uses and
                                    greater development density/intensity if a minimum
                                    percentage of owners join together to formulate and

                               ii.  Broader staff authority to grant administrative relief from
                                    development standards (e.g., 5% reduction in lot area,
                                    setbacks, lot width; 5% increase in lot coverage and
                                    building height)
                              iii.  For commercial uses integrating housing, consider
                                    excluding residential uses in calculations for maximum lot
                                    coverage requirements, thereby providing a development
                                    “bonus”
                              iv.   Allow developments with diverse uses to provide
                                    alternative compliance with development and design
                                    standards that accomplish the purposes of the standard

                               v.   Longer vesting of property rights connected with an

1.5.        General Plan 2020 Land Use Designations & Maximum
            Density and Intensity Standards
PRO - Park/Recreation/Resource/Open Space
Purposes and Intent
To protect the open and semi-rural character of the City of Sonora while protecting its
inhabitants from natural hazards and conserving important areas of scenic, biological or
cultural values. To provide for and maintain publicly owned parks, recreational and cultural
facilities.
Locational Criteria
Encompasses areas prone to geotechnical hazards, flooding, important scenic and
biological resources, significant natural areas, and cultural areas. Includes Woods Creek,
Dragoon Gulch and Sonora Creek. Also includes those areas encompassing the city’s
existing and planned publicly-owned parks, recreational and cultural facilities. In areas
targeted for consideration as potential new redevelopment areas, pocket parks may be
indicated on the land use maps, however, locations indicated are intended to provide
general, rather than precise, locations for these parks which generally are intended to serve
those of live, work and shop at the city’s commercial centers.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
Generally, development within these areas is limited or prohibited.             Because this
designation may be used in partnership with parks and recreational facilities, some small,
limited development (e.g., bathrooms, rest stops) may occur, but rarely exceeds an FAR of
0.1.
ER - Estate Residential
Purposes and Intent
To provide a variety of housing alternatives, including larger lots (1-3 acres) on relatively
gentle slopes.
Locational Criteria
Generally located in areas with gentle slopes away from the central core of the city. The
ER land use designation typically provides a transition between urban and more rural or
agricultural uses. The ER land use also provides opportunities for clustering on small
expanses of gently-sloping land.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
One dwelling unit per one acre to one dwelling unit per three acres.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                      Land Use - 33

SFR - Single-Family Residential
Purpose and Intent
To preserve the integrity of existing single-family residential neighborhoods and reserve
lands best-suited for future single-family development.
Locational Criteria
Variable, but restricted to those areas which may be served by adequate water, sewer,
police, fire, roads and other public services.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
One dwelling unit per 7,500 square feet with an average of six dwelling units per acre and a
maximum FAR of 0.5.          Lots of less than 7,500 square feet existing prior to the effective
date of Sonora General Plan 2020 (May 30, 2007) are considered legal, conforming lots, but
may not be subdivided into lots of less than 7,500 square feet. Lots existing after the
effective date of Sonora General Plan 2020 shall be at least 7,500 square feet in size.
MDR - Medium Density Residential
Purposes and Intent
To provide for a variety of housing needs throughout the city including both single-family and
medium-density multi-family dwellings. Generally, MDR developments will include duplexes,
triplexes, and fourplexes. Integrated condominium or townhouse developments also are
encouraged. MDR housing is intended as a primary tool for fulfilling the housing needs of
special population groups (e.g., seniors, affordable, retired, single).
Locational Criteria
Typically, MDR developments will be located close to commercial or other services and near
major streets and thoroughfares for convenient access. MDR developments will normally
be located on in-fill sites scattered throughout the city blending with the character of existing,
established neighborhoods.          MDR developments that are not in-fill will typically be
condominium or townhouse developments located outside of existing, established
neighborhoods. MDR may also occur as upstairs apartments constructed in conjunction
with commercial developments to provide for live-work opportunities.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
The land use density for MDR is 10.89 dwelling units per gross acre for parcels less than
one acre in size. Land use density is 8.0 dwelling units per gross acre for parcels one acre
or larger in size. Minimum parcel size is 7,500 square feet. Building coverage shall not
exceed a maximum FAR of 0.5. Lots of less than 7,500 square feet existing prior to the
effective date of Sonora General Plan 2020 (May 30, 2007) are considered legal,
conforming lots, but may not be subdivided into lots of less than 7,500 square feet. Lots
existing after the effective date of Sonora General Plan 2020 shall be at least 7,500 square
feet in size.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                        Land Use - 34
                                                                             Chapter 1: Land Use
HDR - High Density Residential
Purposes and Intent
To provide for a variety of housing needs throughout the city including both single-family and
medium-density multi-family dwellings. The HDR designation is intended primarily for
grouped or clustered single-family dwellings, duplexes, triplexes, apartments, dwelling
groups, condominiums and townhouses, senior housing projects, and multi-family dwellings.
It is anticipated that large, multi-family residential complexes will provide a designated
percentage of units for affordable housing as an alternative to high-density complexes built
solely for a single-target income group.
Locational Criteria
HDR developments will be located close to commercial or other services and near major
streets and thoroughfares for convenient access.        HDR developments typically will be
located throughout the city and not concentrated in a single location. HDR may also occur
as upstairs apartments constructed in conjunction with commercial developments to provide
for live-work opportunities.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
The HDR land use density is 21.75 dwelling units per gross acre for parcels of less than one
acre in size. The HDR land use density is 15.0 dwelling units per gross acre for parcels one
acre or greater in size. Parcel sizes shall be a minimum of 12,500 net square feet. Building
coverage shall not exceed a maximum FAR of 0.5. Lots of less than 12,500 square feet
existing prior to the effective date of Sonora General Plan 2020 (May 30, 2007) are
considered legal, conforming lots, but may not be subdivided into lots of less than 12,500
square feet. Lots existing after the effective date of General Plan 2020 shall be at least
12,500 square feet in size.
HMR - Historic Mixed Density Residential
Purpose and Intent
The HMR designation is intended to preserve both the historic and residential character of
those portions of the city with large concentrations of structures 50 years of age or older
located outside of the city’s designated historic commercial district and used primarily for
residential purposes.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
The allowable density for individual parcels designated HMR is variable. The HMR land
use density allows up to 21.75 dwelling units per gross acre for parcels of less than one acre
in size. The HMR land use density allows up to 15.0 dwelling units per gross acre for
parcels one acre or greater in size.
The maximum density permitted on any given parcel designated HMR is a reflection of
opportunities and constraints unique to each parcel. Allowable density is a direct function
of the site’s capacity to provide one or more housing units (within single structures or
multiple structures) while maintaining the historic integrity of existing structures, providing
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                       Land Use - 35

                                                                                Chapter 1: Land Use
adequate parking, preserving mature landscaping and sustaining the overall historic
characteristics of the parcel, the immediate area and adjoining neighborhoods.
It is anticipated that a new Historic Mixed Density Residential Use combining district will be
developed to implement this proposed general plan land use designation.                 The HMR
combining district would overlay the existing primary zoning district and is expected to allow:
single-family residential uses, multi-family residential uses and bed and breakfast
establishments. As compatible with state law and the city’s Housing Element, the district is
expected to allow residential care homes, day care and similar facilities.
The HMR combining district is expected to include/address: alternatives for on-site parking
(e.g., allowing reduced parking or use of community parking areas in partial fulfillment of
parking requirements), maintenance of mature landscaping, reduced setbacks compatible
with historic character, and similar topics. This combining district also is expected to allow
for lots sizes consistent with historic lot sizes (e.g., 6,000 square foot net for single-family
residential districts).
HMU - Historic Mixed Use
Purpose
The HMU designation is intended to preserve historic character in those portions of the city
with large concentrations of structures 50 years of age or older located outside of the city’s
designated historic commercial district while allowing for a broad range of land uses
compatible with maintaining the historic integrity of individual structures and groups of
structures, landscapes and overall neighborhood character.              The HMU designation is
intended to provide a transition between areas with high concentrations of structures 50
years of age or older that are primarily residential in nature (Historic Mixed Density
Residential) and more intensive commercial and civic land uses located near the city’s
designated historic commercial district and along major city thoroughfares.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
The allowable density for individual parcels designated HMU is variable. The HMU land
use density allows up to 21.75 dwelling units per gross acre for parcels of less than one acre
in size. The HMU land use density allows up to 15.0 dwelling units per gross acre for
parcels one acre or greater in size.
The maximum density permitted on any given parcel designated HMU is a reflection of
opportunities and constraints unique to each parcel. Allowable density is a direct function
of the site’s capacity to provide multiple housing units (within single structures or multiple
structures) while maintaining the historic integrity of existing structures, providing adequate
parking, preserving mature landscaping and sustaining the overall historic characteristics of
the parcel, the immediate area and adjoining neighborhoods.
It is anticipated that a new Historic Mixed Use combining district will be developed to
implement this proposed general plan land use designation. The HMU combining district
would be added to the underlying, primary, zoning district, and is expected to allow (but is
not limited to):     professional offices, single-family residential uses, multi-family residential
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                          Land Use - 36

                                                                                Chapter 1: Land Use
uses, museums, public uses, bed and breakfast establishments, restaurants, art galleries,
tourist information facilities, libraries, churches, cemeteries (generally less than one-half
acre in size) and related and accessory uses. As compatible with state law and the city’s
Housing Element, the district is expected to allow residential care homes, day care and
similar facilities. The overlay also is expected to allow storage within existing structures (of
non-hazardous materials) where high-volume multiple vehicle pick-ups for warehouses and
deliveries are not anticipated (i.e., distribution centers are not expected to be a permitted
use). Low-volume traffic retail may be considered.
The HMU combining district is expected to include/address: alternatives for on-site parking
(e.g., allowing reduced parking or use of community parking areas in partial fulfillment of
parking requirements), maintenance of mature landscaping, adaptive re-use of historic
structures, reduced setbacks compatible with historic character, and similar topics. This
combining district also is expected to allow for lots sizes consistent with historic lot sizes
(e.g., 6,000 square foot net for single-family residential districts). Many parcels designated
HMU are expected to qualify for benefits pursuant to the Mills Act program.
HC - Heavy Commercial
Purposes and Intent
To provide a broad range of commercial uses for both residents and visitors. Typical uses
include shopping centers, hotels, motels, restaurants, bars, department stores, gift shops
and professional offices. Generally used for large shopping centers with an integrated
design.
Locational Criteria
Generally located within urban areas and along major thoroughfares.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
The FAR for this designation shall not exceed 2.0.
C:      Commercial
Purposes and Intent
Less intensive than HC and generally encompassing single small lots, a collection of small
lots or the city’s downtown historic district.      Uses include professional offices, bed and
breakfasts, public facilities, small retail businesses, resident and tourist services, restaurants
and similar facilities. Generally includes commercial uses located outside of shopping
centers and outside of special planning areas.
Locational Criteria
Commercial uses located near residential or some public use areas and within the city’s
downtown historic district.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
The FAR for this designation shall not exceed 2.0.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                          Land Use - 37

                                                                             Chapter 1: Land Use
SP - Special Planning
Purposes and Intent
Encourage new development which creates a diverse, walkable, compact, vibrant project
with integrated design compatible with the physical characteristics of the property. This
designation includes two subcategories: Special Planning Residential (SP-R) and Special
Planning Mixed Use (SP-MU) reflecting the emphasis of land uses within each Special
Planning area.
Locational Criteria
Properties that have unique or unusual characteristics and do not fit into the conventional
zoning pattern including vacant land requiring unusually environmentally and aesthetically
sensitive development.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
Flexible standards, but generally will not exceed a FAR of 2.0 for projects which are
primarily commercial, a FAR of 1.5 for projects with diverse uses, and a FAR of 1.0 for
projects which are primarily residential.
P - Public (and Quasi Public)
Purposes and Intent
Includes both public and quasi-public uses for those agencies which serve as their own
Lead Agency when conducting environmental reviews (e.g., government buildings, schools,
railroad, PG&E, TUD facilities, cemeteries).       Also includes hospitals as necessary to
address the unique land use needs of hospitals within the City of Sonora including
associated offices, helipads, emergency vehicles, and related uses.
Locational Criteria
Government buildings, schools, railroad, hospital facilities, PG&E, TUD, cemeteries and
similar uses.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
There are no maximum density or intensity standards for this designation.
LM - Light Manufacturing
Purposes and Intent
To provide for manufacturing, processing, assembly, storage, distribution and other
businesses including those which may require outdoor storage including auto repair facilities
and similar uses. Generally, uses under this designation may be incompatible with other
land uses due to noise, appearance, traffic, odors or similar characteristics. In areas where
noise, odors or aesthetics may be of concern, the designation provides for a mixture of light
industrial and commercial land uses (BP Zoning District) with an emphasis on light
manufacturing, processing, assembly, wholesale businesses and research and development
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                      Land Use - 38
                                                                            Chapter 1: Land Use
activities in a campus-like business setting (e.g., extensive landscaping, integrated
architectural design)
Locational Criteria
Sonora General Plan 2020 does not include this designation within its existing city limits.
However, future annexations adjacent to the city will address the need for light
manufacturing uses within the city limits. Generally, these land uses will be concentrated in
industrial parks isolated from other land uses by topography, major thoroughfares or other
natural barriers. The LM land use will be located in areas which are not highly visible from
either Highway 49 or 108 or other major thoroughfares. For areas visible from major
thoroughfares requiring special design considerations, the BP Zoning District is expected to
apply.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
The FAR for this designation shall not exceed 1.0.

Chapter 2.                        Circulation
2.1.        Requirements
The Circulation Element is one of the seven mandated general plan elements
(California Government Code Section 65302).
The Circulation Element must include the general location and extent of existing and
proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other public
utilities and facilities–all correlated with the land use element of the general plan.
Consistent with past practice, the Public Facilities and Services portion of Sonora
General Plan 2020 has been included as a separate element of General Plan 2020
and addresses public utilities and facilities (General Plan 2020, Chapter 7).
2.2.        Background and Setting
The following transportation studies were undertaken between January, 1986 and
July 15, 2004 to address the City of Sonora and regional transportation needs:

2.2.1.    Transportation Organizations
The California Department of Transportation, District 10 (Stockton) oversees
transportation planning for State Highway 108 and 49 (the city’s arterial roadways).
Tuolumne County regional transportation planning is overseen by the Tuolumne
County Transportation Council (TC2).          The City of Sonora is a member of TC2.
Transportation plans affecting county roads and collector roads within the city are
overseen by TC2.
The Sonora City Council, with support from the city engineer, is responsible for
adopting transportation plans affecting the city’s local roads.

The City of Sonora maintains a Parking District as illustrated in General Plan 2020
Appendix 2A.
Fees collected within the parking district are used to support the costs of maintaining
parking facilities within the city.
2.2.4.    Rail
The Sierra Railroad line passes through the southern portion of the city, crossing
South Washington Street near its intersection with Hospital Road, and passing in
front of Tuolumne General Hospital as it winds its way eastward. Under current
operating conditions, a train makes one round-trip to the lumber mill in Standard
through Sonora daily (passing through Sonora twice each day). Occasional
passenger trains from Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown and
occasional work trains also may pass through Sonora. Per Larry Ingold of the Sierra
Railroad Company (May 23, 2001), freight trains through Sonora could increase to
two round-trips daily depending upon operations at the lumber mill in Standard.
The Sierra Railroad has, from time to time, discussed hauling materials by freight for
proposed mining operations in various locations throughout the county. Per the
Tuolumne County Community Development Department, it is expected that any
increased hauling would use existing freight trains with additional cars operating on
existing freight schedules thereby increasing the length of trains while maintaining
the number of trains passing through Sonora.

2.2.5.   Public Transportation
The City of Sonora, through its participation on the Tuolumne County Transportation
Council, provides some funding for and assists with the operation of, Tuolumne
County Transit. The agency provides fixed route service, flex-route service and
Dial-A-Ride service to and from most destinations within the city limits and
throughout the county.

around the City of Sonora.

2.2.6.    Non-Motorized Modes of Transportation
The Tuolumne County Transportation Council (TC2) which includes representation
from the City of Sonora, is responsible for approving the non-motorized element of
the county’s Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and addresses the provision of
bicycle and pedestrian facilities to serve residents and visitors countywide. Sonora
General Plan 2020 (Recreation and Circulation Elements) includes proposed routes
for bicycle and pedestrian facilities in addition to those contained in the Tuolumne
County Regional Transportation Plan. The Sonora General Plan 2020 Circulation
Element includes a Non-Motorized Element addressing proposed bicycle and
pedestrian routes providing transportation alternatives in addition to those identified
in the Tuolumne County RTP and the Recreation Element of Sonora General Plan
2020 (See Appendix 2F).
This element also identifies proposed sidewalk facilities (Appendix 2F). The
location of these facilities emphasizes the connection of concentrated population
centers with the city’s commercial centers, schools, government facilities, and similar
destinations.    As noted previously, steep terrain increases the cost of sidewalk
construction within many areas of the city. Topography also presents a challenge
for meeting grade requirements for wheelchair accessibility. Sonora is currently
pursuing additional funding for implementation of its Sidewalk Improvement Program.
Funding will include sidewalk rehabilitation, replacement and construction to facilitate
pedestrian traffic between housing, commercial facilities, schools and other
destination points.
2.2.7.    Park and Ride Facilities
There is a single park and ride facility is located on State Route 120 near Ponderosa
Lane in Groveland at Mile Post 32.2 and provides eight parking spaces.
In March, 2004, Caltrans, District 10, published an updated Park and Ride Plan.
That plan identified five new park and ride facilities planned for the county:
        •       Near the Bypass on State Route 108 between Standard Road and Via
                Este in the East Sonora Area between post mile 4.33 and 5.87
        •       Near the Bypass on State Route 108 between Via Este and Sunshine
                Road in the East Sonora Area between post mile 5.87 and 6.86
        •       Near State Route 49 in Jamestown at mile post 14.34
        •       Junction of State Route 129 and 108 at Yosemite Junction, mile post
                12.08
        •       Near the Junction of SR-120 and Highway J-59 (La Grange Road),
                Mile post 8.19
There are no Park and Ride facilities existing or planned within or adjacent to the city
limits as of 2004. The nearest planned facility is more than four miles from the city
limits.     Given the city’s status as a commercial, tourist, and work center for the
county, a park and ride facility could help alleviate some of the demands on the city’s
circulation system. Potential locations for such facilities might include, but are not
limited to:

2.2.8.     Aviation
There are no airports located within the city limits of Sonora. The county operates
an airport in Groveland and one in Columbia. The city is located well outside of the
sphere of influence of the Pine Mountain Lake Airport located in Groveland. The
Columbia Airport is located north of the city which is located entirely outside of the
Columbia Airport Influence Area Boundary which ends at the northernmost limits of
the City of Sonora (Figure 10).
As noted in the 1996 Regional Transportation Plan, there is a great need to provide
emergency medical transportation by helicopter from remote areas of Tuolumne
County to hospitals in Sonora and adjacent areas. In March, 2004, the Sonora
Regional Medical Center facilities on Greenley Road began operating an on-the-
ground helipad for medical helicopters located at the western end of the hospital
(away from Greenley Road). It is anticipated that up to 50 flights per year may be
generated by Sonora Regional Medical Center for this helipad. Tuolumne General
Hospital reports that it also uses air ambulance services approximately 50 times per
year and plans a cooperative use of the new Sonora Regional Medical Center
helipad. Therefore, approximately 100 flights per year are anticipated from the new
helipad at the Sonora Regional Medical Center facilities on Greenley Road. The
flight plan for air ambulance helicopters to the Sonora Regional Medical Center is to
and from a southerly direction.

   2.A.c       Require Dedication of Rights-of-Way
               Require new development and significant expansions of existing
               developments to dedicate right-of-way consistent with the city’s
               adopted right-of-way standards and as included in the Tuolumne
               County Regional Transportation Plan.
               The city may allow exceptions to these rights-of-way dedication
               standards subject to findings that the standards established herein are
               unacceptable. In allowing an exception to the right-of-way standards,
               the city shall consider the following:
                     i.  Right-of-way needs versus the physical impacts on
                         surrounding properties

                   iii.  Impacts on general safety
                   iv.   Impacts on quality of life as perceived by residents
                    v.   Geographical, environmental, historical, social or economic
                         factors
               Exceptions to the standards will only be allowed after all reasonable
               measures and options are explored, including reducing the size of
               planned developments and identifying alternative locations for
               roadways, bicycle and pedestrian ways, and other associated facilities
               compatible with the city’s adopted Streets and Highways Master Plan
               (General Plan 2020 Appendix 2E).
   2.A.d       Adopt Level of Service (LOS) Standards for the City Roadway
               System
               The following levels of service shall be required for new development,
               or expansions of existing developments, for roadways serving such
               developments, for intersections impacted by such developments, and
               for roadways located within the boundaries of such developments:
               Local Roads. LOS C on local roads within one-half mile of collectors
               and arterials. Minimum peak hour LOS for intersections of local roads
               with other local roads and connectors shall be LOS C. Minimum
               peak hour LOS for intersections of local roads with arterials shall be
               LOS D.
               Collector Roads. LOS C on collector roadways except within one-
               half mile of other collectors or arterials where the standard may be
               LOS D. The minimum peak hour LOS standard for intersections of
               collectors and arterials shall be LOS D.
               LOS on city roads shall be evaluated using the methodology included
               in General Plan 2020 Appendix 2B.
               The city may allow exceptions to these LOS standards subject to
               findings that improvements or other measures required to achieve the

               LOS standards established herein are unacceptable. In allowing an
               exception to the LOS standard, the city shall consider the following:
                     i. Number of hours per day that the intersection or roadway
                        segment would operate at conditions worse than the
                        adopted standard
                    ii. The ability of the required improvement to significantly
                        reduce peak hour delay and improve traffic operations
                   iii. Right-of-way needs versus the physical impacts on
                        surrounding properties
                   iv.  Visual effects of the required improvement on the
                        community’s identity and character
                    v.  Environmental impacts including air quality and noise
                        impacts
                   vi.  Construction and right-of-way acquisition costs
                  vii.  Impacts on general safety
                  viii. Impacts of the required construction phasing and traffic flows
                   ix.  Impacts on quality of life as perceived by residents
                    x.  Geographical, environmental, historical, social or economic
                        factors
                   xi.  Ability to equitably fund needed improvements
                  xii.  Importance of proposed improvements in relation to other
                        road needs given limited resources.
               Exceptions to the standards will only be allowed after all reasonable
               measures and options are explored (e.g., use of non-motorized forms
               of transportation, reducing the size of the planned developments).
   2.A.e       City Level of Service Standard for State Highways
               Support, when reasonable, the state’s goal of maintaining a concept
               Level of Service “C” on State Route 49 and 108 for both mainlines
               and intersections. Caltrans may consider a Level of Service “D” on
               State Route 49 or 108 through the City of Sonora. The methodology
               for evaluating Level of Service on State Highways shall be pursuant to
               the Highway Capacity Manual and Transportation Research Record
               1194, as amended.

3.1.     Introduction
3.1.1.   Requirements
Government Code Sections 65302 and 65580 through 65588 requires local jurisdictions to
prepare and implement a plan for providing affordable housing that:
           •   Identifies and analyzes existing and projected housing needs;
           •   Analyzes population and employment trends in relation to the locality’s
               existing and projected housing needs for all income levels;
           •   Analyzes household characteristics and housing stock conditions;
           •   Inventories adequate sites for housing, including vacant sites and sites
               having the potential for redevelopment with an analysis of the relationship of
               zoning and public services to these sites;
           •   Analyzes governmental and non-governmental constraints upon
               maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels;
           •   Analyzes special housing needs for the handicapped, elderly and persons in
               need of emergency shelter;
           •   Analyzes opportunities for energy conservation with respect to residential
               development;
           •   Addresses preservation of subsidized housing units
This Housing Element is intended to meet the requirements of HCD’s 2001-2009 planning
cycle and to reflect the housing needs of the city’s population pursuant to the 2000 Federal
Census.

               Sonora General Plan 2020 and its Housing Element. Landowners were
               encouraged to provide input regarding future development plans. A follow-
               up public meeting was held on June 26, 2003, to discuss landowner
               proposals. The Open House ultimately resulted in discussions between the
               city and two landowners with two vacant properties with a high potential for
               providing multi-family housing.      The city and the landowners agreed to
               amend existing land use designations on these two potential multi-family
               properties—both located within walking distance of commercial and
               employment centers.

3.2.       Executive Summary
The “typical” Sonora resident has a median age of 41.4 years old, is white, female, earns a
median income for a family of four of $47,800, is living in a rented single-family structure
built in 1960 and is one of 4,610 individuals residing within the city limits in 2003. To meet
the needs of this “typical” Sonora resident and all other residents of the city now and in the
future, the city has prepared this 2001-2009 Housing Element.
The City of Sonora anticipates that 405 residential units will be necessary to fill the city’s
housing needs for the planning period of 2001 to 2009. 122 of these units are needed to
house low and very low income households. Currently, the city has an over-concentration
of very low income households (35% of the city’s households) in comparison to the county
(21% of county households). The following regional housing needs allocation is intended
to encourage a more equitable distribution of housing between the city and county for very
low income households while providing affordable housing for all income levels within the
city.

Program Goals:
            •   Assist Six First-Time Homebuyers in Securing Housing
            •   Rehabilitate Ten Substandard Housing Units
RDA Overview
The Sonora Redevelopment Agency (RDA) was established in 1985 and established a
project area in 1991. The plan includes multiple programs for improving affordable housing
opportunities within the city. RDA programs assisting in the provision of affordable housing
are described in the following paragraphs. In the RDA’s second 5-year plan (extending
through 2004), has allocated $449,000 as its 20% housing set-aside. Funds are being
used to improve affordable housing opportunities within the city through the following
programs. The 2005-2010 Redevelopment Plan has not yet been drafted, therefore
appropriations for the various programs have not yet been determined. However,
allocations to the following programs are expected to be similar to those indicated.
Sonora Homebuyer’s Assistance Loan Program
Implementation Program Goal: Assist Six First-Time Homebuyers in Securing Housing
2000 Census statistics reveal that 60.2% of the city’s population rents housing in
comparison to 39.8% owning their homes (in comparison, only 29% of Tuolumne County’s
households rent their homes with the remaining 71% owning homes). In response to this
disparity between home-owners and renters within the city, the City of Sonora has acted to
increase opportunities for low-income households to purchase homes.               Since 1998,
$35,000 in loan assistance funding has been made available to first-time homebuyers
through the city using funding from the Community Development Block Grant program.
In July, 2003, the Sonora City Council voted to use redevelopment money set aside for
housing needs to supplement CDBG funding by an additional $50,000.                   The city’s
homebuyer’s assistance program now provides first-time home buyers with up to $85,000 in
funding assistance to purchase a home.         Program funding provides monies for second,
deferred loans requiring no monthly payments.           Applicants must secure a primary loan
from a commercial lender and provide money for a down payment. Homeowners are
required to pay back the second loan in full in 31 years. Applicants must meet income
limits and not have owned a home within the past three years (unless they are displaced
homemakers or single parents who owned a home with their spouse).
The RDA has earmarked $400,000 for the provision of low income housing through 2004
which is being used for this program.         Program 3.A.g of this element addresses the
continuance of this program in the city.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                      Housing-77

                                                                                  Chapter 3: Housing

$39,000 has been allocated pursuant to this program through 2004.           Program 3.C.c of this
element addresses the implementation of this program in the city.
Neighborhood Improvement Program
$10,000 has been allocated for neighborhood clean-up and beautification projects through
2004.
Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program/CDBG Reuse Plan
Implementation Program Goal: Rehabilitate Ten Substandard Housing Units
111 of the city’s housing units (4.8%) are substandard.        49.6% of the city’s housing units
are more than 50 years of age. The city plans to maintain implementation of the following
program to encourage rehabilitation of up to ten substandard housing units through 2009 for
affordable housing:
This program provides no or low-interest loans of up to $30,000 for the rehabilitation of
existing housing units owned and/or occupied by low income households. The program
includes a homeowner’s program, rental program and deferred loan program. The city also
proposes to include the following in establishing priorities for rehabilitation projects:
        •       Encourage room additions in conjunction with city-assisted rehabilitation
                efforts to ease overcrowding
        •       Give priority to over-payers for city-assisted homeowner rehabilitations
        •       Target substandard, dilapidated, and vacant housing in need of repair for re-
                entry into the housing stock
The city anticipates earmarking redevelopment funds in the 2005-2010 Redevelopment Plan
to provide gap funding for housing rehabilitation projects.
Programs 3.A.h and 3.C.i of this element address housing rehabilitation within the city.
Program 3.C.h addresses the adoption and implementation of the Mills Act within the city to
assist in meeting housing rehabilitation goals.
3.2.2.     Removing Government Constraints, Providing Incentives
Program Goals: Remove Constraints and Provide Incentives to Increase the Stock of
Affordable Housing by at least 122 Units
The city intends to encourage the provision of 122 affordable housing units through new
construction through 2009 through implementation of the following programs:
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                         Housing-78

                                                                                Chapter 3: Housing
Second Dwelling Ordinance
Program Goal: 30 New Affordable Housing Units
The city recently adopted a second unit ordinance (Appendix 3D) which allows for the
construction of small, second residential units as a permitted use on residentially zoned land
and subject to the provisions of the ordinance. It is anticipated that approximately 30 new
affordable housing units will be added to the city’s housing through 2009 as a result of this
new ordinance. Program 3.B.e addresses the implementation of the new second dwelling
ordinance in the city.
Increase the Availability of Land for Multi-Family Development
Program Goal: Designate 17.9± acres of Land for High Density Residential Development
(HDR) with a capacity to Provide 190± New Multi-Family Residential Units
The city is proposing the designation of 17.9± acres of vacant land to high-density
residential adjacent to commercial and employment centers in the General Plan 2020 Land
Use Element update providing capacity for 190± new multi-family residential units (NOTE:
Much of this designation is in the form of the Special Planning Residential Land Use
designation). The majorities of these acres are vacant, have ready access to public water
and public sewer, are adjacent to existing or proposed commercial and employment centers,
and are not surrounded by established neighborhoods. Therefore, it is anticipated that
there will be minimal or no opposition to multi-family projects proposed in these locations
based on changes to the character of established neighborhoods.              Maps providing the
locations of the 17.9± acres of high-density residential (and Special Planning) vacant and
underdeveloped parcels associated with this program are identified in Appendix 3G and the
development of each parcel is evaluated in General Plan 2020 Section 3.7.1. Program
3.A.c establishes minimum densities for medium and high-density residential parcels to
facilitate the provision of affordable housing in the city.
Infill Incentives
Program Goal: Create Five New Affordable Housing Units.
The city will encourage infill projects benefiting low to moderate income households through
the construction of duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes as infill projects in appropriately zoned
areas and through the provision of incentives for low-to-moderate income projects (Program
3A.a and 3.A.d).
Municipal Code Amendments and Incentives
Program Goal: Encourage the Provision of 122 New Affordable Housing Units
The city intends to amend the Municipal Code to remove government constraints and
provide incentives (e.g., including: fee deferrals, fee waivers, alternative development
standards, minimum densities, development agreements, and updating the city’s density
bonus ordinance) to encourage the provision of affordable through implement of Programs
3.A.a, 3.A.b, 3.A.c, 3.A.d, 3.B.c, 3.B.d, and 3.B.f.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                        Housing-79

                                                                              Chapter 3: Housing
Investigate Annexation
Program Goal: Begin to establish the groundwork for new affordable housing units in the
planning cycle commencing in 2010
The city has identified several locations adjacent to the existing city limits and within the
city’s sphere of influence that may provide additional land for construction of affordable
housing. Examples of suitable locations include, but are not limited to: the area north of
Mono Way between Andy’s and east to Mountain View Drive/Sanguinetti Loop turn-off.
This program is expected to occur in the 2009-2014 planning period, although planning for
this program is slated to begin prior to 2009. Program 3.A.e addresses implementation of
this program.
3.2.3.     Special Needs Housing
The city intends to remove governmental constraints as the city’s primary mechanism for
encouraging housing for special needs populations.
3.2.3.1. FEMALE HEADS OF HOUSEHOLDS
The 2000 Census reports that there are 337 (16.4%) households within the city headed by a
single family member (male or female). 85 of these households have income below the
poverty level. However, a recent study completed by the city indicates that this special
needs group is more widespread than reported in the Census. A sampling of 48.5% of
households undertaken by the city in 2003 identified 440 female-headed households with
357 (81%) of these with household incomes at or below the poverty level.
The city anticipates addressing the special needs of these households through the provision
of new affordable housing, including housing with two or more bedrooms, through
implementation of the programs described in the preceding paragraphs. Program 3.D.e of
this element addresses the provision of housing for this special needs population.
3.2.3.2. ELDERLY
There are 572 households with residents 65 years of age or older. More than 79% of the
city’s group quarters (e.g., nursing homes, prisons, shelters) are occupied by residents 65
years of age or older living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. The city anticipates
addressing the special needs of these households by amending the municipal code to
expand the variety of districts in which senior housing facilities may be located to better
accommodate the provision of facilities for the elderly within the city and to recognize tri-
level living communities for the elderly. Program 3.D.a of this element addresses the
provision of housing for this special needs population.
3.2.3.3. FARM WORKERS
The city’s farm worker population is primarily migrant. The city anticipates addressing the
special needs of these households by amending the municipal code to identify appropriate
locations for farm-worker housing to better accommodate the provision of farm worker
housing in the city. Program 3.D.k of this element addresses the provision of housing for
this special needs population.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                      Housing-80

                                                                               Chapter 3: Housing
3.2.3.4. HOMELESS
The city will continue to support the maintenance of an emergency shelter within the city
limits. The city will continue to support the maintenance of a transitional shelter within the
city limits. The city anticipates addressing the special needs of this population by amending
the municipal code to expand the variety of districts in which homeless facilities may be
located to better accommodate the provision of these facilities within the city. Programs
3.D.b and 3.D.e of this element address the provision of housing for this special needs
population.
3.2.3.5. WOMEN
The city will continue to support the maintenance of a safe home within the city limits. The
city anticipates addressing the special needs of this population by amending the municipal
code to expand the variety of districts in which homeless facilities may be located to better
accommodate the provision of these facilities within the city.          Program 3.D.e of this
element addresses the provision of housing for this special needs population.
3.2.3.6. DISABLED
The city has a population of 1,080 persons of disabled status. The city’s disabled are
largely composed of those with physical and mental disabilities. However, a large segment
of the disabled population is employment disabled and unable to leave their homes. The
city will continue to enforce federal and state regulations pertaining to the Americans with
Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act In particular, rehabilitation projects supported with
city funds, shall include consideration of construction design which facilitates access into
and movements within housing units by the elderly and physically disabled. In addition, this
element includes mandates for removing constraints for disabled access, including a waiver
of setbacks to accommodate the construction of access ramps. Additional discussion of the
special needs of the disabled and the city’s disabled population are found in General Plan
2020 Section 3.5 (3.5.3) within this element (Special Needs Households) and in General
Plan 2020 Section 3.8 (Housing Constraints). Program 3.D.g of this element addresses
the provision of housing for this special needs population.
3.2.4.     Other Housing-Related Programs
3.2.4.1. JOBS/HOUSING BALANCE
The city proposes three primary strategies for achieving a balance between jobs and
housing within the city:
         •   Supporting training for low-wage earners for higher paying jobs in demand by city
             employers (e.g., nurses, laboratory technicians) by maintaining the city’s
             Downtown Education Center and through Columbia College, Job Connection
             Tuolumne County, Mother Lode Job Training, and similar agencies
         •   Planning for multi-family housing adjacent to the city’s commercial and
             employment centers
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                       Housing-81

                                                                              Chapter 3: Housing
         •   Continuing to include provisions in the zoning code to permit residential units
             above commercial establishments.
The city will use its website as a primary tool for assisting in the implementation of the
preceding programs. Programs 3.A.f and 3.D.f (Education Center) of this element address
job training and education as a mechanism for increasing employee wages and thereby
increasing access to affordable housing.
3.2.4.2. IMPROVE COORDINATION
As necessary to support implementation of many of the city’s housing programs and to
achieve the city’s housing goals, the city also proposes to use its website to facilitate
coordination between the numerous regional agencies providing housing assistance.
Programs 3.A.j and 3.D.j of this element address coordination and consolidation of housing
programs in the region.
3.2.4.3. REPLACEMENT OF AT-RISK AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS
There are three state or federally-assisted housing projects, totaling 174 units, within the city
limits that are at risk of conversion to non-affordable housing during the 2001-2009 planning
period. Five additional units will become at-risk through 2019. The city proposes to post
the inventory of at-risk units in the city on its website to ensure that agencies interested in
preserving at-risk units have ample time to plan for acquisition of these units. Program
3.C.e addresses this activity.
In addition, the city is investigating its ability to provide financial assistance for the
acquisition of some of the city’s at-risk units. Program 3.C.m addresses this activity.
3.3.       Review of the 1993 Housing Element
3.3.1.     Evaluation of 1993 Programs
3.3.1.1.   IDENTIFICATION OF ADEQUATE SITES
A. Maintain the General Plan 2020 Land Use Map to reflect changing needs and
conditions
There were no general plan amendments requested during the planning period, therefore,
no changes to specific land use designation on specific parcels were required.
However, during the planning period, a single-family residential housing development was
constructed on a prominent city hillside and requiring the removal of extensive vegetation
and soils. The project generated public concern about the appropriateness of allowing
residential development on hillsides due to visual impacts. This concern was directed at all
future residential development, including development of low and moderate income housing.
The city’s ability to apply density bonuses for affordable housing in the face of these public
concerns also became an issue.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                      Housing-82

                                                                               Chapter 3: Housing
In response, during the planning period, the City of Sonora adopted a hillside preservation
ordinance linking slope and topography to permitted residential density and adopting
guidelines for minimizing visual impacts of hillside development.
As a consequence, the consistency between allowable densities and hillside slopes for both
multi-family residential and other residential developments was a primary consideration in
the preparation of the Sonora General Plan 2020 Land Use Map.
B.      Amend title 17 (Zoning Ordinance) to maintain consistency between the
        general plan and zoning
See analyses for paragraphs A and D.
C.      Implement Chapter 17.49 of the zoning ordinance to allow mobile homes on
        lots in areas zoned for single-family residential
The City of Sonora, until recently, did not distinguish between mobile homes and single-
family (stick-built) residences in monthly building permit records.     However, the City of
Sonora Building Department estimates that there were approximately eight permits issued
for mobile homes during the planning period commencing in 1993. Since 2001, new mobile
homes have been tallied separately from other single-family residences.            This revised
method of building permit accounting is expected to improve the city’s ability to evaluate the
effectiveness of this program in the current planning period.
D.      Implement Chapter 17.55 of the zoning code (granny flats)
There were no applications for granny flats during the planning period.
However, in response to second dwelling legislation effective in January and July, 2003, the
city adopted a new second dwelling ordinance on June 30, 2003. A copy of that ordinance
is included in General Plan 2020 Appendix 3D.
E.      Continue to use the Planned Development land use designation to maximize
        the use of land
One application for affordable housing was received during the planning period on land
designated (in part) as Planned Development. The project was subsequently denied by the
city council based, in part, on concerns related to traffic safety. Litigation and an out-of-
court settlement ensued. Due, in part, to this failed application, the city initiated its update
of the 1986 General Plan to identify lands better-suited to high-density residential
development with better access to transportation facilities, and located in close proximity to
shopping and jobs.
The General Plan 2020 Land Use Map amends planned developments to “Special Planning”
designations and include two classes of Special Planning designations:
            •   Special Planning – Residential
            •   Special Planning – Mixed Use
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                      Housing-83

                                                                                 Chapter 3: Housing
Pursuant to Program 3.A.c, the city council will be considering establishment of a minimum
residential density standard, consistent with the city’s hillside preservation ordinance.
3.3.1.2. DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
A.      Due to reductions in state and federal funding available for housing, seek a
        coordinate effort with the Central Sierra Planning Council Staff and/or staff of
        HCD for assistance in completing the following programs: Small Cities CDBG
        Program;      FmHA 502 Homeownership Program; and the                      FmHA        504
        Rehabilitation Program.
The City of Sonora adopted or expanded the following programs, detailed in Sections 3.7.3
and 3.7.2 herein, during the preceding planning period and since 1993:
            •  Homebuyers Assistance Program
            •  Housing Rehabilitation Programs including: 1) the Homeowner’s Program, 2)
               Rental Program and 3) Deferred Loan Program
            •  The Sonora Redevelopment Agency (RDA) was established in 1985 and
               established a project area in 1991.           In the RDA’s second 5-year plan
               (extending through 2004), the RDA has allocated $449,000 as its 20%
               housing set-aside.      Funds will be used to improve affordable housing
               opportunities within the city.
Quantified achievements resulting from the preceding programs, as of June 30, 2003,
include:
            •  Conversion of a dilapidated apartment building into a 5-unit low-to-moderate
               income apartment building.
            •  Creation of one new low/moderate income rental unit.
            •  Assisting 22 low-to-moderate income households in purchasing homes since
               1997.
            •  Granting 34 low-interest loans for the rehabilitation of homes owned or
               occupied by low-to-moderate income households.
            •  Acquisition of a $1,100,000 CDBG general allocation from the California
               Department of Housing and Community Development to support the city’s
               Homebuyer’s Assistance Program.
            •  Rehabilitation of 52 rental units (includes 22 units reported for 1993-97)
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                        Housing-84

                                                                                Chapter 3: Housing
B.       Continue to support use of FmHA 515multi-unit construction program through
         early review and recommendations on projects through the area wide
         clearinghouse review process, and timely review of projects by the planning
         department, building department, planning commission and city council
See analysis for Section 3.3.1.1 paragraph A.
C.       Implement the city’s density bonus ordinance for those providing 25% of units
         affordable to low and moderate income households or 10% available to low
         income households
A single application was received during the planning period which qualified for a density
bonus. As described above, the project was subsequently denied by the city council based
on traffic safety concerns. Litigation and an out-of-court settlement ensued. Due, in part, to
this failed application, the city initiated its update of its 1986 General Plan to identify lands
better-suited to high-density residential development with better access to transportation
facilities, and located in close proximity to shopping and jobs.
3.3.1.3. REMOVAL OF GOVERNMENT CONSTRAINTS
A.       Periodically review and update the general plan to reflect changing needs and
         conditions
See analyses for Section 3.3.1.1 paragraphs A and D.
B.       Maintain the city’s zoning ordinance consistent with the general plan so that
         housing opportunities for all income groups remain available
See analyses for Section 3.3.1.1 paragraphs A and D.
C.       Periodically review fees for development permits so that they represent a fair
         charge for review and processing of applications
Fees for development fees were updated in 1998.                  A comparison of development
application fees for the City of Sonora and similar jurisdictions in the area is found in
General Plan 2020 Section 3.8.1.5.
D.       Consider correction of storm drainage problems in target areas in future CDBG
         applications
No applications for funding storm drainage problems were submitted during the planning
period.      Sewer upgrades were given priority during the planning period and the city
successfully acquired a $500,000 CDBG general allocation grant from the California
Department of Housing and Community Development for sewer upgrades within the city.
The Sonora Redevelopment Agency Five Year Plan (2000-2004) earmarks funding for
$115,000 for storm drain replacement and enhancements including funding to complete the
North Washington Storm Drainage Project (funded after the end of the 1993 planning
period) and $25,000 to conduct a professional study of drainage issues at Shepherd and
Steward Streets between Church and Theall.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                       Housing-85

                                                                             Chapter 3: Housing
3.3.1.4. CONSERVATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK
A.      Encourage the continuation of energy conservation and weatherization
        activities implemented by the Amador-Tuolumne Community Action Agency
During the planning period, the city provided (and continues to provide) informational
handouts at its public counter summarizing ATCAA’s weatherization programs and
availability.
B.      Continue to enforce the provisions of the UBC to provide consistent standards
        for the purpose of residential renovation
The city continued to enforce the UBC for new residential construction and renovation
throughout the planning period. Note: The city is currently completing an inventory of
historic structures. This inventory may encourage some homeowners to pursue use of the
State Historic Building Code for renovations. The inventory may also be used to identify
C.      Continue to implement Chapter 16.28 and 16.30 of the municipal code
        addressing the conversion of rental housing to condominiums and
        establishing standards to be met before any such conversion may take place
There were no applications for conversions of rental housing to condominiums during the
planning period.
D.      Continue to investigate the possibilities of using state CDBG and CDBG Reuse
        funds to complete housing rehab activities
See analysis for Section 3.3.1.2, paragraph A.
E.      Continue to support HUD Section 8 rental assistance to qualifying lower
        income households, recognizing that there are not enough Section 8
        certificates allocated to the area to meet the demand
No specific actions were identified for implementing this program. However, during the
planning period, the city’s Special Programs department continued to refer residents to the
Central Sierra Planning Council to investigate the availability of vouchers.
3.3.1.5. EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY
A.      Continue to process local complaints of housing discrimination by the city,
        Central Sierra Planning Council and Amador-Tuolumne Community Action
        Agency through implementation of the following programs:
        i.      Distribute pamphlets to low income residents discussing housing
                discrimination and landlord-tenant relations.           A housing advocacy
                program has been instituted to meet with landlords and realtors, radio
                shows and seminars advertised by radio and flyers which discuss equal
                opportunity housing.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                     Housing-86

                                                                             Chapter 3: Housing
        ii.    Access to legal aid services for housing complaints has been promoted
               through presentations at senior centers and other lower income groups
               as well as scheduling individual legal appoints to process complaints.
During the planning period, the city provided (and continues to provide) informational
handouts at its public counter and through the city’s Special Programs department regarding
housing discrimination. The city did not receive any complaints of housing discrimination
during the planning period and did not undertake the provision of legal aid services for any
housing complaints during the planning period due to lack of demand for these services.
3.3.1.6. PRESERVATION OF ASSISTED UNITS
A.      Develop a program to use CDBG, CDBG reuse funds and redevelopment set-
        aside funds in the event that measures must be taken to preserve at-risk units.
        The program could take the form of information distribution, housing
        advocacy, or limited rental subsidy or relocation assistance. Develop and
        implement the program prior to 1993, before the first assisted units are eligible
        for conversion.
This program has not been established. This element addresses the necessity of instituting
this program within the city.
3.3.1.7. QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
A.      Assist in the construction of 170 new housing units reflecting the housing
        needs outlined in the Area wide Housing Needs Plan. Assist in meeting the
        objective by providing an incentive for development of housing for low and
        moderate income households through density bonus provisions; second unit
        provisions; support of the use of FmHA 502 and 515 programs in appropriate
        locations.
The 1993 Housing Element projected that 170 new housing units would be constructed
through July, 1997. The city’s Building Department reports that only 23 new housing units
were constructed during that period. In contrast, 122 single family additions and alterations
were undertaken during the same period.
As detailed in the analysis for Section 3.3.1.2, paragraph A, during the planning period, city
programs resulted in:
            •  Creation of one new low/moderate income rental unit
            •  Adoption of a second residence ordinance on June 30, 2003
Since 1993, the city approved the Sunrise Hills Subdivision which created 87 new residential
lots.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                     Housing-87

                                                                                  Chapter 3: Housing
B.      Rehabilitate 75 units by July, 1997, for low and moderate income households
        through the use of the Small Cities CDBG program, CDBG Reuse funds, and
        potential Sonora Redevelopment Agency set-aside funds, Farmers Home
        Administration or HCD programs with program assistance through the Central
        Sierra Planning Council.
The 1993 Housing Element established a goal of rehabilitating 75 housing units prior to July,
1997. 22 units were rehabilitated during that period.
As detailed in analysis for Section 3.3.1.2, paragraph A, during the planning period, city
programs resulted in:
             •  Conversion of a dilapidated apartment building into a 5-unit low-to-moderate
                income apartment building
             •  Granting 34 low-interest loans for the rehabilitation of homes owned or
                occupied by low-to-moderate income households
             •  Acquiring a $35,000 Planning and Technical Assistance Grant from HCD to
                conduct a housing inventory survey to assist in the update of the city’s 1993
                Housing Element (and assist in the identification of housing units in need of
                rehabilitation)
             •  Rehabilitation of 52 rental units (includes 22 units reported for 1993-97)
C.      Conserve 75 housing units through July, 1997, for low and moderate income
        households using the existing Section 8 program administered by CSPC,
        CDBG Rehab loan agreements, CDBG Re-use fund agreements and potential
        use of Sonora Redevelopment Agency housing set-aside funds.
The 1993 Housing Element established a goal of conserving 75 housing units through July,
1997.        No units became at-risk during the planning period, therefore, none were
conserved.
As illustrated above, many of the city’s quantified goals fell short of their targets. A slump in
the real estate market commencing in approximately 1993 and continuing through the end of
the planning period is the primary reason for this shortfall. Evidence of this is found in the
subsequent 3-year period (1998-2000) where new construction increased to 68 new housing
units and 9 rehabilitations were completed. Additions and alterations to the existing single-
family housing stock continue to outpace new construction and rehabilitations with 127
occurring between 1998 and 2000. This trend continues through 2003.

Analysis:
As indicated in the preceding table, population levels in the city have fluctuated widely from
a -3.3% annual percentage decline to a 3.5% annual percentage increase over the 140+
years in which population records have been kept for Tuolumne County and the City of
Sonora.
Over the long-term, the average growth rate for the City of Sonora has averaged between
0.7% and 1.75% annually.
As illustrated in Table 2 (See General Plan 2020 Chapter 1, Land Use), the City of Sonora
can expect its population to grow to between 5,144 and 5,948 individuals by the year 2020.
Applying the county’s projected growth rate, the city’s projected population would be
approximately 5,656 individuals.
For the purposes of General Plan 2020 and this analysis, the population for the City of
Sonora is expected to reach between 5,144 and 5,948 resident individuals in the city limits.
          Based on historical growth rates over the long term, the City of Sonora
       anticipates its resident population will reach between 5,144 and 5,948
     individuals by 2020— an increase of between 480 and 1,284 individuals
As the county seat, and the major employment and commercial center of Tuolumne County,
the City of Sonora sees a daily influx of non-resident population that increases the city’s
daytime population. The city estimates that the daytime population could increase to
between 22,000 and 25,000 individuals.

Analysis:
The largest segment of the city’s population continues to be those aged 20-44 years old,
however the city’s overall population is aging as evidenced by the 5.8% decrease in 20-44
year-olds and the 5.8% increase in 45-64 year-olds in the city between 1990 and 2000.
The 41.1 year-old median age of the city’s citizens is 4.5 years older than the 36.6 year-old
statewide median. The city has a high concentration of residents 65 years of age or older
(20.4%) in comparison to state and nation-wide numbers (e.g., the overall percentage of
those 65 or older state-wide is 10.6% and 12.4% for the United States).                             The
comparatively older age of the city’s citizens is consistent with the general population
characteristics of the Sierra Nevada foothill region.             However, the city’s population also
has a markedly higher concentration of those 65 years of age or older than does Tuolumne
County (20.4% in the city versus 14.7% in Tuolumne County) and other neighboring foothill
communities.
Based on the city’s high concentration of those over 65 years of age; the City of Sonora
Housing Element includes programs emphasizing the needs of its senior citizens.
Specifically, Program 3.D.a encourages “Tri-Level Living Communities” which provide
assisted living, unassisted living and nursing home opportunities within the same community
to allow seniors to remain with their spouses and allow seniors to remain local and avoid
major changes in living conditions and locations throughout their lives. In addition, the
element identifies incentives for tri-level communities and provides direction for removing
governmental constraints (e.g., acquisition of a conditional use permit) for rest homes,
convalescent homes and other related senior facilities.                The element provides further
direction for removing governmental constraints which could hamper construction of
congregate care, convalescent, long-term care facilities, tri-level communities and other
related senior facilities as a permitted use within many of the city’s zoning districts.
The data indicates that the “graying” of the city is due to the increasing age of long-time
residents remaining in the city. However, a loss of 25-34 year-olds in the city population
also appears to be a significant contributor to the “graying” of the city.12 While the reasons
for the city’s loss in the 25-34 year old segment of the population are unclear, two factors
are considered in this element as potentially contributing to this trend:
         ●        A lack of affordable housing in the city (See Section 3.9, Goals, Policies &
                  Implementation Programs herein); and
12
    The number of 25-34 year-olds has declined significantly in the city in comparison to other age
    groups. In 1990, 716 or 17.2% of the city population was 25-34. If these residents continued
    living in the city through 2000, a comparable number of 35-44 year olds would be found in the city
    in 2000. However, only 591 individuals aged 35-44 live in the City of Sonora in 2000 indicating
    that at 4.3% of the city’s population left the city between the ages of 25 and 35 between 1990 and
    2000.

Trends:
The gender of the population in 2000 has changed by approximately 1.4% since 1990 when
46.7% of the population was male and 53.3% was female.                       In 1990, there were
approximately 6.6% more females than males in the city. In 2000, the city has
approximately 9.4% more females than males.
Analysis:
The population of the city is becoming increasingly more female. Data indicates that the
most significant increases in the female segment of the population are occurring in the 45-
59 year-old and 65+ age groups. The city will continue to address the city’s population of
single female headed households with programs to address the special needs of this
population (e.g., living below the poverty level, first-time home purchase assistance, child
care). These programs are addressed in Sections 3.5 and 3.9, herein.

Analysis
As indicated in the preceding tables, there is little ethnic diversity in the City of Sonora
where the population is more than 90% white. The city’s population is ethnically similar to,
but less diverse than that of the county where 85% of the population is white (due, in part,
to the presence of a state prison in the county). The only marked trend in the ethnicity of the
city’s population is an increase in the categories of “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
Islander, Other Race, and Two or More Races.” It is likely that this statistical change
represents a change in the reporting preferences of individuals in the population rather than
in an actual increase in one of these ethnic population(s) in the City of Sonora.          This
assumption is supported by the nearly identical values representing a decline in the white
population (-3.5%) versus the increase in the new population categories (+3.4%). Normally,
such a population change would be triggered by a change in the employment opportunities
or other stimulus (e.g., location of a new prison) in the area. No such change has occurred.
The Hispanic and Latino populations in the city remain unchanged at 24% below the overall
state composition in which 32.4% of the population is Hispanic or Latino.
Based on these trends (or lack thereof), special housing needs based on ethnicity are likely
to play only a small roll in housing issues in the City of Sonora over the planning period.
The identification of appropriate locations for farm worker housing in the city is expected to
be the primary issue to be addressed in the city’s housing element with respect to ethnicity.

decreasing annually by 0.5 and 1.5 percent per year, but have been consistently higher than
the unemployment rate for the state. The Sonora/Tuolumne County area had an annual
average unemployment rate of 5.5% in 2001. The average annual unemployment rate for
the county has fluctuated from a high of 15.4% in 1983 to the 2001 low of 5.5%.
Projected Conditions
Growth Industries
Fastest growing industries in the Sonora/Tuolumne County area include:
           •   Services/Health Services
               The fasted growing industry - projected to increase by 8.2% by 2004. Within
               this category, health services are expected to create a demand for 100 new
               jobs.
           •   Retail Trade
           •   Expected to see a 5% increase by 2004.
New and expanding industries in Sonora/Tuolumne County area include:
           •   Tourism
               The local economy has been diversifying and tourism has become an
               increasingly important industry.
           •   Non-resource based industries
               With the decline in the mining and timber industries, other industries are
               growing in response to the changing needs of the county, moving beyond
               resource-based industries and towards the growing use of computers and
               electronics.

Summary/Analysis
Sonora is Tuolumne County’s retail, service and commercial center. Because of this large
concentration of retailers within the city limits, many of the county’s minimum wage
employees work and live in Sonora. Economic projections indicate that this population of
minimum wage employees is likely to increase over the life of this Housing Element as
demand for retail services continues to grow. There is a need for affordable housing for
minimum-to-low wage earners in close proximity to the city’s work centers.

                                                                                   Chapter 3: Housing
Recommended Strategies for Achieving Jobs/Housing Balance
Train low-wage earners for higher paying jobs
One strategy for meeting the city’s affordable housing goals is to raise the wages of the
minimum-to-low wage earners. One means of accomplishing this, while at the same time
promoting economic development through the provision of a trained labor force, is to focus
on job training for low-wage earners emphasizing those occupations in the highest demand
within or in close proximity to the city limits (e.g., nursing, laboratory technicians, correctional
officer training, teachers, computer/electronics technicians).
As an example, both Sonora Community Hospital and Tuolumne General Hospital are
located within the city limits.     The high demand for nurses and laboratory technicians is
currently unmet and local hospital administrators are anxious to build a local labor force to
fill these moderate-wage positions.
Existing resources which could be used, in part, for job re-training include:
         Downtown Education Center
         The city’s Downtown Education Center (D.E.C.) is predominantly used by the
         Amador Tuolumne Community Action Agency (ATCAA) as a family learning center.
         The focus of the family learning center is the implementation of a model Family
         Literacy Program which assists adults in entering the job marked and young children
         in achieving success in school.
         Columbia College
         Columbia College also uses the facility for some evening classes. Student
         attendance through the college at the D.E.C. normally ranges between 22 and 30
         students. College classes at the D.E.C. include Spanish, child development,
         business administration, and skills development class.          The college has reported
         that the facility provides one of the few off-campus sites that is affordable, however,
         larger classes of 25-30 students are too large for the facility.            Long-distance
         learning via satellite also is offered at the D.E.C. Long-distance courses currently
         include a class in child-development.
         Other Employment Assistance Agencies and Programs
         Agencies and programs available to Sonora residence include: Job Connection
         Tuolumne County, Mother Lode Job Training, Sonora High School’s Regional
         Occupation Program (ROP) and similar agencies and programs.
Provide affordable housing in close proximity to work areas
A second strategy for meeting the city’s affordable housing goals is to locate affordable
housing within walking distance of the city’s commercial centers where businesses
employing minimum wage workers are concentrated.
Commercial & Residential Uses
Another strategy to assist in achieving a balance between the city’s jobs and housing will be
to continue to include provisions in the zoning code to permit residential units above
commercial establishments.

Analysis:
The city’s household characteristics are more diverse than those of the county and include
fewer households composed of the “traditional” married-couple-with-children. For example:
            •  Just over one-third of the city’s households are married couples (with or
               without children) in contrast to the 54% of married couple households (with or
               without children) in the county.
            •  Sonora has nearly twice the number of single-family headed households with
               children (16.4%) in comparison to the county (8.4%)
            •  The city has a nearly equal number of family households (50.9%) and non-
               family households (49.1%). In contrast, less than one-third of county
               households (32.2%) are non-family households.
            •  The average size of households in the city remains constant at 2.06 persons
               per household—slightly smaller than the size of households in the county
               indicating that the size of individual affordable housing units in the city could
               be smaller than those found in the county. The average household size in
               the county is 2.36 persons (with an average family size of 2.82).
The diversity of the city’s households calls for a corresponding diversity in housing choices.
In general, the preceding statistics indicate that housing units in the city may best suit the
city’s population with both comparatively small units (for couples without children and
singles living alone) and relatively large, less expensive, units for single-family headed
households with children (coupled with the provision of first-time home-buyers assistance
offered by the city for these households).
3.4.2.2. HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND HOUSING COSTS
The average household size in the City of Sonora is 2.06 persons with an average family
size of 2.75 individuals.      Therefore, the following analysis is based on incomes for
households with two persons and with three persons.

/b/ For comparative purposes, 1990 utility rates have been used
/c/ See following paragraphs for justification of a higher median cost for a single-family residence in the City of
Sonora.
The preceding table reports an average housing cost of $138,000 in the City of Sonora per
the 2000 Census. Based on 2002 annual statistics from the Tuolumne County Association
of Realtors, the average asking price of a home in the greater Sonora area (which includes
areas within and adjacent to Sonora—including relatively costly homes in Apple Valley) was
in excess of $466,000 with an average sale price of approximately $231,350 per home.

A sampling of the weekly real estate multiple listings from March, 2002, sorted for listings
within the city limits, reported 23 listings ranging in price from $162,000 to $435,000 with an
average asking price of $278,548. In one of the city’s most moderately-priced subdivisions
(Sonora Knolls) the asking price of a three bedroom, two-bath, 1,400 sq. ft. single family
modular residence was $235,000 as of December 31, 2003.
For the first six months of 2003, the average selling price of a home within the city limits was
$209,880. Per Mike Wright of Wright Appraisals in Sonora, the median purchase price of
a home in the City of Sonora is expected to be approximately $225,000 and may range as
high as $250,000.
Based on the preceding, for the purposes of the following analysis, the average cost of a
house in the City of Sonora is projected to be $237,500.
Rental rates identified in the preceding table per the 2000 Census appear to be relatively
consistent with actual city rental costs. One of the more expensive rentals in the city--An
“executive” three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath rental home in Sonora Knolls—has an
asking rental price of $1,650.00 per month indicative of an upper limit rental cost within the
city.
Analysis:
For the purposes of the following analysis, housing shall be considered to be “affordable” at
levels of 30% or less of the gross annual income for an individual household. Based on the
income levels for two and three-person households, monthly and annual “affordable”
housing payments may be projected as follows:

Rental Opportunities
Based on the preceding income figures and housing costs, a very low income household
with two persons could afford rental costs for a studio apartment and could potentially afford
rent on a one-bedroom apartment. While these accommodations may be acceptable for a
married couple without children, these living arrangements would be difficult for a two-
person household consisting of a single parent with one or more children (forced to share a
single bedroom).        In contrast, a low income household with two persons would have
significantly greater opportunities to find an affordable rental unit with two bedrooms. This
indicates that the very low income households, especially single parents with one or more
children should be considered a high priority for housing assistance programs.
Ownership Opportunities
For an analysis of home ownership opportunities, a monthly mortgage payment is projected
to be approximately 1% of the total mortgage.
Per the preceding figures, very low income two-person households could afford a monthly
mortgage payment of up to $477.50 and a low income two-person household could afford
up to a $765.00 monthly mortgage payment. At present, the city offers programs totaling
up to $85,000 in first-time home buyers assistance. This means that a very low income
two-person household could, with maximum first-time home buyers assistance, purchase a
home priced at approximately $132,750 ($104,750± below the average cost of a home in the
city); and a low-income two-person households could afford a home selling for up to
$161,500 ($76,000 below the average home cost in the city) . While homes priced between
$132,750 and $161,500 are available in the city from time to time, the supply of homes in
this price range is relatively small. This indicates a potential need to consider increasing the
amount available for first-time home buyers for very-low income two-person families.
Alternatively, the city might consider targeting lower-cost one-bedroom homes for
rehabilitations with an emphasis on bedroom additions for these homes (coupled with first-
time home buyers assistance).

Rental Opportunities
Based on the preceding income figures and housing costs, a very low income household
with three persons could afford rental costs for a studio apartment and potentially for a one-
bedroom apartment.         Studio apartment accommodations would be difficult for either a
married couple with a child or for a single parent with two or more children (forced to share
bedrooms).        In contrast, a low income household with three persons would have
significantly greater opportunities to find an affordable rental unit with two bedrooms and
could potentially find an affordable rental unit with three bedrooms. These figures indicate
that the very low income households in three-person households, including both married
couples with one or more children and single parents with two or more children, should be
considered a high priority for housing assistance programs.
Ownership Opportunities
For an analysis of home ownership opportunities, a monthly mortgage payment is projected
to be approximately 1% of the total mortgage.
Per the preceding figures, very low income three-person households could afford a monthly
mortgage payment of up to $537.50 and a low income three-person household could afford
up to a $860.00 monthly mortgage payment. At present, the city offers programs totaling
up to $85,000 in first-time home buyers assistance. This means that a very low income
three-person household could, with maximum first-time home buyers assistance, purchase a
home priced at approximately $138,750 ($98,750± below the average cost of a home in the
city); and a low-income three-person households could afford a home selling for up to
$171,000 ($66,500 below the average home cost in the city) .             Homes priced in the
$138,750 range are available in the city from time to time, however, the supply of homes in
this price range is quite small. Low-income three-person households have an increased
likelihood of locating a home in the $171,000 price range. Again, this indicates a potential
need to consider increasing the amount available for first-time home buyers for very-low
income two-person families. Alternatively, the city might consider targeting lower-cost one-
bedroom homes for rehabilitations with an emphasis on bedroom additions for these homes
(and coupled with first-time home-buyers assistance).
3.4.2.3. OVERPAYMENT
Households paying more than 30% gross annual income are considered to be overpaying
for rent or mortgage payments.

Most owners overpaying are low and very low income households, while 98.6% of renters
overpaying are low and very low income households. This indicates a potential need for
increased rental assistance in the city.

Characteristics
Per Census 2000, more than half of the city’s households are low and very low income
households. The City of Sonora Housing Occupancy Survey (2003) provided survey forms
to residents. Of the 2,135 occupied housing units within the city; 1,140 (53.4%) returned
housing surveys. The results of householder surveys indicates that low and very low income
households may total up to 55.4% of city households (See following table).

Analysis
In comparison to the city, 38% of the county’s households are low and very low income
indicating the need to increase housing opportunities for low and very low income
households in the county in addition to increasing those opportunities in the city.

Analysis
In 1990, the City of Sonora identified 80 households with overcrowding.   The majority of
overcrowded households live in rentals. The majority of overcrowded households are white
(96) with only 13 Hispanic or Latino households overcrowded, six Native American
households overcrowded and six Asian households overcrowded. This sharp increase in
overcrowding indicates a potential need for rental units with more bedrooms than are
currently being provided in the city.

Analysis
The majority of the city’s institutionalized population is 65 years of age and older (79.4%)
and is living in nursing homes, long-term care facilities and similar quarters. Women aged
65 or older compose more than half of the total population living in group quarters within the
city. This indicates a potential need for elderly housing in the form of elder care facilities
within the city.
3.4.3.     Housing Characteristics
The City of Sonora was awarded a CDBG Planning and Technical Assistance Grant in 2001
(Grant #: 00-STBG-1544). The funding from this grant was utilized to conduct a Housing
Conditions and Income Survey within the city. City staff conducted the survey during which
all city residential units were evaluated.        Staff used the Housing and Community
Development Department survey guidelines to prepare survey documents and all were pre-
approved by the Housing and Community Development Department prior to use. The field
survey was completed in June, 2003.
Evaluations of exterior housing conditions were conducted by city staff.                  Interior
evaluations also were completed by city staff when occupants were present and amenable
to providing information.      When occupants were absent, a mail-in questionnaire was
provided for completion by the occupant.
A copy of the criteria used to evaluate the city’s housing conditions and owner and renter
characteristics are included in General Plan 2020 Appendix 3A.

         /a/ 2-4 units (383); 5+ units (447)
The majority of the city’s housing units are single-family, detached units. Given the small
lots and sometimes steep topography in the city, detached garages are common on most
lots established more than 25 years ago.              Attached garages appear to be a contributing
factor in increasing grading requirements for housing as indicated in the Morningstar
Subdivision in Sonora.                This indicates that the inclusion of detached garages as a
development standard for new housing units could contribute to decreased grading and
decreased costs of constructing housing in the city.
Multi-family rentals compose between 37% and 41%. As indicated in Tables 36 and 37
and Section 3.4.2.2, herein; 60.2% of the city’s households rent housing. This means that
the city’s households are renting approximately 19.2-23.2% of single-family residential units
in the city.
Given the relatively short supply of single-family residences available for ownership in the
city (as evidenced by real estate listings), and the relatively quick sales of new homes in the
city, the high number of single-family residences being made available for rentals is unusual.
The city may wish to use its 2003 Housing Inventory to investigate if and/or where single-
family residential rental units are concentrated in the city. It is possible that, as commercial
uses encroach from the traditional downtown historic district into the fringes of the city’s old,
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                           Housing-114

are becoming increasingly occupied by renters rather than residential homeowners.

         /b/ 51 of the 458 housing units in moderate condition had incomplete interior evaluations which, if
         completed, could reclassify these units as Substantially deteriorated or dilapidated
A total of 111 housing units are substantially deteriorated or dilapidated. A significant
portion of these units lack foundations—a condition typical of an older housing stock in
which residential construction began as early as the 1850s (Please refer to Chapter 9,
General Plan 2020 Cultural Resources Element for additional information).                            A lack of
foundation does not, in itself, render a home uninhabitable. However, a large portion of the
substandard housing units in the city also require significant roof repair or replacement.
Finally, of the 458 housing units in moderate condition, 51 are borderline
moderate/substantially deteriorated. These units also should be targeted in rehabilitation
efforts to ensure the retention of these units in the city’s housing stock.

In comparison, Tuolumne County has a vacancy rate of 25.9%. This is largely due to the
high number (20.7%) of seasonal rentals scattered throughout Tuolumne County and used
by non-residents taking advantage of the county’s many recreational amenities (e.g., skiing,
swimming, and hiking). In contrast, city households are predominantly year-round residents.
The city’s vacancy rate is within one percent of the state’s (5.8%) and does not indicate that
the city is either losing residents or has an overstock of housing. Given the small number of
vacant housing units in the city, opportunities for increasing the stock of either permanent or
seasonal affordable housing (e.g., available to seasonal farm workers) in the city appear
limited.

Analysis
More city residents rent rather than own their homes--39.8% own homes and 60.2% rent
homes. In contrast, 71.3% of county residents own homes and 28.7% rent homes.
Tuolumne County housing is predominantly owner-occupied, while City of Sonora housing is
predominantly renter-occupied based on total occupied housing units. The high percentage
of renters and relatively low percentage of home owners in the city indicates that city
programs targeting low and very low income households should include programs for first-
time home buyers.

3.5.      Special Needs Households
The City of Sonora Housing Occupancy Survey (2003) provided survey forms to residents.
Of the 2,135 occupied housing units within the city; 1,140 (53.4%) returned housing surveys.
In the following analysis, the results of householder surveys are included where results of
the surveys indicate trends which may refine those garnered from Census 2000 statistics.

The number of households with householders 65 years of age or older is down from the 643
senior-headed households reported in 1990 (384 owners, 259 renters).                 During the
preceding planning period, the county added senior housing facilities immediately adjacent
to the city’s eastern limits. It is likely that some of the 65+ aged householders recorded in
the 1990 Census have relocated to these units in the county. The city remains aware of the
necessity to provide opportunities for senior housing and city intends to expand
opportunities for seniors through removal of government constraints as described in Section
3.9, Implementation Program 3.D.a.

 Analysis
 The total number of single-parent heads of households has increased from 279 in 1990
 (14.3% of total households) to 337 in 2000 (16.4% of total households).             All 85 single-
 parent heads of households under the poverty level in 2000 were female--up slightly from
 the 83 female-headed households in 1990 living below the poverty level. For those living
 above the poverty level in the year 2000, 73 were male and 179 were female indicating that
 single-male parent households continue to escape poverty in the city and that programs
 addressing the provision of affordable housing for single-parent households living below the
 poverty level should focus on single-female parent households. Program 3.D.e of this
 element addresses the provision of housing for this special needs population.

Analysis/Reasonable Accommodation for the Disabled
Persons with disabilities include those with both physical and mental disabilities.                          The
Census no longer undertakes a comprehensive accounting of the disabled within various
jurisdictions (i.e., the number of households occupied by disabled persons). However, the
city’s 2003 housing survey, which sampled 53.4% of householders, identified 194
households with occupants either mentally or physically disabled (17% of the households
surveyed). Assuming that this sampling is reflective of the city’s total population, it can be
estimated that there are approximately 363 households with disabled occupants in the city.
This compares with the 225 households with disabled persons reported in the 1990 Census.
Disabled persons often need housing with modifications to accommodate physical
disabilities, which are located near services and which are easy to maintain.
Some of these disabled persons in Sonora live in group homes ( private homes occupied by
a small number of residents who live together and receive care from a live-in caretaker).
Group homes are generally established to accommodate a particular group (e.g., seniors,
mentally ill or physically disabled). Housing may include assistance with daily living (e.g.,
nursing services, counseling).
Section 3.8.1 includes an analysis of the city’s zoning regulations as they pertain to housing
modifications to accommodate physical disabilities and the location of group quarters within
the city. Recommendations for reducing or eliminating obstacles which might constrain the
provision of housing for this special needs group are identified to remove constraints for
persons with disabilities.         Program 3.D.g includes provisions for removing constraints to
the provision of housing for the disabled.

3.5.4.     Large Households
Large households are defined as those having 5 or more persons.

Analysis
There were 100 large households reported in Sonora in 1990.          The increasing number of
large households in 2000 indicates the need to consider additional bedrooms in new
affordable housing units. Alternatively, given the large number of single-family residences
in the city which are rentals, it also is possible that multiple families are pooling their
resources to live together in single-family residences, resulting in this increase in large
household numbers indicating the need for more affordable housing, rather than for larger
affordable housing units.
3.5.5.     The Homeless
For the purposes of the Sonora General Plan 2020 Housing Element (2001-2009), a person
is considered homeless who lacks a fixed, regular and adequate night-time residence; and
an individual who has a primary nighttime residence that is: A) A supervised publicly or
privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations (including
welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional housing for the mentally ill); or B) An
institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to be institutionalized;
or C) A public or private place not designed for or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping
accommodation for human beings.             Homeless individuals do not include individuals
imprisoned or otherwise detained pursuant to an Act of the Congress or a state law (U.S.
Code Section 11302).
Homeless individuals within the city include, but are not limited to: victims of domestic
violence, persons with mental illness, persons suffering from addiction disorders, those with
inadequate incomes, families with single-heads of households, and unaccompanied minors.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                      Housing-121
                                                                                 Chapter 3: Housing
According to Merilee Dubner, with the Kings View Homeless Outreach Service Team
(HOST), Tuolumne County’s homeless population is largely unseen by most county
residents. Dubner estimates that of the more than 480 non-duplicated contacts she has
made with the homeless throughout the county, approximately 75% are living in and around
the City of Sonora. Ms. Dubner indicates that a large portion of the growing homeless
population in Tuolumne County is the result of an influx from out-of-county residents
originating from the Central Valley and Bay Area counties. These individuals are seeking
lower housing costs in Tuolumne County due to high housing costs and layoffs in their
“home” county.         Unfortunately, those unfamiliar with Tuolumne County find that the
affordable house advertised in the newspaper is quite rural and requires ownership of a
reliable automobile--thereby placing many of these affordable homes (originally built as
vacation homes) out of reach for many of the county’s homeless.
Dubner further indicates that nearly 17% of the homeless are college graduates who have
found themselves jobless, while another large segment of the county’s homeless are
veterans. With the county’s homeless shelter constantly filled to capacity, there have even
been recent cases of individuals undergoing surgery at Tuolumne General Hospital and
Sonora Community Hospital who must be released to the street for lack of shelter.
Sonora Fire Department
The City of Sonora Fire Department provides beds for six low-income residents in an
ongoing program which began in 2000.
Mountain Women’s Resource Center, Inc. (MWRC)
The MWRC was established in 1978 to provide services to victims of domestic violence and
sexual assault in Tuolumne County.             MWRC has 17 full and part-time staff with
approximately 34 active volunteers. The MWRC provides two anonymous, safe homes for
battered women and their children while they make a transition to a life without violence.
In 2001, the MWRC sheltered 100 women and children, provided peer counseling for 250
individuals and handled 94 law enforcement referrals. As a result of a 1989 CDBG grant,
the shelter was rehabilitated by the City of Sonora and is provided to the MWRC rent free.
Principal funding sources for the facility are from the Office of Criminal Justice Planning;
Community Development Block Grants and MWRC fund-raising.                   In 2001, the MWRC
leased a new facility from the city which is currently in use as a transitional shelter.
The average client profile at MWRC is a white married woman under 30 with at least one
child earning less than $9,999 (very-low income category). Many clients have no income.
The current daily capacity of the MWRC shelters is 16 persons (approximately 4 families).
Amador-Tuolumne Community Action Agency (A-TCAA)
A-TCAA has assisted the homeless in Sonora and Tuolumne County since 1981 and
obtained its first shelter in 1984. The shelter provides 25 beds which are continually full.
The City of Sonora sponsored a CDBG grant in 1989 to purchase and rehabilitate the
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                         Housing-122

                                                                             Chapter 3: Housing
shelter.     A-TCAA also implements a Home Weatherization Program. Foreseeable needs
of A-TCAA15 include:
            •   The addition of one emergency shelter
            •   The creation of two transitional shelters
            •   The addition of a second homeless shelter to assist in providing separate
                shelter for single males and families
            •   A second education center
A-TCAA further urges support for self-help housing (e.g., Habitat for Humanity) within the
city and notes that assistance in gaining funding for such programs is available.
A-TCAA is currently working with the city to acquire ownership of the existing homeless
shelter and undertake rehabilitation expected to increase the number of homeless served by
the shelter.
Kings View – David Lambert Community Center/Drop-in Center
This facility provides a place for socialization for the mentally ill and other homeless
individuals. The center is located in the former Department of Motor Vehicles office at 347
W. Jackson St., Sonora.
Kings View – Homeless Outreach Service Team
This program provides assistance to homeless individuals in the county using AB2034
funding (now known as AB334 funding). Please see additional details in the introductory
paragraphs of this section.
American Red Cross
The Tuolumne County office of the American Red Cross assists residents with temporary
housing, food, and clothing in response to disasters.       In addition to assisting individual
households, the American Red Cross has played an important role in the county in response
to county disasters, in particular, wildfires.
Churches/Salvation Army
Other organizations within the city have limited funds set aside for 1-2 night motel
accommodations for the homeless (e.g., St. Patrick’s Church, the Salvation Army).
National Association of the Mentally Ill (NAMI)
As of July, 2003, NAMI is providing 5 supportive housing rentals within the city limits for
those with mental disabilities. NAMI takes responsibility for signing leases on the rentals
and residents use SSI benefits to pay their rent. Up to four residents may occupy each unit.
Each has a separate bedroom.

Senior Lounge
The City of Sonora celebrated the opening of the new Senior Lounge on North Washington
Street October 31, 2003, at the site of the former Seven-Eleven. The site was purchased
and remodeled using redevelopment funds and now provides a site for senior activities and
socializing in addition to serving as a museum.
The primary mechanism used by the city to serve the preceding special needs populations
is the removal of governmental constraints. An analysis of these constraints is included in
Sections 3.8 and 3.9, Implementation Programs 3.D.a through 3.D. k establishing the
necessary programs to remove these constraints to the provision of special needs housing.

The majority of farm workers in Tuolumne County are employed in reforestation after timber
harvesting (e.g., re-planting trees). Reforestation activities generally occur in the county’s
higher elevations and is often seasonal. As a result, the demand for farm worker housing
for those employed in reforestation activities is normally greatest at elevations of 3,000 feet
and above (i.e., close to the forest and far from the city limits).
In contrast, many of the county’s non-forest agricultural crops can be found below 3,000 feet
(i.e., relatively close to the city limits). Therefore, the primary emphasis on farm worker
housing in the City of Sonora is focused on the provision of housing for the migrant farm
worker employed in the production of non-forest crops and farm commodities (e.g., grapes,
apples, turkeys). As indicated in the preceding table, approximately 35.7% of the county’s
total farm worker population (116 individuals) could benefit from housing in the City of
Sonora. Based on a 3.72 average household size for migrant farm workers (including their
families), this translates into a need for approximately 40 housing units county-wide for
migrant workers and their families. Consistent with the county’s Regional Housing Needs
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                                Housing-124

Assessment, the City of Sonora provides approximately 10% of the county’s housing.
Therefore, the City of Sonora anticipates that it should provide for approximately 4 housing
units for migrant farm workers (i.e., for low or very low income and with a minimum of 4
bedrooms).
Given the extended distance between the city and agricultural destinations for workers, and
that migrant and seasonal workers are often without private transportation; farm worker
housing units should be located along primarily public transportation routes which provide
regular service to Twain Harte and higher elevations so that workers may meet with other
workers to be transported to work sites by their employers. Implementation Program
3.D.k establishes the city’s strategy and implementation program removing governmental
constraints to the provision of farm worker housing.
3.6.      Projected Needs
3.6.1.    Regional(Citywide) Housing Needs
The Central Sierra Planning Council (CSPC) completed a draft Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) for the Central Sierra Economic Development District in April, 2003.
After consultations with local planning agencies, the Governing Board of the CSPC
approved the draft RHNA on May 7, 2003. The draft RHNA’s 90-day review period ended
on August 6, 2003 and the final RHNA was approved by the CSPC at its August 6, 2003
meeting.
The plan addresses regional housing needs for Alpine, Amador, Calaveras and Tuolumne
Counties and their incorporated cities. The City of Sonora, located in Tuolumne County,
was identified as having an over-concentration of lower-income households--52% low and
very low income households are located within the city compared with 38% in Tuolumne
County.         Consistent with Government Code Section 65584(a), the RHNA reflects
adjustments to the city-county housing allocations by income groups to achieve a greater
equity between the jurisdictions. The results of regional housing need allocation for the City
of Sonora are summarized in the following sections.

  Rehabilitation
  The city anticipates continuing its housing rehabilitation program.          However, these
  rehabilitations may not meet the definition of “substantially rehabilitated” pursuant to H&S
  Code 17995.3 and, therefore, are not included in these estimates.
  At-Risk Units
  The city is investigating the extent of funds which may be available to assist in the
  preservation of approximately 46 at-risk units in the city (Implementation Program 3.C.m)
  However, because the city already is into the third year of the plan period for this housing
  element, it will be unable to meet Government Code Section 65583 requirements pertaining
  to “committed assistance” by entering into a legally enforceable agreement within the first
  two years of the plan period to commit funds to this endeavor. Therefore, these units are
  not included in the preceding summary.

The following analysis and inventory is based on the Land Use Element of General Plan
2020.
The following parameters are used in this inventory:
        •  Projections are based on actual development densities occurring within existing
           developments within the city
        •  Inventory excludes parcels with the potential to support two or fewer dwelling
           units (i.e., excludes most scattered infill parcels)
        •  Inventory includes vacant and underdeveloped parcels with a high potential for
           development and of sufficient size and with sufficient services to provide more
           than two dwelling units
        •  Inventory includes only parcels with the potential to produce new residential units
           (i.e., excluding parcels in which preservation, rehabilitation or conversion could
           occur)
        •  Projections do not include density bonuses
        •  Projections do not include second units
Based on the following inventory a development capacity of 621-978 residential units
exists on non-infill parcels in the city

The most recent planned development including residential uses occurring within the city is Northcam Heights. That subdivision
produced an average residential density of 2.85 dwelling units per acre. 16 Per the City of Sonora Housing Conditions Survey (2003),
there were approximately 2,293 dwelling units in the city limits.             Adjusting for the addition of an estimated 95 additional dwelling
units in the city between 2003 and 2006 increases this to an estimated total dwelling units in the city in 2006 of approximately 2,388.
Total developed acreage supporting residential uses in 2006 is approximately 552.44 acres. This translates to an average density
per acre of residential uses of all densities (i.e., single-family small lot, single-family rural, and multi-family) of 4.3 dwelling units per
acre based on historic development patterns in the City of Sonora. This density is used to project Special Planning development
densities.

At-Risk Housing Developments are privately-owned multi-family rental developments partly
financed either by the United States’ Department of Agriculture (USDA) or by the Housing
and Urban Development Department (HUD) which are at-risk for conversion to market-rate
rents.    Federally-assisted housing developments approved from 1990 to the present are
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                     Housing-140

                                                                              Chapter 3: Housing
subject to additional requirements to help ensure that they remain available as affordable
housing once established.             Should any of the post 1989 development projects seek
rehabilitation loans, then they must remain available to low and very low income families for
an additional twenty years. The City of Sonora has 174 units in three projects established
prior to 1990 that may pre-pay and become at-risk of conversion to market-rate rents. In
addition, 5 units were established with assistance of redevelopment funding from the City of
Sonora. The five redevelopment units are expected to become eligible for conversion to
market-rate rentals in 2017.
174 units are anticipated to be at-risk during the planning period from 2001-2008. Five
additional units (the city’s redevelopment-funded project) become at-risk in 2017, bringing
the city’s at-risk total through 2018 to 179 units. 128 of those units already are eligible for
pre-payment and the remaining 46 units become eligible for prepayment in October, 2007
As noted in the preceding table, 80 of the 179-at-risk units (the Sierra Village Apartments)
are in the process of pre-payment evaluations. According to the Davis office of the US Dpt.
of Agriculture, owners of the Sierra Village Apartments have agreed to delay pre-payment
until a non-profit group can acquire the at-risk units. Therefore, these units are considered
at-risk, but are at relatively low risk for conversion at present.        The 48-unit Sonora
Apartments also is currently at risk. However, a non-profit has opened escrow to purchase
the units and retain them for affordable housing. Therefore, the City of Sonora considers
only 46 of the 179 at-risk affordable housing units (Sonora Terrace) to be at a high risk of
conversion through 2008. Implementation Program 3.C.m addresses the city’s plans for
participating in the retention of these high-risk at-risk units.

It is the city’s objective to preserve or replace all subsidized units. See Implementation
Program 3.C.m for the city’s strategy for assisting in the preservation of high-risk at-risk
units.
3.7.3.     Housing Programs (Existing)
The City of Sonora administers the following housing programs:
Homebuyers Assistance Program
The City of Sonora’s Homebuyer Assistance program is designed to assist low income
families to purchase a home within the City of Sonora. The program provides loan
assistance to families with immediate cash needs, as required, for loan origination fees and
closing costs, including impounds for property taxes and insurance; and assists families in
meeting long-term housing commitments by reducing monthly payments to an amount
consistent with income levels.
Eligible families must have an income that does not exceed 80% of the area median
income, adjusted for household size as established by the Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD).
Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program
This program provides low-interest loans for the rehabilitation of existing housing units
owned and/or occupied by low-to-moderate income households.
             •   Homeowner’s Program
                 Provides low-interest loans for rehabilitation of single family residential units
                 owned and occupied by low-to-moderate income households within the city
                 limits.
             •   Rental Program
                 Provides low-interest loans for the rehabilitation of rental properties currently
                 occupied by or that will be occupied by low to moderate income tenants
                 within the city limits.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                          Housing-142

                                                                               Chapter 3: Housing
             •   Deferred Loan Program
                 Provides deferred low-interest loans for the rehabilitation of single-family
                 residential units which are owner-occupied by individuals 65 years of age or
                 older or who are permanently disabled and on SSI.
Redevelopment
The Sonora Redevelopment Agency (RDA) was established in 1985 and established a
project area in 1991. In the RDA’s second 5-year plan (extending through 2004), the RDA
has allocated $449,000 as its 20% housing set-aside. Funds will be used to improve
affordable housing opportunities within the city.        Proposed future programs include a
residential paint voucher program and neighborhood improvement program.
CSPC
The Central Sierra Planning Council (CSPC), a four-county Council of Governments is
active in managing affordable housing programs in Tuolumne County.               The following
programs are implemented in the City of Sonora with the assistance of CSPC:
             •   Section 8: 50-60 vouchers (rental assistance vouchers)
             •   Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)
3.7.4.     Energy Conservation
The City of Sonora works with the Amador-Tuolumne Community Action Agency (A-TCAA)
to ensure that energy conservation plays a prominent role in both rehabilitations and new
construction (See General Plan 2020 Appendix 3C).
Recycling
Recycling opportunities are easily accessible to Sonora residents. Cal Sierra Recycling
operates Tuolumne County’s primary recycling facility located at 14959 Camage Avenue off
of Tuolumne Road.         Curbside recycling also is provided within the city limits for various
materials. In addition, recycling bins are provided at the Crossroads Shopping Center within
the city limits.
Transportation
The City of Sonora, through its participation on the Tuolumne County Transportation
Council, provides some funding for and assists with the operation of, Tuolumne County
Transit. The agency provides both fixed route service and Dial-A-Ride service to and from
most destinations within the city limits.
Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
The Tuolumne County Transportation Council which includes representation from the City of
Sonora, is responsible for approving the non-motorized element of the county’s Regional
Transportation Plan and addresses the provision of bicycle and pedestrian facilities to serve
residents and visitors countywide. Sonora’s General Plan 2020 Recreation and Circulation
Elements include proposed routes for bicycle and pedestrian facilities in addition to those
contained in the county’s Regional Transportation Plan.             In addition to identifying
recreational trails, General Plan 2020 also identifies proposed sidewalk facilities (General
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                        Housing-143

                                                                                  Chapter 3: Housing
Plan 2020 Appendix 2F). The location of these facilities emphasizes the connection of
concentrated population centers with the city’s commercial centers, schools, government
facilities, and similar destinations. As noted previously, steep terrain increases the cost of
sidewalk construction within many areas of the city. Topography also presents a challenge
for meeting grade requirements for wheelchair accessibility.
Sonora is currently pursuing additional funding for implementation of its Sidewalk
Improvement Program.             Funding will include sidewalk rehabilitation, replacement and
construction to facilitate pedestrian traffic between housing, commercial facilities, schools
and other destination points.

3.8.1.1. ZONING AND GENERAL PLAN
Zoning Districts and General Plan 2020 Land Use Designations
The City of Sonora adopted General Plan 2020 in May, 2007. In conjunction, some existing
zoning districts are being amended and new ones are being created. The following
addresses the zoning districts proposed pursuant to General Plan 2020 and describes
pending changes to existing zoning districts.
Single-Family Residential (R-1) /Single-Family Residential (SFR) General Plan 2020
Land Use Designation
The purpose of this zoning district is to:
    •    Provide for the development of single-family residences in areas feasibly served by
         utilities, streets, schools, recreation areas, and other necessary facilities
    •    Create conditions conducive to a desirable residential environment, protect it from
         the encroachment of unrelated uses affecting the development of vacant land and
         detrimental to existing residences, and limit the continuance of such uses in
         existence in the area
    •    Insure light, air, privacy and usable open spaces for residential living, and freedom
         from traffic or fire dangers
    •    Provide for those facilities primarily serving the neighborhood and serving it best by
         being located within it, providing such facilities are in the appropriate locations, and
         in harmony with the neighborhood
Permitted Uses:
Single-family residences, one guesthouse, rental of a single room
Development Standards:
Lot size: 1 du per 7,500 sq. ft. or 6 du per 1 gross acre.
Building Coverage: 50% maximum
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                            Housing-144

                                                                                       Chapter 3: Housing
Setbacks: 20’ front, 10’ sides, 30’ rear
Height: 35’ or two stories
Analysis and General Plan 2020 Consistency
Pursuant to General Plan 2020, the R-1 zoning district is consistent with the Single-family
Residential (SFR) land use designation. The purpose of the SFR land use designation is to
preserve the integrity of existing single-family residential neighborhoods and reserve lands
best-suited for future single-family development.
Locational Criteria:
The location of SFR land in the General Plan 2020 Land Use Element is variable, and is
consistent with the city’s existing general plan in that development on land designated SFR
is restricted to those areas which may be served by adequate water, sewer, police, fire,
roads and other public services. The availability of infrastructure for the city’s vacant and
underdeveloped lots designated as SFR on the General Plan 2020 Land Use Map is
detailed and analyzed in Section 3.7, herein (Resources Inventory).
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
Based on actual development densities and consistent with the city’s hillside preservation
ordinance, the density of development in this district is one dwelling unit per 7,500 square
feet or six dwelling units per gross acre.19 This more realistic density will provide the city
with an improved ability to assess the actual development potential of its residential lots.
Maximum Floor-to-Area-Ratio (FAR) for this district is 0.5 (equivalent to a lot coverage of
approximately 50%). This increase in maximum allowable lot coverage (from 35%) will
assist in achieving the densities anticipated in General Plan 2020.
The changes proposed pursuant to General Plan 2020 (lot coverage, realistic development
density) coupled with incentives offered for affordable housing contained in this element and
pertaining to flexible standards for building height, setbacks and lot coverage are expected
to encourage more infill development on vacant R-1 lots and encourage the construction of
affordable housing on larger, vacant and underdeveloped R-1 parcels (see list, Section 3.7.1
herein) consistent with the goals of this element.
       19
          Lots of less than 7,500 square feet existing prior to the effective date of General Plan 2020
        (May 30, 2007) will continue to be considered legal, conforming lots, but may not be
        subdivided into lots of less than 7,500 square feet. Lots existing after the effective date of
        General Plan 2020 shall be at least 7,500 square feet in size.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                                Housing-145

                                                                             Chapter 3: Housing
Limited Multi-Family Residential (R-2)/Medium-Density Residential (MDR) General
Plan 2020 Designation
The purpose of this district is to:
         • Provide for the development of duplexes and other types of residences, and
           multi-family dwellings in garden apartments, in areas properly located in relation
           to commercial and other residential areas, and where utilities, streets, schools,
           recreation areas and other necessary facilities can feasibly serve a medium
           density population
         • Create conditions conducive to a desirable residential environment, protect it
           from the encroachment of unrelated uses affecting the development of vacant
           land and detrimental to existing residences, and limit the continuance of such
           uses in existence in the area
         • Insure light, air, privacy and usable open spaces for residential living, and
           freedom from traffic or fire dangers
         • Provide for those facilities primarily serving the neighborhood and serving it best
           by being located within it, providing such facilities are in the appropriate
           locations, and in harmony with the neighborhood
Permitted Uses:
Single-family residence, multifamily dwelling with ground level access for each unit up to a
maximum of 4 units per building, rooming house or boardinghouse (to be clarified in the
Municipal Code amendments made upon implementation of General Plan 2020 to recognize
duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes).
Development Standards:
Lot/Dwelling Unit Size Standards: 7,500 sq. ft.
Building Coverage: 50% building coverage
Setbacks: 10’ front, 10% width or 10’ whichever is less for sides, 5’ rear
Height: 35’ or two stories
Analysis and General Plan 2020 Consistency
Pursuant to General Plan 2020, the R-2 zoning district is consistent with the Medium
Density Residential (MDR) land use designation.           The purpose of the MDR land use
designation is to provide for a variety of housing needs throughout the city including both
single-family and medium-density multi-family dwellings. Generally, MDR developments will
include duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes. Integrated condominium or townhouse
developments also are encouraged. MDR housing is intended as a primary tool for fulfilling
the housing needs of special population groups (e.g., seniors, affordable, retired, and
single).
Locational Criteria
The location of MDR land in the General Plan 2020 Land Use Element is generally close to
commercial or other services and near major streets and thoroughfares for convenient
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                      Housing-146

                                                                                       Chapter 3: Housing
access. MDR developments also include in-fill sites scattered throughout the city blending
with the character of existing, established neighborhoods. General Plan 2020 expands the
locational criteria of MDR lands to recognize upstairs apartments constructed in conjunction
with commercial developments to provide for live-work opportunities. The location of the
city’s vacant and underdeveloped lots designated as MDR on the General Plan 2020 Land
Use Map are detailed and analyzed in Section 3.7, herein, (Resources Inventory).
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
As noted in Section 3.3 of this element, topography restricts practical density of residential
development in the city.            As noted in the Table of Constraints Analysis (following),
development densities for medium-density parcels are not realistically reflected in the city’s
1986 general plan.
Therefore, based on actual development densities and consistent with the city’s hillside
preservation ordinance, the density of development in this district is 10.89 dwelling units per
gross acre for parcels less than once acre in size. Land use density is 8.0 dwelling units per
gross acre for parcels one acre or larger in size. 20 This more realistic density will provide the
city with an improved ability to assess the actual development potential of its residential lots.
Maximum Floor-to-Area-Ratio (FAR) for this district is 0.5 (no change from the existing
standard).
The changes proposed pursuant to General Plan 2020 (realistic development density)
coupled with incentives offered for affordable housing contained in this element and
pertaining to flexible standards for building height, setbacks and lot coverage are expected
to encourage more infill development on vacant R-2 lots and encourage the construction of
affordable housing on larger, vacant and underdeveloped R-2 parcels (see list, Section 3.7,
herein) consistent with the goals of this element.
Multi-Family Residential (R-3) Zoning District/High Density Residential (HDR) General
Plan 2020 Land Use Designation
Purpose:
          •   Provide for the development of multi-family dwellings in apartments in areas
              properly located in relation to commercial and other residential areas, and where
              utilities, streets, schools, recreation areas and other necessary facilities can
              feasibly serve a high population density
          •   Create conditions conducive to a desirable residential environment
20
     Lots of less than 7,500 square feet existing prior to the effective date of General Plan 2020 (i.e.,
     May 30, 2007) will continue to be considered legal, conforming lots, but may not be subdivided
     into lots of less than 7,500 square feet. Lots existing after the effective date of the General Plan
     2020 shall be at least 7,500 square feet in size.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                                 Housing-147

                                                                                        Chapter 3: Housing
          •    Protect it from the encroachment of unrelated uses affecting the development of
               vacant land and detrimental to existing residences, and limit the continuance of
               such uses in existence in the area
          •    Insure light, air, privacy and usable open spaces for residential living, and
               freedom from traffic or fire dangers
          •    Provide for those facilities primarily serving the neighborhood and serving it best
               by being located within it, providing such facilities are in the appropriate
               locations, and in harmony with the neighborhood
Permitted:
Single-family residence, multi-family dwellings
Development Standards:
Lot Size: Minimum parcel size of 12,500 square feet21
Building Coverage: 50%
Setbacks: 10’ front, 5’ sides, 10’ rear; Five feet additional for each story in excess of two
Building Height: 35’ maximum-larger with CUP by Sonora Planning Commission based on
          finding of necessity and desirability and considering impacts on adjoining buildings
          and public safety.
Analysis and General Plan 2020 Consistency
Pursuant to General Plan 2020, the R-3 zoning district is consistent with the High Density
Residential (HDR) land use designation. The purpose of the HDR land use designation is
to provide for a variety of housing needs throughout the city including both single-family and
medium-density multi-family dwellings. The HDR designation is intended primarily for
grouped or clustered single-family dwellings, duplexes, triplexes, apartments, dwelling
groups, condominiums and townhouses, senior housing projects, and multi-family dwellings.
It is anticipated that large, multi-family residential complexes will provide a designated
percentage of units for affordable housing as an alternative to high-density complexes built
solely for a single-target income group.
Locational Criteria
The location of HDR-designated lands in the General Plan 2020 Land Use Element are
close to commercial or other services and near major streets and thoroughfares for
convenient access. HDR land is located throughout the city and not concentrated in a
single location.            General Plan 2020 expands the locational criteria of HDR lands to
recognize upstairs apartments constructed in conjunction with commercial developments to
provide for live-work opportunities. The location of the city’s vacant and underdeveloped
lots designated as HDR on the General Plan 2020 Land Use Map are detailed and analyzed
in Section 3.7 (Resources Inventory).
21
     Lots of less than 12,500 square feet existing prior to the effective date of General Plan 2020 (i.e.,
     May 30, 2007) will continue to be considered legal, conforming lots, but may not be subdivided
     into lots of less than 12,500 square feet. Lots existing after the effective date of the General Plan
     2020 shall be at least 12,500 square feet in size
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                                  Housing-148

                                                                                      Chapter 3: Housing
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
As noted in Section 3.3 of this element, topography restricts practical density of residential
development in the city.         As noted in the Table of Constraints Analysis (following),
development densities for high-density parcels are not realistically reflected in the city’s
existing general plan.
Therefore, based on actual development densities and consistent with the city’s hillside
preservation ordinance, the density of development in this district is 21.75 dwelling units per
gross acre for parcels of less than one acre in size and 15.0 dwelling units per gross acre for
parcels one acre or greater in size with a minimum parcel size of 12,500 square feet. 22 This
more realistic density will provide the city with an improved ability to assess the actual
development potential of its residential lots.
Maximum Floor-to-Area-Ratio (FAR) for this district is proposed to remain at 0.5 (no change
from the existing standard).
The changes proposed pursuant to General Plan 2020 (realistic development density)
coupled with incentives offered for affordable housing contained in this element and
pertaining to flexible standards for building height, setbacks and lot coverage are expected
to encourage more infill development on vacant R-2 and R-3 lots and encourage the
construction of affordable housing on larger, vacant and underdeveloped R-2 and R-3
parcels (see list, Section 3.7) consistent with the goals of this element.
Special Planning Residential (SP- R) Zone, Special Planning Mixed Use (SP-MU) and
Special Planning Residential (SP-R) and Special Planning Mixed Use (SP-MU) General
Plan 2020 Land Use Designations
General Plan 2020 will replace the 1986 General Plan Planned Development (PD) Zone and
1986 PD General Plan Land Use Designation with the Special Planning (SP) Zone and
Special Planning (SP) General Plan 2020 Land Use Designation (including Special Planning
Residential and Special Planning, Mixed Use). The purpose of the change is to allow the
application of existing state law governing the content of specific plans as necessary to
update the Planned Development designation currently in place.
Purpose and Intent
The purpose of the 1986 General Plan Planned Development (PD) Zone and PD General
Plan Land Use Designation was to accommodate various types of developments such
as…multiple housing developments, single-family residential developments…and any other
use or combination of uses which can be made appropriately a part of a planned
development.
22
    Lots of less than 12,500 square feet existing prior to the effective date of General Plan 2020 (May
    30, 2007) will continue to be considered legal, conforming lots, but may not be subdivided into
    lots of less than 12,500 square feet. Lots existing after the effective date of General Plan 2020
    shall be at least 12,500 square feet in size.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                               Housing-149

                                                                               Chapter 3: Housing
The purpose of the Special Planning (SP) Zone and Special Planning (SP) General Plan
2020 Land Use Designation (including Special Planning Residential and Special Planning
Mixed Use) is expected to mirror those of the 1986 General Plan’s PD designation, while
expanding upon the intent of the PD designation to further encourage new development
which creates a diverse, walkable, compact, vibrant project with integrated design
compatible with the physical characteristics of the property.
In addition, to ensure that development within the Special Planning land use and zoning
district designations throughout the city correspond to surrounding uses, the city is
proposing two classes of Special Planning—one of these is the Special Planning-Residential
(SP-R) Zoning District with a corresponding SP-R General Plan 2020 Land Use Designation
intended to encourage a mixed density of residential uses within the context of a specific
plan while establishing that the designated parcel will be used for residential uses (i.e., not
for commercial or other uses).
Locational Criteria
The location of SP-R designated lands in the General Plan 2020 Land Use Element are on
properties that have unique or unusual characteristics and do not fit into the conventional
zoning pattern including vacant land requiring unusually environmentally and aesthetically
sensitive development.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
The SP-R designation (as is the case with the 1986 General Plan’s Planned Development
designation) will retain flexible standards, but generally will not exceed a FAR of 1.5 for
projects with diverse uses and a FAR of 1.0 for projects which are primarily residential.
Because the primary purpose of this zone and land use designation is to provide flexibility in

Residential Estate, One-Two-Three Acre Minimum Zoning District (RE-1, RE-2, RE-3)
Estate Residential (ER) General Plan 2020 Land Use Designation
The City of Sonora currently (i.e, 1986 general plan) has a single Residential Estates (RE)
Zone allowing a one-acre minimum lot size. The next “larger” zoning district in the city is
the Agricultural - Residential (AR) Zone which allows a five acre minimum lot size. As
necessary to accommodate hillside development densities which may provide opportunities
for densities of more than one dwelling per five acres, but which may not be suitable for
densities of one dwelling unit per one acre, the city will add the Residential Estate, one-acre
minimum; Residential Estate-two acre minimum and Residential Estate, three acre minimum
zoning districts to the Municipal Code in conjunction with General Plan 2020.

Purposes and Intent
The purpose of the Estate Residential Land Use is to:
        •   Provide for the development of single-family residences in outlying areas and
            areas having special topographic features and to prevent a higher population
            density, requiring a higher level of services, or damaging to the natural
            appearance of an area
        •   Create conditions conducive to a desirable low density suburban environment,
            and protect it from the encroachment of unrelated uses affecting the
            development of vacant land and detrimental to existing residences, and limit the
            continuance of such uses in existence in the area
        •   Provide for sufficient space to enable residents of the property to raise crops and
            fruits and keep animals in a limited and controlled manner so as to be in keeping
            with the residential character of the area
Permitted Uses:
Single-family residence, one guesthouse, one room may be rented
Development Standards:
Minimum lot size: 1 acre (to be amended to 1 acre, 2 acres or 3 acres)
Building Coverage: 35%
Setbacks: 20’ front, 10’ sides, 30’ rear
Height: 35’ or two stories
Analysis and General Plan 2020 Consistency
Pursuant to General Plan 2020, the RE-1, RE-2 and RE-3 zoning districts are consistent
with the Estate Residential (ER) land use designation. The purpose of the ER land use
designation is to provide for a variety of housing alternatives, including larger lots (1-3
acres) on relatively gentle slopes.
Locational Criteria
The location of ER land on the General Plan 2020 Land Use Map is in areas with gentle
slopes away from the central core of the city.         The ER land use designation typically
provides a transition between urban and more rural or agricultural uses. The ER land use
also provides opportunities for clustering on small expanses of gently-sloping land. The
location of the city’s vacant and underdeveloped lots designated as ER pursuant to General
Plan 2020 are detailed and analyzed in Section 3.7 (Resources Inventory).
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
One dwelling unit per one acre to one dwelling unit per three acres (See introductory
discussion).

Agricultural Residential (AR) Zone/ (No Designated 1986 General Plan Land Use
Designation)
The city intends to amend the existing Agricultural Residential (AR) land use/zone to the
Estate Residential land use (ER) and Residential Estate, one, two or three acre minimum
(RE-1, RE-2, or RE-3) zoning district as a means of recognizing that the primary purpose of
parcels in excess of one acre in the city is residential, rather than the more traditional
agriculture found on large ranches in the county.
The purposes of the Estate Residential land use and Residential Estate zoning districts is
described in the preceding paragraphs.
HMR: Historic Mixed Density Residential
Purpose and Intent
The HMR designation is intended to preserve both the historic and residential character of
those portions of the city with large concentrations of structures 50 years of age or older
located outside of the city’s designated historic commercial district and used primarily for
residential purposes.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
The allowable density for individual parcels designated HMR is variable. The HMR land
use density allows up to 21.75 dwelling units per gross acre for parcels of less than one acre
in size. The HMR land use density allows up to 15.0 dwelling units per gross acre for
parcels one acre or greater in size.
The maximum density permitted on any given parcel designated HMR is a reflection of
opportunities and constraints unique to each parcel. Allowable density is a direct function
of the site’s capacity to provide one or more housing units (within single structures or
multiple structures) while maintaining the historic integrity of existing structures, providing
adequate parking, preserving mature landscaping and sustaining the overall historic
characteristics of the parcel, the immediate area and adjoining neighborhoods.
It is anticipated that a new Historic Mixed Density Residential Use combining district will be
developed to implement this General Plan 2020 land use designation. The HMR combining
district would overlay the existing primary zoning district and is expected to allow: single-
family residential uses, multi-family residential uses and bed and breakfast establishments.
As compatible with state law and the city’s Housing Element, the district is expected to allow
residential care homes, day care and similar facilities.
The HMR combining district is expected to include/address: alternatives for on-site parking
(e.g., allowing reduced parking or use of community parking areas in partial fulfillment of
parking requirements), maintenance of mature landscaping, reduced setbacks compatible
with historic character, and similar topics. This combining district also is expected to allow
for lots sizes consistent with historic lot sizes (e.g., 6,000 square foot net for single-family
residential districts).

HMU: Historic Mixed Use
Purpose
The HMU designation is intended to preserve historic character in those portions of the city
with large concentrations of structures 50 years of age or older located outside of the city’s
designated historic commercial district while allowing for a broad range of land uses
compatible with maintaining the historic integrity of individual structures and groups of
structures, landscapes and overall neighborhood character.             The HMU designation is
intended to provide a transition between areas with high concentrations of structures 50
years of age or older that are primarily residential in nature (Historic Mixed Density
Residential) and more intensive commercial and civic land uses located near the city’s
designated historic commercial district and along major city thoroughfares.
Land Use Density and Intensity of Use
The allowable density for individual parcels designated HMU is variable. The HMU land
use density allows up to 21.75 dwelling units per gross acre for parcels of less than one acre
in size. The HMU land use density allows up to 15.0 dwelling units per gross acre for
parcels one acre or greater in size.
The maximum density permitted on any given parcel designated HMU is a reflection of
opportunities and constraints unique to each parcel. Allowable density is a direct function
of the site’s capacity to provide multiple housing units (within single structures or multiple
structures) while maintaining the historic integrity of existing structures, providing adequate
parking, preserving mature landscaping and sustaining the overall historic characteristics of
the parcel, the immediate area and adjoining neighborhoods.
It is anticipated that a new Historic Mixed Use combining district will be developed to
implement this General Plan 2020 land use designation. The HMU combining district would
be added to the underlying, primary, zoning district, and is expected to allow (but is not
limited to): professional offices, single-family residential uses, multi-family residential uses,
museums, public uses, bed and breakfast establishments, restaurants, art galleries, tourist
information facilities, libraries, churches, cemeteries (generally less than one-half acre in
size) and related and accessory uses. As compatible with state law and the city’s Housing
Element, the district is expected to allow residential care homes, day care and similar
facilities. The overlay also is expected to allow storage within existing structures (of non-
hazardous materials) where high-volume multiple vehicle pick-ups for warehouses and
deliveries are not anticipated (i.e., distribution centers are not expected to be a permitted
use). Low-volume traffic retail may be considered.
The HMU combining district is expected to include/address: alternatives for on-site parking
(e.g., allowing reduced parking or use of community parking areas in partial fulfillment of
parking requirements), maintenance of mature landscaping, adaptive re-use of historic
structures, reduced setbacks compatible with historic character, and similar topics. This
combining district also is expected to allow for lots sizes consistent with historic lot sizes
(e.g., 6,000 square foot net for single-family residential districts). Many parcels designated
HMU are expected to qualify for benefits pursuant to the Mills Act program.

In keeping with the city’s policy of providing reasonable accommodation for the disabled, potential constraints to these
accommodations within the city’s municipal code have been analyzed. The results of that analysis are as follows:

3.8.1.2. PERMIT AND PROCESSING PROCEDURES
The procedure for processing permits in the City of Sonora is similar for all permit types and
is as follows:
Step A:         File an application with appropriate land development application fees.
                Application submittals generally include a site plan showing proposed
                development for the entire parcel, such as uses and buildings, walkways and
                driveways, and parking stalls. The site plan is required to contain sufficient
                information and accuracy to determine compliance with the provisions of the
                City of Sonora Municipal Code.
Step B:         The Community Development Director circulates the site plan to other city
                departments for input. This generally requires 10-14 days, although it may
                be completed within as little as 48-hours depending upon the complexity of
                the application.
Step C:         A public notice of Sonora Planning Commission hearing is published in the
                local newspaper at least ten days prior to the hearing.
Step D:         The Community Development Director prepares a staff report for the Sonora
                Planning Commission recommending approval of the entitlement, approval of
                the entitlement with conditions, or denial of the entitlement based on a pre-
                established set of findings (See following discussion for required findings for
                each type of permit)
Step E:         Within 40 days of receipt of the application, the Sonora Planning Commission
                is required to hold a public hearing at a regular or special meeting [30-days
                for design review]. This hearing may be continued for up to 30 days.
Step F:         The Sonora Planning Commission may require such terms or conditions to
                grant permit as it may deem necessary (See findings)
Step G:         Decisions of the Sonora Planning Commission may be appealed to the
                Sonora City Council within 10 days of the Sonora Planning Commission’s
                decision.

       Required Findings for Approval:
            • Protect and maintain property values and community amenities in the subject
                area, and
            •   Foster and maintain the health, safety and general welfare of the city, its
                property owners, and residents.

Due to its size, the city is able to process permits quickly. Because time rarely presents a
constraint, the permitting process and permit requirements of the city are not generally
considered to be constraints to development.
However, required findings addressing consistency of uses and neighborhood compatibility
and protection of property values in communities may sometimes provide a basis for
neighborhood opposition to apartment projects for low and very low income households and
in opposition to various types of special needs housing (e.g., emergency shelters, battered
women’s shelters).
In recognition of this, the city:
             •   Makes available to interested members of the public, the required findings for
                 denials of projects which provide housing for low and very low income
                 households as stated in Government Code Section 65589.5 and emphasizing
                 that these findings are required in addition to the findings associated with
                 various city permits and supersede the findings for permit approval or denial
                 as established in the city’s municipal code with minor exceptions (e.g., denial
                 due to identified health and safety concerns).
             •   Has identified vacant and underdeveloped parcels outside of long-established
                 neighborhoods and close to city amenities and jobs for the establishment of
                 new multi-family developments (in conjunction with General Plan 2020

3.8.1.3. BUILDING CODES AND ENFORCEMENT
Building codes are often viewed as a contributor to the high cost of housing by generating
delays and requiring construction methods which increase basic costs. However, the
adoption and enforcement of such codes is required of municipalities under State law. The
Sonora Building Department views code enforcement as the means to insure that safe and
uniform construction practices are followed.
Building department and other law enforcement agencies of the city enforce the provisions
of the Municipal Code, including the Zoning Code, pursuant to the guidelines established in
Chapter 17.70 of the Municipal Code.          Per the Municipal Code; the City Attorney, upon
order of the Sonora City Council can immediately commence action to abate, remove,
restrain and enjoin violations of the Municipal Code as public nuisances as prescribed by
law.     Violations of the Municipal Code are misdemeanors subject to the penalties as
established by state law.
Code violations in the city are generally related to junk storage rather than to housing issues
and, therefore, the city’s enforcement of the Uniform Building Code and the Municipal Code
is not viewed as an obstacle to the provision of affordable housing in the city.
3.8.1.4. PROCESS AND POLICY FOR SUBSTANDARD UNITS AND REHABILITATION
           REQUIREMENTS
Given the large concentration of homes built in the second half of the 19th Century, the City
of Sonora applies the State Historic Building Code for those homes listed in the city’s
historical inventory (Marvin, et. al., 2003) where the application of that code may be applied
and is requested by the homeowner.
3.8.1.5. DEVELOPMENT FEES
The most recent revision to the city’s fee resolution was in 1998 with an update scheduled
for Fall, 2002. Fees charged for development applications, impact fees, fees for water and
sewer, and other development fees are listed in General Plan 2020 Appendix 3F.
A summary of how these various costs influence the affordability of various single and multi-
family housing opportunities in the City of Sonora follows. [Note: An analysis of application
fees charged for land development applications within the city is not included herein due to
the substantially lower fees found in the City of Sonora compared with those in adjoining
jurisdictions as illustrated in General Plan 2020 Appendix 3F)].

3.8.1.6. INFRASTRUCTURE
As required by state law, the city’s water and wastewater service provider, the Tuolumne
Utilities District (TUD) was contacted in conjunction with the preparation of this element and
General Plan 2020 on March 23, 2001 and on June 22, 2003, to review water and
wastewater capacity to serve the city and the city’s projected housing needs.23              The
following information summarizes the results of discussions between the city and TUD.
Wastewater Facilities
TUD provides public sewer service to the majority of the city. TUD operates a sewer
treatment plant in the southwestern corner of the city adjacent to city-owned property -
(Sonora Wastewater Treatment Plan – WWTP).
The facility currently provides service to 23,000± people with a design capacity of 2.6 million
gallons per day (mgd). The average dry weather flow at the facility is approximately 1.6
mgd. The plant produces secondary treated and disinfected effluent is discharged to a large
storage reservoir, Quartz Reservoir, prior to distribution for reclamation by agricultural end-
users.
During winter months, input at the WWTP may increase to 2.6 mgd exceeding the facility’s
capacity to clarify and digest the input. This “overflow” has resulted in a limited number of
spills into Woods Creek.
An expansion of the facility’s sewage treatment processing system is underway.         TUD has
adopted a reclamation strategy, currently under review by the state that includes:
         1) Seeking easements over or acquisition of additional lands to allow for disposal of
             biosolids (some new easements and expansions of existing sites already has
             occurred)
         2) Increasing storage capacity (140± acres has been acquired for additional storage
             expected to come on-line in approximately 5 years)
         3) An application (currently under state review) to reinstate discharges into Woods
             Creek
Private septic systems are regulated through the Tuolumne County Environmental Health
Department and are of limited distribution. Private systems are concentrated southwest of
J.S. West and Symons and near the northern city limits with limited numbers scattered in
areas outside the public sewer service areas. Thin soils and porous rock (e.g., limestone)
are two identified hazards associated with failed septic systems within the city’s sphere of
influence.      However, age has been the primary reason for septic system failure within the

                                                                                      Chapter 3: Housing
city according to the Tuolumne County Environmental Health Department. Most of these
older failing systems have been replaced with public sewer service from TUD.
Water
The county has more than 133 water suppliers. The largest supplier of potable water is the
Tuolumne Utilities District (TUD) which serves all of the City of Sonora. TUD maintains
three water storage and treatment facilities within or adjacent to the city limits:
    •     Greenley Road water tank adjacent to Sonora Hills – 2.7 million gallons storage
    •     Sonora Water Treatment Plant water storage tanks on Bald Mountain Road -
          Storage capacity 2 million with potential expansion to 3 million gallons
    •     Sonora Reservoir at the end of Reservoir Road – 60,000 gallons
TUD has three primary sources of water:
    •     Surface water
    •     Groundwater
    •     Recycled water
TUD obtains more than 90% of its water from surface water supplied for the South Fork of
the Stanislaus River through a 1983 purchase agreement with PG&E. Sonora’s water
supply travels from Lyons Reservoir, fed by the Stanislaus River, to Phoenix Lake which is
the nearest water storage body serving Sonora. From Phoenix Lake, water travels to
TUD’s Sonora Water Treatment Plant (located within the Sonora City Limits) by
underground pipe24. Between Lyons Reservoir and Phoenix Lake, water is transported by
numerous miles of ditch. Annual water supply is dependent upon natural flow of the South
Fork of the Stanislaus River which yields 100,000± acre feet including 24,000± acre feet of
combined storage in Strawberry (Pinecrest) and Lyons Reservoirs. Historically, the amount
of water supplied through the system has been more than twice the amount of water
consumed.
Groundwater provides 5.5% of domestic or treated water annually. TUD assumes it could
sustain 1,075 acre-ft over a nine-month period, annually. Recycled water is used by private
landowners for irrigating 1,000± acres of farm and pastureland.
Per TUD, available water supplies for new development are currently dependent upon when
water is requested. Presently, there is a sufficient volume of water available to supply
existing needs for the City of Sonora. The peak load water demand for the City of Sonora
in 2002 was 3.5 million gallons per day (TUD, 2004).
24
    A portion of the Shaw’s Flat Ditch containing water remains open and provides a popular walking
    trail for residents. However, this portion of the ditch does not deliver water to the Sonora Water
    Treatment Plant. All water to that facility from Phoenix Lake is transported via pipeline.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                              Housing-172

                                                                              Chapter 3: Housing
TUD Water/Wastewater Fees
Hook-up costs for water and sewer vary and are payable to TUD —the only water and
wastewater service purveyor in the city limits. Water and wastewater fees at TUD in 2003
(excluding costs for stubbing service laterals to parcels) are:
Water Fees
         Previously-installed infrastructure (subdivisions) -        $1,135/unit
         No previously-installed infrastructure (new lot split) -    $4,535/unit
Wastewater Fees                                                      $3,800/unit
TUD is a quasi-public agency operating outside of the city’s jurisdiction. Therefore,
the City of Sonora does not have influence over the cost of water and sewer service for the
city.
3.8.1.7. STATE LAW
One of the biggest obstacles to the use of redevelopment housing set aside funds for
providing affordable housing has resulted from new legislation. Recent legislative changes
(2002) have increased the requirements for affordability covenants which ensure that
assisted developments remain available for affordable housing for 45 years for owner-
occupied units and 55 years for rental units. This increase has resulted in a decreased
interest in rehabilitating and constructing new affordable housing within the city using
redevelopment funds.
3.8.2.    Non-Governmental Constraints
Non-governmental constraints which influence the cost of housing within the city limits
include:
         Topography
         Land costs
         Construction costs
         Availability of financing for construction
         Availability of financing for purchase
         Community opposition
Topography
Topography in the foothills restricts the overall density of housing units that can be
accommodated both physically and economically. Within the city limits, slopes vary from 0%
to in excess of 50%. To address this issue, the City of Sonora has adopted a Hillside
Preservation Ordinance that includes slope/density requirements and flexible standards for
hillside development. Topography also provides challenges for sidewalk construction and
in meeting grade requirements for wheelchair accessibility.
Land costs
The price of land is determined by a number of factors, including location within the
community, terrain, utilities and services available. Statistics from the Tuolumne County
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                     Housing-173

Association of Realtor (2002) and a review of current listings for vacant residential land
within the city indicate that the average asking price for vacant residential land within the city
limits is illustrated in the following table:
Table 69: Vacant Residential Land Costs, City of Sonora – November, 2003
                           Asking Price        # Acres      Cost Per Acre
                                  $89,000            0.24             $370,833

                                  $175,000           0.46             $380,435
                                  $175,000           0.26             $673,077
                                  $54,500            0.19             $286,842
                                  $62,500            0.34             $183,824
                                  $67,900            0.31             $219,032
The average asking price for vacant residential land (with existing public water, public sewer
and paved roads), based on the preceding table is $389,707 per acre. At an average
density of 6 dwelling units per acre, this translates into $64,951 per single-family residential
lot.
No multi-family land has been listed for sale within the past five years.         However, it is
anticipated that the costs of multi-family designated land would be similar to the costs
identified above for single-family residential land given that most vacant land near the center
of the city (i.e., not on the outer fringes of the city) is typically served by water and sewer
and paved roads and would be of similar size and topography to land designated as single-
family residential.
Construction costs
The Tuolumne County Building Department indicates that 349 single-family residential
permits were issued in 2002 with a total value of $37,023,355--an average construction cost
of $106,085 per unit. That number is down from Tuolumne County’s $111,706 per single-
family residence construction cost in 2001.
The City of Sonora Building Department has calculated the per-square-foot costs of
construction within the city limits as follows:

Financing
At the writing of this section, the nationwide economy is believed to be rebounding after a
slowdown both preceding and following the September 11th terrorist attacks. In an effort to
stimulate the economy over the past 18 months, the Federal Reserve has dropped interest
rates repeatedly and is expected to maintain these low interest rates until there is further
evidence of expansion signaling a stable economic recovery (as of September, 2003;
interest rates were at a 40-year low). For Sonora, this means that approved residential
projects which had previously seen little building activity have been proceeding at a record
pace over the past 18 months. Many of these new residential units are being constructed
in Sunrise Hills; Sonora Knolls, and at the Northcam subdivision.
Current trends within the city indicate that the demand for single-family residences will
continue far into the future. More recently, a limited number of scattered duplexes and
triplexes have become popular. These units continue to be built for the above-moderate-
income groups.
Financing for home loans and housing developments within Tuolumne County is readily
available and accessible.       Small (e.g., Foothill Home Mortgage, 49er Financial, United
Mortgage), medium (Central Sierra Bank, County Bank, Oak Valley Bank) and large (e.g.,
Washington Mutual, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, WestAmerica Bank, Guaranty Bank)
lending institutions operate within Tuolumne County.           One dozen lending institutions

Community Opposition
Community opposition to high-density affordable housing in established residential
neighborhoods has emerged as one of the most prominent obstacles to the provision of
affordable housing in the city and county. Numerous programs in this element focus on
defusing this opposition. These programs emphasize the dispersal of affordable housing
throughout the city in the form of second residential units and as individual duplexes and
triplexes. New, high-density, multi-family housing for all income levels is being encouraged
through the city’s General Plan 2020 Land Use Element on currently vacant lands located
within walking distance of the city’s commercial centers.
3.8.3.     Summary
Current low interest rates are expected to continue driving housing construction within the
city. With many of the city’s residents in the low-to-moderate income categories, achieving
the city’s housing goals is likely to require a combination of additional rental housing, home-
buyers assistance programs and job training to increase wages. See also Section 3.4.2.2
herein for a detailed analysis of household incomes versus housing costs.

Goal:
   3.A         Provide a wide variety of housing suitable for all city residents.
Adequate Sites & Affordable Housing
Policies:
   3.A.1       Provide for adequate sites to accommodate the housing needs of a variety of
               households of all income levels with a particular emphasis on providing rental
               housing.
   3.A.2       Promote the development of very low, low and moderate income housing
               compatible with the city’s character.
Implementation Programs:
   3.A.a       Encourage the Establishment of Small, Affordable Housing Units
               Distributed Throughout the City
               Reduce community opposition to high-density affordable housing complexes
               through the provision of smaller (e.g., duplex, triplex) infill projects in
               appropriately zoned districts.
               The city will facilitate the provision of affordable housing in infill areas through
               implementation of the following programs:
                   i.  Prepare a map of vacant parcels zoned R-2 and R-3 throughout the
                       city and make the map available for developers at the Community
                       Development public counter or on the city’s website
                  ii.  Update the vacant parcels map at least once every three years
                 iii.  Amend the Sonora Municipal Code (Chapters 17.18, 17.20) to provide
                       the following incentives for infill projects on land zoned R-2 or R-3 in
                       which: a) the project will provide a minimum density equal to 80% of
                       the allowable maximum density for the subject site; and b) the
                       landowner enters into an agreement with long-term affordability
                       covenants and restrictions to maintain the housing for at least 10
                       years for low or very low income housing:

Open Space Element
Government Code Sections 65302(e), 65563 and 65560 state that a general plan shall
include an open space element and an open-space plan for the Acomprehensive and long-
range preservation and conservation of open space land within its jurisdiction.         For the
purposes of land use planning pursuant to this section, “Open-space land” is defined as any
parcel or area of land or water which is essentially unimproved and devoted to an open-
space use as defined in this section, and which is designated on a local, regional, or state
open-space plan as any of the following:
           •    Open space for the preservation of natural resources including, but not
                limited to, areas required for the preservation of plant and animal life,
                including habitat for fish and wildlife species; areas required for ecological
                and other scientific study purposes; rivers, streams, bays and estuaries; and
                coastal beaches, lake shores, banks of rivers and streams, and watershed
                lands.
           •    Open space used for the managed production of resources, including, but not
                limited to, forest lands, rangeland, agricultural lands and areas of economic
                importance for the production of food and fiber; areas required for recharge of
                ground water basins; bays, estuaries, marshes, rivers and streams which are
                important for the management of commercial fisheries; and areas containing
                major mineral deposits, including those in short supply.
           •    Open space for outdoor recreation, including, but not limited to, areas of
                outstanding scenic, historic and cultural value; areas particularly suited for
                park and recreation purposes, including access to lake shores, beaches, and
                rivers and streams; and areas which serve as links between major recreation
                and open-space reservations, including utility easements, banks of rivers and
                streams, trails, and scenic highway corridors.
           •    Open space for public health and safety, including, but not limited to, areas
                which require special management or regulation because of hazardous or
                special conditions such as earthquake fault zones, unstable soil areas, flood
                plains, watersheds, areas presenting high fire risks, area required for the
                protection of water quality and water reservoirs and areas required for the
                protection and enhancement of air quality.

 Due to the absence of these open space resources within the city’s sphere of influence, the
 following are not addressed in the Sonora General Plan 2020: lakes, bays, estuaries, harbors, and
 beaches.
In addition to these requirements, Government Code Section 65563(b) also requires the
preparation of an open-space inventory as part of the general plan’s open space element.
That inventory is found in General Plan 2020 Appendix 4H.
Finally, Section 65564 of the Government Code requires that an action plan be adopted for
the general plan’s open space element. The action plan is required to include specific
programs to implement the open space element. The implementation programs included in
this element and in the elements referenced in the preceding table, provide that state-
mandated open space action plan.

4.1.      Mineral Resources
4.1.1.    Issues and Opportunities
The City of Sonora and its sphere of influence encompass two state-designated areas of
significant mineral resources (Figure 11). In addition, the city encompasses soils composed
of carbonate rock which can trigger special conditions related to construction (e.g., to
address subsidence). Carbonate rock area mapped within the City of Sonora sphere of
influence are illustrated in Figure 12.
Pursuant to California’s Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA) as described in
Public Resources Code Section 2762, local jurisdictions must adopt mineral resource
management policies for designated significant mineral areas and:
        •       Recognize the mineral classification information of the California Department
                of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology, including the classification
                maps and include the classification maps in its general plan.
        •       Assist in the management of land use which affects areas of statewide and
                regional significance.
        •       Emphasize the conservation and development of identified significant mineral
                deposits.

Pursuant to the California Code of Regulations, Section 3676, those mineral resource
management policies shall include, but not be limited to:
        •       Statements of Policy in accordance with PRC Section 2762(a).
        •       Implementation measures including reference in the general plan to the
                location of identified mineral deposits and a discussion of those areas
                targeted for conservation and possible future expansion by the lead agency.
        •       Use of overlay maps or inclusion of information on any appropriate planning
                maps to clearly delineate identified mineral deposits and those areas targeted
                by the lead agency for conservation and possible future extraction.
        •       At least one of the following:
                         Use of special purpose overlay zones, mineral resource/open space
                         zoning, or any other appropriate zoning that identifies the presence of
                         identified mineral deposits and restricts the encroachment of
                         compatible land uses in those areas that are to be conserved.
                         Record, on property titles in the affected mineral resource areas, a
                         notice identifying the presence of identified mineral deposits.
                         Impose conditions upon incompatible land uses in and surrounding
                         areas containing identified mineral deposits for the purpose of
                         mitigating the significant land use conflicts prior to approving a use
                         that would otherwise be incompatible with mineral extraction
In 1997, the California Department of Conservation Division of Mines and Geology,
completed an evaluation of the mineral resources of Tuolumne County, including those
resources within the City of Sonora and its sphere of influence. That report identifies the
significant mineral resources as designated by the State Geologist and the State Mining and
Geology Board (SMGB). The report and its designations have been adopted by the
Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors. As prescribed by Section 3676 of the California
Code of Regulations, this conservation and open space element hereby incorporates, by
reference,     DMG Open-File Report 97-09 Mineral Land Classification of a Portion of
Tuolumne County, California for Precious Metals, Carbonate Rock, and Concrete-Grade
Aggregate, 1997, and all maps associated with and contained in that report. The findings of
that report are summarized as follows:
The classification system used in the preceding study is summarized in General Plan 2020
Appendix 4A, California’s Mineral Land Classification System. In short, lands classified as
MRZ-2 are considered significant mineral resource areas.

Gold
Two areas within the city limits and city’s sphere of influence are classified by the California
Department of Conservation Division of Mines and Geology as MRZ-2b, inferred areas of
mineral resource significance (Figure 11).
These areas are part of the Bald Mountain (aka Brown’s Flat) Gold Mining District located
north of Sonora and the Golden Gate Mine area located to the southwest.                Both are
recognized for their mineral resource value due to the inferred presence of gold based on
the history of gold extraction in these areas.
The Bald Mountain District extends from the northern edge of Sonora northward for a few
miles to Sawmill Flat. The district is famous for its rich deposits of pocket gold, some of
which are important for their value as specimens. The district has had numerous producing
mines, the most important of which were the Sugarman-Nigger, Hope, Ford, Lazar, and
Bonanza, the most famous pocket mine in the world.
The Golden Gate Mine, at the southwest edge of Sonora, was one of the steady major
producers in Tuolumne County in the 19th century, although records of production estimates
are inconsistent ranging from $100,000 (Clark, 1970) to $3.2 million (Union Democrat,
1909).
A third district, classified as MRZ-3a, and not currently subject to state regulations, is found
in association with the Golden Gate vein system. This district is named the Southwest
Sonora Area. Properties include the Gerrymander, Rainbow, Minnie and Manzanita
patents. Road cuts at the intersection of State Highway 49 (Stockton Road) and State
Highway 108 (Frank Momyer Bypass) provide well-exposed views of the quartz veins and
other geological characteristics which have resulted in classifying this area as one having
known mineral occurrence of undetermined resource significance (MRZ-3a).               This are
could become classified as MRZ-2 in the future.
Carbonate Rock
Extending from Lime Kiln Road, south of Sonora, to the Stanislaus River north of Columbia,
is the Columbia-Sonora Area, as an area of known mineral occurrence of undetermined
mineral resource significance (MRZ-3a) – See Figure 12.                The area is part of an
irregularly-exposed mass of mixed carbonate rock forming the single largest exposure of
carbonate rock in the Sierra Nevada.           The carbonate rock ranges from high-quality
limestone through intermediate magnesium content to dolomite. In places, the higher-
quality rock in this area has been mined for production of lime, manufacture of glass,
magnesium chemicals, animal feed, dimension stone, and decorative rock. The California
Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology states the following concerning
this region: ACertainly, results from future detailed sampling and drilling could elevate local
parts of the carbonate mass to MRZ-2a or MRZ-2b).

Aggregates
Pursuant to the California Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology,
Sonora and its sphere of influence do not contain any known significant concrete-grade
aggregate.
Potential Conflicts
As indicated on the maps in Figures 11 and 12, the identified significant mineral resource
areas cover both existing developed areas and vacant lands within Sonora’s existing city
limits. Portions of these designated significant mineral resource areas coincide with areas
declared eligible for scenic highway corridor status and include large portions of Woods
Creek.
The Tuolumne County General Plan calls for the designation of mineral preserve areas for
sites classified as MRZ-2a and MRZ-2b located 600 feet or more from the City of Sonora.
However, it is anticipated that large mineral extraction activities undertaken within 600 feet
of the City of Sonora could have significantly adverse impacts on water quality, adverse
noise impacts on existing residential and commercial development, adverse impacts to
visual quality and conflict with future plans to locate new and/or expand existing public
facilities including those important to community and environmental health and safety.
The goals, policies and implementation programs included in the following are intended to
resolve potential future conflicts between existing development in the city and future mining
operations consistent with state law.

4.2.     Mineral Resources: Goals, Policies and Implementation
         Programs
Goal:
   4.A          Resolve potential conflicts between future mining activities adjacent to the
                city and existing and planned city land uses.
Policies:
   4.A.1        Identify significant mineral resource lands as designated by the State
                Geologist and the State Mining and Geology Board.
   4.A.2        Recognize that large mining operations may be incompatible with existing
                development within and adjacent to the city limits and with planned
                development necessary for the health and safety of the community.
   4.A.3        Protect existing city land uses from potential future conflicts with mining
                activities both within and adjacent to the city.
   4.A.4        Protect mineral resources located in the county from future encroachment by
                city land uses and from conflicts with existing city land uses.
Implementation Programs:
   4.A.a        Maintain Maps of Significant Mineral Resources within the City’s Sphere
                of Influence
                Maintain copies of the Department of Conservation, Division of Mines and
                Geology mineral maps as part of the city’s natural resources database.
                Update these maps when new information is made available by the State
                Mining and Geology Board and evaluate them for consistency with existing
                and planned land uses.

                within the city limits which already have existing structures have not been
                designated as mineral reserve zones on the general plan land use maps
                because the mineral reserves as described in DMG Open-File Report 97-09
                Mineral Land Classification of a Portion of Tuolumne County, California for
                Precious Metals, Carbonate Rock, and Concrete-Grade Aggregate, are no
                longer available because of encroachment by development. The city shall
                continue to reflect on its general plan land use map, those locations where
                mineral resources are no longer available due to existing development. The
                city shall continue to assign land use designations other than Mineral

4.3.1.     Issues and Opportunities
Sonora currently provides pick-up service for yard debris (e.g., leaf and lawn cuttings) within
the city limits. Yard debris collected by the Sonora Public Works Department is mulched
and used for landscaping, thereby reducing air pollution resulting from burning. Similarly,
Sierra Pacific Industries (SPI) allows city and county residents to dispose of yard debris at
its Standard facility. Yard debris is then chipped on site.
The Tuolumne County Transportation Council currently operates a public transit service
serving the Sonora area which assists in reducing reliance on private automobiles.
Central Sierra Disposal, Inc. - A Waste Management Company, provides pick-up service for
recyclables in conjunction with its regular trash hauling services.        The company also
operates a recycling facility in Standard, however, hours of operation at this facility now
exclude weekends, making it difficult for weekday workers to dispose of recycled materials.

4.5.      Scenic Resources
4.5.1.    Issues and Opportunities
Sonora’s natural scenic resources include heritage trees, hillsides, hilltops, scenic corridors,
creeks, historic and similar features. In addition to contributing to the quality of life for
residents, the City of Sonora also recognizes the economic benefits of preserving scenic
resources as a vital part of the city’s tourism economy.
The city manages these scenic resources through the following programs:
Hillside Preservation Ordinance
A hillside preservation ordinance, adopted in 1996, governs residential development on
hillsides and hilltops in the city.      The General Plan 2020 Land Use Map reflects the
slope/density standards prescribed in the ordinance. Development standards for hillsides
and hilltops in the ordinance also address: grading, vegetation management and the optimal
location of structures as necessary to retain visual quality.
Tree City, USA
Sonora received official designated as a Tree City USA in 1995. Tree City USA is a
program established by the National Arbor Day Foundation and the National Association of
State Foresters. The purpose of the program is to establish standards which ensure that
qualifying communities will have a viable tree management plan and program.                 This
program consists of four components:
        •   A tree board or department
        •   A tree care ordinance
        •   A community forestry program with an annual budget of at least $2 per capita
        •   An Arbor Day observance and proclamation
Benefits of the Tree City USA program include:
        •   Helping a community start towards annual, systematic management of its tree
            resources
        •   Education, including technical advice and assistance from professionals
        •   Enhances the public image of the community
        •   Increasing citizen pride
        •   Financial assistance
        •   Publicizing the City of Sonora through the Tree City USA website to assist in
            attracting visitors and economic development

Sonora Parks, Recreation and Beautification Committee (PR&B)
The Sonora Parks, Recreation and Beautification Committee is governed by Chapter 12.20
of the Sonora Municipal Code and is charged with:
         •      Providing guidelines for review and approval of landscape plans per city
                ordinance, including tree preservation and proposed tree removal within the
                City of Sonora and make recommendations to the Sonora Planning
                Commission and/or Sonora City Council.            The PR&B also reviews the
                location and materials to be used for man-made structures, including
                retaining walls, sidewalk paving, fencing and similar structures.
         •      Makes recommendations to the Sonora City Council regarding the use of
                open space and public recreation spaces.
         •      Makes recommendations to the Sonora City Council for the beautification of
                existing city properties, parks and undeveloped open space areas of the city.
         •      Makes available and provides direction for educational materials advocating
                best management practices for vegetation maintenance, construction on
                slopes and similar activities.
Sonora Planning Commission: Design Review Commission and Historic Committee
The Sonora Planning Commission serves as the city’s design review commission and
historic committee pursuant to Section 17.32.040 of the Sonora Municipal Code. In its
capacity as the design review and historic committee, the Sonora Planning Commission is
responsible for evaluating applications for new construction and exterior alterations,
additions or modifications to structures within the city’s design review zone and historic area.
The commission also is responsible for reviewing demolition permit applications.
Scenic Highways and Heritage Corridors
In addition to the preceding programs, the state has designated two state transportation
corridors which traverse Sonora as eligible for scenic-highway status in recognition of the
outstanding scenic vistas visible from both routes:
             •  State Route 49 from State Route 120 to near Grass Valley
             •  Highway 108 from State Route 49 near Sonora to State Route 395
The California Public Resources Code (Sections 5070-5077.8), the California Recreational
Trails Act, designates “State Highway Route 49” as a heritage corridor. A heritage corridor
is a regional, state, or nationwide alignment of historical, natural, or conservation education
significance, with roads, state and other parks, greenways, or parallel recreational trails,
intended to have guidebooks, signs, and other features to enable self-guiding tourism, and
environmental conservation education along most of its length and of all or some of the
facilities open to the public along its length, with an emphasis on facilities whose physical
and interpretive accessibility meet “whole-access” goals.

Section 5077.6 of the Public Resources Code designates Highway 49 as a heritage corridor
“because of its clear function as the interpretive highway of the Gold Rush, and because of
outstanding efforts of public agencies and the private sector to increase accessibility to
physically disabled persons along parts of its route.” The corridor includes all sections which
link the counties of Sierra, Nevada, Placer, El Dorado, Amador, Calaveras, Tuolumne,
Mariposa, and Madera and is officially known as the Golden Chain Highway.
The following goal, policies and implementation programs are intended to conserve and
enhance the scenic resources of Sonora. Additional programs for preserving the Sonora’s
rural character in the man-made environment are found in the Community Identity Element
(General Plan 2020, Chapter 11).

4.7.      Biological Resources
4.7.1.    Issues and Opportunities
Pursuant to the California Government Code, general plans must address management of
biological resources.     However, it is the requirements of the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA), the California Endangered Species Act (CESA), the Federal Clean
Water Act (CWA), the Federal Endangered Species Act (FESA) and similar state and
federal laws which guide the formulation of the biological resource management programs
found in local general plans.
Similarly, a primary goal of this biological
resources section of the Conservation and
Open Space Element is not only the
conservation and management of biological
resources, but also compliance with state
and federal laws and regulations governing
impacts to special status plants, fish and
wildlife species and impacts to habitats of
limited distribution which support these
species.

For the purposes of this element, special status species include those plants, fish or animals
listed or designated as candidates for listing pursuant to the federal or state endangered
species acts; species designated as species of special concern by the California
Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and plants species
designated as Category 1A, 1B or 2 by the California Native Plant Society (and are
recognized by the California Department of Fish and Game and are considered significant
biological resources pursuant to CEQA).

          Valley Foothill Riparian Lower-elevation riparian deciduous woodland (tree cover of 10% or more); similar to montane
          (VRI)                    riparian habitats, but trees are generally taller and may form wider stands along water courses,
                                   especially in broad valleys. Dominant trees are usually Fremont cottonwood , California
                                   sycamore, various willows and valley oak. Generally occurs below 3,000 elevation.
          Wet Meadow               An area with more or less permanently moist or wet soil and dense herbaceous vegetation
          (WTM)                    dominated by sedges and other perennial herbs. There may also be patches of willows and
                                   other riparian shrubs, with a total canopy cover of less than 10%. In wet meadows, water is at
                                   or near the surface most of the growing season as opposed to emergent wetlands which have
                                   standing water.
          Lake or Pond             Water bodies which hold water year-round. Includes both natural and constructed ponds.
          (LAK)
          Perennial stream         Streams of all sizes that flow all year in normal precipitation years. Streams may be classified
                                   as perennial based on the US Geological Survey maps (perennial streams are indicated as solid
                                   blue lines) or based on sound evidence regarding their flows in recent years.
          Intermittent stream      Streams that normally keep flowing in the spring or summer but eventually stop flowing in normal
                                   precipitation years. They may flow year-round in unusually wet years. When not flowing the
                                   water may remain in isolated pools or surface water may be absent. Streams may be classified
                                   as intermittent based on the US Geological Survey maps (intermittent streams are indicated as
                                   dashed blue lines) or based on sound evidence regarding their flows in recent years.
          Blue-oak foothill-pine   Foothill woodland dominated by blue oak, bull pine, and/or interior live oak, usually with a sparse
          (bop)                    to moderate canopy cover. A common associate is California buckeye. A patchy shrub layer is
                                   usually present at higher elevations, but absent at lower elevations.
          Mixed chaparral          A foothill habitat dominated by one or more species of evergreen shrubs, including scrub oak,

           (mch)                       chaparral oak, ceanothus species, manzanita species, and chamise. Common associates
                                       include birchleaf mountain mahogany, silk tassel, toyon, yerba santa, poison oak and California
                                       fremontia. Shrub cover is 10% or more and tree cover, if any, is less than 10%. Occurs mainly
                                       at elevations of ponderosa pine forest and below.
           Montane hardwood            Forests with at least two-thirds hardwoods (not including riparian trees), usually mixed with some
           (mhw)                       conifers. Dominant species are usually canyon live oak or black oak, and the common conifers
                                       are ponderosa pine, incense-cedar and other trees. Generally occurs within the same elevation
                                       zones as ponderosa pine forests or sierran mixed conifer, but can occur at lower elevations.
           Blue oak woodland           Foothill woodland in which blue oak occupies at least 85% of the tree canopy. Canopy cover is
           (bow)                       usually sparse to open. Associated trees include interior live oak and bull pine. Under story is
                                       annual grassland, sometimes with scattered patches of shrubs.
           Residential/Urban/Park      Areas which are urbanized including residential, commercial and industrial areas as well as
           (rsp)                       landscaped parks and gardens.
           Annual grassland            Open grassland composed primarily of annual grasses and forbs. Occurs mainly in the lower
           (ags)                       foothills. Scattered trees and shrubs may be present, but both have a canopy cover of less than
                                       10%.

4.7.3.    Wildlife Resources
Special Status Species
As noted, biological resources planning normally focuses on specific programs and policies
for protecting special status species and habitats of limited distribution with broader, more
general programs for conserving common wildlife species and habitats.
Pursuant to a review of the California Natural Diversity Database for the Sonora, Standard,
Columbia and Columbia SE Quadrangles; a review of the Tuolumne County Wildlife
Database; and an inventory of habitat types; approximately 28 special status plants, fish and
animal species occur, have a high potential for occurring, or have potential habitat within the
city’s sphere of influence. A complete list of these species is found in General Plan 2020
Appendix 4C. Of these species, the following have the highest potential for occurring
within the city limits:

Common Species
General Plan 2020 Appendix 4D provides an extensive listing of common species which
occur within the city’s sphere of influence. Of these species, special consideration is given
to resident mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) populations within the city’s planning area.
This species regularly resides in and moves through the city.            At least one identified
resident deer concentration area is located adjacent to the southwest city limits within a
potential city annexation area. These concentration areas and the ability to move between
concentration areas is recognized by the California Department of Fish and Game as
important to the long-term health of resident deer populations. Therefore, this element
addresses conservation of movement corridors for this species and associated species
between known concentration areas.
Migratory Bird Treaty Act
In brief, this international law, enforced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, makes it illegal
to disturb the nest of any bird protected pursuant to the act. With the exception of certain
non-native birds (e.g., European starlings), all birds currently identified in Tuolumne County
are protected pursuant to this act.        Therefore, while many bird species throughout the
planning area are considered common bird species, special protections must be considered
during construction activities for new development when nesting birds are present pursuant
to federal law.

4.8.     Biological Resources: Goals, Policies and Implementation
         Programs
Goal:
   4.D          Sustain and enhance biological resource quality, quantity and diversity within
                the city.
Policies:
   4.D.1        Establish and implement protection measures for special status plants, fish
                and wildlife species in the city’s sphere of influence.
   4.D.2        Establish and implement protection measures for habitat types of limited
                distribution.
   4.D.3        Protect, maintain, and enhance wildlife corridors through Sonora including
                Sonora Creek, Woods Creek and Dragoon Gulch.
   4.D.4        Support voluntary efforts to conserve biological resources.
Implementation Programs:
   4.D.a        Continue to Maintain Setbacks Along Sonora Creek, Woods Creek and
                Dragoon Gulch
                To protect water quality and its associated biological resources, the city has
                designated minimum streamside setbacks of 50 feet on both sides of Woods
                Creek, Sonora Creek and Dragoon Gulch (as measured from the top of the
                bank of the creek or drainage channel) on the Sonora General Plan 2020
                Land Use Maps. These designations are interim and subject to change upon
                completion of floodplain studies of Woods Creek and Sonora Creek through
                the city limits being undertaken by the Resource Conservation &
                Development District or equivalent studies.
                The city shall establish a Recreation/Open Space (or comparable) zoning
                district and rezone these setback/buffer areas as Recreation and/or Open
                Space. This zoning district shall permit only small, public-utility or recreation-
                related structures and other similar uses consistent with the preservation of
                water quality and protection of biological resources.         Reductions in the
                established setbacks may be acquired through issuance of a variance.

                Structures encroaching within the established setbacks as of the Effective
                Date of Sonora General Plan 2020 may be expanded provided that the
                expansion does not encroach farther into the established drainage setback
                (i.e., Expansions of existing structures away from the drainage, but not
                towards the drainage are permitted).

                Support and undertake efforts to remove hardscapes (e.g., paved or
                concreted structures) and deteriorating structures covering Sonora Creek to
                re-expose the creek and assist in implementing the Sonora General Plan
                2020 Conservation and Open Space Element. Where feasible, incorporate
                pocket parks, trail heads and stream-side mini-parks along the proposed
                Sonora Creek Trail in areas where the creek or its banks are currently paved.
                Consider the use of redevelopment funds, subject to redevelopment law
                restrictions and requirements, to assist in funding this program.

4.9.1.2. SEWAGE DISPOSAL
TUD provides public sewer service to the majority of the city. TUD operates a sewer
treatment plant in the southwestern corner of the city adjacent to city-owned property
(TUD’s Sonora Wastewater Treatment Plan – WWTP).
The facility currently provides service to 23,000± people with a design capacity of 2.6
million gallons per day (mgd).        The average dry weather flow at the facility is
approximately 1.6 mgd. The plant produces secondary treated and disinfected

                                                       Chapter 4: Conservation & Open Space
effluent is discharged to a large storage reservoir, Quartz Reservoir, prior to
distribution for reclamation by agricultural end-users.
During winter months, input at the WWTP may increase to 2.6 mgd exceeding the
facility’s capacity to clarify and digest the input. This “overflow” has resulted in a
limited number of spills into Woods Creek.
An expansion of the facility’s sewage treatment processing system is underway.
TUD has adopted a reclamation strategy, currently under review by the state that
includes:
          1) Seeking easements over or acquisition of additional lands to allow for
             disposal of biosolids (some new easements and expansions of existing
             sites already has occurred)
          2) Increasing storage capacity (140± acres has been acquired for additional
             storage expected to come on-line in approximately 5 years)
          3) An application (currently under state review) to reinstate discharges into
             Woods Creek
Based on the preceding assumptions, and as detailed in Tables 76 and 77, an
increased wastewater generation of 398,825 GPD is anticipated should all residential
lands in the city be developed by 2020.           Residential wastewater generation is
expected to increase by between 50,095 GPD (with 233 new dwelling units) and
134,160 GPD (with 624 new dwelling units).
Non-residential uses are expected to generate an additional 59,163GPD wastewater
(buildout is assumed for other land uses) -- an increase of approximately 22,152
GPD in comparison to General Plan 1986.
The most probable wastewater generation demand pursuant to General Plan 2020
based on likely residential growth and buildout of all non-residential uses by 2020 is
between 109,258 and 193,323 GPD (an increase of approximately 22,152 GPD in
comparison to General Plan 1986).
TUD anticipates that new development throughout the county and in the city will
receive service commitments for wastewater based on timed agreements
established on a “first come, first serve” basis.
Private septic systems are regulated through the Tuolumne County Environmental
Health Department and are of limited distribution. Private systems are concentrated
southwest of J.S. West and Symons and near the northern city limits with limited
numbers scattered in areas outside the public sewer service areas. Thin soils and
porous rock (e.g., limestone) are two identified hazards associated with failed septic
systems within the city’s sphere of influence.      However, age has been the primary
reason for septic system failure within the city according to the Tuolumne County
Environmental Health Department. Most of these older failing systems have been
replaced with public sewer service from TUD.

4.9.1.3. NON-POINT SOURCE POLLUTION
Non-point source pollution includes contaminants which enter surface or ground
water through runoff and/or filtration. Sources of these discharges are normally
multiple and/or widely spread. In comparison, point source pollution includes
contaminants which enter surface or ground water from a specific known (usually
single) source (e.g., a factory).
Sources and types of non-point source discharges common in urban runoff which
could be present in city’s waterways as runoff are detailed in General Plan 2020
Appendices 4E and 4F.             They include: fecal coliform bacteria, phosphorous,
insecticides, herbicides, pesticides, DDT, chlordane, dieldrin, volatile organic
compounds, traces of cadmium, traces of lead, traces of zinc, traces of mercury,
zinc, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs), organochlorine compounds and PCBs.
The Tuolumne County Environmental Health Department (Division of Environmental
Health) performed water quality sampling for total coliform and fecal coliform bacteria
in various locations along Woods Creek and Sonora Creek between 2001 and 2003.
The Tuolumne Utilities District performed some bacteriological sampling in Woods
Creek, Sullivan Creek and Sonora Creek in 2001.                The results of TUD and
Tuolumne County Health Department (Division of Environmental Health) water
quality sampling from 2001-2003 are summarized in General Plan 2020 Appendix
4G.
Coliform is a type of bacteria which may, in itself, pose no threat to health, but may
indicate the presence of other disease-causing agents in water.               The bacteria
normally occur in low levels in surface waters (e.g., lakes, beaches, streams). Fecal
coliform and E. coli (a coliform) are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water
may be contaminated with human or animal wastes which can cause diarrhea,
cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms posing a special health risk for
infants, young children, and people with severely compromised immune systems.
The California Department of Health Services has established the following draft
guidelines (March, 2004) for maximum concentrations of total coliform and fecal
coliform for beach use (i.e., surface waters):
        Total Coliform: 10,000 most probable number (mpn) per 100 milliliter (ml)
        Fecal Coliform: 400 mpn per 100 ml
The results of water quality sampling performed by TUD and the Tuolumne County
Environmental Health Department for surface waters (General Plan 2020 Appendix
4G) indicate that levels of fecal coliform in Sonora Creek and Woods Creek within
the city limits and within the city’s sphere of influence, regularly have exceeded state
guidelines—sometimes by significant amounts.             The Tuolumne County Water
Quality Plan, completed in February, 2007 identifies the following as potential causes
of high coliform readings found countywide: failing septic systems and unobstructed
grazing practices.

The coliform standard for treated drinking water is governed by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency. EPA drinking water standards are violated when
water samples test positive in more than one or more than 5.0% of monthly sampling
for total coliforms (dependent upon the size of the water system). Water systems
with confirmed positive tests for the presence of fecal coliform (in any amount) are in
violation of EPA drinking water standards.
TUD’s Sonora/Jamestown Water System serves a population of approximately
13,042 per the USEPA Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) as of July
17, 2004. TUD’s water quality report for the Sonora/Jamestown system in 2003
(TUD, 2004) records no violations of drinking water standards for coliform in the
system.         However, sampling in 1992-1993 indicated some lead and copper
contamination within the system. Lead and copper levels have been brought into
compliance per the EPA’s SDWIS system website (http://oasub.eqp.gov/enviro ).
NOTE: Tuolumne County completed the Foothill Watershed Assessment and
Tuolumne County Water Quality Plan in February, 2007.                    A summary of water
quality measurements taken within creeks within the Sonora Sphere of Influence
during 2005-2006 is included in Sonora General Plan 2020 Appendix 4G.
4.9.1.4. WATER QUANTITY
The county has more than 133 water suppliers. The largest supplier of potable water
is the Tuolumne Utilities District (TUD) which serves all of the City of Sonora. TUD
maintains three water storage and treatment facilities within or adjacent to the city
limits:
     •   Greenley Road water tank adjacent to Sonora Hills – 2.7 million gallons
         storage
     •   Sonora Water Treatment Plant water storage tanks on Bald Mountain Road -
         Storage capacity 2 million with potential expansion to 3 million gallons
     •   Sonora Reservoir at the end of Reservoir Road – 60,000 gallons
TUD has three primary sources of water:
     •   Surface water
     •   Groundwater
     •   Recycled water
TUD obtains more than 90% of its water from surface water supplied for the South
Fork of the Stanislaus River through a 1983 purchase agreement with PG&E.
Sonora’s water supply travels from Lyons Reservoir, fed by the Stanislaus River, to
Phoenix Lake which is the nearest water storage body serving Sonora.                        From
Phoenix Lake, water travels to TUD’s Sonora Water Treatment Plant (located within
the Sonora City Limits) by underground pipe25.                Between Lyons Reservoir and
Phoenix Lake, water is transported by numerous miles of ditch.                     Annual water
25
     A portion of the Shaw’s Flat Ditch containing water remains open and provides a popular
     walking trail for residents. However, this portion of the ditch does not deliver water to the
     Sonora Water Treatment Plant. All water to that facility from Phoenix Lake is transported
     via pipeline.

                                                     Chapter 4: Conservation & Open Space
supply is dependent upon natural flow of the South Fork of the Stanislaus River
which yields 100,000± acre feet including 24,000± acre feet of combined storage in
Strawberry (Pinecrest) and Lyons Reservoirs. Historically, the amount of water
supplied through the system has been more than twice the amount of water
consumed.
Groundwater provides 5.5% of domestic or treated water annually. TUD assumes it
could sustain 1,075 acre-ft over a nine-month period, annually. Recycled water is
used by private landowners for irrigating 1,000± acres of farm and pastureland.
     •   Per TUD, available water supplies for new development are currently
         dependent upon when water is requested. Presently, there is a sufficient
         volume of water available to supply existing needs for the City of Sonora.
         The peak load water demand for the City of Sonora in 2002 was 3.5 million
         gallons per day (TUD, 2004).
TUD anticipates that new development throughout the county and in the city will
receive service commitments for water based on timed agreements established on a
“first come, first serve” basis.
Based on a review of General Plan 2020 Land Use Maps, and as detailed in Tables
78 and 79, projected water needs through 2020 are as follows:
700,263 GPD is anticipated should all residential lands in the city be developed by
2020 (a decrease in expected residential water demand of nearly 124,575 GPD in
comparison to General Plan 1986).
Based on anticipated levels of residential development of all densities through the
year 2020 in the City of Sonora, water demand is expected to increase by between
87,958 GPD (with 233 new dwelling units) and 235,560 GPD (with 624 new dwelling
units)—nearly identical to projections per General Plan 1986.
Non-residential uses are expected to increase water demand (buildout is assumed
for other land uses) by an additional 103,877 GPD (an increased water demand for
non-residential uses of 38,894 GPD in comparison to General Plan 1986).
The most probable increase in water demand pursuant to General Plan 2020 is
projected to be between 191,835 – 339,437 an increased water demand for non-
residential uses of 38,894 GPD in comparison to General Plan 1986).

4.9.1.5. SPECIAL PROGRAMS
Resource Conservation Districts
The U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resource Conservation Service
(formerly the Soil Conservation Service) provides technical support for local non-
profit community-outreach and education organizations called Resource
Conservation Districts (RCDs).      RCDs are special districts composed of volunteer
board members appointed by local governments.                 RCDs stress resource
conservation without government regulation.       Tuolumne County is not currently
included in a Resource Conservation District (although it is part of a Resource
Conservation & Development Area, a different organization performing some
services similar to those of the RCD and also sponsored by the USDA).
RCDs have a long history of working cooperatively with local agricultural interests
and, increasingly, with other resource conservation interests, particularly
communities interested in watershed management and maintenance of water quality.
Watershed planning and watershed stewardship programs are being increasingly
facilitated and implemented by RCDs throughout California. As a result, California,
at the urging of the California Association of Resource Conservation Districts,
recently passed legislation which provides funding for hiring watershed planners and
coordinators.
In short, RCDs can provide special assistance for resource conservation planning
and implementation programs, especially for those related to the conservation and
management of water resources. In addition, RCDs have access to special funding
sources for these activities unavailable to many governmental agencies. And, given
the RCDs non-governmental status and emphasis on voluntary stewardship, RCDs
are increasingly succeeding in accomplishing resource conservation on private
property in cooperation with landowners and with the preservation of private property
rights--an area where government regulatory programs have frequently failed.

4.10. Water Resources: Goals, Policies and Implementation
         Programs
Goal:
    4.E         Conserve the quality and quantity of the city’s and county’s water
                resources.
Policies:
   4.E.1        Reduce non-point source pollution from urban, residential and other
                land uses.
   4.E.2        Reduce erosion and sedimentation in water ways.
   4.E.3        Maintain and enhance the water quality of Sonora Creek, Woods
                Creek and Dragoon Gulch.
   4.E.4        Provide managed public access to waterways.
   4.E.5        Conduct ongoing water quality monitoring to assess the success of
                the city’s water management programs.
   4.E.6        Support efforts to increase Tuolumne Utilities District’s (TUD) water
                supply.
   4.E.7        Support efforts to improve the capacity of the city’s and county’s
                sewage treatment facilities.
Implementation Programs:
   4.E.a        Consider the Establishment           of   a    Voluntary      Watershed
                Stewardship Program
                Consider the establishment of a voluntary, stewardship-based
                watershed stewardship program emphasizing the reduction of non-
                point source pollutants from urban and residential uses. Consider a
                partnership with an existing resource conservation district to
                implement the program. Models for these programs are available
                through: a) the Northeast Regional Agricultural Engineering Service,
                Farm*A*Syst/Home*A*Syst Program and its published guide:
                Home*A*Syst, An Environmental Risk-Assessment Guide for the
                Home and b) The San Joaquin County Resource Conservation
                District Watershed Homeowner’s Manual available through the USDA
                Natural Resources Conservation Service Stockton Field Office and
                online at www.sjcrcd.org.       Investigate funding for a watershed
                coordinator through the state-funded watershed coordinator program.

   4.E.b        Promote the Establishment of an Ongoing Water Quality
                Monitoring Program
                Sponsor the formation of a state-certified citizen monitoring program
                to monitor water quality within Woods Creek and Sonora Creek.
                Enlist the aid of local schools to participate in the program.
                Establish set monitoring locations along the creeks above and below
                areas of industrial, commercial and residential concentration areas
                located along the streams and above and below storm drain outlets to
                the creeks.
                Consider monitoring the following baseline water quality parameters in
                accordance with the US EPA Office of Water Volunteer Stream
                Monitoring: A Methods Manual: stream flow, dissolved oxygen (DO)
                and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), temperature, pH, turbidity,
                phosphorous, nitrates, total solids, conductivity, total alkalinity, and
                fecal bacteria.      Monitoring for specific contaminants known, or
                expected to occur, may be added as the program progresses.
                Normally, volunteer monitors are responsible for the collection of
                water samples for specific contaminants. However, the samples are
                normally forwarded to professional labs for detailed analysis.
                Consider partnerships with a) local schools to promote student
                monitoring (Storm Drain Detectives), b) the California Department of
                Fish and Game, Fisheries, c) the Tuolumne County Environmental
                Health Department, d) and others similar agencies and organizations.
   4.E.c        Continue to Maintain Setbacks Along Sonora Creek, Woods
                Creek and Dragoon Gulch
                To protect water quality and its associated biological resources, the
                city has designated minimum streamside setbacks of 50 feet on both
                sides of Woods Creek, Sonora Creek and Dragoon Gulch (as
                measured from the top of the bank of the creek or drainage channel)
                on the Sonora General Plan 2020 Land Use Maps.                       These
                designations are interim and subject to change upon completion of
                floodplain studies of Woods Creek and Sonora Creek through the city
                limits being undertaken by the Resource Conservation &
                Development District or equivalent studies.
                The city shall establish a Recreation/Open Space (or comparable)
                zoning district and rezone these setback/buffer areas as Recreation
                and/or Open Space. This zoning district shall permit only small,
                public-utility or recreation-related structures and other similar uses
                consistent with the preservation of water quality and protection of
                biological resources. Reductions in the established setbacks may be
                acquired through issuance of a variance. Structures encroaching
                within the established setbacks as of the Effective Date of Sonora
                General Plan 2020 may be expanded provided that the expansion
                does not encroach farther into the established drainage setback (i.e.,

                Expansions of existing structures away from the drainage, but not
                towards the drainage are permitted).

Chapter 5.                     Noise
5.1.      Requirements
Government Code Section 65302(f) requires general plans to include a Noise Element
which identifies and appraises noise problems in the community. The noise element shall
recognize the guidelines established by the Office of Noise Control in the State Department
of Health Services and shall analyze and quantify, to the extent practicable, as determined
by the legislative body, current and projected noise levels for all of the following sources:
        •       Highways and Freeways
        •       Primary arterials and major local streets
        •       Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and group rapid transit
                systems
        •       Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, and military airport
                operations, aircraft overflights, jet engine test stands, and all other ground
                facilities and maintenance functions related to airport operation
        •       Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classification
                yards
        •       Other ground stationary noise sources identified by local agencies as
                contributing to the community noise environment
Noise contours shall be shown for all of these sources and stated in terms of community
noise equivalent level (CNEL) or day-night average level (Ldn). The noise contours shall be
prepared on the basis of noise monitoring or following generally accepted noise modeling
techniques for the various sources identified above in 1-6. Noise contours shall be used as
a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses in the land use element that minimizes the
exposure of community residents to excessive noise.
The noise element shall include implementation measures and possible solutions that
address existing and foreseeable noise problems, if any. The adopted noise element shall
serve as a guideline for compliance with the state’s noise insulation standards.
Section 46050.1 of the Health and Safety Code further requires that revisions to noise
elements in general plans shall be more standardized, comprehensive and utilitarian than
had been previously and shall use the guidelines for preparation and content of noise
elements as provided by the Office of Planning and Research and summarized in
Government Code Section 65302(f).
Pursuant to the California Department of Health Services, Guidelines for the Preparation
and Content of the Noise Element of the General Plan, 1998 (as included in the State of
California General Plan Guidelines, State Office of Planning and Research), the
fundamental goals of the Noise Element are to:

             •   Provide sufficient information concerning the community noise environment
                 so that noise may be effectively considered in the land use planning process.
                 In so doing, the necessary groundwork will have been developed so that a
                 community noise ordinance may be used to resolve noise complaints
             •   Develop strategies for abating excessive noise exposure through cost-
                 effective mitigating measures in combination with zoning, as appropriate, to
                 avoid incompatible land uses
             •   Protect those existing regions of the planning area whose noise environments
                 are deemed acceptable and also those locations throughout the community
                 deemed “noise sensitive”
             •   Use the definition of community noise environment, in the form of CNEL or
                 Ldn noise contours as provided in the Noise Element for local compliance with
                 the State Noise Insulation Standards. These standards require specific levels
                 of outdoor to indoor noise reduction for new multi-family residential
                 construction in areas where the outdoor noise exposure exceeds CNEL (or
                 Ldn) 60 dB
The City of Sonora maintains representation on the Airport Land Use Commission for the
Columbia Airport.         Minor disturbances related with borade bombers flying over the city
during fires and occasionally received, but airport-related noise disturbances are not
significant for the city.
5.2.      Issues and Opportunities
5.2.1.    Noise-Generating Sources In/Adjacent to Sonora
The City of Sonora has identified the following noise-generating sources located within or
adjacent to the city (See Figure 16):
             •   Highways and major arterial roadways
             •   Trains operating along the Sierra Railroad
             •   Construction activities
             •   The Sonora Police Department firing range
             •   Trotter Welding/Breshear’s Petroleum/Joe Martin Trucking
             •   Heliports
Highways and Arterial Roadways
Noise generated by vehicles and trucks along Highways 108 and 49 and along major arterial
roadways, such as Greenley Road, is the primary contributor to Sonora’s community noise
levels. Table 80 illustrates the distance, in feet, that noise exceeding 60 dB extends from
these roadways (i.e., the noise contour levels). Table 80 illustrates the distance (in feet)
from the centerline of highways and roadways that noise levels of 60dB or greater exist
along Sonora’s major transportation routes (existing and through the year 2020):

Sierra Railroad
The Sierra Railroad line passes through the southern portion of the city, crossing South
Washington Street near its intersection with Hospital Road, and passing in front of
Tuolumne General Hospital as it winds its way eastward. Under current operating
conditions, a train makes one round-trip to the lumber mill in Standard through Sonora daily
(passing through Sonora twice each day). Occasional passenger trains from Railtown 1897
State Historic Park in Jamestown and occasional work trains also may pass through Sonora.
Freight trains through Sonora could increase to two round-trips daily depending upon
operations at the lumber mill in Standard (Ingold, 2001).
The Sierra Railroad has investigated increasing it freight hauling operations from time to
time. Materials would likely be hauled by rail from their site of origin to either the lumber mill
in Standard and/or through the City of Sonora and on to the Central Valley. In the event of
increased freight operations, it is expected that existing freight trains would simply add
additional cars and operate on existing freight schedules thereby increasing the length of
trains while maintaining the number of trains passing through Sonora (Beil, 2001).
Noise levels from railroad operations in Tuolumne County were quantified in 1996 using the
Wyle Laboratories analytical method recommended by the California Office of Noise Control
for Noise Element studies (which considers reference noise levels from various types of
trains, distance from tracks, speed and the characteristics of the track). According to this
analysis, the 65 and 60 dB Ldn contours for the Sierra Railroad are located less than 100 feet
from the tracks. This indicates that noise exposure, as defined by the Ldn probably is not
significant from the railroad, although some intermittent interruption of activities due to train
noise may affect persons located near the tracks.26
The proximity of Tuolumne General Hospital, as a noise sensitive facility, to the Sierra
railroad line would normally be an indicator that careful consideration should be made
regarding the noise environment. However, neither the Sonora Police Department nor the
Sierra Railroad Company have received complaints related to noise from trains along the
Sierra Railroad. In fact, the trains, particularly when the steam engines are running, may
provide a diversion for hospital patients, particularly long-term care patients. Therefore,
while the potential for significant noise impacts exist, no implementation programs are
proposed to address rail operations under current conditions, but, instead, programs will
focus on recognizing the noise-generating potential of the railroad in making land use
planning decisions for new development located along the tracks within the city (Ingold,
2001b).
Construction
Because construction noises are transient, there has not been a concerted effort to reduce
the noise levels of the equipment involved. However, as the city expands and as the older
areas are renewed and rehabilitated, the noise from construction will become more

Sonora Police Department Firing Range
The City of Sonora Police Department maintains an outdoor practice firing range at the
south end of Southgate Drive in the extreme southwestern limits of the city near the
Tuolumne Utility District’s sewer treatment ponds.
The firing range is used by safety service and law enforcement agencies (Ellis, 2001). The
range is used approximately six times per year by the Sonora Police Department and up to
eight times a year by the CHP. Historically, some isolated complaints were received from a
nearby residence during sale of the home. The Sonora Police Department worked with the
landowner, conducted noise level surveys and resolved the issues by altering hours of
operation at the firing range. Hours of operation are regulated by city policy. Given the
limited use of the site, the isolated complaints and the resolution of the complaints, no
programs are proposed to address the firing range until and unless a problem is identified.

Trotter Welding/Breshears Petroleum/Joe Martin Trucking
Pursuant to the 1996 Noise Background Report for Tuolumne County, Trotter Welding,
Breshears Petroleum and Joe Martin Trucking, located along Sanguinetti Road, just off
Route 108 in East Sonora (near the eastern boundary of the existing city limits) were
identified as a stationary noise generating operation. Noise sources at the site include
small pumps, motors, torches and truck movements.          The 60 dB Ldn contour for this
business has been located at a distance of 180 feet from the source (see Figure 16).
Heliports
Sonora Regional Medical Center’s new hospital on Greenley Road has an on-the-ground
helipad for medical helicopters located at the western end of the hospital (away from
Greenley Road). It is anticipated that up to 50 flights per year may be generated by the
hospital from this helipad (Devitt, 2001). Tuolumne General Hospital reports that it also
uses air-flight providers approximately 50 times per year and plans a cooperative use of the
new Sonora Regional Medical Center’s helipad.
Therefore, approximately 100 flights per year are anticipated from the new helipad at the
new Sonora Regional Medical Center.
The flight plan for the helicopters will be to and from a southerly direction. Because this
flight plan will travel primarily over roadways and existing commercial developments,
impacts related to noise will be largely reduced. Residents located west of the helipad will
be buffered from the helipad by the hillside which divides the hospital from residential uses
to the west.
Other Noise Generators
As prescribed in the California Department of Health Services, Guidelines for the
Preparation and Content of the Noise Element of the General Plan, noise complaints
received by the Sonora Police Department were reviewed to identify other noise-generating
sources.       Other noise-related complaints received by the Sonora Police Department
include:
             •   Barking dogs
             •   Car stereos
             •   Noisy vehicles at Sonora High School
             •   Motorcycles
             •   Mother Lode Fairgrounds
             •   Sonora High School football field
Barking Dogs
Complaints related to barking dogs are received with relative frequency (Police Department,
2001).
Vehicle-Related
Vehicle-related complaints also are relatively common and include complaints related to car
stereos (especially those playing heavy, loud, bass); noisy vehicles near Sonora High
School (e.g., students gunning engines, peeling out); and complaints related to motorcycles

traveling in large groups during annual events (e.g. Calaveras County Frog Jump). The
City of Sonora also has received complaints related to noise generated by large trucks
braking on Washington Street. The California Vehicle Code (2001) establishes noise limits
for motorcycles and vehicles which are included in General Plan 2020 Appendix 5A.
Fairgrounds
A more limited number of complaints are received from residents of Southgate during certain
events at the Mother Lode Fairgrounds and relative to construction activities within the city.
Construction
Please refer to discussions pertaining to noise levels from construction activities in the
preceding section.
Sonora High School Football Field
Limited complaints also are received concerning noise at the Sonora High School football
field (e.g., band noise during games or special events). However, the Sonora Police
Department has found that the public is generally accepting of noise generated by events at
the Sonora High School football field.
5.2.2.     Community Noise Exposure Inventory
A requirement of the Noise Element is to analyze the current and future impacts on
community residents of noise emanating from identified noise-generating sources.                 By
plotting the 65 and 60 dB figures using Figure 16, and projecting them through the year
2020 using Table 80, the following estimates of community residents who may be subject to
noise levels in excess of 60 and 65 dB for the years 1995 and 2020 may be estimated as
follows:

               eastern side of Shepherd [assuming that noise contours north of the city
               limits extend along both sides of Washington Street (Hwy 49) south to
               Stockton Road within the city limits]. It is anticipated that this will result in the

               Parcel Number 56-340-02, totaling 4± acres) will be exposed to 60dB and
               65dB contours under both existing noise conditions and projected 2020 noise
               conditions. It is estimated that this will result in the exposure of an additional
               16-32± households to 60dB and 65dB noise levels by 2020.

Greenley Road from Mono Way to Lyons Street
       •       The Sunrise Hills residential subdivision is located outside of existing and
               projected noise contours for 60dB and 65dB generated along Greenley Road
               and, therefore, is not expected to be affected.
       •       A portion of two of the existing three apartment complexes located between
               Morningstar Drive and Lyons Street along Greenley Road will become
               increasingly exposed to traffic noise from Greenley as the 60dB noise contour
               expands from 41 to a projected 60 feet from centerline of the roadway. It is
               estimated that 5± additional multi-family units within these two complexes
               may be affected.

   5.A.b       Adopt Exterior Ambient Community Noise Exposure Levels (CNEL)
               Adopt the exterior ambient community noise exposure levels (CNELs) in
               Figure 17 for application to all new development in the City of Sonora.
   5.A.c       Continue to Enforce State Noise Insulation Standards and Uniform
               Building Code Standards for Interior Noise Levels
               Continue to enforce the State Noise Insulation Standards (California Code of
               Regulations, Title 24) and Chapter 35 of the Uniform Building Code (UBC)
               establishing interior noise exposure for multi-family housing, hotels and
               motels. Reference these requirements in the city’s noise ordinance (See
               Program 5.A.a).
   5.A.d       Adopt Construction/Maintenance Activity Noise Management Standards
               Include in the city’s noise ordinance (see Program 5.A.a), construction and
               maintenance activity noise management standards to be applied to new
               development and maintenance activities which may adversely affect
               neighboring land uses including, but not limited to:
                     •     Limit construction/maintenance activity hours
                     •     Require acoustic muffling per Caltrans standards; and
                     •     Establish standards for small engines (e.g. two-cycle engines, leaf-
                           blowers, chainsaws).
   5.A.e       Require Acoustic Analyses for New Development Near Noise-Sensitive
               Land Uses or Proposed Near Pre-Existing Noise Generators
               Require an acoustic analysis for new development with the potential for
               adverse noise-generation to perform an acoustic analysis whenever such
               development is located near existing residential areas, schools, hospitals,
               nursing homes, churches, libraries or similar noise-sensitive receptor land
               uses.        Similarly, when new, potentially noise-sensitive development is
               proposed adjacent to an identified noise generator, require preparation of an
               acoustic analysis. Acoustical Analyses prepared pursuant to this element
               shall27: 1) Be the financial responsibility of the applicant; 2) Be prepared by a
               qualified person (as determined by the city) experienced in the fields of
               environmental noise assessment and architectural acoustics; 3) Include
               representative noise level measurements with sufficient sampling periods and
               locations to adequately describe local conditions and significant noise
               sources. Where actual field measurements cannot be conducted, all sources
               of information used for calculation purposes shall be fully described; 4)

               with adopted policies of the Noise Element, giving preference to proper site
               planning and design over mitigation measures which require the construction
               of noise barriers or structural modifications to buildings which contain noise-
               sensitive land uses; and 6) Estimate noise exposure after the prescribed
               mitigation measures have been implemented.
   5.A.f       Adopt Guidelines for Controlling Stationary Noise
               Adopt guidelines for controlling stationary noise at the source through the use
               of insulation, berms, building design/orientation, buffer strips, staggered
               operating hours, maintaining existing and/or planting new vegetation, and
               other techniques. Maintain up-to-date reference materials illustrating new
               noise-controlling measures which may be incorporated into the design of new
               projects located adjacent to identified noise-generating land uses or with the
               potential to generate adverse noise levels [e.g., Caltrans Noise Manual,
               Fundamentals and Abatement of Highway Traffic Noise (U.S. DOT, Federal
               Highway Administration, National Highway Institute Report No. FHWA-HHI-
               HEV-73-7976-2)].
   5.A.g       Protect On-Going Existing Noise-Generating Land Uses
               Protect on-going operations of existing land uses identified within the City of
               Sonora’s General Plan 2020 where such land uses are operating below the
               maximum noise levels recorded in 1996 and contained in the City of Sonora’s
               Noise Element. If these identified uses propose expansions or changes in
               use which would increase noise levels, then such new uses or expansion
               shall be subject to the provisions of the Noise Element and applicable
               implementing ordinances.
   5.A.h       Adopt a Program for Addressing Noise Complaints from Other
               Identified Noise Sources
               The Noise Element identifies the following other sources of noise complaints
               within the city limits: barking dogs, loud car stereos, noisy vehicles at Sonora
               High School, Motorcycles, and the Mother Lode Fairgrounds. The city shall
               adopt a program, as part of its Noise Ordinance, for addressing noise
               complaints from these sources including, but not limited to:
               General: Use the City of Sonora Police Department’s Community Service
               Officers to assist in resolving noise disputes, including those resulting from
               barking dogs.
               Barking dogs:         Coordinate with Animal Control to provide enforcement
               agencies and public counters with information on available dog training
               (maintaining a list of local animal trainers and a schedule of dog-training
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                     Noise - 275

                                                                                       Chapter 5: Noise
               classes). Continue to use the city’s existing nuisance ordinance, when
               necessary to resolve noise disputes related to barking dogs.
               Fairgrounds: Conduct noise surveys of residential interior spaces from which
               noise complaints are regularly received.                   Investigate establishing a
               Community Development Block Grant program to assist in implementing an
               insulation improvement program to assist homeowners undertaking home
               rehabilitation projects along Southgate in reducing interior noise levels.
               Noisy vehicles/loud stereos:            Provide coordination between local high
               schools, the CHP, and City of Sonora Police Department (Sonora Resource
               Officer) to include, as part of the local driver’s education curriculum,
               information related to noise limits established in the California Vehicle Code
               and the effects to engines of revving and similar noise-generating actions.
               Continue to enforce existing vehicle noise standards.
               Truck brakes: Consider extending (or replacing lost signage related to) the
               current prohibition against the use of “Jake” brakes along all of Washington
               Street.
               Motorcycles: Continue to enforce established noise limits established in the
               California Vehicle Code.
   5.A.i       Coordination with Circulation, Housing and Conservation and Open
               Space Elements
               Continue to coordinate the goals, policies and implementation programs of
               the Noise Element with those of the Circulation, Housing and Conservation
               and Open Space Elements when updating the Sonora General Plan 2020
               and adopting implementing ordinances.

Key:
Normally Acceptable:
Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are of normal conventional
construction, without any special noise insulation requirements.
Conditionally Acceptable:
New construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the noise reduction
requirements is made and needed noise insulation features included in the design. Conventional Construction, but
with closed windows and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning will normally suffice.
Normally Unacceptable:
New construction or development should generally be discouraged. If new construction or development does
proceed, a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features
included in the design.
Clearly Unacceptable:
New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.
Note to Figure 17: Where the location of an outdoor activity area is unknown, the
exterior noise level standard shall be applied to the property line of the receiving land
uses. When determining the effectiveness of noise mitigation measures, the
standards may be applied on the receptor side of the noise barriers or other property
line noise mitigation measures.

Chapter 6.                      Safety
Requirements
The Safety Element is a required element of Sonora General Plan 2020. Pursuant
to Government Code Section 65302(g), the purpose of the Safety Element is to
protect the community from unreasonable risks associated with the effects of
seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche,
and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence,
liquefaction and other seismic or geologic hazards known to the city. The element
also must address flooding, wild land and urban fires.
The Safety Element must include mapping of known seismic and other geologic
hazards, address evacuation routes, military installations, peak load water supply
requirements, and minimum road widths and clearances around structures as those
items relate to identified fire and geologic hazards.
The element must be prepared after consultation with the California Department of
Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology (now the California Geological Survey)
and the Office of Emergency Services. Prior to adoption, the Safety element must
be submitted to the California Geological Survey along with technical studies used in
developing the element.
Issues and Opportunities
Emergency or disaster situations which could affect the City of Sonora include:
         •      Geological Hazards (earthquakes, unstable slopes, collapsing mines,
                limestone, erosive soils, volcanic activity)
         •      Floods
         •      Hazardous Materials
         •      Fire
         •      Water Supply
         •      Transportation Accidents
         •      Severe Weather
         •      Agricultural Disasters
         •      Radiological Incidents
         •      Civil Disturbances
         •      Utility Failures
Population
The City of Sonora has a population of approximately 4,600 persons (2004).
However, this population can rise to an estimated 25,000 individuals during the day
due to the presence of the Tuolumne County administrative and service offices and
courts located within the county seat of Sonora. Day-time population within the city
limits is further increased by visitors inhabiting hotels within the city, tourists, and
shoppers from throughout the county visiting the county’s main shopping district

                                                                        Chapter 6: Safety
within the city limits. Special events, such as the Mother Lode Fair, Mother Lode
Round-Up and similar events further inflate the city’s population.          As a result,
staffing levels to provide adequate police and fire protection and emergency services
must go far beyond that necessary to protect the city residents, but must also provide
services for non-residents, workers, and visitors.
Chapter Organization

6.1.       Geologic Hazards
The Updated Geotechnical Safety Issues Report, January 1996 [hereinafter 1996
Update], by Geotechnical Research and Development, Sutter Creek, was prepared
in conjunction with the update of the 1996 Tuolumne County General Plan. The
report includes maps showing the approximate boundaries of faults, areas of slope
instability (based on steep slopes) and limestone soils throughout Tuolumne County.
That report is hereby incorporated by reference. Tuolumne County also maintains
Geotechnical Interpretive Diagrams.          Geotechnical Interpretive Diagrams for the
Sonora, Columbia and Columbia SE Quadrangles have been adopted in conjunction
with the Sonora General Plan 2020 adoption and are hereby incorporated by
reference as the Sonora General Plan 2020 Geotechnical Diagrams. These maps
and documents are summarized as follows:
6.1.1.     Seismic Hazards
Seismic hazards within Tuolumne County include potential ground rupture, ground
shaking, and ground failure during earthquakes.
Ground Rupture
Tuolumne County is located east of the Foothills Fault System which includes two
primary fault zones: the Melones Fault Zone along the eastern edge of the Foothill
Fault System and the Bear Mountain Fault Zone located on the western side of the
Foothills Fault System. The Melones Fault Zone is classified as “active” (i.e., has
demonstrated displacement within the last 100,000 years). The Bear Mountain fault
zone is classified as “indeterminable active” (i.e., definitive evidence has not been
established).
Pursuant to the 1996 Update, four “capable” faults (i.e., faults with tectonic
displacement within the last 35,000 years which could produce a quake) are located
in Tuolumne County:
         •   Negro Jack Point
         •   Bowie Flat
         •   Rawhide Flat West (estimated maximum Magnitude 6.2 quake capability)
         •   Rawhide Flat East (estimated maximum 6.2 Magnitude quake capability)
The locations of these faults and their proximity to the City of Sonora are illustrated in
the Sonora General Plan 2020 Geotechnical Diagrams available for review at Sonora
City Hall.
Based on history data, particularly work performed on the Auburn and New Melones
Dam sites (Woodward Clyde, 1975, 1977 and 1978), the California Geologic Service
determined that the Melones Fault Zone is capable of generating a Richter 6.5
maximum credible earthquake. The modified Mercalli intensity of the Melones fault
zone for a maximum credible earthquake would be expected to be on the order of
VIII or IX--a quake resulting in moderate to major damage (Table 4, page 29 of the
Tuolumne County General Plan Master EIR Documentation).                   Woodward and
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                   Safety - 280

                                                                          Chapter 6: Safety
Clyde further estimated the recurrence of a maximum credible earthquake along the
fault to be on the order of 25,000 years (as compared to 250 years on the San
Andreas Fault System). Per the 1996 Update:
        “The implication of this long recurrence interval is that the area has a very low
        probability of being subjected to a ‘maximum event’ during the life of the
        project.”
Maximum credible earthquakes on the Rawhide Flat East and Rawhide Flat West
faults are estimated to be Magnitude 6.2 (Dames and Moore, 1993) with a
recurrence interval of 10,000-30,000 years (Woodward Clyde, 1978).
While moderate rather than devastating quakes are more likely to occur in Sonora;
the 1990 Sonora Emergency Operations Plan states that the danger to life and
property in the city resulting from earthquake is significant.         The Plan cites an
historic quake which nearly destroyed the downtown district resulting in significant
damage to residences and resulting in destruction of the majority of unreinforced
masonry structures.       Historical records reference quakes felt in the city in 1868,
1870, 1876, 1877 with one of the largest and most sustained quakes occurring on
March 26, 1872 in conjunction with the Inyo County quake. Aftershocks of the 1872
quake continued through August of 1872.
The 1996 Update, concludes that the probability of a development project being
impacted by a fault within Tuolumne County (and hence the City of Sonora) is
remote compared with the same development project being impacted by one of the
other three fault systems in Northern California located outside of Tuolumne County:
        •   The Coast Ranges-Sierran Block boundary zone (40 miles west of the
            Foothills fault system and conservatively estimated to be capable of a
            Magnitude 7 quake)
        •   The Sierra Nevada frontal fault system (the eastern boundary of the
            county is near this system, but the City of Sonora and the majority of the
            developed county is located approximately 60 miles south of the system
            which is conservatively estimated to be capable of a Magnitude 7.5
            quake), and
        •   The San Andreas fault system (in the general vicinity of San Francisco
            and including the Hayward, Calaveras, and Greenville faults which
            produced the Magnitude 8.25 San Francisco quake of 1906 and
            Magnitude 7.1 Loma Prieta quake of 1989)
Ground Shaking
Based on the likelihood of an earthquake of moderate magnitude occurring within the
area (see preceding analysis), the 1996 Update concludes:
        “Tuolumne County is located in a potentially active seismic area. Although
        the long period of time for the recurrence interval between significant effects
        implies that the project area will not be effected [sic] during the project’s life, it
        should be expected that a remote chance exists for the site to be subjected to
        moderate ground shaking.”

                                                                         Chapter 6: Safety
The International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) designated all of the United
States into four zones based on likelihood of earthquake in the area. The larger the
number (1-4), the higher the likelihood of earthquake occurring. All of California is
designated as either Zone 3 or Zone 4. Tuolumne County is located within Seismic
Zone 3.        The Uniform Building Code (UBC) includes building standards for each
zone with construction standards for the strongest buildings able to withstand
significant ground shaking required in Zone 4 with lesser standards for strength in
Zone 1. Compliance with the construction standards of the UBC (Current Edition) for
Seismic Zone 3 reduces the likelihood of damage to structures from ground shaking
associated with moderate earthquakes in the City of Sonora.
Ground Failure
Ground shaking results in liquefaction, lateral spreading, lurching and differential
settlement which may occur in unconsolidated, fine grained, water-saturated
sediments typically found in valleys. Based on the known geology and topography
of the city, it is not anticipated that these types of seismically-related ground failures
would occur within the city unless development has been located on incompetent
(i.e., inadequate or defective) fill materials. Soils disturbed by grading may result in
differential settlement of soils without proper implementation of engineered grading
plans.
Seiches and Tsunami
Seiches are earthquake-generated waves within enclosed or restricted bodies of
water such as lakes or reservoirs.          The waves are generated by oscillation or
rocking back and forth (like rocking in a bathtub until the “waves” grow large enough
to spill out of the tub).     Seiches are most commonly observed in swimming pools
during earthquakes (although swimming pools normally hold insufficient water to
create a threat to life and property from seiches). There are no lakes or reservoirs
within close enough proximity to the City of Sonora to present a likely hazard.
Further, there is no evidence that seiches have ever occurred in Tuolumne County’s
lakes and reservoirs.        Therefore, seiches present an unlikely threat to the City of
Sonora.
Because the City of Sonora has no land within proximity to a seacoast, there is no
potential for tsunami (i.e., tidal wave).

6.1.2.      Geologic Hazards
Unstable Slopes/Landslides/Erosive Soils/Erosion
Soils within the City of Sonora are generally shallow.                    The nature of the soils
underlying surface soils provide a good indicator of the likelihood of erosion, potential
for shrinking and swelling, and slope stability.
The potential for erosion of soils increases with the steepness of a slope. Generally,
slopes in excess of 30% present a high potential for slope failure/erosion. Areas
within the city with slopes of 30% or more are illustrated on the Sonora General Plan
2020 Diagrams.
Grading activities remove natural vegetative cover that protects soils from erosion.
As a result, grading plans should include erosion control plans with a specified
timeline for implementation to reduce the erosion of soils.
A map of soils types with a description of soil characteristics within the City of Sonora
are found in General Plan 2020 Appendix 6B.
Subsidence and Differential Settlement – Mines, Limestone
Subsidence is settling of the ground surface in response to fluid withdrawals, mine
excavations, solution cavity (i.e., cave) collapse or hyrdocompaction. Differential
settlement is a form of subsidence in which one soil mass settles at a different rate
than an adjacent soil mass.
Settlement due to fluid (e.g., oil, water) withdrawal is theoretically possible in the
extreme western portion of the county, but is unlikely since oil deposits have not
been discovered in Tuolumne County and large withdrawal of groundwater by
agriculture does not exist on a large scale.
Past mining activity has created a subsurface system of miles of tunnels and shafts,
primarily excavated in hard rock. These tunnels and shafts have collapsed in the
past and will continue to collapse in the future as the tunnels and shafts continue to
fill with water and supporting timbers decay and crumble. Localized subsidence has
been observed near the former openings of some of the city’s historic mines and has
historically resulted in sinking homes and sinking streets. It is likely that subsidence
in the vicinity of water lines, sewer lines, or drainage structures could also affect the
ability of those facilities to function.28

      Rumors persist of tunnels beneath the sidewalks and roadways in Sonora reportedly
      constructed and used by the Chinese to allow for underground passage necessary to
      avoid persecution by Whites or for use as joss houses (Union Democrat, 2004). Based
      on research by Priscilla Wegars, Ph.D., Volunteer Curator, Laboratory of Anthropology,
      University of Idaho, (www.uidaho.edu/LS/AACC/RESEARCH.HTM#tunnels):
          “ Many communities where large numbers of Chinese people once lived are today rumored to
          have so-called ‘Chinese tunnels’ under downtown buildings and streets. This myth continues to
          be perpetuated despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
          During Priscilla Wegars' extensive research on the Chinese in the West, she has never found
          any documentation or substantiation for these rumored ‘Chinese tunnels.’ In cities where the
          Chinese owned buildings and utilized the basements, the latter may have been subdivided or
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                              Safety - 284

                                                                                       Chapter 6: Safety
In 2004, the owners of the St. James Episcopal Church (i.e., the Red Church)
initiated a survey of its holdings with the use of ground penetrating radar when the
rectory began to shift and sink. This followed the removal of the church’s youth
center in 2002 when that building also began sinking. The results of the church-
initiated study confirmed the collapse of workings from portions of the Big Bonanza
and Little Bonanza mines located beneath the rectory.                           Radar readings also
identified “voids” within 20 feet of the ground surface beneath some of the roadways
in the vicinity of the church (Lundin, 2004). Anecdotal evidence indicates that these
roadway sections are subject to repeated maintenance--potentially due to the effects
of settling and subsidence resulting from collapse of the underground mines beneath
the roadways.           Sometimes the effects of subsidence on city streets is more
substantial, as in the 1960s when a portion of Washington Street collapsed into a
mine tunnel during a heavy storm—luckily the collapse occurred at night, preventing
injuries (Union Democrat, 2004).
The 1996 Update similarly warns of potential damage from subsidence caused by
collapsing mines:
         “Caution is warranted when projects are contemplated in former mining areas
         due to the potential for collapse of near surface abandoned mine workings
         due to increased surface loading by grading or building loads”.
Limestone is found throughout Brown’s Flat at the northern boundary of the City of
Sonora and may extend down through portions of North Washington Street and
adjacent areas.         Limestone is a generic term for carbonate bedrock subject to
solution cavities (i.e., the formation of “caves”) when limestone is dissolved by
groundwater. If these “caves” are located near the ground surface, collapse can
occur resulting in sink holes. Similarly, the location of private septic systems within
limestone areas is problematic due to the drainage of sewage into caves, with
minimal leaching, and ultimately into groundwater.                    Because new development
within the city is required to connect to a public sewer system, the threat of
groundwater contamination from septic systems is unlikely.
Differential settlement occurs when a structurally incompetent man-made or natural
fill area is located adjacent to a competent fill or bedrock.                        Foundation loads
         partitioned into smaller areas as living quarters or opium-smoking establishments, with
         hallways, but these in no way can be considered ‘tunnels.’
         In Lewiston, Idaho, for example, Erb Hardware Company President Jeanine Bennett graciously
         led Wegars on a tour of the store's basement areas, in response to a local newspaper's
         suggestion that it contained entrances to such "tunnels." Instead, the arched openings actually
         lead to passageways under the sidewalk (today either in use as storage areas, or blocked up)
         that were once used for delivery access, or to admit light. The architectural term for these
         passageways is "sidewalk vaults."
         Although the sidewalk openings (metal doors) or glass blocks to allow light (round or
         rectangular; eventually colored purple by the sun), no longer exist in the sidewalk around Erb's,
         they can be seen in the sidewalks of many towns and cities throughout the West. The
         passageways underneath them are simply access channels, and have no connection with
         early Chinese residents. The same can be said for the so-called "Chinese tunnels" rumored to
         exist in Boise and Pocatello, Idaho; Baker City and Pendleton, Oregon; Seattle and Tacoma,
         Washington; Victoria, BC, and many other places.“

spanning the two differing soil masses are supported unequally and result in uneven
settling of the foundation. This can be avoided through proper evaluation of soils
prior to construction with testing and foundation engineering employed to resolve the
problem prior to construction.
Volcanic activity
There are no active volcanoes identified in Tuolumne County. However, volcanic
eruptions from Mammoth Lakes, located approximately 77 air miles (150 driving
miles) southeast of the city, could occur. Explosive eruptions would create volcanic
ash or streams of hot ash and rock mixed with hot gases into the air. Non-explosive
eruptions could result in lava flows and domes with associated gas emissions.
The City of Sonora is most likely to be impacted by the clouds of volcanic ash that
could result from an eruption in Mammoth Lakes (an ash layer of up to a few inches
and including anything from fine dust to fist-size rocks). Large rock fragments are
likely to blow only six miles from the volcano and therefore are not expected to
impact the City of Sonora.
Ash from one-half to a few inches thick could:
             •  halt traffic (clogging engines)
             •  disrupt electrical services, transportation, business, water supply and
                communications services
             •  hamper visibility
             •  create darkness (depending on severity of the eruption)
             •  affect those with respiratory problems
             •  muddy water
             •  result in chemical contamination of water
             •  cause rapid wearing of machinery
             •  clog air filters
             •  block drains and water intakes
             •  injure vegetation
             •  generate electrical storms (potentially starting fires or disrupting radio
                communications)
             •  short-circuit electrical systems (damp ash)
Unlike earthquake or wildland fires for which many city residents have had some
limited experience, most city residents would be unlikely to know how to respond to a
volcanic eruption [e.g., close and lock windows and exterior doors; turn off fans,
heating and air conditioning systems; close the fireplace damper; go to an interior
room without windows; bring in pets; use duct tape and plastic sheeting (heavier than
food wrap) to seal all cracks around the door and vents into the room]. To assist in
reducing panic and facilitating self-help in emergency situations, the city should
consider citizen preparedness in its emergency response planning efforts.

               exceeding 30%). Evaluate the effects of grading on slope stability
               including standards limiting fill slopes to 1 ½:1 unless registered civil
               engineer or certified engineering geologist can demonstrate that the
               fill slope will be stable and not prone to erosion.

               Prepare, and consider for adoption, a grading ordinance to protect
               scenic resources addressing:            When a grading plan shall be
               prepared, required contents of a grading plan, anticipated grades
               before and after construction, the total amount of soil to be moved,
               significant vegetation or other natural features to be removed, location
               and design of retaining walls, erosion control standards, preparation
               of erosion control plans, recommended erosion control methods,
               when a grading permit is required, soil disposal, revegetation,
               drainage, requirements for erosion and sedimentation control plans
               and other elements, as identified. The ordinance, or a companion
               publication (either prepared as an original publication or adopted from
               existing publications) should be prepared/adopted in conjunction with
               the grading ordinance and illustrate Best Management Practices.
               Resources for recommended Best Management Practices are listed in
               Sonora General Plan 2020 Appendix 4B. The ordinance should
               further establish that no grading permit or permits to allow grading or
               vegetation removal of more than ten percent of a parcel shall be
               issued until a site plan, development plan, building permit or other
               entitlement has been issued for a specific development project.

6.3.       Flood Hazard & Dam Failure
Flooding may occur from heavy, prolonged rain and/or rapid spring thaw.
Widespread or localized flooding could involve extensive life and property loss,
interruption of transportation and communication systems, and similar facilities.
The City of Sonora is located within the Upper Tuolumne River Watershed. Primary
waterways within the City of Sonora Sphere of Influence include:
         •       Woods Creek
         •       Sonora Creek
         •       Dragoon Gulch
         •       Sullivan Creek
         •       Shaws Flat Ditch
         •       Jamestown Ditch
Water bodies within the city’s planning area include:
         •       Tuolumne Utilities District Sonora Water Treatment Plant (Bald
                 Mountain)
         •       Tuolumne Utilities District Sonora Reservoir (Saratoga Road)
         •       Tuolumne Utilities District Sewer Treatment Plant ponds
The flood potential of these waterways and water bodies within the City of Sonora
has not been evaluated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
National Flood Insurance Program. History indicates that flooding can occur quickly
and result in major property damage in the City of Sonora as illustrated on May 16,
1996 when Sonora Creek came within inches of claiming steam engine #3 at the
entrance to the Mother Lode Fairgrounds. Damage during the 1996 flooding also
took portions of the Sonora Hotel and flooded several downtown businesses when
severe thunderstorms and runoff overwhelmed Sonora and Woods Creeks and the
city’s drainage system.
Dam Failure
Dam failure could occur in one of the 45 dams in Tuolumne County causing loss of
life and property, flooding, interruption of transportation and communication systems,
etc. None of the dams required by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) to prepare inundation area maps show the City of Sonora within a potential
area of inundation. The dam failure most likely to affect the City of Sonora is the
failure of the Phoenix Lake Dam which could inundate Sullivan Creek and its
associated tributaries. The threat from a failure of the Phoenix Lake Dam was
illustrated in November, 1875 when heavy rains caused the failure of the dam and
washed away the Sullivan Creek Bridge and killing three or four persons. Unlike the
county’s larger dams, FERC regulations do no require the operators of the Phoenix
Lake Reservoir to prepare an inundation map indicating areas which could be
affected by dam failure. Consequently, the potential impacts to the City of Sonora
resulting from failure of the Phoenix Lake Dam have not been evaluated.

6.4.     Flood Hazard & Dam Failure: Goals, Policies and
         Implementation Programs
Goal:
   6.B         Protect persons and property from flooding and inundation from dam
               failures.
Policies:
   6.B.1       Assess and keep appraised of the potential risks to persons and
               property from flooding and inundation from dam failures within the
               city.
   6.B.2       Inform citizens of potential risks associated with flooding and
               inundation from dam failures within the city.
   6.B.3       Provide guidance to citizens for preparing for and responding to floods
               and inundation from dam failures affecting the city.
   6.B.4       Strive to maintain adequate levels of police, fire and other emergency
               services necessary to protect persons and property from floods and
               inundation from dam failures within the city.
Implementation Programs:
   6.B.a       Facilitate Assessment of Hazards Associated with Dam Failure at
               Phoenix Reservoir
               Gather information on ballpark cost estimates to prepare an
               inundation map in the event of failure of the Phoenix Lake Dam.
               Initiate contact with Tuolumne County and the Phoenix Lake
               Homeowners Association to discuss potential funding to map the
               potential inundation area resulting from failure of the Phoenix Lake
               Dam, along Sullivan Creek and associated tributaries and on the City
               of Sonora. Incorporate the findings of that study, if completed, into
               the city’s Emergency Operations Plan including methods for notifying
               affected landowners of the threat and, if necessary, preparation of a
               dam failure evacuation plan.
   6.B.b       Facilitate Identification and Mapping of Flood Zones in the City
               In conjunction with preparation of or updates to the city’s FEMA-
               mandated Local Hazards Mitigation Plan, identifying funding sources
               for and facilitate mapping of the city’s flood zones.         Make this
               information available at the public counter.

   6.B.c       Consider Preparation of a Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance
               Consider preparation of a flood damage prevention ordinance to guide
               development within flood zones identified pursuant to Program 6.B.b.
               In the absence of maps identifying flood zones and flood elevations
               (or equivalent) along waterways within the city; the following is
               required:
               Prior to approval of new development occurring within 75 feet of both
               sides of Sonora Creek, Woods Creek and Dragoon Gulch (measured
               from the top of the bank of the drainage); the applicant shall identify
               flood elevations and provide documentation that new development will
               be located outside of the 100-year flood elevation, prior to approval of
               new development.        The city may waive this requirement if ample
               evidence is available on-site (e.g., site topography) to clearly establish
               that new development will occur outside of the 100-year flood
               elevation.
   6.B.d       Continue to Maintain and Upgrade Drainage Facilities
               Continue to address maintenance and upgrades of the city’s drainage
               facilities. Consider preparation of a Drainage Facilities Management
               Plan to forecast when systems may require replacement and the
               potential costs and funding sources necessary to maintain the city’s
               drainage facilities. Continue to pursue sources of funding to ensure
               ongoing maintenance of the city’s storm drains.
   6.B.e       Mitigate Impacts       on   Downstream       Drainage    Facilities   and
               Property
               In conjunction with Program 6.A.j, address requirements for
               preparation of drainage plans addressing potential impacts on
               downstream drainage facilities and properties and requiring
               implementation of measures identified to reduce or eliminate those
               impacts.
   6.B.f       Continue to Maintain Setbacks Along Sonora Creek, Woods
               Creek and Dragoon Gulch
               To protect water quality and its associated biological resources, the
               city has designated minimum streamside setbacks of 50 feet on both
               sides of Woods Creek, Sonora Creek and Dragoon Gulch (as
               measured from the top of the bank of the creek or drainage channel)
               on the Sonora General Plan 2020 Land Use Maps.                      These
               designations are interim and subject to change upon completion of
               floodplain studies of Woods Creek and Sonora Creek through the city
               limits being undertaken by the Resource Conservation &
               Development District or equivalent studies.
               The city shall establish a Recreation/Open Space (or comparable)
               zoning district and rezone these setback/buffer areas as Recreation
               and/or Open Space. This zoning district shall permit only small,
               public-utility or recreation-related structures and other similar uses

               consistent with the preservation of water quality and protection of
               biological resources. Reductions in the established setbacks may be
               acquired through issuance of a variance. Structures encroaching
               within the established setbacks as of the Effective Date of Sonora
               General Plan 2020 may be expanded provided that the expansion
               does not encroach farther into the established drainage setback (i.e.,
               Expansions of existing structures away from the drainage, but not
               towards the drainage are permitted).

               development projects located within the city’s watershed to the city for
               response. Continue to comment on county projects with the potential
               to increase runoff, increase flood hazards and tax drainage systems
               within the city. Meet with the county to consider preparation of a
               retention basin master plan or standardized mitigation requirements to
               offset cumulative impacts of individual projects occurring upstream of
               the City of Sonora and resulting in increased runoff, increased flood
               hazards and overtaxing of drainage systems within the city.

6.5.         Fire Protection
Wildfire along the urban-wildland interface or a series of such fires could result in
major losses to property, life and natural resources.         The City of Sonora Fire
Department, Tuolumne County Fire Department and CAL FIRE all maintain facilities
within the city limits.
6.5.1.       City Fire Department
          It is the mission of the Sonora City Fire Department to serve and protect the
          community, to provide public education, training, fire prevention, fire
          suppression, emergency rescue, disaster preparedness, mutual aid support,
          advances in modern technology and other services in order to minimize the
          loss of life and property, damage to the environment, and adverse economic
          impacts due to natural and man-made emergencies or events, while still
          preserving the City’s historic character and charm.
The City of Sonora Fire Department is
responsible for fire suppression and fire
prevention within all areas within the city
limits on both improved and unimproved
properties and including wildlands within
the city limits and all areas within the
urban/wildland interface within the city
limits (i.e., the I Zone).
The City of Sonora maintains a Fire
Department consisting of five full-time
and four part-time positions.            The
Department operates three shifts with
one Fire Captain and 2 firefighter
trainees per shift.       During weekdays,
the Fire Chief, Fire Prevention Captain
and a Part-time assistant also are on
duty. The department relies on 4 part-
time fire engineers and 10-15 volunteer
firefighters for additional staffing. This
level of staffing is below that level
maintained in 1982.

The city has and continues to face problems with recruitment and retention of
personnel for its police and fire departments due to competition from neighboring
cities and counties for pay and benefit packages, a limited pool of qualified law
enforcement officers and firefighters, and lack of job advancement opportunities
inherent in small departments.        The problem of retention and recruitment has
resulted in turnover of full-time police personnel of 50% of the Police Force in the
past four years and 40% of the Fire Department.
In response, a special election was held August 31st, 2004, adopting “Measure I” –a
½ cent sales tax increase to become effective January 1, 2005. Measure I assists
in funding both staff and equipment necessary to maintain and improve police and
fire protection within the City of Sonora (Public Facilities funding from Measure I is
discussed in General Plan 2020 Chapter 7, Public Facilities and Services Element).
Funding from Measure I provides the following:
     •  Hire three additional personnel necessary to raise staffing levels to two paid
        employees per shift
     •  Fund a city-wide fire hazard reduction program
     •  Improve wages and benefits to better recruit and retain qualified fire
        personnel
     •  Upgrade front-line fire and medical equipment
     •  Increase opportunities for education and training
     •  Expand Office Assistant position from part to full-time
The Department responds not only to calls within the city limits, but maintains an
automatic aid agreement with all fire agencies within a five-mile radius of the city.
The Department responded to an all-time high of 797 calls in 2003. Response time
averages 3.6± minutes.

can be carried by the engine
The largest water storage capacity in the city’s fleet of engines is 800 gallons.
Medical equipment
All first responders must have a minimum Basic Life Support (BLS) training. All paid
fire personnel must have Emergency Medical Technician I (EMT I) training.
In addition to Basic Life Support (BLS) medical equipment, the Sonora Fire
Department has four auto external defibrillators (AEDs) including one on the rescue
squad, one on the first responder engine, one in the Chief’s truck, and a back-up).
Oxygen, C-spine kit (Cervical spine kit), and burn kits also supplement BLS medical
equipment.
Arson Investigation
The Sonora Police Department conducts arson investigations within the city with the
assistance of the City of Sonora Fire Department and an arson dog belonging to one
of the station’s fire captains.
Urban/Wildland Interface – Road and Construction Standards
The Sonora Fire Department enforces the provisions of the California Fire Code
(which includes references to the National Fire Code) and the California Building
Code for construction within the urban-wildland interface.29                  Specifically, those
standards address the creation of "defensible space" for buildings and accessory
buildings through reducing vegetative cover adjacent to structures. The California
Fire Code is also implemented to establish standards for road widths sufficient for
safe ingress and egress of emergency vehicles to and within developments within
the city.
Section 17.60.040(J) of the municipal code allows building heights in excess of two
stories with building heights generally restricted to three stories in commercial and
multi-family zones subject to the granting of a conditional use permit (and a finding of
necessity and desirability) consistent with the Sonora Fire Department’s capacity to
29
     As of October, 2004, discussions are ongoing in the fire protection community regarding
     the potential for adopting a National Fire Protection Code and consideration of adopting
     international fire codes.     As of this writing, the California Fire Code and California
     Building Code remain in force.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                            Safety - 298

                                                                           Chapter 6: Safety
provide fire protection. This requirement may be modified through acquisition of a
variance in conjunction with the adoption of mitigation as necessary to offset
additional impacts associated with buildings in excess of three stories.
ISO's Public Protection Classification (PPCTM) Program
To help establish appropriate fire insurance premiums for residential and commercial
properties, insurance companies rely on information about a municipality's fire
protection services. ISO provides that information through the Public Protection
Classification (PPCTM) program.
ISO collects information on a community's public fire protection and analyzes the
data using the Fire Suppression Rating Schedule (FSRS) and assigns a Public
Protection Classification from 1 to 10. Class 1 represents the best public protection,
and Class 10 indicates less than the minimum recognized protection. (In Northern
California, only the City of Stockton carries an ISO classification of 1).
By classifying a community's ability to suppress fires, ISO helps the communities
evaluate their public fire protection services. The program provides an objective,
countrywide standard that helps fire departments in planning and budgeting for
facilities, equipment, and training. And by securing lower fire insurance premiums for
communities with better public protection, the PPC program provides incentives and
rewards for communities that choose to improve their firefighting services.
The city’s 2003 Public Protection Classification Survey (PPC) resulted in a new ISO
Classification of 4 for all properties within the city limits. The city’s ISO classification
of 4 is a significant improvement over the previous split classification of 6/9.
Improved staffing is likely to improve further the city’s ISO classification.
6.5.2.      Tuolumne County Fire Department
The Tuolumne County Fire Department (TCFD) Station 59 is located at 2 Forest
Road within the city limits. TCFD provides automatic mutual aid support to the City
of Sonora Fire Department within the city limits.
6.5.3.      CAL FIRE
CAL FIRE maintains a facility at 2 Forest Road within the city limits. The agency is
responsible for wildland fire protection in the unincorporated areas of Tuolumne
County and provides back-up services to the City of Sonora Fire Department.
Wildland areas prone to fire within the city limits include the area behind Sonora High
School, above the Mother Lode Fairgrounds, and in the region of Trunkenmiller
Road. CAL FIRE has been exploring relocating its ground facilities to Standard. A
relocation of CAL FIRE facilities to Standard would increase the response time
necessary to provide CAL FIRE wildland fire response to the city by several minutes.
CAL FIRE also operates the Columbia Air Attack Base which provides aerial fire
suppression support during wildland fire situations (or to prevent urban fires from
spreading into adjacent wildlands).

               address fire suppression and assist in funding fire support activities in
               which the City of Sonora is first responder within areas located

               relocate outside of their present location within the city limits (e.g., to
               Standard); reevaluate existing automatic aid agreements to assess
               the affects of the move on the Sonora Fire Department’s response
               time and requests for service outside of the city limits.

Police Protection
         The Mission of the Sonora Police Department is to affirmatively promote and
         provide, as much as is practicable given existing resources, a feeling of
         security and safety among all persons within our agency’s jurisdiction.
         To provide the highest quality professional police services to the citizens of
         Sonora; to protect life and property; to suppress crime; to apprehend
         offenders; to regulate and control traffic; and to provide various general
         services to the citizenry.
         It shall be the mission of every police department employee to provide the
         highest quality of service available to be rendered. There exists a bond
         between the citizenry and the police department. This trust shall continually
         be cultivated through the delivery of optimal public safety services.
         Historically, the Sonora Police Department has provided general services to
         the community in addition to the mandated law enforcement functions of the
         department. These services shall be carried out with the same vibrancy as
         the law enforcement function.

                                                                       Chapter 6: Safety
The City of Sonora maintains a Police Department consisting of 25 staff including 13
sworn officers plus support staff. The city also relies on five reserve police officers
and a 12-member senior volunteer program. Staffing levels for the City of Sonora
Police Department have not increased since 1975.
The Police Department strives to maintain two patrol officers on duty 24-hours per
day.
In general, there are three personnel on duty per shift including one supervisor and
two officers.     The Department operates a 24-hour Dispatch Center.                  The
Department has five divisions: Patrol, Investigations, Animal Control, Parking and
Administration.
The city has and continues to face problems with recruitment and retention of
personnel for its police and fire departments due to competition from neighboring
cities and counties for pay and benefit packages, a limited pool of qualified law
enforcement officers and firefighters, and lack of job advancement opportunities
inherent in small departments.         The problem of retention and recruitment has
resulted in turnover of full-time police personnel of 50% of the Police Force in the
past four years and 40% of the Fire Department.
In response, a special election was held August 31st, 2004, adopting “Measure I” –a
½ cent sales tax increase to become effective January 1, 2005. Measure I assists
in funding both staff and equipment necessary to maintain and improve police and
fire protection within the City of Sonora (Public Facilities funding from Measure I is
discussed in Sonora General Plan 2020 Chapter 7, Public Facilities and Services
Element).
Funding from Measure I provides the following:
     •  Salary and benefit enhancements to assist in making and keeping the city
        competitive with law enforcement agencies in surrounding jurisdictions
     •  Hiring four additional officers to meet increased demands for services
     •  Update safety equipment
     •  Increase opportunities for education and training for existing staff
     •  Modernize computer systems, including car computers
     •  Add part-time and full-time positions for animal control, dispatch, parking
        enforcement and community service duties

Special Programs provided by the Sonora Police Department include:
     •   Police Explorer Post
         Currently with 14 explorers, the program introduces young men and women
         to career opportunities in law enforcement. Explorers participate in traffic
         control, crime scene control, report writing, bicycle licensing, community
         relations programs, Department/Explorer meetings, training, fingerprinting,
         security work activities, departmental work activities, and patrol ride-alongs.
     •   Police Associate Citizens Team (PACT)
         These volunteers assist with serving subpoenas, patrolling handicap parking
         spaces, directing traffic and similar services depending on the volunteers
         abilities and interests for a minimum of four hours per week.
     •   School Resource Officer/ Cops in Schools Program
         A part-time police officer is devoted to Sonora High School. The program,
         initially funded through the federal Cops in Schools Program, is currently a
         jointly funded program of the city and Sonora High School.
     •   Community Service Officers (COPS)
         Depending on funding availability, the Department supports two part-time
         Community Service Officers, each working 20 hours per week to assist with
         non-crime related calls including traffic collisions, found property, subpoenas,
         crime scene processing and similar activities.
     •   Problem Oriented Policing (POP)
         The program focuses on detecting problems such as drug activity, juvenile
         and even traffic problems in cooperation with other agencies (e.g., Building
         and Planning, Fire, Probation) to address the issues and solve these
         problems in the community
     •   Bike Patrol Program
         Consists of eight officers including full-time and reserve officers. The
         program is designed to supplement regular street patrol in the city’s business
         district. The bike patrol also provides additional patrols for special events
         such as the Mother Lode Round Up and Mother Lode Fair.
The annual call volume for the Police Department has steadily increased since 1989.
Despite a slight stabilization in numbers of calls for service between 1995 and 2000,
the annual call volume began increasing again after 2000 at an accelerated rate. In
2003, call levels reached an all time high of 14,552 and are projected to reach
16,600± in 2004.         The most frequently occurring crime within the city is larceny,
followed by assaults and burglaries. With the increase in large retail stores located
within the city limits, the volume of theft reports has also increased. Response time
to calls averages less than three minutes.
The Police Department is located at 100 South Green Street (as of 2007).                The
facility provides 2,500 square feet.

Sheriff/Jail
The county jail and Tuolumne County Sheriff’s offices also are located within the city
limits at 28 North Lower Sunset Drive. Discussions to relocate both the jail and
Sheriff’s Department facilities have been ongoing.           A preferred site has been
selected and negotiations to purchase the site are ongoing. The site is currently
located outside of the city limits, but future annexation of the site is a possibility.
California Highway Patrol
The California Highway Patrol maintains facilities at 18437 Fifth Avenue in
Jamestown. The CHP patrols Highways 108 and 49 within the city limits.                  The
CHP has discussed relocating its facilities, perhaps in conjunction with the
establishment of a new Law and Justice Center, depending upon available access of
the site eventually selected for the facility and its ability to provide quick access to
the state highways.
Court System
Pursuant to a 1998 California Constitutional amendment, Tuolumne County
consolidated its Municipal and Superior Courts into a single Superior Court system
as did all 58 of California’s counties. Oversight of Superior trial courts is provided by
the Administrative Office of the Courts, a part of the Judicial Council of California-the
policy and rule-making body of the state court system.
Tuolumne County’s Superior Court system includes four judges and support staff
located in two separate court buildings—both located within the city limits.            The
potential to relocate the county’s court facilities to a new location in conjunction with
the establishment of a Law and Justice Center remains a possibility.

        •       Direct activities in connection with the use, conservation and salvage
                of essential materials, services and facilities (e.g., transportation,
                power, communication facilities)
        •       Other actions necessary for the management of resources following
                an emergency
As part of Plan implementation, the city participates in the joint city-county
Operational Area Committee established by the Plan.           City agencies participating
on the Operational Area Committee include: City of Sonora Emergency Services,
Sonora Police Department, and the Sonora Fire Department.
Designated emergency operations centers for the city are: The Sonora Fire
Department with the Tuolumne County Office of Emergency Services and the U.S.
Forest Service offices on Greenley Road as alternate locations.
Section two of the Plan addresses procedures for evacuations within the city and
county.      The Incident Commander, in coordination with the Sonora Police
Department (or Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Department, as applicable), is
responsible for ordering and managing evacuations within the city. For more
widespread emergencies requiring evacuation, evacuation operations are
coordinated by the Operational Area Law Enforcement Coordinator (City of Sonora
Police Chief or Tuolumne County Sheriff, as applicable), however, the city remains
responsible for its own evacuation notifications.
Best available evacuation routes, per the Plan procedures, will be provided in
conjunction with the issuance of evacuation orders and will vary depending upon the
nature and location of the emergency.           During evacuations, the city will make
transportation arrangements for groups requiring assistance for those facilities which
do not already have evacuation plans in place. The City of Sonora Public Works
Department (or Tuolumne County Public Works Department, as applicable) is
responsible for identifying potential problem areas along evacuation routes (e.g.,
weight restrictions, narrow bridges, road sections susceptible to secondary effects of
an incident); clearing debris from roads which have been designated as evacuation
routes and coordinate with the Emergency Operations Center to estimate traffic
capacity for designated evacuation routes and the amount of time for completing the
evacuation.
The county has the authority to close county roads. Within the city limits, the city
has authority to close city roads. Direction of traffic flow on county roads may be
altered at the discretion of the California Highway Patrol and such changes will be

coordinated through the Operational Area Law Enforcement Coordinator. Authority
to close state highways resides with the California Department of Transportation and,
in an emergency, with the California Highway Patrol.
In general, primary evacuation routes identified by the City of Sonora include routes
to the north, south, east and west of the city via major highways:
     •   South Washington Street south to Highway 108 (southern and western route)
     •   North Washington Street (Highway 49) north on Highway 49 (northern route)
     •   Mono Way East to Highway 108 (eastern route)
As identified in the Plan, Tuolumne County is part of Mutual Aid Region IV as
established by the State Office of Emergency Services. Other counties in Region IV
are: Nevada, Placer, El Dorado, Yolo, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Calaveras, Alpine
and Stanislaus counties.
6.9.2.    Emergency Medical Services
Emergency medical response services are provided within the city by the City of
Sonora Fire Department and the Tuolumne County Ambulance Service.                           The
Tuolumne County Ambulance Service is operated by Tuolumne County with facilities
at 1210 Sanguinetti Road. In general, four ambulances are normally in service with
two back-up ambulances. However, the service has the capacity to provide up to 9
ambulances, if necessary. Tuolumne County pays for equipment and facilities and
hires staff pursuant to a contract with another agency. The Tuolumne County
Ambulance Service anticipates moving to Tuolumne Road near Standard Park in
2004.31 One ambulance will be retained within the city limits.
Air ambulance services are provided by up to seven air ambulance services. Air
Med and Medi-Flight provide service to Doctor’s Medical Center and Memorial
Medical Center, respectively, in Modesto.                Other providers of air ambulance
services include the California Highway Patrol and Life Flight (Fresno-based).
Tuolumne County has two hospitals—both located within the city limits of Sonora:
Tuolumne General Hospital and the Sonora Regional Medical Center (formerly
Sonora Community Hospital).
Tuolumne General Hospital, established in 1856, is located at 101 Hospital Road
and is owned and operated by Tuolumne County. In 1996 TGH partnered with UC
Davis Health Systems to become one of California’s four rural telemedicine
programs. The facility provides 79 beds and is staffed by 400 employees.
Tuolumne General Hospital opened the Adult Day Health Care satellite program in
1996—now one of only 70 accredited in the state. TGH provides traditional medical
and surgical services, acute psychiatric services, and long-term care.32
The Sonora Regional Medical Center opened a new facility in Sonora in 2004 at
1000 Greenley Road relocating from its former site at 4 South Forest Road. The
31
   This move was completed in 2007
32
    In 2007, the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors voted to close the hospital, retaining
     some of its services to be relocated or transferred to alternative providers

                                                                       Chapter 6: Safety
facility is privately owned and operated by Adventist Health which operates 20
hospitals throughout California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii.            The Sonora
Regional Medical Center provides 72 beds with an additional 68 skilled nursing
beds, an intensive care and critical care unit, birth center, surgery, emergency,
urgent care, diagnostic imaging, chemotherapy, skilled nursing, home care, durable
medical equipment and occupational health.              The facility is staffed by 120
physicians, 871 employees and 155 volunteers and handled 4,172 admissions, 507
deliveries, 20,118 emergency room visits, 230,752 outpatient visits and 16,772 home
care visits in 2003.
American Red Cross
The American Red Cross provides disaster relief and recovery in Tuolumne County
and within the City of Sonora. The Red Cross is most frequently called upon to
provide relief to residents who have lost their home in a fire, although the agency
also provides relief for large-scale disasters—one of the most notable being the 1987
Complex Fire in Tuolumne County.           The Red Cross also trains local volunteers,
assisting in the development of Citizen Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and
provides Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), Auto External Defibrillator (AED)
and First Aid training for individuals and professionals.
There is currently only one citizen within the city limits who has completed CERT
training. Remaining members (23 of 24) of CERTs are located in unincorporated
Tuolumne and Calaveras Counties. The existing CERT members are under the
supervision of the Tuolumne County Office of Emergency Services. CERTs can be
established to assist small populations such as a residential subdivision, mobilehome
parks, or even a city.       Team members receive ongoing training. There is no
minimum number of individuals required to form a CERT.

Certified Unified Program Agency with oversight of hazardous materials for
Tuolumne County. The city responds to calls related to hazardous material spills or
releases and calls on the Tuolumne County Environmental Health Department for
support, if needed.      The primary responder for hazardous material-related calls
within the city is the Sonora Fire Department.
The City of Sonora has adopted the Multi-jurisdictional Household Hazardous Waste
Element prepared in cooperation with Tuolumne County in 1992. The goals of the
Household Hazardous Waste Element are to reduce the amount of household
hazardous waste generated through reuse and recycling, diversion from landfills,
promoting alternatives to toxic household products and educating the public
regarding household hazardous waste management.

6.13. Water Supply & Utilities
The county has more than 133 water suppliers. The largest supplier of potable water
is the Tuolumne Utilities District (TUD) which serves all of the City of Sonora.
Emergency situations related to water supply are associated with water quantity and
quality.
6.13.1. Water Quantity
The peak load water demand for the City of Sonora in 2002 was 3.5 million gallons
per day (TUD, 2004).          Three water storage facilities provide water for the City of
Sonora—all are located within or adjacent to the city limits:
         •        Greenley Road water tank adjacent to Sonora Hills – 2.7 million
                  gallons storage
         •        Sonora Water Treatment Plant water storage tanks on Bald Mountain
                  Road - Storage capacity 2 million with potential expansion to 3 million
                  gallons
         •        Sonora Reservoir at the end of Reservoir Road – 60,000 gallons
A failure of the county’s more than 71 miles of water supply ditches; damage to one
of TUD’s water storage facilities; or drought could result in a full or partial loss of
water supply to the city.
In September, 2001, the Darby Fire burned through a wooden trestle, the Utica
Flume, supporting a portion of the Utica Ditch—a part of the Calaveras County water
supply system-- nearly rendering the City of Angels without water and illustrating the
vulnerability of water supply systems dependent upon ditch distribution.
Sonora’s water supply travels from Lyons Reservoir, fed by the Stanislaus River, to
Phoenix Lake which is the nearest water storage body serving Sonora.                       From
Phoenix Lake, water travels to TUD’s Sonora Water Treatment Plant by underground
pipe33. Between Lyons Reservoir and Phoenix Lake, however, there are numerous
miles of ditch, some portions supported by wooden trestles susceptible to destruction
from wildfire or by other means. Should the ditch system suffer damage between
Lyons Dam and Phoenix Lake, TUD estimates that the City of Sonora has sufficient
water stored at the Sonora Water Treatment Plant to serve the city for 7 days.
Drought occurs in approximately 7-11 year cycles in Tuolumne County. The 1990
Sonora Emergency Operations Plan states that, during periods of drought,
emergency response measures will consist of land use planning practices consistent
with water conservation goals and various water conservation methods. TUD also
has adopted requirements for drought periods for the conservation of water.
33
    A portion of the Shaw’s Flat Ditch containing water remains open and provides a popular
    walking trail for residents. However, this portion of the ditch does not deliver water to the
    Sonora Water Treatment Plant. All water to that facility from Phoenix Lake is transported
    via pipeline.
Sonora General Plan 2020                                                          Safety - 325

                                                                      Chapter 6: Safety
Naturally occurring contamination (e.g., chemical, bacteriological, parasitic),
accidental spills or sabotage could affect water quality. TUD has the means to by-
pass Phoenix Lake in the event of contamination and to continue providing the city
with an uninterrupted water supply.       However, contamination of Lyon’s Reservoir
would threaten the water supply for most of Tuolumne County, including the City of
Sonora.
6.13.2. Utility failures
Utility facilities within the county include liquid petroleum, electricity, water (see
above), and sewage disposal. Interruptions to utility services delivered through
above or below-ground pipelines, ditches or electrical lines could suffer service
interruptions from earthquakes, floods, fire, wind storms, landslides, sabotage or
similar events.

         Policies and Implementation Programs
Goal:
   6.G         Facilitate the provision of an adequate supply of water, and essential
               utilities and communications for city residents during emergency
               situations.
Policies:
   6.G.1       Provide the necessary tools to reduce the impacts of disruptions in
               water and other essential utilities and communications during
               emergency situations.
   6.G.2.      Proactively plan for emergency response during situations affecting
               the city water supply and essential services and communications.

               proposals to upgrade the TUD Water System will benefit the city—in
               particular during times of emergency. For example, should water
               managers propose replacing wooden trestles with fire safe materials,
               ask TUD officials to quantify how such projects would protect the city’s
               water supply.
   6.G.b       Provide Emergency Response/Preparation                       Guidelines        for

6.15. Other Safety Issues: Transportation, Severe Weather,
           Agricultural Disaster, Radiological Incidents
6.15.1. Transportation Accidents (including aircraft and rail accidents)
Major east-west commercial air transportation routes pass directly over parts of
Tuolumne County.          The Columbia Airport, located north of the city, and Pine
Mountain Lake Airport located south of the city, also generate large numbers of
private aircraft. From June through mid-October, the CAL FIRE operate firefighting
aircraft out of the Columbia Airport Air Attack Base.
The Sierra Railroad traverses southern Sonora and crosses Sonora roadways in
three locations: South Washington Street near its intersection with Hospital Road,
Wards Ferry Road at its intersection with Sanguinetti Lane, and Sanguinetti Loop at
Sanguinetti Road within the city limits. Under current operating conditions, a train
makes one round-trip to the lumber mill in Standard through Sonora (i.e., passes
through the city twice daily). Occasional passenger trains from Railtown 1897 State
Historic Park in Jamestown and occasional work trains also pass through Sonora.
Train derailments have resulted in the temporary closure of access to and from
Sonora along South Washington Street to Highway 108.
Crash, derailment, or collision involving aircraft, trains, truck, or other passenger or
cargo vehicles could occur within the city limits. Transportation accidents resulting in
spills of hazardous materials are addressed in the Hazardous Materials portion of
this element.
6.15.2. Severe Weather
Severe weather may occur in the form of wind, rain, snow, ice, extreme cold or heat
and/or thunder storms. Tuolumne County (including the City of Sonora) also has
occasionally been subject to tornado warnings. All of theses conditions could result
in loss in life and property, and interruption of transportation and communication
systems.
6.15.3. Agricultural Disasters
Agriculture is one of Tuolumne County’s major industries. Any natural or man-
caused event interrupting the growing cycle is likely to adversely impact agriculture in
the county. Widespread agricultural damage could be caused by blight, chemical
spills, drought, fire, flood, hail, or infestations. Agriculture within the city limits is
minimal. Therefore, disasters affecting agriculture are unlikely to directly affect the
City of Sonora.
6.15.4. Radiological Incidents
Radiological incidents may be caused by either a nuclear attack or peace-time
emergency. Tuolumne County and the City of Sonora would not likely experience
any of the direct effects of nuclear detonation (i.e., blast, shock, fires) as it lacks the
military, industrial and commercial facilities likely to be targeted.

7.1.       Requirements
A Public Facilities and Services Element is an optional general plan element.              A Public
Facilities and Services Element assists local jurisdictions in identifying the existing and
potential future needs of public, quasi-public and privately-owned community service
facilities within its jurisdiction for planning purposes. The element is useful in planning for
future facility needs, anticipating reuse of buildings after relocation of public facilities, and in
assessing present and future maintenance and upgrades which may be needed for public
facilities. This element also describes the existing water and sewer capacity of the city and
projects future need.

7.2.       Issues and Opportunities
The City of Sonora is the location for the majority of the public services and associated
facilities provided to citizens by county, state, federal, non-profit and special districts.
County facilities used by city residents are paid, in part, through a Tuolumne County
Services Impact Mitigation Fee collected on building permits issued both within the county
and the city.
City facilities are established, maintained and enhanced, in part, through the city’s
Redevelopment Agency (subject to Redevelopment Law restrictions and requirements).
The Redevelopment Agency was established in 1985 with adoption of redevelopment
district boundaries and a redevelopment plan by August, 1992. In addition to assisting in
the provision of affordable housing (See General Plan 2020 Chapter 3, Housing Element),
since activation of the Redevelopment Agency, the city also has used redevelopment funds
to:
         •       Build a new fire station
         •       Acquire a new fire engine
         •       Relocate to new police station facilities
         •       Rehabilitation of the police station
         •       Relocate to new public works facilities
         •       Rehabilitation of the public works facility
         •       Enhance Woods Creek Park with the addition of restrooms and other
                 improvements
         •       Contribute to the maintenance of the Sonora High School swimming pool
         •       Develop a parking facility on Church Street
         •       Acquire the Downtown Education Site
         •       Acquire the School Street Parking Lot
         •       Undertake improvements at the Opera Hall (e.g., kitchen facilities)
         •       Economic development activities
         •       Improve signage (street signs and parking lot sings)
         •       Undertake sidewalk improvements
         •       Undertake storm drain improvements
         •       Add trash receptacles to downtown
         •       Acquire land for a bicycle/pedestrian trail
         •       Complete an historic structure report
Ongoing and future redevelopment projects include:
         •       Business/commercial curb & sidewalk replacements
         •       Downtown restroom facilities
         •       Phase II of the historic resources inventory report and publication
         •       Economic development activities

In addition, a special election was held August 31st, 2004, adopting “Measure I” –a ½ cent
sales tax increase to become effective January 1, 2005. Measure assists in funding both
staff and equipment necessary to maintain and improve police and fire protection within the
City of Sonora (Measure I benefits for police and fire are addressed in Sonora General Plan
2020 Chapter 6, Safety Element).
Funding from Measure I benefits public works by providing for the following:
        •       Hire two additional personnel
        •       Provide additional funding for infrastructure improvements including streets,
                sidewalks and storm drains
        •       Provide additional funding for capital equipment, safety equipment and
                supplies and facility enhancements

                                           The ditch was piped in 1992 from the Phoenix
                                           Reservoir and the Sonora Water Treatment
                                           Plant. However, flowing water is maintained in

                                                      Chapter 7: Public Facilities & Services
Other water bodies within the city’s planning area include:
    •   Tuolumne Utilities District Sonora Water Treatment Plant (Bald Mountain)
    •   Tuolumne Utilities District Sonora Reservoir (end of Reservoir Road)
    •   Tuolumne Utilities District Wastewater Treatment Plant ponds
7.7.2.2. NON-POINT SOURCE POLLUTION
Non-point source pollution includes contaminants which enter surface or ground
water through runoff and/or filtration. Sources of these discharges are normally
multiple and/or widely spread. In comparison, point source pollution includes
contaminants which enter surface or ground water from a specific known (usually
single) source (e.g., a factory).
Sources and types of non-point source discharges common in urban runoff which
could be present in city’s waterways as runoff are detailed in General Plan 2020
Appendices 4E and 4F.             They include: fecal coliform bacteria, phosphorous,
insecticides, herbicides, pesticides, DDT, chlordane, dieldrin, volatile organic
compounds, traces of cadmium, traces of lead, traces of zinc, traces of mercury,
zinc, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs), organochlorine compounds and PCBs.
The Tuolumne County Environmental Health Department (Division of Environmental
Health) performed water quality sampling for total coliform and fecal coliform bacteria
in various locations along Woods Creek and Sonora Creek between 2001 and 2003.
The Tuolumne Utilities District performed some bacteriological sampling in Woods
Creek, Sullivan Creek and Sonora Creek in 2001.                The results of TUD and
Tuolumne County Health Department (Division of Environmental Health) water
quality sampling from 2001-2003 are summarized in General Plan 2020 Appendix
4G.
Coliform is a type of bacteria which may, in itself, pose no threat to health, but may
indicate the presence of other disease-causing agents in water.                 The bacteria
normally occur in low levels in surface waters (e.g., lakes, beaches, streams). Fecal
coliform and E. coli (a coliform) are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water
may be contaminated with human or animal wastes which can cause diarrhea,
cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms posing a special health risk for
infants, young children, and people with severely compromised immune systems.
The California Department of Health Services has established the following draft
guidelines (March, 2004) for maximum concentrations of total coliform and fecal
coliform for beach use (i.e., surface waters):
        Total Coliform: 10,000 most probable number (mpn) per 100 milliliter (ml)
        Fecal Coliform: 400 mpn per 100 ml
The results of water quality sampling performed by TUD and the Tuolumne County
Environmental Health Department for surface waters (General Plan 2020 Appendix
4G) indicate that levels of fecal coliform in Sonora Creek and Woods Creek within
the city limits and within the city’s sphere of influence, regularly have exceeded state
Sonora General Plan 2020
                                                                 Public Facilities & Services-352

                                                     Chapter 7: Public Facilities & Services
guidelines—sometimes by significant amounts.            The Tuolumne County Water
Quality Plan, completed in February, 2007 identifies the following as potential causes
of high coliform readings found countywide: failing septic systems and unobstructed
grazing practices.
The coliform standard for treated drinking water is governed by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency. EPA drinking water standards are violated when
water samples test positive in more than one or more than 5.0% of monthly sampling
for total coliforms (dependent upon the size of the water system). Water systems
with confirmed positive tests for the presence of fecal coliform (in any amount) are in
violation of EPA drinking water standards.
TUD’s Sonora/Jamestown Water System serves a population of approximately
13,042 per the USEPA Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) as of July
17, 2004. TUD’s water quality report for the Sonora/Jamestown system in 2003
(TUD, 2004) records no violations of drinking water standards for coliform in the
system.         However, sampling in 1992-1993 indicated some lead and copper
contamination within the system. Lead and copper levels have been brought into
compliance per the EPA’s SDWIS system website (http://oasub.eqp.gov/enviro ).
NOTE: Tuolumne County completed the Foothill Watershed Assessment and
Tuolumne County Water Quality Plan in February, 2007.              A summary of water
quality measurements taken within creeks within the Sonora Sphere of Influence
during 2005-2006 is included in Sonora General Plan 2020 Appendix 4G.
7.7.2.3. WATER QUANTITY
The city’s primary water source is public water supplied by the Tuolumne Utilities
District (TUD). TUD maintains three water storage facilities within or adjacent to the
city limits:
     •   Greenley Road water tank adjacent to Sonora Hills – 2.7 million gallons
         storage
     •   Sonora Water Treatment Plant water storage tanks on Bald Mountain Road -
         Storage capacity 2 million with potential expansion to 3 million gallons
     •   Sonora Reservoir at the end of Reservoir Road – 60,000 gallons
General Plan 2020 Section 4.9.1.4 (herein) details the city’s estimated water needs
through 2020.
TUD anticipates that new development throughout the county and in the city will
receive service commitments for water based on timed agreements established on a
“first come, first serve” basis.
7.7.3.     Sewer Facilities
TUD provides public sewer service to the majority of the city. TUD operates a sewer
treatment plant in the southwestern corner of the city adjacent to city-owned property
- (Sonora Wastewater Treatment Plan – WWTP).
Sonora General Plan 2020
                                                           Public Facilities & Services-353

                                                     Chapter 7: Public Facilities & Services
The facility currently provides service to 23,000± people with a design capacity of 2.6
million gallons per day (mgd).        The average dry weather flow at the facility is
approximately 1.6 mgd. The plant produces secondary treated and disinfected
effluent is discharged to a large storage reservoir, Quartz Reservoir, prior to
distribution for reclamation by agricultural end-users.
During winter months, input at the WWTP may increase to 2.6 mgd exceeding the
facility’s capacity to clarify and digest the input. This “overflow” has resulted in a
limited number of spills into Woods Creek.
An expansion of the facility’s sewage treatment processing system is underway.
TUD has adopted a reclamation strategy, currently under review by the state that
includes:
          1) Seeking easements over or acquisition of additional lands to allow for
             disposal of biosolids (some new easements and expansions of existing
             sites already has occurred)
          2) Increasing storage capacity (140± acres has been acquired for additional
             storage expected to come on-line in approximately 5 years)
          3) An application (currently under state review) to reinstate discharges into
             Woods Creek
General Plan 2020 Section 4.9.1.2 (herein) details the city’s estimated wastewater
demands through 2020.
Private septic systems are regulated through the Tuolumne County Environmental
Health Department and are of limited distribution. Private systems are concentrated
southwest of J.S. West and Symons and near the northern city limits with limited
numbers scattered in areas outside the public sewer service areas. Thin soils and
porous rock (e.g., limestone) are two identified hazards associated with failed septic
systems within the city’s sphere of influence.      However, age has been the primary
reason for septic system failure within the city according to the Tuolumne County
Environmental Health Department. Most of these older failing systems have been
replaced with public sewer service from TUD.

Chapter 8.                         Air Quality
8.1.       Requirements
An Air Quality Element is an optional element for a general plan. However, because
air quality must be addressed as part of the environmental review process pursuant
to the California Environmental Quality Act [(CEQA), Public Resources Code
Sections 21000 et. seq.] and Appendix G of the State CEQA Guidelines35, many
local governments include an Air Quality Element as part of their general plan. The
City of Sonora included an Air Quality section within the Conservation and Open
Space Element of the 1986 Sonora General Plan.
The Federal Clean Air Act (of 1970, amended 199036) and the California Air
Resources Board’s California Air Pollution Control Laws (a.k.a. The Bluebook)--
establish the standards for air quality for the state and the nation. Jurisdictions which
exceed established thresholds must prepare an Air Quality Management Plan
detailing how that jurisdiction will reduce polluting air emissions as necessary to
achieve adopted standards for air quality.
8.2.       Issues and Opportunities
The City of Sonora enjoys some of the best air quality in the state. However,
population increases within the city, county and throughout the state add to the
number of air polluting sources and activities which include: vehicles, traffic
congestion, open burning, wood-burning stoves, grading/heavy construction
equipment, control/prescriptive burns and wildland fires. Pollutants transported from
the San Joaquin Valley and Bay Area further degrade air quality within the city.
Sonora is located in the Mountain Counties Air Basin. The California Air Resources
Board (CARB) operates an air quality monitoring station within the city limits on
Barretta Street. Based on data gathered from this station, the City of Sonora’s air
quality is affected by elevated levels of both ozone and carbon monoxide.
8.2.1.     Ozone
Ozone is created by a chemical reaction between hydrocarbons (i.e., volatile organic
compounds, or VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) in the presence of sunlight. Major
sources of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons are combustion such as that found in
factories and automobiles, gasoline vapors and the evaporation of solvents and
fuels. Health effects of ozone include eye irritation and damage to lung tissues.
Ozone also damages various materials including plants resulting in damage to city
landscaping projects, heritage trees and other vegetation.
 The state and federal air quality standards for ozone are:
35
    Per State CEQA Guidelines Appendix 8, a significant adverse impact is assumed to exist
    if a project will contribute to or result in the violation of any ambient air quality standards

These ozone standards are being exceeded within the city and county. Because
ozone creation involves sunlight, the highest ozone readings within the City of
Sonora normally occur during the warm months between June and mid-September
at the following rates:

    Exceeded Since 1992
When pollutant levels exceed state and/or federal standards on a regular basis, the
area is designated by the state and federal regulatory agencies as a non-attainment
area. This designation requires the affected jurisdiction to prepare an Air Quality
Plan to reduce the levels of the high-concentration pollutants. Tuolumne County is
non-attainment for the state 1-hour ozone standard and, potentially, for the federal 8-
hour ozone standard. Tuolumne County currently is required to submit a State
Implementation Plan (SIP) to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by June 15th,
2007. However, due to pending litigation (the D.C. Court of Appeals vacated the 8-hr
Sonora General Plan 2020
                                                                             Air Quality-360
                                                                        Chapter 8: Air Quality
  Ozone Implementation Rule), this requirement may change. The Tuolumne County
  Air Pollution Control District anticipates that the SIP will not include requirements for
  indirect sources and that CEQA thresholds countywide (including the city) will remain
  at 100 tons/year and 1,000 pound/day. In addition, the TCAPCD expects to adopt
  several new rules in 2007addressing stationary sources.
  Despite these measures, however, the primary source of ozone in the area remains
  transport of O3 from the San Joaquin Valley and the Bay Area into Tuolumne County.
  Even with an Air Quality Plan (or State Implementation Plan), the city and county
  would be unable to effectively reduce O3 originating outside of Tuolumne County.
 8.2.2.     Carbon Monoxide
  Carbon monoxide gas is formed by the incomplete combustion of fuels. The primary
  sources of carbon monoxide in Sonora are automobiles, traffic congestion, smoke
  from wood-burning stoves, wildland fires and heavy construction equipment.               At
  high concentrations, carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood
  resulting in heart difficulties, reduced lung capacity and impaired mental abilities.
  The highest carbon monoxide readings within the City of Sonora normally occur
  during the cold months between November and February. Since monitoring began
  in 1992, the City of Sonora has exceeded neither the state nor federal standards for
  carbon monoxide concentrations.
           Table 96: State and Federal Carbon Monoxide Standards
      Pollutant            Averaging Time           Federal Primary          State Standard
                                                       Standard            (parts per million)
                                                   (parts per million)
Carbon Monoxide                 8-hour                   9.0 ppm                 9.0 ppm
                                1-hour                  35.0 ppm                 20 ppm
  However, certain “hot spots,” or areas with high levels of carbon monoxide, have
  been identified within the City of Sonora. For example, the intersection of Stockton
  Road and Washington Street is known to have elevated CO levels due to vehicle
  emissions trapped within the “canyon” created by buildings trapping vehicle exhaust
  at this intersection.     In addition, during the winter months, smoke from wood-
  burning stoves may become trapped and concentrated within the low-lying Sonora
  basin which is bounded to the west and east by hillsides. The highest carbon
  monoxide reading for the Sonora area recorded since 1992 was 5.46 parts per
  million recorded on October 20, 1998, during the Paper Ridge Fire.
 8.2.3.     Suspended Particulate Matter (PM 2.5)
  A 2001 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court will result in the establishment of air
  quality standards for PM 2.5 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the
  near future. One of the primary sources of PM 2.5 is smoke from wood-burning
  stoves. It is anticipated that PM 2.5 monitoring will begin within the City of Sonora in
  the near future and will provide another incentive to address the use of wood-burning
  stoves in the area.

Other pollutants which can degrade air quality include: suspended particulate matter
(PM-10), nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and lead. These pollutants are not
currently considered a threat to the City of Sonora and are not regularly monitored.
The following goals, policies and implementation programs are intended to maintain
and improve the air quality within and around the Sonora area by reducing or
eliminating the source and cause of air pollutants generated within and around the
city limits.

Chapter 9.                       Cultural Resources
Cultural Resources
Cultural resources are remains and sites associated with human activities and
include the following:
            •   Prehistoric and ethnohistoric Native American sites
            •   Historic archaeological sites
            •   Historic buildings
            •   Elements or areas of the natural landscape with have traditional
                cultural significance to the citizens of the City of Sonora, Tuolumne
                County, the State of California, the foothill region or the nation
9.1.      Requirements
A Cultural Resources Element is an optional general plan element. However,
because cultural resources must be addressed as part of the environmental review
process pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA, Public
Resources Code Sections 21000 et seq.), many local governments include a Cultural
Resources Element as part of the general plan.
California Public Resources Code Sections 21002(b), 21083.2 (Archaeological
Resources), and 21084.1 (Historical Resources Guidelines) address the evaluation
of environmental impacts on historical resources. The California Register of
Historical Resources (California Register) has been adopted as the state’s
authoritative guide to the state’s historical resources and to which properties are to
be considered significant for the purposes of CEQA.
Pursuant to Section 21084.1 of the Public Resources Code, a project that may cause
a substantial adverse change to in the significance of an historical resource is a
project that may have a significant effect on the environment. The State CEQA
Guidelines define an historical resource as:
                •       Listed in, or determined to be eligible for listing in, the
                        California Register of Historical Resources
                •       Historical resources included in a local register of historical
                        resources as defined in subdivision (k) of Section 5020.1
                •       A resource deemed significant pursuant to subdivision (g) of
                        Section 5024.1
                •       The fact that a resource is not listed in or determined eligible
                        for listing pursuant to any of the preceding does not preclude a
                        determination that the resource may be an historical resource

9.2.       Purpose
One of the primary purposes of this cultural resources element is to inventory,
evaluate and identify those resources in the City of Sonora which may be eligible for
the California Register and provide guidelines for their management in accordance
with CEQA.
In addition, the City of Sonora recognizes the economic benefits of preserving
cultural resources which encourages cultural heritage tourism (see glossary).
Visiting historic sites and museums is the third most popular vacation activity for U.S.
travelers (Heritage Tourism, Benefits of Heritage Tourism, The National Trust for
Historic Preservation, undated). Cultural heritage travelers spend an average of
$623 per trip (excluding transportation) versus $457 for other U.S. travelers (The
Historic/Cultural Traveler, Travel Industry Association and Smithsonian Magazine,
2003).
Cultural heritage tourism provides multiple benefits, including:
        •        Creating jobs and businesses
        •        Increasing tax revenue
        •        Diversifying the local economy
        •        Creating opportunities for partnerships
        •        Attracting visitors interested in history and preservation
        •        Increasing historic attraction revenues
        •        Preserving local traditions and culture
        •        Generating local investment in historic resources
        •        Building community pride in heritage
        •        Increasing awareness of the site or area’s significance

9.3.1.     Prehistory
Current knowledge of the prehistoric past in Tuolumne County is largely the result of
major studies in Yosemite National Park, Stanislaus National Forest, and those
conducted for water development projects. The studies at New Melones (Moratto,
et al., 1988) indicate that:
         Over a span of millennia this part of California witnessed the ebb and flow of
         human populations, the emergence of an acorn-based subsistence economy,
         increasing sedentism, a diversity of settlement modes, expansion of trade
         networks, introduction of the bow and arrow, evolution of complex socio-
         political organization, and the advent of distinctive cult/ceremonial systems.
         Archaeology here sheds light on the transitions from early Holocene nomadic
         hunting and foraging to the protohistoric semisedentary village life of hunter-
         gatherers [Goldberg et al. 1986:iii]
Studies at New Melones indicate that human presence in the general vicinity of
Sonora dates from 8000 to 5,500 years before present.
Approximately 600 years ago, changes in the archaeological record suggest that a
new group of people infiltrated the area. These people are generally considered to
be the precursors of the Me-Wuk with cultural traits defined by acorn processing in
bedrock mills, and more permanent (or recognizable) settlements.
Since the advent of the Me-Wuk, the history of human settlement until the Gold Rush
may be characterized as follows:
         …as a result of Ibero-American incursions and pressures, Indians from
         western California sought refuge in the Sierra… after A.D. 1770. … the
         epidemic of 1833 devastated foothill Indians and left many of their villages
         deserted forever…The Gold Rush of circa 1848-1860 severely disrupted
         settlements in the Mother Lode country and often triggered the relocation of
         entire villages. …Finally the establishment of…reservations…further
         coalesced Indian groups, reduced their numbers, and accelerated cultural
         and social changes.
9.3.2.     1848-49 The Gold Rush and the Founding of Sonora
The “modern” history of Sonora was sparked by the discovery of gold on January 24,
1848, in California on the South Fork of the American River.
Among the first miners to reach Tuolumne County were recently discharged veterans
of the Mexican War and miners from the State of Sonora, Mexico, commonly referred
to as “Sonoranians.” While references to “the great camp of the Sonoranians,” are
found in early Gold Rush literature38; it is believed that this early “camp” was actually
located in today’s Jamestown.
In the early days of the Gold Rush, most gold miners left the Tuolumne County gold
placers as winter approached in fear that they would be cut off from supplies by

oncoming storms. Most miners wintered in Stockton, San Francisco, or in coastal
communities extending to Southern California. Among those miners who left in the
late Autumn and early winter of 1848-49 were the Sonoranian miners who returned
to their homes in Mexico.
         “There they inflamed their relatives and friends with stories of the abundance
         of gold in the newly discovered placers in California, and urged that they
         return with them to the diggings so that they would be on hand to share in the
         golden harvest when the winter storms had subsided. Little coaxing was
         required once the proof of their golden tales was displayed in the bags of dust
         and nuggets many had brought home with them.”
Upon returning to Sonora, the Sonoranians established a camp named Santa Iago
approximately a half mile above Jamestown.
In 1848 there had been some friction between the Americans and the Sonoranians
and other Spanish-speaking miners, but at that time, the gold seekers were few and
the virgin placers extensive. Upon the occasions that the Americans forced Hispanic
miners from their rich finds, Hispanic miners simply moved to other sites. In the
spring of 1849, this occurred once again.
This time, however, the newly ended Mexican War was fresh in the minds of the
American miners, and they considered California to be conquered territory in which
the Americans should have exclusive right to exploit its golden riches.           As the
number of miners increased rapidly, the Sonoranians were forced from their Santa
Iago diggings by this sentiment. The Sonoranians decided to move to rich placers
upstream-- this time, however, they intended to keep their find a secret from the
Americans. On March 17, 1849, the Sonoranians quickly vacated their camp and
moved to the new diggings before miners downstream became aware of their
departure. The new camp was on Wood’s Creek at the site of today’s Sonora High
School grounds and extended upstream along present Columbia Way to the bridge
crossing the creek. The new camp of Sonora was born.
It was a few days before the Americans became aware that nearly all of the
Sonoranians had suddenly disappeared. Knowing of their reputation for locating
placer deposits, the Americans began an immediate search and soon found the new
camp. While in the area, the Americans did some prospecting themselves and
uncovered equally rich diggings along the branch of Wood’s Creek that subsequently
became known as Sonora Creek. An American camp soon came into existence
along the creek in the area of today’s Coffill Park expanding the boundaries of what
would become the City of Sonora.
For a short time, the American camp was called “Scott Town,” probably in honor of
Charles G. Scott, a former soldier of the First Regiment of New York Volunteers in
the Mexican War. The camp was soon engulfed by more numerous Sonoranians
and others of Hispanic origin and became known as the Sonoranian Camp, later
shortened to Sonora.
Thousands of eager gold seekers made their way to the new diggings discovered by
the Sonoranians bringing with them merchants with a wide variety of tools and
supplies, butchers, bakers, mule packers, teamsters, those aiming to open

restaurants and lodging houses, liquor dealers, gamblers, black legs, and
speculators who were not particular about how they acquired their gold.
The largest foreign group was that of the Sonoranians themselves who were joined
by Chileans (Chilenos), Peruvians , and a few Argentines. All were attracted to the
camp not only because of gold, but because it was known as a mining center where
the Spanish language was spoken and the Catholic religion and familiar Latin
customs were widely observed.
Newcomers made their camps on unoccupied land lying          along the sides of an old
Indian trail extending from Sonoranian Camp on Wood’s        Creek down a dry ravine
called Senorita Gulch to the American settlement along       Sonora Creek. This trail
later became today’s Washington Street, the center of         business activity for the
mining camp and later, for the City of Sonora.
9.3.3.    1850s: Sawmills, City Incorporation, Miner’s Tax and Depression
Sawmills
In August, 1850, the erection of a steam sawmill, by Henri Charbonelle & Co.,
changed the appearance of the camp and surrounding hills. The mill, located near
today’s intersection of Washington and Church Streets, immediately began to
produce rough lumber sawed from the pine and cedar logs dragged down to the mill
from the hillsides by oxen. The abundance of local lumber at a reasonable price
followed by the erection of competing sawmills made lumber readily available for
building. By early 1852, Sonora had assumed a cosmopolitan appearance with
architecture reflecting the tastes of its American, European, and New World
Hispanics far more than most of the other mining camps of the era.
        I arrived at Sonora, the largest town of the southern mines. It consisted of a
        single street, extending for upwards of a mile along a sort of hollow between
        gently sloping hills. Most of the houses were of wood, a few were of canvas,
        and one or two were solid buildings of sun-dried bricks. The lower end of the
        town was very peculiar in appearance as compared with the prevailing style
        of California architecture. Ornament seemed to have been as much
        consulted as utility, and the different tastes of the French and Mexican
        builders were very plainly seen in the high-peaked overhanging roofs, the
        staircases outside the houses, the corridors round each story, and other
        peculiarities; giving the houses—which were painted, moreover, buff and pale
        blue—quite an old-fashioned air alongside of the staring white rectangular
        fronts of the American houses. There was less pretence and more honesty
        about them than about the American houses, for many of the latter were all
        front, and gave the idea of a much better house than the small rickety
        clapboard or canvas concern which was concealed behind it. But these
        facades were useful as well as ornamental, and were intended to support the
        large signs, which conveyed an immense deal of useful information. Some
        small stores, in fact, seemed bursting with intelligence, and were broken out
        all over with short spasmodic sentences in English, French, Spanish,
        German, covering all the available space save the door, and presenting to the
        passer-by a large amount of desultory reading as to the nature of the property
        within and the price at which it could be bought. This, however, was not by

        any means peculiar to Sonora—it was the general style of things throughout
        the country.
        The Mexicans and the French also were very numerous, and there was an
        extensive assortment of other Europeans from all quarters, all of whom, save
        French, English and ”Eyetalians,” are in California classed under the general
        denomination of Dutchmen more frequently “d----d Dutchmen,” merely for the
        sake of euphony.
         J.D. Borthwick, Englishman, 1852
City Incorporation
California passed legislation dividing California into 27 counties and designating a
seat of government for each county in February, 1850. While the residents of
Sonoranian Camp, or Sonora, as it was increasingly being called, were satisfied with
their camp being designated as the county seat, they were incensed to discover that
the name Sonora had been changed to Stewart in honor of an assemblyman
representing them. A petition signed by the camp’s leading citizens and business
owners was filed with the legislature, and that body responded by passing an
amendatory act on April 15, 1850, naming Sonora as the county seat of Tuolumne
County.
With statehood on September 9, 1850, the California Legislature approved the
incorporation of the City of Sonora on May 1, 1851.39 The first city election was held
May 19, 1851, to elect the common council in which 400 votes were cast to elect
Mayor Charles F. Dodge and aldermen A.F. Chatfield, Abraham Tuttle, Israel P.
Yaney, Hiram W. Theall, R.S. Gladwin, H.T. Fuller and Lewis C. Gunn.
At the first meeting of the common council, the first city officers were appointed:
Leander Quint, city recorder; Daniel Sayre, city treasurer; Ethan Allen, city assessor;
James F. McFarland, city marshal; and Alexander W. Luckett, city clerk.
Foreign Miner’s Tax and Depression
Two days prior to naming Sonora as the county seat, the legislature adopted the
foreign miner’s tax. The law was titled “An Act for the better regulation of the Mines,
and the government of Foreign Miners.” The act required each foreign miner to pay
a monthly license fee of $20 to mine for gold in California. The avowed intent of the
law was to raise revenue for the infant state, but also had the object of reserving for
American miners as much of the gold fields as possible.
Unable to afford the monthly taxes, thousands of foreigners, principally Mexicans,
departed from the mines with a bitter hatred for the Americans. Their departure
triggered a massive local financial depression in Sonora and the other county gold
camps. It also greatly affected the supply center of Stockton economically, as well
as the teamsters and pack train owners who moved supplies between the two points.
Funds were raised by affected local business interests, and an attempt was made to
have the law declared unconstitutional; but the damage was done, and it was not

until a year later that the miners’ tax act was repealed and then replaced with
another in which a more moderate and reasonable tax was prescribed.
9.3.4.    1860s-1870s: Civil War and the Chinese
By the 1860s, the loss of population due to the exhaustion of the vast surface placer
gold deposits that had sustained her for many years sent Sonora into an economic
decline. The Civil War also had its effect as some men left to serve in the armed
forces.
During the late 1860’s and early 1870’s, thousands of Chinese miners came once
they were free to work unmolested in the abandoned placers to extract the remaining
gold dust deposits. Many of the Orientals remained to enter other fields of work,
usually menial, and resided in the area east of Stewart Street, lying generally
between Lyons and East Bradford streets. Originally, this section had been occupied
by Mexicans and Hispanics and was known as the “Tigre.” Towards the end of the
century, as Orientals became more numerous, it became Sonora’s “Chinatown.”
Well into the 1880s, the city’s economy was based primarily upon nearby farming
and ranching, some gold mining, lumber production and a slowly growing tourist
trade, as visitors to the Calaveras Grove of Big Trees passed through Sonora en
route to the Yosemite Valley; however, the future prospect for most residents was
not encouraging.

9.3.5.    1880s, 1890s and the Turn of the Century: the Second Gold
          Rush
In the late 1880s and early 1890s, there was a sudden and tremendous revival of
prosperity accurately named the “Second Gold Rush” which transformed the county
and brought it into the 20th Century with a booming economy and restored
confidence.
With the availability of strong wire, rope, or cable, and improved machinery and
milling processes, together with underground mining techniques developed in the
Comstock Lode of Nevada, it became physically and financially possible to open
many quartz gold mines and begin the era of hard-rock mining along the Mother
Lode.
Captain William A. Nevills pioneered the way with his famous Rawhide Mine (located
west of Sonora). He displayed his success at the 1894 mid-winter fair in San
Francisco, thereby ignited a fire for quartz mining which resulted in investors pouring
money into the development of known claims as well as prospecting for new veins.
Much of that activity took place in Tuolumne County where the population grew
rapidly, and the assessed value of property on the county’s tax rolls increased
several fold, fed by the erection of new quartz mills, installation of hoisting machinery
and the establishment of new businesses as well as the construction of homes to
house the workers. This activity was further spurred by the arrival of the Sierra
Railway and the birth of giant lumbering industries in the mountains to the east of the
Mother Lode.       It resulted in a quarter-century of prosperity for both Tuolumne
County and its center of business activity, the City of Sonora.
Sonora itself had experienced brief gold excitement about two decades previously
when several huge quartz vein deposits of gold, known as “pockets,” were
uncovered in the depth of the Bonanza Mine at the northern edge of the city. This
strike had benefited principally only the owners; yet, evidence of some of that wealth,
approaching a million dollars it is said, is still displayed locally in the Nicol Mansion at
313 South Stewart Street which was erected in 1887 by Julia Nicol, widow of Charles
Clark, one of the three Bonanza Mine partners.
                                                              Figure 24: Nicol Mansion

Some of the wealth extracted from the Bonanza mine also went into the erection of
Sonora’s Opera Hall on South Washington Street, now restored and playing an
active role in community life.

The increased tax revenues also brought about the construction of a long-needed
county hospital in 1887, and within two years, the decrepit 1853 wooden courthouse
was razed and replaced with a handsome new yellow pressed brick building that
presently graces the center of the city.
Nor was education neglected. For the first time, local students could remain at home
and receive a high school education in a new school erected at the northern edge of
the city. Shortly later, a similar structure was provided for the city’s elementary
school students. Commonly known today as “The Dome,” it stands overlooking the
city on Barretta Street.

There were also private investments in other
buildings during those prosperous times. In 1896
Mrs. William A. Nevills erected the city’s finest
hostelry, the Victoria Hotel. Remodeled in the late
1920s and renamed the Sonora Inn, it still serves
the traveling public. A second building born of that
era is the 1903 brick Bradford Building at the
southwest corner of Bradford Avenue and South
Washington Street.

9.3.6.    World War I to the Present
By World War I, most of the mines in Tuolumne County were again idle and many
people moved away to work in the war-related industries in the San Francisco Bay
Area. With the advent of the automobile and truck transportation, many agricultural
products and manufactured items were imported rather than being produced locally.
The Depression in 1929 sounded the death knell for most major industries including
agriculture and timber, and the county slumbered along with the rest of the United
States during the following decade.
Due to the increase in the price of gold and low operating costs during the
Depression, a small mining boom occurred again during the mid-to-late 1930s (the
nearest to Sonora to reopen being the Harvard Mine located between Sonora and
Jamestown). World War II effectively put an end to any major mine reopenings and,
with few exceptions, the mines of Tuolumne County were closed in 1942.
The centennials of the gold discovery in 1948 and statehood in 1950 brought a
renewed interest in the gold country. Books were published, photographic and art
exhibits mounted and tourists came in droves to see where it had all happened. The
quaint towns with their narrow streets and frame buildings from another century were
now a destination and Sonora was no exception.
At the height of the Gold Rush in 1852, the population of Tuolumne County is
estimated to have numbered 17,000 individuals—a figure which was not reached
again for 110 years when the 1963 population of the county again reached 17,000.

9.3.7.     Cultural Resource Studies
Many of the cultural resources of the city have been documented in the following
studies:

     •   Historic Inventory City of Sonora-Central Sierra Planning Council, Tuolumne
         County Historical Society, 1983
Sonora’s Historic Resources Inventory recorded 209 properties within the study
boundaries identified in General Plan 2020 Appendix 9A including those
constructed prior to 1945 and excepting those so drastically altered that they lacked
potential for future restoration.      The 2003 inventory provides a good indication of
the nature and extent of resources within the city:

9.4.      Architectural Styles 40
The architectural history of Sonora strongly reflects the availability of construction
materials and the ability of the city’s inhabitants to use those materials.
The architectural style of the dwellings of the first inhabitants of Sonora is unknown.
Descriptions and illustrations of the structures of the Me-Wuk, who resided in the
central Sierra foothills at the time of the Gold Rush, included conical brush and bark
shelters held together with grapevines and a central fire for warmth. Other structures
included ceremonial roundhouses, sweat lodges, and acorn granaries. None of
these structures remain in the City of Sonora.
The discovery of gold brought tent cities with tents of white canvas and log cabins.
The Sonorans from Mexico built brush houses where miners left their families during
the week.
The Sonorans also brought their expertise in adobe construction and numerous
adobe cabins, homes and businesses were built in the earliest years of the Gold
Rush. Three buildings with adobe portions remain in the city today:
        •       Central portion of the Gunn House, Inventory No. 57, built 1852
        •       Portion of the Sugg-McDonald House, Inventory No. 155; constructed
                1857
        •       South wall of the City Hotel, Inventory No. 119, built 1852

Neoclassical (California Rustic)
The first frame homes in Sonora were simple, one-story vernacular Neoclassical,
also referred to as California Rustic. The homes had a basic Neoclassical study with
gable roofs, horizontal siding, surrounding porches, central entries flanked by multi-
paned windows, and a shed-roofed kitchen at the rear. The style remained one of
the most popular in Sonora from the Gold Rush to the early 1900s.
After the loss of numerous buildings to the fires of 1852, 1853 and 1861, affluent
merchants began to introduce the use of brick and stone in their structures and iron
shutters for protection from both fire and thievery.            The Italian and French
stonemasons, experienced in the use of stone in construction from their homeland,
built the majority of stone structures in the California foothills. The first substantially
stone building in Sonora was the City Hotel, completed in 1853.

By the mid-1860s, brick and lime kilns using local supplies of clay and limestone
produced Neoclassical buildings with gable roofs, false fronts with simple cornicing,
brick and stone relieving arches over the windows and doorways. Examples
remaining today include:

Italianate, Eastlake, Queen Anne
Commencing in the 1880s and extending through World War I, Tuolumne County
saw a second Gold Rush based on hard-rock mining. With this boom in mining,
came numerous false-front commercial and Italianate, Eastlake and Queen Anne
residences.     Two of these, designed by architect C.W. Ayres, include the Street-
Morgan Mansion and the Bradford-Rosasco residence.

Romanesque
Tuolumne County did not readily embrace the Romanesque style of the early 1900s.
The county courthouse, designed by William Mooser of San Francisco, is one of the
few constructed in this style.

Craftsman
Following World War I, numerous Craftsman bungalows were constructed and a
number of examples of this style remain today. Most Craftsmen structures appear
to have been built by local carpenters from style books produced by architects such
as Greene and Greene, Gustav Stickley and others.

Mission Revival/Spanish Eclectic
In the 1920s and 1930s, romantic nostalgia for the Hispanic culture culminated in the
development of the Mission Revival and Spanish Eclectic styles used for both
commercial and residential architecture. The style generally made use of brick or
stucco, with colonnades, arches, pillars, tile roofs, decorative tile work, flooring and
metalwork.

Architects
Few homes in Sonora were designed by architects; the Segerstrom home on
Knowles Hill in Sonora (1927) was designed by Stockton architect Davis Pearce.
The Tuolumne County Courthouse was designed by San Francisco Architect William
Mooser. Craftsmen style structures in Sonora appear to have been built by local
carpenters from style books produced by architects such as Greene and Greene,
Gustav Stickley and others.

               To facilitate the use of the city’s cultural resources inventories,
               establish an electronic database, tied to parcel, which includes
               information pertaining to cultural resources on individual parcels. It is
               recommended that the city incorporate inventory data for individual
               parcels using the city’s Geographic Information System (GIS)
               Database.

10.2.1.5. SONORA REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY
The Sonora Redevelopment Agency was established in 1985. On September 16, 1991 a
redevelopment survey area was designated. From this survey area, a 536 acre Project Area
was selected in 1991 and on August 19, 1992 the Redevelopment Plan was approved and
adopted. The overall goal of the Agency’s Redevelopment Plan is to eliminate conditions of
blight by providing needed public improvements; by encouraging rehabilitation and repair of
deteriorated structures; by facilitating land assembly and development which will result in
housing opportunities, employment opportunities and an expanded tax base; and by
promoting development in accordance with Sonora General Plan 2020.
The following adopted objectives reflect the Redevelopment Agency’s economic goals for
the Sonora Redevelopment Project Area:

   •   Expansion and diversification of the community’s economic and employment base,
       through the facilitation of more year-round employment opportunities, including
       industrial development and expansion
   •   Strengthening of the general retail and service commercial sectors of the local
       economy, through diversification and enhancement of population-generated and
       income-generated demand
   •   Recapture of general retail sales leakage from Sonora to other, larger trade centers
   •   Increasing the capture of potential commercial trade originating from through traffic
       on State Routes 49 and 108
   •   Improvements to infrastructure supporting the Project Area, particularly streets,
       storm drainage, curb, gutter and sidewalk to remove existing impediments to the
       economic development of the community
   •   Improvement of parking conditions in the central area of the community through
       creation of additional parking spaces
   •   Elimination or mitigation of other existing blighting conditions and influences,
       including incompatible land uses, obsolete or substandard structures, inadequate
       public facilities, and/or small, irregular and landlocked parcels
   •   Provision of opportunities for participation by owners and tenants in the
       revitalization of their properties
   •   Establishment and implementation of performance criteria to assure high quality
       site design standards, environmental compatibility, and design elements which
       provide unity and integrity to development projects

Chapter 12. Parks & Recreation
12.1. Requirements
The Park and Recreation element is an optional general plan element. However,
over one-third of the cities and 40 percent of the counties in California have adopted
park and recreation elements reflecting the importance placed upon parks and
recreation facilities by local jurisdictions.42
In addition, Park and Recreation elements are often included as part of a general
plan in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the general plan’s Conservation and
Open Space Element. Pursuant to Government Code Section 65563, the
Conservation and Open Space Element must address open space uses including:
        Open-space for outdoor recreation including, but not limited to:
        •        Areas of outstanding scenic, historic and cultural value
        •        Areas particularly suited for park and recreation purposes including
                 access to lake shores, beaches and rivers and streams
        •        Areas which serve as links between major recreation and open-space
                 reservations, including utility easements, banks of rivers and streams,
                 trails, and scenic highway corridors
12.2. Issues and Opportunities
The City of Sonora’s park and recreation facilities can provide multiple benefits which
include:
        •   Contributing to the city’s character
        •   Providing a visual “break” along large expanses of commercial or
            medium-to-high density residential uses
        •   Enhancing economic development
        •   Promoting a sense of mental and physical well-being for residents and
            visitors
        •   Implementing strategies of Sonora General Plan 2020’s Conservation and
            Open Space Element for managing sensitive resources (e.g., historical,
            cultural, biological, scenic)
        •   Implementing strategies of Sonora General Plan 2020’s Circulation
            Element by providing linkages with non-motorized transportation facilities
            (e.g., pedestrian and bike trails)
        •   Enhancing educational opportunities for local schools

                                                         Chapter 12: Parks & Recreation
        •   Encouraging work-live commercial/housing land uses
        •   Promoting a sense of community by providing spaces for community
            assembly and special events
        •   Providing spaces for special events promoting economic development in
            the city
There following categories of park and recreation facilities can provide these
benefits:
City/Community Parks
These parks are designed primarily for use by residents located within one-half to
three miles, but are normally located within one mile of their target user. These
parks normally range in size from 6-25 acres and provide similar amenities to those
found in regional parks, but on a smaller scale. Woods Creek Rotary Park is an
example of a City/Community Park.
Work-Live Parks
These parks are similar to neighborhood parks, but are specifically designed to serve
a particular neighborhood—populations living in an apartment-type setting in close
proximity to their work (e.g., a commercial center, nearby office complex, or mixed
commercial/residential use zone). Parks located within 750 feet of housing receive
the greatest use. These parks are well-suited to serve as visual breaks along long
expanses of buildings and should be an important tool in redevelopment of strip
commercial developments or development of new land uses emphasizing the
location of residential uses in close proximity to work centers. Parks vary widely in
size, but normally average between two and six acres. Facilities should include tot
lots, small picnic areas, generous landscaping, rest areas and, where feasible, small
expanses of hard courts and large expanses of grass play areas.
                                       Pocket Parks
                                       These small facilities normally provide
                                       pedestrian rest areas, landscaped welcomes
                                       at community gateways, visitor services (e.g.,
                                       information kiosks, rest areas, restrooms) and
                                       visual breaks to large expanses of buildings.
                                       These parks are also regularly used for the
                                       display of unique cultural or natural resources
                                       which contribute to community character (e.g.,
                                       a train, mining equipment, significant tree).
                                       Pocket parks generally range in size from 0.1
                                       to 0.5 acre and serve pedestrians within a
                                       radius of 1/8th mile. Pocket parks in Sonora
                                       include the Foster Center Prospector Park and
                                       the U.C. Cooperative Extension Park.

Tot Lots and Children’s Adventure Parks
Tot lots range between 0.5 and 2.0 acres in size. Tot lots serve individuals located
within ¼ mile of the facility. Children’s adventure parks, similar to the children’s park
adjacent to the Sonora’s Main Branch of the Tuolumne County Library, are similar in
size to tot lots, but provide unique recreational facilities in a setting which often
reflects a theme popular to children. These parks may become destination points
for parents and grandparents serving populations throughout the county and even
from neighboring counties.
Regional Parks
These parks range in size from 25 to 1,000 acres, but average between 100 and 250
acres. Individuals normally drive between 20 minutes and one hour to reach these
facilities which are designed to serve all ages and interests with a wide variety of
recreational facilities which can include multiple ball fields (often sponsoring league
play), soccer fields, large picnic areas, swimming pools, expanses of landscaped
areas with mature trees, tennis courts, tot lots, play areas for grammar school
students (jungle gyms, swings), skate parks, golf courses and any other recreational
facility which appeals to the community. It is anticipated that, given the city’s central
location and concentrated population, Sonora (either within the city limits or within its
sphere of influence) could become a logical place to locate a new regional park to
serve both city and county residents. Standard Park is an example of one of the
county’s few regional parks.
Trails
These linear parks are more frequently being rated at or near the top of desirable
recreational facilities in local, state and community recreation surveys. These
facilities provide opportunities for quiet observation (e.g., nature study, bird
watching), hiking through natural lands within an urban setting, protecting natural
resources (e.g., creeks), conserving cultural resources (e.g., miner’s ditches),
attracting visitors, non-motorized transportation (e.g., bicycle, pedestrian, equestrian
use), and other benefits. While numerous standards exist to guide trail widths, few
standards exist for trail length. Current standards recommend at least one regional
trail system per community. The recently-acquired Dragoon Gulch trail parcel within
the city is one example.
12.3. Facility Needs
Park land acquisition for residential subdivisions is governed by the California
Government Code Section 66477 et. seq. (the Quimby Act). The statute specifies
the ratio of parkland acreage to population that may be used to establish dedication
requirements or calculate fees in lieu of dedication for residential subdivisions. The
Quimby Act standard for acquisition of parkland is 3.0 to 5.0 acres of parkland per
1,000 residents.
Alternative standards for the development of recreational facilities (excluding
acquisition of parklands addressed by the Quimby Act) occur throughout the United
States.       For consistency with the provisions of the Quimby Act in California,
recreational facility master plans in Northern California for the development of
parkland are typically based on a standard at or near five acres of parkland per 1,000
Sonora General Plan 2020
                                                               Parks & Recreation-427

                                                               Chapter 12: Parks & Recreation
population although this number typically ranges between 3 acres and 15 acres per
1,000 population (See General Plan 2020 Appendix 12D).43
The city’s projected resident population by 2020 is expected to grow to between
5,144 and 5,948 individuals by the year 2020. Applying the county’s projected
growth rate, the city’s projected population would be approximately 5,656 individuals.
For the purposes of General Plan 2020 and this analysis, the population for the City
of Sonora is expected to reach between 5,144 and 5,948 resident individuals in the
city limits.
As the county seat, and the major employment and commercial center of Tuolumne
County, the City of Sonora sees a daily influx of non-resident population that
increases the city’s daytime population. The city estimates that the daytime
population could increase to between 22,000 and 25,000 individuals. This non-
resident population competes with residents for use of the city’s park and recreation
facilities in many ways, including:
              •  Visitors use picnic facilities at parks, their children use tot lots
              •  Shoppers may pause at tot lots and adventure play areas with their
                 children during shopping trips
              •  Workers take breaks and eat their lunches in city parks while many
                 take fitness walks during the lunch hour, and
              •  County residents often assemble at Courthouse Park for special
                 events
To reflect this pattern of park and recreation facility use by both city residents and
non-residents, the city has opted for a park and recreation facility ratio approximately
double the parkland acquisition standards of the Quimby Act: 10 acres of parkland
per every 1000 residents.           Recognizing the city’s resident and non-resident
population in planning for recreational facilities will reduce competition by non-
residents for recreational facilities while providing an attraction for the workers,
shoppers and visitors so vital to the city’s economic vitality.
Based on the city’s goal of providing 10 acres of parkland for every 1,000 residents,
the city’s total park and recreational needs in the year 2020 are projected to range
between 51 and 60 acres (depending upon actual population in 2020). A portion of
that need already has been filled by the city as illustrated in Table 102.
43
    The five-acre standard is applied by cities for both acquisition of recreational property—in
    conjunction with new residential development pursuant to the Quimby Act; and is applied,
    separately, as the standard for the provision of developed recreational facilities—
    separate from the acquisition standards established pursuant to the Quimby Act.

  /a/     Trails are projected to encompass easements of approximately 50 feet wide (including natural
          areas adjacent to trails). 50 foot trail easements with 25 feet of improved pathway width are
          equivalent to 3 acres per mile [25 ft. X 5,280 ft. per mile/43,560 ft. per acre]
  /b/     Because public school facilities may be made available to the public only on a limited basis,
          total acreage of the existing facilities have been adjusted by 50%
  With 54.6± acres of recreational facilities existing in the city limits and a projected
  need for approximately 51 to 60 acres of recreational facilities by the year 2020, the
  city has likely met its recreation facility needs through 2020.                       However, should
  population increases within the city reach the maximum projected 5,948, up to 5.4±
  acres of additional park and recreation facilities may be needed.

12.6. Goals, Policies and Implementation Programs
Goal:
   12.A        Provide an adequate supply and equitable distribution of park and
               recreation facilities providing multiple benefits to the city’s residents
               and non-residents while enhancing the city’s economy, community
               design, visual quality, jobs/housing balance, conservation of natural
               and cultural resources and circulation as funding permits for
               maintenance and acquisition opportunities.
Recreation Facility Funding
Policy:
   12.A.1      Pursue multiple funding sources for ongoing funding, acquisition,
               construction and maintenance of park and recreation facilities.
Implementation Programs:
   12.A.a      Consider Formation of a New or Participation In an Existing
               Recreation District
               Consider the formation of a city park district or similar entity exclusive
               of existing community recreation and park districts and community
               services districts which provide public recreational facilities, to
               oversee the acquisition, construction and maintenance of recreational
               facilities. Alternatively, participate in a regional recreation district if
               one is established for implementation of the county’s park and
               recreation master plan.
   12.A.b      Investigate Formation of a Landscaping and Lighting District
               Investigate the feasibility of establishing a Landscaping and Lighting
               Assessment District for the purpose of financing the installation,
               construction and maintenance of landscaping, park and recreational
               improvements and for the purchase of land improvements related to
               parks, lighting and landscaping in compliance with state law governing
               the formation of Landscaping and Lighting Districts.
   12.A.c      Consider Using the City’s Redevelopment Agency to Assist in
               Funding Some Park Facilities
               Consider using the city’s Redevelopment Agency funds, subject to
               Redevelopment Law restrictions and requirements to assist in funding
               some park facilities. (See Implementation Programs 12.C.c,
               12.C.d and 12.C.e)

   12.A.d      Pursue Grant Funding
               Include a current list of potential funding sources suited to the
               acquisition and development of the city’s highest ranked (top 10) park
               and recreation facilities as part of the Park and Recreation Master
               Plan. A partial list of currently available funding sources is included
               in General Plan 2020 Appendix 12C.
   12.A.e      Facilitate and Support Community-Based Park and Recreation
               Efforts
               Facilitate and support community-based efforts to establish
               recreational facilities within the city limits. Such efforts already have
               demonstrated positive results within the city limits at a significant
               reduction (even elimination) of costs to public entities (e.g.,
               community-based groups constructed the skate park and children’s
               park adjacent to the county library on Greenley Road). For those
               park and recreational projects endorsed by the Sonora City Council in
               the city limits, the city shall undertake special efforts to fast-track
               permitting and provide assistance in meeting special needs during
               construction.      In addition, when needed, the city shall provide
               community groups with references to agencies and consultants who
               have participated or specialize in providing oversight and guidance for
               community organizations seeking to establish park and recreation
               facilities.44
   12.A.f      Support and Encourage Adopt-A-Park Programs/Endowments
               Encourage community groups, commercial sponsors and similar
               entities to “Adopt-A Park” for maintenance of completed park and
               recreational facilities. Similarly, consider requesting endowments to
               assist in maintaining park facilities which may be dedicated or
               donated to the city.
   12.A.g      Consider the Impacts of New Development on the City’s
               Recreational Facilities
               Revise the city’s ordinance code pertaining to land dedications and/or
               payment of in-lieu fees for new development’s contribution to
               providing recreational facilities consistent with Government Code
               Section 66477 et seq.

               Available Facilities and Distribute Costs and Manpower to
               Acquire and Maintain Facilities
               Promote partnerships with schools, utility agencies community
               groups, the county, state and federal agencies and others to share the
               costs, management and maintenance of existing and new facilities for
               mutually beneficial recreational use. Link or incorporate recreational
               facilities from other entities with city facilities whenever feasible.
               Examples of these partnerships include, but are not limited to:
                        i.  Partnering with the Tuolumne Utilities District (TUD) to
                            share maintenance with and use TUD utility easements
                            (e.g., sewer easements, water line easements, ditches)
                       ii.  Cooperatively developing the Dragoon Gulch Park and
                            Trail with the Mother Lode Adventist Junior Academy to
                            provide vital linkages through the school site between
                            Dragoon Gulch Trail and the proposed Woods Creek Trail
                            while developing educational and interpretive opportunities
                            within the trail system for local schools (e.g., biological
                            studies of natural resources within the trail/park system,
                            study examples of California Gold Rush history located
                            throughout the trail system)
                      iii.  Team with TUD to undertake a pilot program opening up a
                            portion of the Shaw’s Flat Ditch for recreation while
                            potentially providing opportunities for TUD facility
                            expansion adjacent to TUD’s existing facilities within the
                            city.
                      iv.   Locate trails adjacent to existing public rights-of-way where
                            they may be easily maintained in conjunction with
                            maintenance of pre-existing facilities (e.g., roadways).
                       v.   Partner with schools to assist in facility maintenance in
                            exchange for opening recreational facilities for public use;
                            or jointly plan recreational facilities with schools to locate
                            and design facilities which serve both students and the
                            city’s population.

Policy:
   12.B        Acquire and develop 5.4± acres of park and recreational facilities to
               fulfill the city’s projected unmet needs based on a goal of 10 acres of
               recreational facilities per 1,000 residents and based on a maximum
               population projection of 5,948 by the year 2020.
Implementation Programs:
   12.B.a      Develop and Adopt a Park and Recreation Master Plan
               Develop and adopt a Park and Recreation Master Plan describing the
               general locations, designs, costs, priorities, potential funding sources,
               management agencies, strategies for protecting future trail corridors,
               and uses for 5.4± acres of future park and recreation facilities in the
               city including those facility options listed in Table 103.
   12.B.b      Establish a Trail System Integrated with Regionally-Planned
               Facilities Located Within the City’s Sphere of Influence
               Integrate new trails located within the city’s sphere of influence with
               trails in the county’s proposed regional trail system. Continue
               coordination with the county to ensure recognition of proposed city
               trails in the county’s recreation master plan. The Draft Tuolumne
               County Recreation Master Plan proposes the following regional trails
               located in the city’s sphere of influence: Woods Creek Trail, Sierra
               Railroad Trail, Dragoon Gulch Trail, Shaw’s Flat Saratoga Rd. Trail,
               Bald Mountain Rd. Trail, Jamestown Ditch Trail, Campo Seco Road
               Trail, Shaw’s Flat Ditch Trail, and the Racetrack Road Trail (see map

               To protect water quality and its associated biological resources, the
               city has designated minimum streamside setbacks of 50 feet on both
               sides of Woods Creek, Sonora Creek and Dragoon Gulch (as
               measured from the top of the bank of the creek or drainage channel)

               limits being undertaken by the Resource Conservation &
               Development District or equivalent studies.
               The city shall establish a Recreation/Open Space (or comparable)
               zoning district and rezone these setback/buffer areas as Recreation
               and/or Open Space. This zoning district shall permit only small,
               public-utility or recreation-related structures and other similar uses
               consistent with the preservation of water quality and protection of
               biological resources. Reductions in the established setbacks may be
               acquired through issuance of a variance. Structures encroaching
               within the established setbacks as of the Effective Date of General
               Plan 2020 may be expanded provided that the expansion does not
               encroach farther into the established drainage setback (i.e.,
               Expansions of existing structures away from the drainage, but not
               towards the drainage are permitted).

Above Moderate Income Household
Above moderate income households are those households whose incomes are
greater than one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the county median household
income.
Adaptive Reuse
Adaptive reuse means the conversion of obsolescent or historic buildings from their
original or most recent use to a new use. For example, the conversion of a former
hospital or school building to residential use or the conversion of an historic single-
family home to office use.
Affordable Housing
Affordable housing means housing which costs 30% or less of a household’s gross
annual income. Within the context of the Housing Element, “Affordable Housing”
generally is used to describe housing affordable to the city’s low and very low income
households.
Ambient Noise
Ambient noise is the composite of noise from all sources near and far. Ambient
noise levels are the normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given
location.
Automatic Aid (See Also Mutual Aid)
Automatic aid agreements are similar to mutual aid except that the signatory
agencies automatically respond to alarms within all or a portion of each others’
jurisdiction within the operational guidelines of the agreement.          Automatic aid
resources are dispatched with the first alarm assigned.
Average
An average is the result obtained by dividing the sum total of a set of figures by the
number of figures.
A-Weighted Sound Level (dBA)
A-weighting de-emphasizes the very low and very high frequencies of sound in a
manner similar to the human ear. Most community noise standards use A-weighting,
as it provides a high degree of correlation with human annoyance and health effects.
California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR)
The California Register of Historical Resources is a comprehensive listing of
California’s historical resources including those listed in or formally determined
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, California Registered Landmarks
No. 770 onward, and California Points of Historical Interest (commencing with those
designated in January 1998). In addition, the CRHR, includes resources nominated

resources and historic districts; resources identified as significant in historical
resources surveys which meet certain criteria; and resources and districts
designated as city or county landmarks pursuant to a city or county ordinance when
the designation criteria are consistent with the California Register criteria.
Resources eligible for listing include buildings, sites, structures, objects, or historic
districts that retain historic integrity and are historically significant at the local, state
or national level under one or more the following criteria:
         •       Associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
                 the broad patterns of local or regional history, or the cultural heritage
                 of California or the United States;
         •       Associated with the lives of persons important to local, California, or
                 national history;
         •       Embodies the distinctive characteristics of type, period, region, or
                 method of construction, or represents the work of a master or
                 possesses high artistic values; or
         •       Yielded, or has the potential to yield, information important to the
                 prehistory or history of the local area, California, or the nation.
In addition to having significance, resources must have integrity for the period of
significance (i.e., resources must retain enough of their historic character or
appearance to be recognizable as historical resources and to convey the reasons for
their significance.
Central California Information Center (CCIC)
The Central California Information Center (CCIC) is the resource inventory
maintained by the Central California Information Center at California State University
at Stanislaus, in Turlock.
Certificate of Appropriateness
A certificate of appropriateness is a certificate, normally issued in conjunction with a
building permit prior to a demolition or relocation of an important historic structure.
A local government adopts standards which are used to determine the
“appropriateness” of issuing such a certificate for a demolition or relocation.
Certified Local Government
The Certified Local Government (CLG) program is a program sponsored by the
California Office of Historic Preservation (SHPO) and the United States Department
of the Interior that provides funding and technical assistance for local historic
preservation programs and requires adoption of a county cultural resources
protection ordinance and maintenance of a cultural resources inventory.
Civilian Workers
The total number of civilian workers (per the US Census) equals the sum of all
private industry, state and local workers. Federal, military and agricultural workers

Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL)
The community noise equivalent level is the average equivalent sound level during a
24-hour day, obtained after addition of approximately five decibels to sound levels in
the evening from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and ten decibels to sound levels in the
night before 7:00 a.m. and after 10:00 p.m. NOTE: CNEL and Ldn represent daily
levels of noise exposure averaged on an annual or daily basis. Leq represents the
equivalent energy noise exposure for a shorter time period, typically one hour.
Committed Assistance (Housing)
Committed assistance is defined as when a local government has entered into a
legally enforceable agreement during the first two years of the housing element
planning period that obligates sufficient available funds to provide the assistance
necessary to make the identified units affordable and that the units be made
available for occupancy within two years of the execution of the agreement.
Context, Contextual History
Context, or historic context, is a management tool which categorizes information
about related important cultural resources based on a specific theme, geographic
limits, and chronology. (U.S. Department of the Interior, Archaeology and Historic
Preservation: Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines; September 29,
1983)
         “A historic context thus describes one or more aspects of historical
         development in an area, identifying the significant patterns which individual
         resources represent. Contexts such as these are the cornerstone of the
         historic preservation planning process, since the goal of such planning is the
         identification, evaluation and treatment of a whole range of cultural resources
         rather than preservation of a few, or perhaps biased sample of properties.
         Historic contexts should be developed to allow subsequent identification and
         frameworks for evaluation of resources located at a later time.” [Contextual
         History of Tuolumne County, Davis-King et. al, 1994]
Conversion (Housing)
Conversion is one method of increasing the availability of affordable housing
consistent with a jurisdiction’s Housing Element. Housing units are considered to be
“converted” when they meet the following criteria:
Multifamily units in a rental complex of 16 or more units that are converted from not
affordable to affordable with committed assistance by acquisition of the unit or the
purchase of affordability covenants and restrictions providing the units are not
acquired by eminent domain and that the acquisition provides a net increase in the
stock of housing affordable to low-and very low income households. To qualify for
“conversion,” units must be made available at affordable housing costs; the units
cannot be currently occupied by low-or very low income households; the units must
be in decent, safe and sanitary conditions when occupied; the acquisition price
cannot be greater than 120% of the median price for housing units in the city or
county; and the units must have long-term affordability covenants for not less than 30
years. Converted residential units meeting this criteria may count as one-to-one
credit toward fulfilling a jurisdictions affordable housing goals

Cultural Resource
Cultural resources relate only to remains and sites associated with human activities
and include the following:
             •   Prehistoric and ethnohistoric Native American sties
             •   Historic archaeological sites
             •   Historic buildings
             •   Elements or areas of the natural landscape with have traditional
                 cultural significance to the citizens of the City of Sonora, Tuolumne
                 County, the State of California, the foothill region or the nation.
Day/Night Average Sound Level (Ldn)
The day/nigh average sound level is the average equivalent sound level during a 24-
hour day, obtained after addition of ten decibels to sound levels in the night after
10:00 p.m. and before 7:00 a.m. NOTE: CNEL and Ldn represent daily levels of
noise exposure averaged on an annual or daily basis. Leq represents the equivalent
energy noise exposure for a shorter time period, typically one hour.
Decibel (dB)
A decibel is a unit of measure describing the amplitude of sound which is used to
express the relative intensity of a sound as it is heard by the human ear. The
decibel scale expresses sound level relative to a reference sound pressure of 20
micronewtons per square meter, which is the threshold of human hearing. Sound
levels in decibels (dB) are calculated on a logarithmic basis. An increase of 10
decibels represents a 10-fold increase in acoustic energy, and an increase of 20
decibels corresponds to a 100-fold increase in acoustic energy. An increase of 10
dB is usually perceived as a doubling of noise.
Defensible Space
Defensible space means an area either natural or manmade where material capable
of causing a fire to spread unchecked has been treated, cleared, reduced or
changed in order to act as a barrier between the advancing wildfire and the loss to
life, property or resources.
Effective Date
The Effective Date of Sonora General Plan 2020 is May 30, 2007.
Equivalent Sound Level (Leq)
Equivalent sound level is the sound level containing the same total energy as a time
varying signal over a given sample period. Leq is typically computed over 1, 8, and
24- hour sample periods. NOTE: CNEL and Ldn represent daily levels of noise
exposure averaged on an annual or daily basis. Leq represents the equivalent
energy noise exposure for a shorter time period, typically one hour.
Entryway
An entryway is an area within the city limits where the city has located or plans to
locate a structure and/or landscaping which welcomes, gives direction to, or provides
assistance or other information for residents and visitors to the city. An entryway is
smaller in area than a gateway

Façade Easement
A façade easement is an agreement between the owner of an historic structure or
cultural resource and a government agency or preservation organization pursuant to
which the agency or organization is given the right to review and approve changes to
the exterior of the historic structure or resource before such changes may be sought
or commenced. In exchange for granting a façade easement, the property owner
may receive tax benefits in the form of a charitable contribution for conservation
purposes.
Family (Housing Element)
A family is a group of two people or more (one of whom is the householder) related
by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. The number of families is
equal to the number of family households; however, the count of family members
differs from the county of family household members because family household
members include any non-relatives living in the household.
Floor-Area-Ratio (FAR)
Floor-Area-Ratio is the ratio of the gross building square footage permitted on a
parcel to the square footage of the parcel (i.e., the gross floor area of all buildings
permitted on a lot divided by the area of the lot). To determine the permitted floor
area for all buildings in a particular zoning district; multiply the maximum FAR
specified for the zoning district by the total area of the parcel.
For example, on a 40,000 square foot parcel:
A permitted FAR of 2 would allow the construction of 80,000 square feet of gross
floor area (40,000 X 2 ‘ 80,000). This construction could occur in many alternative
configurations (e.g., as a two-story building with 40,000 square feet of gross area
per floor, a four-story building with 20,000 square feet gross area per floor, or some
alternative combination totaling 80,000 square feet of gross floor area).
A permitted FAR of 1.0 would allow construction of buildings totaling 40,000 square
feet of gross floor area (20,000 square feet of gross floor area per floor on two floors
or 40,000 square feet of gross floor area on a single floor or some alternative
combination totaling 40,000 square feet of gross floor area).
A permitted FAR of 0.50 would allow the construction of buildings totaling 20,000
square feet of gross floor area on 40,000 square feet of land.
A permitted FAR of 0.25 would allow 10,000 square feet of gross floor area for all
buildings on 40,000 square feet of land.
Gateway
A gateway is that area along a roadway entering the city where a motorist gains a
sense of approaching and entering the city.

accommodations (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional
housing for the mentally ill); or B) An institution that provides a temporary residence
for individuals intended to be institutionalized; or C) A public or private place not
designed for or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human
beings. Homeless individuals do not include individuals imprisoned or otherwise
detained pursuant to an Act of the Congress or a state law (U.S. Code Section

the immediately prior planning period.
Noise Contours
Noise contours are lines drawn about a noise source indicating equal levels of noise
exposure. CNEL and Ldn are the metrics used to describe annoyance due to noise
and to establish land use planning criteria for noise.
Noise-Sensitive Land Uses
Noise-sensitive land uses include, but are not limited to: urban residential land uses,
transient lodging, schools, libraries, churches, hospitals and nursing homes. Recent
court decisions have also indicated the need to include sensitive wildlife habitat
including the habitat of rare, threatened, or endangered species.
Non-family Household
A non-family household is a household which is not composed of two or more
people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. Individuals
living alone are an example of a non-family household.

vehicles), medium (25-100 vehicles) and large (more than 100 vehicles).
Prehistoric
Prehistoric means pre-1750.
Preservation (Affordable Housing)
Preservation is one method of increasing the availability of affordable housing
consistent with a jurisdiction’s Housing Element. Housing units are considered to be
“Preserved” when they meet the following criteria:
Units shall be preserved at affordable housing costs to low or very-low income
households by acquisition of the unit or purchase of affordability covenants for the
units. Preserved units must have long-term affordability covenants and restrictions
for at least 40 years; have received governmental assistance under specified
programs; be eligible and reasonably expected to convert to non low-income uses
(as determined by a public hearing); and be in decent, safe and sanitary condition.
When units are identified for preservation, they must be available at affordable costs
to persons and families of low or very low income. Preserved residential units
meeting this criteria may count as one-to-one credit toward fulfilling a jurisdictions
affordable housing goals.

Rehabilitation (Affordable Housing)
Rehabilitation (or, Substantial Rehabilitation) is one method of increasing the
availability of affordable housing consistent with a jurisdiction’s Housing Element.
Housing units are considered to be “Substantially Rehabilitated” when they meet the
following criteria:
Units to be substantially rehabilitated must result in a net increase in the stock of
housing affordable to low and very low income households and be at imminent risk of
loss to the housing stock. Relocation assistance must be provided to any occupants
temporarily or permanently displaced and the local government must require that any
displaced occupant will have the right to reoccupy the rehabilitated units. Units are
to have been found by the code enforcement agency or a court to be unfit for human
habitation and vacated or subject to being vacated for at least 120 days because of
the existence of at least four of the following conditions in Health and Safety Code
Section 17995.3:
        •    Termination, extended interruption or serious defects of gas, water or
             electric utility systems provided such interruption or termination is not
             caused by the tenant’s failure to pay such gas, water or electric bills
        •    Serious defects or lack of adequate space and water heating
        •    Serious rodent, vermin or insect infestation
        •    Severe deterioration, rendering significant portions of the structure unsafe
             or unsanitary
        •    Inadequate numbers of garbage receptacles or service
        •    Unsanitary conditions affecting a significant portion of the structure as a
             result of faulty plumbing or sewage disposal
        •    Inoperable hallway lighting
Rehabilitated units must have long-term affordability covenants and restrictions
requiring the units to be available to, and occupied by low and very low income
households for at least 20 years or the time required by any applicable federal or
state law or regulation.
Units protected by long-term affordability covenants may count as one-to-one credit
toward fulfilling a jurisdictions affordable housing goals. Substantially rehabilitated
units with affordability covenants and restrictions of less than 20 years may be
substituted at the rate of three rehabilitated units for one credit of affordable housing.
No credit is provided for units with less than 10-year affordability restrictions.
