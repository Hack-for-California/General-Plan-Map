3        LAND USE ELEMENT
         The purpose of the Land Use Element is to shape the future physical development of Calistoga and
         to preserve, protect and enhance Calistoga’s current quality of life, so that the city can remain a
         walkable, small town with a complementary mixture of buildings and land uses in a pleasant
         environmental setting. The Land Use Element is the central chapter of the General Plan.
As required by state law, this Land Use Element contains text and maps that designate the future use and
reuse of land within Calistoga city limits. The Land Use Element also includes standards of density and
building intensity recommended for the City of Calistoga, which is also required by law.
While Napa County has direct control over land within the unincorporated part of the Planning Area, the
Calistoga General Plan Land Use Element also provides guidance for this part of the Planning Area, which
will be used by the City in commenting on projects in the Planning Area.
A.       Background Information
Existing Land Uses
City Limits
Table LU-2 identifies the acreage of major land uses within the city limits, as defined in Table LU-1. This
information is mapped in Figure LU-1 and graphed in Figure LU-2.
Residential uses occupy nearly half of the land within the city limits.

Agricultural land comprises approximately one-fifth. Parks and public
space are also major existing uses within the city limits in terms of

part of the Planning Area from being subdivided or converted to
other land uses without a countywide vote. Much of this land is also              too steep and hilly to allow for
development, and the County limits development along the ridgelines.
A distinctive feature of the Calistoga Planning Area is the placement of single-family homes on large lots
planted with grapevines or orchards. This feature characterizes other nearby communities and landscapes,
providing a visual sense of place in the region.

1  Some parcels included in the agricultural categories could have been classified as either single-family or agriculture, since they are
   comprised of a house surrounded by vineyards. Generally, these are categorized as Agriculture because they differ from the
   majority of single-family homes in terms of their large lot size (typically greater than two acres) and because most of the parcel has
   an economic use, i.e., viticulture.

Growth Management
Economic expansion in the nine-county San Francisco Bay area has fueled dramatic construction rates
throughout the region. In contrast, development in Calistoga has been less intense. This is partially because
limitations in the availability of water and wastewater treatment capacity restricted growth throughout the
1990s. Calistoga’s Resource Management System, which limits the amount of residential development allowed
each year, was instituted in 1990.
Partly as a result of the RMS, both population growth and construction occurred at rates much lower than
was the case elsewhere in the region. While Calistoga’s population grew by 15 percent between 1990 and
2010, Napa County’s total population (including all cities and the unincorporated area) grew by 25 percent
during this same time period.
As discussed in the Infrastructure Element, the purchase of water supply from Kern County and expansion
of the wastewater treatment system mean that the limitations that created a need for this Resource
Management System are largely no longer in effect. However, the City is committed to the continued
management of its growth to maintain its unique small town character.
Since the adoption of the 1990 General Plan, land use planning has
begun to reflect increasing concerns about the impact of
conventional models of suburban development on community                   Green construction and land
character, resource use, and the environment. Many communities,            development techniques are more
including Calistoga, are interested in looking at new modes of             environmentally benign than standard
development that incorporate ecological principles such as “green          ones. Examples of “green building”
building” practices and sustainable urban development. Infill              include passive solar energy use and
development of vacant and underutilized land in the urbanized area,        the use of materials such as straw
as well as clustered development that seeks to minimize conversion         bale.
of open space lands are among some of the other important
strategies in sustainable urban development.
Jobs/Housing Balance
There is approximately one job per household in Calistoga, which is less than the approximately 1.2 employed
residents per household 2. The latter tends to range from about 1.3 to 1.5 in communities like Calistoga with
large senior populations. However, as many as 1,300 jobs could be added within the next 20 years 3.
B.       Key Findings
1.       Calistoga has avoided the extreme results of “suburban sprawl”, i.e., conventional, post- World War
         II zoning. As a result, the community displays a mixture of housing of many different price ranges
         within walking distance of a commercial downtown. It has not created large monotonous areas of
         just one type of land use such as the “cookie-cutter” subdivisions so prevalent elsewhere in
         California.

2.       The majority of commercial uses in Calistoga are centered on Lincoln Avenue. Most retail properties
         are small businesses; few are franchise and formula operations. These qualities add to the economic
         and commercial diversity of downtown.
3.       Single-family homes on large lots planted with grapevines form a distinctive feature of land use in the
         Calistoga Planning Area. They make Calistoga’s location in a winemaking region apparent and help
         provide a visual sense of place.
4.       Currently, about 400 acres of land within the city limits are vacant or used for agriculture. These sites
         are significant because their development could have a profound impact on the appearance and
         function of the community.
5.       Limitations in water supply and wastewater treatment capacity caused the City to adopt a Resource
         Management System. Now that these infrastructure limitations are being addressed, growth
         management will continue to be an important means of maintaining Calistoga’s rural town character
         and quality of life.
6.       Calistoga currently has a relatively healthy jobs/housing balance. Although the City seeks additional
         employment development, it also seeks to maintain this jobs/housing balance by ensuring that
         commercial growth does not outpace residential growth through limitations on both residential and
         commercial growth.
7.       Concerns about the impact of land development on natural resources and energy use have grown.
         Conventional suburban development is now perceived to have negative impacts related to the
         environment, preservation of natural resources and community character. Interest in integrating
         ecological and environmental concerns into what is called “green building” and “sustainable
         development” is increasing.
8.       In the unincorporated part of the Planning Area, Napa County's Agricultural Resource Land Use
         designation and Measure J protect much of the agricultural land. The County rural residential
         designation, which requires 10-acre minimum lot sizes, also protects open space. As long as this area
         remains subject to these kinds of controls, agricultural uses will remain in the unincorporated part of
         the Planning Area.
C.       Land Use Designations within the City Limits
This section provides land use designations within the city limits.
(Land use designations for the rest of the Planning Area are discussed           Land Use designations have the
in Section E.) All new development in the city must conform to these             same force as General Plan
designations.                                                                    policies. This means that future

The nine different land use designations shown on the Land Use Designations Map are defined here. The
designations provide a range of densities and intensities of use in order to provide flexibility. Development
densities and intensities are maximum amounts of development. The development levels listed here do not
create entitlements to a specific number of dwelling units or amount of floor area. Densities may be lower
due to site constraints or other City regulations.
Development intensity for housing is expressed in terms of dwelling units per gross acre. Development
intensity for commercial and other non-residential uses is expressed as floor area ratios (FARs), which is the
gross floor area of all construction divided by the net property area.
The Land Use Designations Map is implemented through the Zoning Code, which provides more specific
classifications than this General Plan. In some cases, more than one zoning district is consistent with the
General Plan Land Use designation. Other parts of the Municipal Code, especially the Subdivision Ordinance,
provide additional development standards. Under State law, the Zoning Code and other City regulations must
be consistent with the General Plan.
By reducing the level of density allowed on the outskirts of the city, infill development is encouraged and
density is feathered downward in intensity from the downtown to the city’s edge.

Rural Residential Land Use Designation
Lands designated Rural Residential serve as a buffer between the agricultural lands around the city and the
urbanized part of Calistoga. The intent of this land use designation is to establish a limit to the urbanized
parts of Calistoga. This area currently contains a mixture of agriculture and large-lot residential use. Farming,
including grapes, is expected to remain a major land use. There could also be some new residential
subdivisions and some economic development related to wineries.
Uses allowed in this designation include crop production, vineyards, light agricultural structures, and single-
family residences. Wineries and visitor accommodations may occur with discretionary permit approval.
The maximum density in areas designated Rural Residential is one unit per acre. The allowed density shall be
determined through the subdivision review process, which will include an assessment of the proposed
developments according to the following performance standards. Development at or near one unit per acre
will be permitted only if the performance standards are met:
•     Cluster development where feasible to minimize the deleterious effects of monotonous development that
      contradicts the residential character of the community.
•     Preserve and enhance open spaces and agricultural lands.
•     Target higher densities, within the range, adjacent to the more densely-developed areas and lower
      densities, within the range, outward to the City’s edge consistent with the community’s interest in
      feathering development.
•     Provide landscaping and/or open space buffers between development and at the entrances to new
      development.
•     Maintain scenic vistas from public rights-of-way and existing private development.
•     Preserve natural resources important to the community, such as waterways.
•     Enhance the rural traditions of the community and preserve Calistoga’s small-town character through
      sensitive architectural and site planning.
In order to offset the cost of preserving large lots in agricultural production, the following uses may also be
permitted if they conform to all relevant General Plan policies: light agricultural uses and structures; small-
scale wineries; bed-and-breakfast inns; religious facilities and home occupations.
A portion of the Rural Residential area is designated Rural Residential-Hillside. This designation occurs in
rural residential areas where steep slope or hillside conditions exist in order to ensure that development meets
public safety, open space conservation and visual concerns. The size and number of lots and development
standards in hillside areas are established by ordinance. Clustered single-family development may be
permitted if it conforms to all General Plan policies.
Low Density Residential Land Use Designation
The Low Density Residential designation applies to areas on the                  Single-family homes on lots
outskirts of Calistoga that are served by public water and sewer                 ranging from 0.25 acres to 0.5
services and are generally flat in topography. These areas provide a             acres shall be the predominant use

Single-family homes are allowed at densities ranging from 1 to 4 dwelling units per acre, along with
supportive housing, transitional housing and residential care.
The following uses may also be permitted if they conform to all relevant General Plan policies: schools, bed-
and-breakfast inns; home occupations; and religious facilities.
Medium Density Residential Land Use Designation
Areas with the Medium Density Residential designation are generally located between the Low Density and
High Density residential designations. This designation is applied to areas in which both City water and sewer
services are provided.
The Medium Density Residential designation allows single-family homes at densities ranging from 4 to 10
dwelling units per acre, along with supportive housing, transitional housing and residential care. Duplexes
and mobile home parks are also allowed, where appropriate.
The following uses may also be permitted if they conform to all relevant General Plan policies: schools, bed-
and-breakfast inns, and home occupations, and religious facilities.
High Density Residential/Office Land Use Designation
The High Density Residential/Office designation generally occurs adjacent to downtown and on large land
holdings provided with full City services and good street access.
Allowed uses are multi-family housing (three or more attached units) at densities of 10 to 20 dwelling units
per acre, along with supportive housing, transitional housing and residential care. Offices are allowed in
appropriate areas and may be developed at a floor area ratio up to 0.8.
The following uses may also be permitted if they conform to all relevant General Plan policies: visitor
accommodations other than bed-and-breakfast units where the Visitor Accommodation Overlay District is
applied, bed-and-breakfast inns, live-work units, home occupations, and religious facilities.
Downtown Commercial Land Use Designation
The Downtown Commercial designation generally applies to
properties located along the southerly portion of Lincoln Avenue and           As an incentive for mixed use
along Foothill Boulevard near its intersection with Lincoln. This area         projects, residential development

dwelling units per acre, including live-work units, is also permitted
above the ground floor. The maximum FAR is 2.0. Housing floor area is not included in the FAR
calculations.
The following uses may also be permitted if they conform to all relevant General Plan policies: bars, visitor
accommodations, tasting rooms, service stations and religious facilities.
Since they are located in the central part of Calistoga, parcels in the Downtown Commercial areas shall be
subject to a wider array of development and design requirements than are other parts of the City. These
requirements are summarized in the Community Identity Element.

Community Commercial Land Use Designation
The Community Commercial designation applies to areas at the edge of the downtown, and at the entry
corridor at the intersection of Foothill Boulevard and Petrified Forest Road. Some of these areas are
transitional between the downtown commercial area and residential neighborhoods. Others provide a
combination of visitor- and local-serving commercial uses for residential neighborhoods at the outskirts of
the city.
Principal uses allowed include retail, personal services, professional offices, medical offices and clinics, at a
maximum FAR of 0.8. The residential floor area of mixed use projects is not included in the calculation of
FAR. Multi-family residential is allowed at densities in the range of 10 to 20 dwelling units per acre, except
that a lower density may be approved for vertical mixed use projects.
The following uses are also permitted if they conform to all relevant General Plan policies: restaurants; bars;
public uses; visitor accommodations including motels, hotels, resorts and inns where the development
provides opportunities for amenities serving the local community; spas; religious facilities; service commercial
uses; large residential care facilities for the elderly; skilled nursing facilities; outdoor sales such as nurseries;
and service stations.
Airport Commercial Land Use Designation
The Airport Commercial designation applies to the former Gliderport property, comprised of a group of
parcels covering approximately 43 acres extending down-valley from Lincoln Avenue in central Calistoga.
Most of this site is undeveloped, with the only construction being a former hangar, which has been converted
into service uses and storage, and the former gliderport office. Any redevelopment of the property will
require its reclassification to another land use designation. The existing uses may continue until such
redevelopment.
Light Industrial Land Use Designation
The Light Industrial designation is applied to certain areas of the city where existing industrial uses occur or
where industry can be isolated or buffered from residential uses.
This area is set aside for heavy commercial and light industrial uses, including light manufacturing, auto
repair, bottling plants, storage, assembly, service and repair, developed at a maximum FAR of 0.60. Uses
shall be appropriately planned and designed to minimize conflict with adjacent areas, as established in policies
set forth in Section F.
Accessory commercial uses, such as retail, offices and eating establishments, may be permitted if they
conform to all relevant General Plan policies.
Public/Quasi-Public Land Use Designation
The Public/Quasi-Public designation applies to existing and planned public facilities such as the County
fairgrounds, parks, City Hall, the community center, the police station, the cemetery, schools and the
wastewater treatment plant, spray fields and holding ponds. Policies and actions related to the development
and operation of such facilities are included in the Circulation, Infrastructure and Public Services Elements of
the General Plan.

D.          Overlay Designations
This General Plan includes four overlay designations that provide special design and development guidance
for key sites in Calistoga. Except where specified differently below, allowable uses for overlay designations
are the same as those of the underlying designation. Overlay designations are mapped in Figure LU-6.
Planned Development Overlay
The Planned Development Overlay (PD) is applied to large land
                                                                                    Properties designated with the
holdings with unique features, parcels that are located in sensitive
environmental and transitional areas, and in areas where innovative                 Planned Development Overlay
design standards are to be applied to achieve a superior design or to               merit particular attention because
permit dedicated affordable housing. Development in PD areas is                     of their size or location or due to
subject to design review. Specific guidance for each PD area is                     environmental constraints.
discussed below.
Silverado Trail Planned Development Overlay (PD-1)
Development on these large parcels on the Silverado Trail shall be designed to be visually suitable for its entry
corridor location on the edge of town and should contribute to the economic and/or community vitality of
Calistoga. Development on this site shall respond to the following issues:
•     A balance of uses among various parts of the site.
•     Sensitivity to the natural landscape, scenic vistas (particularly to the Palisades) and site features, including
      adequate creek setbacks and preservation of vegetation on Mount Washington.
•     Protection of natural resources, including retention of on-site drainage, mature trees and sensitive habitat.
•     Clustering of development to allow for the retention of habitat-containing open space.
•     Minimization of grading.
•     Minimization of impacts on adjacent land uses, including appropriate siting of noise generators, lighting,
      and building location, height and style.
•     Incorporation of adequate landscaping, including provision of a landscaped setback from Silverado Trail
      and a landscaped berm or other screening along the boundary with the mobile home park.
•     Ensure that new development is of a scale subordinate to the agricultural uses of properties located at
      these entry corridors.
•     Consideration of passive recreational opportunities on Mount Washington and a pedestrian pathway on
      the site to provide public access to this area. An appropriate location for such a pathway may be along
      the boundary with the mobile home park.
•     Adequate consideration, through submittal of geotechnical and preliminary drainage plans with a project
      application, of geological and hydrological constraints, including soil erosion and slope stability, drainage,
      flooding, and drainage ditch maintenance.
•     Provision of on-site parking and circulation that includes safe access to Silverado Trail.

•     Land uses shall be limited to agriculture, residences and visitor accommodations, including hotels, motels,
      and destination resorts. Agriculture uses may include, but are not limited to, horticulture,
      floriculture, viticulture, apiaries, and similar uses (excluding stockyards or commercial feeding of animals),
      and related uses such as wineries and retail wine sales, provided that these uses are clearly subordinate to
      the primary agricultural use. Residential uses may include single-family homes, mixed density
      development and senior retirement center. Residential densities normally allowed under the Rural
      Residential designation shall apply to the Planned Development area. Visitor accommodations may
      include related visitor services such as restaurants, recreational amenities, wine retail sales and storage, spa
      and retail shops, provided that they are clearly secondary to the visitor accommodation use.
      Development of these parcels shall be varied and shall not include a single land use or predominant use
      such as visitor accommodations or wineries on each lot.
Calistoga H ills Planned Development Overlay (PD-2)
Development on these hillside properties along Foothill Boulevard shall be carefully designed to provide
appropriate transition into town while protecting the visual quality and integrity of the forested hillside and
contributing to the economic and/or community vitality of Calistoga. Land uses shall be limited to light
agricultural, residences and visitor accommodations, including destination resorts and fractional club units.
Agriculture uses may include, but are not limited to, horticulture, floriculture, viticulture, apiaries, timber
harvesting and similar uses (excluding stockyards or commercial feeding of animals), and related uses such as
wineries and retail wine sales, provided that these uses are clearly subordinate to the primary use. Residential
uses may include single-family homes and residential second units. Residential densities normally allowed
under the Rural Residential-Hillside designation shall apply to the Planned Development area. Visitor
accommodations may include related visitor services such as restaurants, recreational amenities, wine retail
sales and storage, spa and retail shops, provided that they are clearly secondary to the visitor accommodation
use. The Resort Club shall respect the residential density requirements.

Development in all entry corridors shall incorporate the following features:
•     Setbacks shall be wide in order to preserve rural characteristics and shall be landscaped with trees,
      vineyards and/or native vegetation. These setbacks shall not be deducted from the calculation of net
      density (i.e., the same amount of development is permitted, shifted elsewhere on the property).
•     Walls, fences and berms included in landscaping should incorporate materials and design that blend
      harmoniously with the surrounding landscape.
•     Existing orchards and stands of mature trees shall be maintained or replaced with similar vegetation.
•     Unique natural features shall be preserved and remain visible.
•     The appearance of historic buildings visible from public streets shall be preserved.
•     New buildings should reflect small-scale, low-rise design characteristics with an understated visual
      appearance, and should maintain existing small-town rural and open space qualities.
•     Parking areas should not be visible from the entry corridor roadway.
•     All development within designated entry corridors shall be subject to design review.
•     New development shall not include shopping centers, gas stations, “big-box” retailers, or other
      commercial centers with strip retail characteristics, and formula businesses shall be discouraged.
•     Commercial uses permitted in the entry corridor should complement rather than compete with
      Calistoga’s downtown commercial core. Examples of such uses include, but are not limited to, nurseries,
      destination spas and resorts, museums, winery and vineyard-related businesses and community facilities
      such as a library or recreational use. Such uses shall be allowed only if they are consistent with the
      underlying land use designation.
For those parts of the entry corridors located outside of city limits, the City shall provide input to the County
Planning Department and other County review authorities.
The following sections describe each entry corridor and give additional guidance for their development.
Entry Corridor 1: Downvalley Foothill Boulevard
The majority of people approaches Calistoga along Foothill Boulevard from the southeast, and pass through
this entry corridor. The entry corridor is undeveloped except for a small number of single-
family homes set back from the road, and some vineyards and orchards outside of the city limits. A portion
of the right-of-way is an open gravel area running alongside the road, which is controlled by Caltrans.
All development in this area should maintain the rural and open space qualities, with minimal visibility from
the highway.
Entry Corridor 2: Downvalley Silverado Trail
Vineyards and related uses are the predominant use of land on the north side of Silverado Trail in this area,
both inside the city limits and in the adjacent unincorporated area. The south side is primarily developed with
a resort and winery, along with a public water tank at the top of Mt. Washington. Between Brannan Street
and Lincoln Avenue, uses include a light industrial facility, a church, a winery and some rural residential uses.
A tourist entertainment business, including bicycle rentals and tours, may be considered subject to the
processing of a use permit. All development in this area should preserve vineyards and existing trees along
Silverado Trail, to the extent feasible, and conform to the rural quality of the area.

Entry Corridor 3: Lincoln Avenue at Foothill Boulevard
With its flashing light and historic directional arrow sign, this three-way intersection is the visual entrance to
downtown Calistoga. Most properties in this entry corridor are highway-oriented; there is limited landscaping
and substantial amounts of land on each parcel is set aside for automobile access and parking.
The City desires that new development in this area include minor landmark features such as small signs or
gateway landscaping to mark the entrance to the Downtown on Lincoln Avenue. One- and two-story
construction, oriented toward the intersection, would be appropriate. Development at the intersection of
Foothill Boulevard and Petrified Forest Road should have positive visual qualities to mark the entrance to the
town
Entry Corridor 4: Lincoln Avenue/Silverado Trail
The part of this entry corridor outside of city limits is mostly undeveloped. The major exception is the
PG&E power substation and homes on parcels generally exceeding two acres. The area’s general appearance
is rural. The appearance of the western side, within the city limits, is similar, although slightly more
developed, with some single-family homes on large parcels, interspersed with areas of low intensity or vacant
agricultural land.
All development in this area should maintain existing rural and open space qualities. Appropriate site layout,
architecture, and setbacks should be used to create an understated visual appearance for development visible
from the roadway.
Entry Corridor 5: Upvalley Foothill Boulevard
In this entry corridor, the hilly terrain of the southwest side of Foothill Boulevard contrasts greatly with the
flat open fields of the northeast side. Houses are relatively small and the agricultural uses of the properties
dominate visually.
Any development in this area should preserve the rural open space character visible from Foothill Boulevard.
Development at the intersection of Foothill Boulevard and Petrified Forest Road should have positive visual
qualities to mark the entrance to the town.
Entry Corridor 6: Petrified Forest Road
This entry corridor is hilly and heavily forested, except at the commercial properties at the intersection with
Foothill Boulevard. Properties directly fronting the intersection are auto-oriented, with little indication that
this is an entrance to Calistoga. Most existing development on the other parcels is set further back from the
public right-of-way.
New development along Petrified Forest Road should retain or enhance tree cover visible from the roadway.
Visitor Accommodation Overlay
This overlay designation allows both new and existing visitor accommodations, including motels, hotels and
inns, within certain areas that would not otherwise allow these uses. Spas are allowed in conjunction with
these uses, provided that they are not the primary use. Other uses allowed by the underlying land use
designation are also allowed.
Character Area and Gateway Overlays
Character Area and Gateway overlay designations are applied to areas that will play an integral role in the
quality of life and economic vitality of Calistoga. Guidance for development and/or redevelopment of these

including the historic commercial district (“Historic District”),
properties along Stevenson Avenue and Grant Street area (“Stevenson/Grant”), and properties within the
Lincoln/Foothill Gateway area.
Connectivity Considerations
•     Create new pedestrian connections to adjacent streets and public areas through new development or
      redevelopment activities.
•     Work with Caltrans to identify alternative routes for truck traffic with the objective of eliminating truck
      traffic on Lincoln Avenue.
•     Enhance pedestrian connections by preserving and creating accessways from Lincoln Avenue to the
      Sharpsteen Museum/Police Station Plaza, First Street, Fire Station parking lot, Gerrard Street and Elm
      Street.
•     Where possible, access, circulation and parking shall be shared by adjacent properties.
•     Encourage reconfiguration or other improvements to the CalMart parking lot to facilitate vehicular
      access from Fair Way or First Street.
•     Extend and connect Gerrard Street to the Fair Way extension to facilitate area circulation and access.
•     When appropriate, enhance pedestrian connections to and along the Napa River with the goal of creating
      a river promenade.
•     Consider establishing a pedestrian bridge over the Napa River at Hazel Street to the Fire Station parking
      lot and development of a river overlook at the Gerrard Street terminus.
•     As part of the reconfiguration of the Police Station/Sharpsteen Museum parking lot area into a public
      event plaza area, design a deliberate connection to Pioneer Park that would establish a synergy between
      the two public spaces.
•     New development projects or major redevelopment of non-residential properties must participate in the
      necessary mitigation to accommodate improved access, circulation and parking.
Historic District Sub-Area
The Historic District sub-area extends from the Lincoln/Foothill Gateway area to Stevenson Street. The
district is characterized by traditional storefront buildings and restored historic structures. Future
development in this area should continue to convey and define Calistoga’s community heritage of a small
town lined with pedestrian oriented shopping and services for residents and visitors. The district should be
enhanced with nooks and alcoves to strengthen the unique identity of Calistoga and make it an interactive and

inviting place to spend time. Redevelopment of downtown’s “second streets” (e.g., First Street, Gerrard
Street, Elm Street) and activity-generating uses along connecting east-west streets will serve to broaden and
enhance the downtown experience. The Napa River corridor, as an important natural water feature for
Calistoga, should be showcased through development of an inviting river promenade that would serve as a
convenient and attractive accessway from the public parking areas at the Sharpsteen Museum/Police Station
and the Fire Station to the downtown area.
Land Use Considerations
•     The range of land uses allowed in the Downtown Commercial land use designation is appropriate for this
      area. A diversity of uses should be encouraged and supported.
•     Redevelopment should be encouraged to increase the intensity, activity and vibrancy of downtown’s
      “second streets,” including First Street, Gerrard Street and Elm Street.
•     Encourage the establishment of land use “anchors” in the form of signature development at either end of
      the character area. The northern anchor should complement the Historic District with a retail-
      commercial component and provide a distinct connection to the Resort Character Area.
•     Encourage greater building density/intensity and allow required parking to be located on-site in shared
      parking spaces, off-site in shared parking spaces, or in public parking spaces located on the street or in a
      public parking facility.
•     Expand commercial/office development and/or parking at the Fire Station parking lot area and require
      improvements along the river frontage to facilitate development of a river promenade.
•     Support renovation of Doctor Wilkinson’s Hot Springs Resort. Renovations should maintain its
      signature thermal hot springs resort status and be respectful of its historic presence in town. Ground
      level retail-commercial active uses may be provided along its street frontages.
•     Redevelopment of the Doctor Wilkinson’s Hot Springs Resort and the former gliderport properties
      should collectively form an “anchor” at the northern end of the Historic District. Along each property’s
      Lincoln Avenue frontage, development should be comparable in scale and mutually supportive in use.
•     Evaluate current parking standards to minimize the impact of parking requirements on new development
      and to reduce redundant parking.
•     Allow redevelopment of existing small parking lots within the area with multi-story mixed use buildings
      provided that adequate parking can be provided on site or within a reasonable distance.
•     Support the development of multi-story mixed use buildings on the east side of Elm Street.
•     Consider relocating the Community Center to allow for the reconfiguration and improvement of the
      Sharpsteen Museum/Police Station parking lot areas into a public event plaza.
•     Opportunities to create an inviting promenade along the Napa River and a public event plaza in the
      Sharpsteen Museum/Police Station parking lot should be explored as part of public and/or private
      improvement projects.

Development and Design Considerations
•     New development in the district shall be compatible in mass, scale and character with the historic context
      and immediate neighborhood setting.
•     Traditional store front design should be reflected in new development or redevelopment of buildings
      along Lincoln Avenue from Cedar Street to Fair Way.
•     Three-story buildings should be designed so that the upper floor is “stepped back” to lessen the
      perceived scale at street level.
•     Buildings should convey traditional widths of earlier structures in this area. New buildings with larger
      frontages should be modulated and articulated to maintain the historic architectural rhythm and scale of
      Lincoln Avenue.
•     Use of historic building materials such as stucco, brick and wood is encouraged. More complementary
      materials may be considered for new development or redevelopment along First, Gerrard and Elm
      streets.
•     As opportunities present themselves, building elevations that face alleys, the Napa River and other public
      areas should be enhanced.
•     Encourage new development to accommodate outdoor seating in areas adjacent to the Napa River,
      parking lots, public areas, and public rights-of-way through the creation of nooks and alcoves.
•     New development or redevelopment of buildings backing to the Sharpsteen/Police Station and Fire
      Station parking lots should provide some design orientation to these areas.

Foothill Character Area Overlay
The Foothill Character Area extends along Foothill Boulevard from the Petrified Forest Gateway to the
Lincoln/Foothill Gateway. The southern portion of this area is predominantly developed with hillside
residential uses and several small bed-and-breakfast inns of good architectural character. The northern
portion consists of single-family residential uses and includes the historic hospital property and the Herrero
Italian olive farm reproduction.
Development in this area should convey a sense entering at the edge of a small, historic town. Infill
development should reinforce the area’s character as an older, well-established neighborhood. Enhancements
to Foothill Boulevard such as pedestrian pathways, crosswalks, appropriate street lighting and street trees will
help to slow traffic and signal to travelers that that have entered town.
Land Use Considerations

Gliderport Character Area Overlay
The Gliderport Character Area includes the former gliderport properties and several smaller parcels located in
the southwest portion of the character area. These properties are currently underutilized and are anticipated
to be redeveloped in the future. Redevelopment presents an opportunity to add to the excitement and vitality
of the downtown area and improve area access and circulation. It is expected that redevelopment efforts will
result in a vibrant and synergistic mix of uses that complement current uses in the downtown area and serve
as a catalyst for further redevelopment and improvement of other properties in the City.
Land Use Considerations
•     Land uses to be considered in the redevelopment of properties in this area should include
      retail/commercial uses, a signature full service resort and spa, residential uses and community and visitor
      serving uses.
•     New development and redevelopment should consider and accommodate to the extent possible area
      access, circulation and parking needs.
•     Care must be taken to ensure that development of the disproportionately large former Gliderport
      properties reflects Calistoga’s small town character.

Lower Washington Character Area Overlay
The Lower Washington Character Area is an older area comprised of a wide variety of land uses, including:
commercial services, a medical clinic, a church, single- and multi-family residential, warehousing, a softball
field, and the City’s Public Works yard, wastewater treatment plant and irrigation ponds. This area offers
unique redevelopment potential and presents an opportunity to address a number of needs, including
affordable housing and development of new leasable space for small start-up businesses.
Given these opportunities, the Lower Washington Character Area should be reserved primarily for more-
intensive mixed use developments. New development should create a vibrant and interesting overall
environment with limited gaps of commercial inactivity. Because the southern boundary of the character area
is defined by the Napa River, consideration of river access and experience should be evaluated and
incorporated as appropriate.
Land Use Considerations
•     Land uses in this area should primarily serve local needs, such as resident-serving uses, commercial
      storage, office space, artist studios and restaurant uses.
•     Development of new rental housing and “live-work” space is encouraged.
•     Mixed use development is strongly encouraged.
•     Small scale light industrial uses that keep within the character of the area and existing neighborhood
      constraints should be allowed.

      -    Conserve energy and resources to the greatest extent possible.
Connectivity Considerations
•     Prioritize the extension/improvement of Fair Way from Lincoln Avenue to Earl Street to facilitate good
      circulation and access to local streets (e.g., Anna Street, Eddy Street).
•     Pursue opportunities to establish a pedestrian and bicycle connection to State Highway 29 via a
      pedestrian and bicycle bridge crossing over the Napa River.
•     New development projects or major redevelopment of non-residential properties must participate in the
      necessary mitigation to accommodate improved access, circulation and parking.

      connection between State Highway 29 and lower Washington Street via a pedestrian and bicycle bridge
      crossing over the Napa River.
•     A pedestrian walkway and bikeway with appropriate lighting should be considered along the north side of
      State Highway 29 to accommodate safe passage to downtown. The walkway shall be designed to be rural
      in character.
•     Consider establishing public access along the Napa River, where appropriate and with exception to
      developed single-family residences, in conjunction with major development proposals or with the willing
      cooperation of private property owners. Public access shall be designed in consideration of the security
      and privacy of adjacent residences.
•     Street access should be extended from Pine Street to service and connect with properties within the
      character area.
•     New development projects or major redevelopment of non-residential properties must participate in the
      necessary mitigation to accommodate improved access, circulation and parking.

Lincoln Avenue/Foothill Boulevard Gateway
The Lincoln Avenue/Foothill Boulevard Gateway serves as a key intersection for bypass traffic and as an
entrance into downtown. The area has a distinct and different development pattern than the Historic District
in the Downtown Character Area. New development or redevelopment within this area should strive to
extend development characteristics found in the Historic District. Attention also needs to be given to more
efficient movement of bypass traffic through the Lincoln/Foothill intersection.
Land Use Considerations
•     The range of land uses allowed in the Downtown Commercial land use designation is appropriate for this
      area. A diversity of uses should be encouraged and supported.
•     Encourage the establishment of an “anchor” land use on the lands located south of the Lincoln
      Avenue/Foothill Boulevard intersection. The anchor should include a signature development with
      enhanced public and shared parking facilities.
•     Retain, enhance and supplement the existing conforming retail, commercial, artisan and lodging
      establishments in the area.
•     Gas stations may remain but should be encouraged to enhance the aesthetic appearance of their facilities.
Development and Design Considerations
•     Characteristics found in the Historic District of the Downtown Character Area must be carried through
      the gateway area to effectively “join” the two areas through common physical and functional
      improvements.
•     In general, development and design considerations specified for the Historic District of the Downtown
      Character Area should be applied in this area.
•     The defining streetscape elements of the Historic District of the Downtown Character Area should be
      extended to the Lincoln/Foothill intersection and along Foothill east to Pine Street and west to Elm
      Street.
•     As opportunities present themselves, enhance the appearance of properties in this area and coordinate
      improvements to area access, circulation and parking.
•     Encourage the gas stations at the Lincoln/Foothill intersection to maintain their facilities in a clean and
      orderly fashion. Encourage building improvements as well as more subtle signage, lighting and
      landscaping.
•     All overhead utilities should be placed underground.
•     Outdoor lighting shall be designed to preserve and protect the nighttime environment in accordance with
      the following International Dark Sky Association model ordinance objectives:
      -    Provide the minimum lighting level necessary for night-time safety, utility, security, productivity,
           enjoyment, and commerce.
      -    Minimize adverse offsite impacts such as sky glow, light overspill and obtrusive light.
      -    Conserve energy and resources to the greatest extent possible.
                                                                                                           LU-31

Connectivity Considerations
•     A study should be initiated to evaluate all feasible intersection improvement alternatives to address
      deficiencies and objectives for the Lincoln/Foothill intersection, including pedestrian safety control
      measures to facilitate access to the downtown area.
•     Wayfinding signage should be integrated into the intersection design to direct visitors to the downtown
      area and other destinations
•     Consider prohibiting through-traffic on Hazel Street from Myrtle Street to Foothill Boulevard and
      encourage private or public improvements to the intersection.
•     Improve pedestrian and bicycle circulation and facilities in the area.
•     Establish a pedestrian crosswalk on State Highway 29 at Pine Street.
•     New development projects or major redevelopment of non-residential properties shall participate in
      necessary mitigation to accommodate the improvements to the intersection.
Petrified Forest Gateway
The Petrified Forest Gateway is a “country crossroads” located at the intersection of Petrified Forest Road
and Foothill Boulevard. This intersection primarily serves commute traffic between Lake, Napa and Sonoma
counties. Commercial uses in the area should serve travelers but also include limited services for nearby
residents. Although safety and circulation improvements are needed, the intersection should remain compact
to avoid encouragement of commercial sprawl. The character of the area should have an understated visual
appearance and provide a preview of the community’s unique qualities.
Land Use Considerations
•     The range of uses established for the Community Commercial land use designation is generally
      appropriate for the area.
•     Agriculturally oriented uses such as produce stands, nurseries, winery and vineyard related uses are
      encouraged.
•     Development or redevelopment around the intersection shall not be of a design or style that is typical for
      a suburban strip center. Formula chain businesses are discouraged.
•     Commercial uses should primarily serve the commuter-traveler. Uses that also serve nearby residents but
      do not compete with downtown businesses may also be allowed.
•     A Planned Development (PD) zoning overlay approach may be utilized for future development or
      redevelopment of larger properties within the area to address shared access opportunities and circulation
      needs.
Development and Design Considerations
•     The scale of new development or redevelopment must not overpower the surrounding neighborhoods
      and should be understated, using small scale and low-rise building design.
•     The approach to town from a rural setting must convey a sense of arrival and signify the characteristics of
      a unique, small visitor-friendly town.
•     Building massing, form and lay-out must convey a diverse village character and reflect Calistoga’s
      individualistic nature.

•     Where appropriate, new development or redevelopment should provide some orientation toward Cyrus
      Creek.
•     Landscaping should convey a rural rather than manicured urban setting.
•     Parking should be screened from street view and placed at the rear of properties while buildings should
      be placed in close proximity to the road.
•     Uniform setbacks, heights, roof forms and architectural language should be avoided so that the
      appearance of a large development is that of one which was built over time.
•     Outdoor lighting shall be designed to preserve and protect the nighttime environment in accordance with
      the following International Dark Sky Association model ordinance objectives:
      -    Provide the minimum lighting level necessary for night-time safety, utility, security, productivity,
           enjoyment, and commerce.
      -    Minimize adverse offsite impacts such as sky glow, light overspill and obtrusive light.
      -    Conserve energy and resources to the greatest extent possible.
Connectivity Considerations
•     Intersection improvements are needed to allow for increased/ more efficient traffic flow during peak
      commuter traffic periods and to improve pedestrian and vehicular safety.
•     In addressing intersection design deficiencies, all feasible alternatives including signalization, intersection
      realignment and installation of a roundabout should be evaluated.
•     Commuter traffic congestion must be monitored and managed to ensure that it does not become
      hindrance to visitor access.
•     Development should be coordinated to ensure logical and efficient circulation. Particular attention
      should be paid to minimizing site access points and creating opportunities for shared parking.
•     Opportunities to improve pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular access to sites within close proximity to the
      intersection should be explored as part of public and private improvement projects.
•     Pedestrian and bicycle path connections to the downtown area should be accommodated so that
      commercial opportunities and services can become more accessible.
Silverado Trail Gateway
The Silverado Trail Gateway is located approximately one-half mile north of downtown and lies within the
Resort Character Area. At its center is the intersection Silverado Trail, Lincoln Avenue/State Highway 29
and Lake Street. As a major entry into town, the Silverado Trail Gateway must convey several strong
messages. Design and development should provide a clear sense of entry into Calistoga and build anticipation
of the City’s unique character. It should incorporate local elements such as a geothermal feature to highlight
Calistoga’s unique resource. Special attention must also be given to the Oat Hill Mine Trail trailhead which
also lies within this gateway area. The trailhead area should be showcased, and facilities for accommodating
access by residents and visitors should be provided.
Land Use Considerations
•     Development and redevelopment of land within this area must substantially enhance the appearance of
      this critical entry.
                                                                                                               LU-33

•     Opportunities to provide parking accommodations and quality trailhead amenities for Oat Hill Mine Trail
      users should be explored as part of public or private improvement projects.
Development and Design Considerations
•     Design of all improvements around the intersection must convey a strong sense of arrival to Calistoga
      and signal aspects of its identity.
•     Landscaping at the intersection shall be attractive and appropriately design and should borrow from the
      prevailing landscaping theme within the Resort Character Area.
•     Development leading to and around the intersection must be setback from the street edge to
      accommodate installation of meandering and well landscaped pathways.
•     Improvements to the Oat Hill Mine Trail trailhead must be of high quality, yet simple and rural in
      character with heavy use of stone and wood.
•     All parking should be screened from public view to the extent possible.
•     Outdoor lighting shall be designed to preserve and protect the nighttime environment in accordance with
      the following International Dark Sky Association model ordinance objectives:
      -    Provide the minimum lighting level necessary for night-time safety, utility, security, productivity,
           enjoyment, and commerce.
      -    Minimize adverse offsite impacts such as sky glow, light overspill and obtrusive light.
      -    Conserve energy and resources to the greatest extent possible.
Connectivity Considerations
•     Inviting and user-friendly pathways and road-crossings for pedestrians and bicyclists shall be provided to
      and from the resorts located within the Resort Character Area. Pathways shall be designed to be rural in
      character.
•     New development projects or major redevelopment of non-residential properties within the Resort
      Character Area shall participate in the funding of needed improvements to the intersection to the
      appropriate extent.
•     Traffic calming techniques to slow traffic in this area should be explored as part of public or private
      improvement projects.
•     In addressing intersection design deficiencies, all feasible alternatives including signalization, intersection
      realignment and installation of a roundabout should be evaluated.
•     Wayfinding signage should be integrated into the intersection design to direct visitors to the downtown
      area and other destinations.
E.          Land Use Designations in the Unincorporated Planning Area
The portion of the planning area outside of Calistoga city limits is under the jurisdiction of Napa County.
The City has no intention of annexing any area outside of the current city limits, and the City’s Sphere of
Influence is coterminous with the city limits. However, development in the surrounding area may impact
long-term city planning and development efforts.

Napa County has applied three Land Use designations in the unincorporated part of the Calistoga Planning
Area. As shown in Figure LU-8, the area east of Foothill Boulevard is designated Agricultural Resource.
Almost all land west of Foothill Boulevard and outside of the city limits is in the “Agriculture, Watershed and
Open Space” land use designation. The exception is comprised of parcels down-valley from city limits as far
as Mountain Road on the west side of Foothill Boulevard. This approximately 75-acre area is designated Rural
Residential.
Land designated by the County as Agricultural Resource is subject to the protection of the Napa Valley
Agricultural Preserve, created through Measure J. Conversion to a non-agricultural development would
require a change in County zoning and land use designation, which requires approval by
Napa County voters. The following text has been excerpted from the 1990 Napa County General Plan, and
serves as the City of Calistoga’s land use designations for parcels outside the city limits.
Rural Residential Land Use Designation
This designation applies to land in proximity to existing urban areas but currently in agriculture or developed
with low-density year-round residences. Further parcelization of these lands is discouraged. Minimum parcel
size is 10 acres, with one housing unit per parcel.
Agriculture, Watershed and Open Space Land Use Designation
This designation provides areas where the predominant use is agriculturally oriented; where watershed areas,
reservoirs, floodplain tributaries, geological hazards, soil conditions and other constraints make the land
relatively unsuitable for urban development; where urban and erosion is essential to the general health, safety,
and welfare. Minimum parcel size is 160 acres.
Agricultural Resource Land Use Designation
This designation identifies areas in the Napa Valley and foothills in which agriculture is and should continue
to be the predominant land use, where uses incompatible with agriculture should be precluded and where the
development of urban type uses would be detrimental to the continuance of agriculture and the maintenance
of open space. Minimum parcel size is 40 acres.
F.         Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions
  Goal LU 1          Protect the small-town qualities of Calistoga, which include walkability, vineyards,
                     orchards, natural habitats and open space.
Objective LU 1.1         Ensure that new commercial development enhances and maintains the vibrancy
                         of Calistoga’s downtown.
Policies
P1.1-1 Formula businesses within the city limits shall generally be prohibited. Exceptions may be made for
          formula businesses primarily meeting local residents’ and business owners’ needs.
P1.1-2 Commercial development in Calistoga shall be focused in the downtown area.
P1.1-3 The City shall encourage commercial development to incorporate local-serving commercial and
          residential uses in the second story.
LU-36

C I T Y O F  C A L I S T O G A G E N E R A L P L A N                                2015 LAND USE ELEMENT
P1.1-4 New development in the downtown is encouraged to have a minimum of two stories. Second stories
         in this district may be limited to resident-serving commercial uses and/or residential units where
         appropriate, given the context of surrounding units. Third stories shall be limited to residential units
         only.
P1.1-5 The City shall encourage infill development and development on land with necessary public
         infrastructure in place.
Actions
A1.1-1 Encourage the County to regulate formula businesses in the rest of the Planning Area.
A1.1-2 Enforce and expand landscape standards for all uses within the downtown to promote a human
         scale, and provide visual interest, protective shading and other natural vegetation features.
A1.1-3 When awarding growth management nonresidential allocations, give preference to the intensification
         or expansion of existing uses greater than 10 percent in floor area or new construction on vacant,
         underdeveloped or redeveloped land with necessary public infrastructure in place.
Objective LU 1.2        Promote a balance between visitor-oriented and local-serving commercial
                        development.
Policies
P1.2-1 Tourism activities shall be regulated to minimize adverse impacts to other segments of the economy,
         and the resident population.
P1.2-2 New visitor accommodations proposed in Calistoga shall be required to mitigate all environmental
         impacts.
P1.2-3 Although existing visitor accommodations in Community Commercial areas may expand, new visitor
         accommodations in these areas shall generally be allowed only where they are part of mixed use
         projects that provide tangible benefits to the Calistoga community.
P1.2-4 New visitor accommodations development shall be designed, constructed and operated so as to be
         compatible with adjacent uses, particularly residences.
P1.2-5 Short-term visitor rentals of residential properties intended for long term use shall be prohibited.
Actions
A1.2-1 Continue to regulate the expansion of bed-and-breakfast units to ensure an appropriate mix of land
         uses and to retain the predominantly residential character of established neighborhoods.
A1.2-2 Conduct annual inspections to ensure compliance with Use Permit requirements for bed-and-
         breakfast inns to ensure that bed-and-breakfast development does not result in the net loss of
         housing.
Objective LU 1.3        Ensure that commercial and industrial development is designed, located and
                        operated so as to not disturb Calistoga’s quality of life, and approved at a rate
                        and scale that retains Calistoga’s small-town character.
Policies
P1.3-1 New commercial and industrial development shall occur at a rate that maintains a healthy
         jobs/housing balance, in conformance with Calistoga’s growth management strategy.
                                                                                                          LU-37

P1.3-2 Development that creates new jobs shall be balanced with the ability to house new employees in
         Calistoga.
P1.3-3 Commercial and industrial land shall be developed in an environmentally-sensitive manner and shall
         be compatible with any adjacent residential and commercial uses.
P1.3-4 No commercial or industrial uses shall be permitted unless they meet noise, air, water and wastewater
         quality standards and have access to City water, wastewater, fire and police services.
P1.3-5 Commercial and industrial development shall be appropriately landscaped, provide sufficient on-site
         parking and be designed to minimize the size and bulk of individual buildings.
P1.3-6 The conversion of residential buildings to commercial uses shall be prohibited in areas designated
         solely for residential use, such as the RR, RR-H, R-1 and R-2 Zoning Districts.
P1.3-7 In areas designated for commercial uses, developers shall offset, on a one-to-one basis, any loss of
         housing that occurs through the redevelopment of residential buildings to commercial uses.
P1.3-8 Napa County shall be encouraged to prevent the proliferation of commercial and industrial activities
         in the unincorporated part of the Planning Area, especially if State Highway status is shifted from
         Lincoln Avenue.
Action
A1.3-1 Continue to manage commercial and industrial growth through the Growth Management System.
Objective LU 1.4        Develop and phase new housing at a rate that can be absorbed by public
                        infrastructure and in a manner that fits within Calistoga’s small-town identity.
Policies
P1.4-1 On average, Calistoga’s annual residential growth rate shall be no more that 1.35% of the number of
         residents in Calistoga the previous year. This rate may be exceeded in a single year provided that the
         growth rate is not exceeded when combining up to five years growth; average annual growth in the
         five-year period shall not exceed 1.35% as measured through the adopted residential growth
         allocation procedures. High priority shall be given to affordable housing and infill development and
         the development of land with necessary public infrastructure in place.
P1.4-2 Development that meets performance standards for growth consistent with community character
         shall be given a high priority, including affordable housing, mixed-use projects, infill development
         and second units.
P1.4-3 Generally, no more than ten market-rate units may be built in a single subdivision in any given year.
         Exceptions may be allowed for subdivisions that provide benefits to the city.
Action
A1.4-1 Continue to administer the Growth Management System.

 Goal LU 2           Designate a broad range of land uses within the city limits.
Objective LU 2.1         Ensure that an adequate amount of land is designated in the General Plan to
                         permit desired development in Calistoga, while also preserving Calistoga’s small
                         town character.
Policies
P2.1-1 All new development in the city shall comply with the policies of the individual land use designations
         in Section C of this Land Use Element.
P2.1-2 All new development on sites with overlay designations shall follow the overlay designation
         regulations in Section D of this Land Use Element to ensure that their development is in harmony
         with the surrounding environment.
P2.1-3 Recognize the importance of affordable, conveniently-located, quality child care as a component of
         family life in Calistoga, particularly given the rapidly increasing rate of working women with young
         children.
Actions
A2.1-1 Develop measures that would enhance the provision of quality large and small child care facilities in
         Calistoga, such as reduced or eliminate permitting fees, flexible parking standards, fast-track
         permitting or permit exemptions, and similar provisions.
  Goal LU 3           Ensure that new development mitigates significant environmental, design and
                      infrastructure impacts.
Objective LU 3.1         Prevent development from occurring where the location or the physical or
                         biological characteristics of the site would make the land use inappropriate.
Policies
P3.1-1 New development shall be focused within the existing developed areas, and not at the city’s
         periphery.
P3.1-2 New development shall be designed so as to not adversely impact adjacent uses, particular those of
         lower intensities.
P3.1-3 The approval of all development projects shall be coordinated with the provision of infrastructure
         and public services required to meet the needs of the development.
P3.1-4 The development area of a site shall be calculated based on net acreage, once areas of steep slopes,
         floodways, streets and park dedications have been subtracted from the gross acreage of a parcel.
         Properties with the Rural Residential-Hillside designation shall be subject only to the street and park
         dedication exclusions, since they are subject to a slope density formula established by ordinance.
P3.1-5 Clustering of development shall be encouraged, especially in areas of ecological sensitivity including
         hillside areas and on and around Mount Washington.
                                                                                                          LU-39

Action
A3.1-1 Standards for new subdivisions will be developed to include clustering as a component to promote
         the preservation of open space.
Objective LU 3.2        Ensure that new development complements Calistoga’s small town rural
                        character and minimizes impacts on the environment.
Policies
P3.2-1 New development shall be designed to respect and enhance Calistoga’s small-town rural character
         and the natural environment.

         reduce the environmental impacts of construction activity.
Actions
A3.2-1 Use the design review process to ensure that development meets community concerns for visual and
         functional quality.
  Goal LU 4         Maintain the rural qualities of the unincorporated part of the Calistoga Planning
                    Area.
Objective LU 4.1        Preserve agricultural and natural resources in the unincorporated area to provide
                        the natural setting for Calistoga’s identity.
Policies
P4.1-1 Annexation of any unincorporated land shall be discouraged.
P4.1-2 Napa County shall be requested to limit land use activities in the unincorporated part of the Planning
         Area, including that designated Rural Residential, to agricultural and open space uses.
P4.1-3 Napa County, the State, non-profit organizations and interested individuals shall be encouraged to
         preserve, acquire and enhance open space in the Planning Area.
P4.1-4 The City shall collaborate with Napa County and with Napa County LAFCO to protect existing land
         uses from development inappropriate for rural areas.
P4.1-5 The City shall advocate at the State level for expansion of incentives, such as Williamson Act
         contracts, that allow agricultural operations to remain economically viable.
P4.1-6 Local property owners shall be encouraged to place agricultural land in the Land Trust of Napa
         County and/or to protect their farms with Williamson Act contracts.
P4.1-7 Provide input to Napa County on applications in the Planning Area for discretionary land use
         approvals, both through the environmental review process and by commenting on referrals from the
         County.

4        COMMUNITY IDENTITY ELEMENT
         The natural and built environments of Calistoga help create a strong sense of community for the
         town. Given the importance of Calistoga’s unique physical, visual and cultural features, the
         community has decided to include a Community Identity Element to identify, protect and
         enhance these characteristics.
State law does not require a Community Identity Element. However,
                                                                                   The       Community         Identity

community identity can be maintained.
A.       Background Information
Calistoga is a walkable small town,
made up of a vibrant main street set
within               pedestrian-oriented
neighborhoods and surrounded by
wineries, vineyards and other
agricultural lands. Important visual
features include the tree-lined streets
found throughout the city, the Napa
River, and historic homes and
commercial buildings. Most of the
community is located on the Napa
Valley floor and is nestled between the
                                                            Vineyards in front of Mount Washington
Palisades and the Southern range. The
rugged hilly areas are heavily forested, contrasting with the gentler landscape of the town itself, which
has been tamed and tempered by human hands to create large expanses of vineyards, orchards and other
open space, dotted with houses and other structures.
The Planning Area can be divided into distinct districts that form its physical identity. These include:
•   Downtown, which has a compact street pattern and Lincoln Avenue as its main axis. Downtown is
    the economic and social center of Calistoga.
                                                                                                                   CI-1

•     Residential neighborhoods, each of which developed over several decades in the nineteenth and
      twentieth centuries. These neighborhoods are comprised primarily of one- and two-story houses set
      back on landscaped lots. Lot size is generally small.
•     Rural and semi-rural areas, comprised of agriculture and other open space. Large single-family
      homes surrounded by vineyards are a distinctive feature of this area, part of which is located outside
      of city limits.
•     Publicly-owned open space, which includes parks and public infrastructure and facilities.
Urban Design
Urban design considers the aesthetic and functional relationship of places and buildings. It focuses on
the connections between people and places, circulation patterns and the physical form of the city.
Enhancing quality of life is a key goal of urban design.
An important part of Calistoga’s existing streetscape is the fact that virtually all areas contain different
kinds of land uses located near to one another. In most of the city, no distinct boundary separates single
family homes from denser housing; commercial streets are near other land uses. No large shopping
malls or “big box” retail centers exist. With few exceptions, residential neighborhoods are comprised of
houses in a variety of styles, built over several years, even decades. This architectural and visual
heterogeneity helps to create the community’s identity. Landscaping, signage, the control of traffic, noise
and other emissions also play an important role.
Landmarks, Entry Corridors and Vistas
Calistoga is in the upvalley section of the Napa Valley, which is punctuated by small landmarks such as
Mount Washington and Mount Lincoln. Most of the visually prominent features, such as the ridgelines
of the Palisades, are located outside of the city limits beyond the direct control of the city government.
As a result, the General Plan, and the Community Identity Element in particular cannot protect the
visual features of many of the most significant features of the Planning Area. However, the Napa
County General Plan and other County regulations provide some visual protection to the hillsides that
frame Calistoga. Moreover, the City has a role in responding to discretionary permits since those areas
are within the General Plan Planning Area.
Entrances to the city on major roadways are called “entry corridors.”
Entry corridors marking the principal entrance points into Calistoga are            The rural quality of

policies and actions to enhance these entry corridors.
Calistoga and its Planning Area also include many vistas offering important views of Calistoga’s
surrounding scenic resources. Vistas and scenic resources are discussed in the Open Space and
Conservation Element.

Historic Resources
In addition to natural environmental features, Calistoga possesses
cultural resources that are important parts of its community
identity. These historic resources include historic structures, sites     In 2001, the National Trust for

Surviving nineteenth-century houses are designed in Greek
Revival, Gothic Revival, Italianate, Second Empire, Queen Anne,
and vernacular styles. Houses from the first half of the twentieth century display Colonial Revival,
Craftsman, Bungalow, Tudor Revival, and Spanish Colonial Revival styling. There are relatively few
houses from the 1920s and 1930s, since the Napa Valley's economy was depressed in this period.
Approximately 25 commercial buildings are significant, and most are rated “A.” The largest
concentration extends along Lincoln Avenue, which comprises the city's historic downtown. A handful
of older roadside businesses, including two older gas stations, are distributed along Foothill Boulevard.
Fires swept through the business district in 1901 and 1907, with the result that few nineteenth-century
structures remain. Still, four significant commercial buildings are from the period 1887 to 1895, with 20
other buildings dating from the first four decades of the twentieth century. Lincoln Avenue is
distinguished by several fine examples of vernacular construction using local stone and brick, including
the Fraternal Hall building (1887) at 1343-47 Lincoln Avenue, pictured on the previous page. Lincoln
Avenue’s commercial styles include Mission Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival, Neoclassical and
Moderne.
The most notable aspect of
Calistoga’s commercial history is its
status as a resort town. For example,
five properties survive from the
original Calistoga Hot Springs of the
1860s and 1870s. Four early
twentieth century resort/spas have
also been identified.
Other types of historic resources in
Calistoga include barns and stables, a
railway depot, churches, govern-
mental buildings, a public park, a

bridge, and a cemetery. For example,
the church at 1321 Cedar Street (1869/1902) represents a unique example of Romanesque Revival
architecture. Very few older industrial buildings survive, although two structures associated with early
wineries are significant. The winery building (1890) at 28 Kortum Canyon Road is a primary historic
resource that may be eligible for the National Register. The Calistoga Depot (1868) is one of the state's
oldest train stations and adjoins the historic downtown on Lincoln Avenue. Five churches spanning the
years from 1869 to 1945 complement the older residential neighborhoods. The City Hall (1902), Library
(1924), and Pioneer Park (1936) embody the local government's role in Calistoga’s growth and
development.

Historic Districts. Historic districts can be
designated to protect historic areas or groups
of historic structures against insensitive
changes and the loss of historic fabric and
features. A designated historic district can
contribute        to      the    revitalization     of
neighborhoods and to the conservation of the
resources they contain. By encouraging better
quality design, positive economic impact can be
created because Calistoga’s sense of place will
remain strong for visitors and for potential and
current residents. Four historic districts in
Calistoga have been identified and are mapped                    Calistoga Depot, 1458 Lincoln Avenue

Archaeological and Paleontological Resources
In May 2000, a request for a records search for the entire Planning Area was filed with the Northwest
Information Center at Sonoma State University, which is the clearinghouse for all archaeological
resource surveys in this part of California. The records search indicated that 50 studies of archaeological
and paleontological resources covering approximately 5 to 10 percent of the Planning Area have been
conducted.
The types of cultural resources which have been discovered in the Planning Area include remnants of
Native American villages and campsites and other evidence of habitation such as large, small and ashy
middens, and lithic and obsidian scatter. Potential prehistoric resources include chert or obsidian flakes,
projectile points, mortars and pestles; and dark friable soil containing shell and bone dietary debris, heat-
affected rock, or human burials.
Within the Planning Area, prehistoric archaeological sites are generally located along seasonal and/or
perennial watercourses, at or near vegetation ecotones, and at the base of foothills. The unsurveyed
portions of the Planning Area contain these environmental features and there is a high probability of
additional prehistoric cultural resources in these areas.
Disclosure of more specific information on archaeological sites is inappropriate for General Plan
documents. Locations of sites are kept confidential in order to prevent vandalism, artifact hunting and
trespassing. The Northwest Information Center provides site location data and/or the exact contents of
surveyed sites only to licensed archaeologists, who are then prohibited from disclosing this information
to the public. California Government Code Section 6254.10 exempts archaeological site information
from the California Public Records Act which requires that public records be open to public inspection.
Since the Planning Area is known to contain numerous prehistoric resources and there is a high
probability of additional resources, archival and field study is recommended prior to the implementation
of projects involving or leading to ground disturbance.
Community Cultural Facilities and Activities
In addition to its numerous historic buildings and archaeological resources, Calistoga, both in the past
and today, is home to a diverse population that reflects a variety of cultures and their heritage. Several
institutions reflect and enhance this important aspect of the city’s community identity.
The Sharpsteen Museum in Calistoga is located in a City-owned building close to the downtown, and
operated by a non-profit association that maintains and staffs the museum. The Museum houses
numerous exhibits depicting the city’s history. Notable are a series of extensive dioramas that portray
Calistoga in its 19th Century heyday as a fashionable spa town. Other displays are in place that provide
information about Calistoga’s indigenous population, the Mishewal (named the Wapoo by the Spanish),
                                                                                                         CI-9

as well as artifacts from 19th and 20th Century life in Calistoga. The Museum also houses a large
collection of historic photographs that provide an important connection to the past.
Calistoga’s Pioneer Cemetery, located along Foothill Boulevard near Petrified Forest Road, is the burial
place of many of Calistoga’s early citizens, as well as a picturesque open space area, with winding paths,
trees and hillsides throughout the cemetery. At present, there are no formally developed interpretive
facilities at the site and visitor amenities are limited. Given its importance to local history, as well as its
scenic qualities, the Cemetery has great potential to be enhanced as a significant local historic and
cultural site.
Beyond these cultural and historic sites, Calistoga also hosts a number of events that are an important
aspect of local community character. The annual Napa County Fair is held at the Fairgrounds in July,
and is an occasion for Calistogans and Napa Valley residents alike to enjoy exhibits of local agriculture
and business, live entertainment and other amusements. There is also an annual Cinco de Mayo Festival
and Parade that celebrates Hispanic culture and Calistoga’s local Hispanic population. Other events
include the Beer and Sausage Festival, Art in the Park, and an annual Fourth of July parade and
celebration.
B.        Key Findings
1.        Calistoga’s identity as a small town is based on its physical appearance, including eclectic small
          buildings set on walkable streets and the surrounding natural environment.
2.        Calistoga has several “entry corridors” providing entry to the city along major roadways. Entry
          corridors play an important role in the perception of Calistoga and in its small town, rural
          identity.
3.        Attention to urban design criteria can help ensure that future development fits within the
          existing built environment and permit the continued growth of Calistoga in a manner which
          maintains its existing small town atmosphere. Landscaping, signage, traffic and noise all play a
          key role in enhancing quality of life in Calistoga.
4.        An important part of the Calistoga streetscape is created by the businesses lining Lincoln Avenue
          and a few side streets. A key feature of buildings along the central portion of Lincoln Avenue is
          the use of extended roofs and canopies that create an arcade of covered sidewalks. Shopping is
          focused in the downtown area, and typical shopping centers and "big box" retail have been
          discouraged.
5.        Historic resources comprise an important part of Calistoga’s character, embodying the city's rich
          and varied heritage. The preservation of these resources is vital to the city's ongoing quality of
          life and its continued viability as a visitor destination.
6.        Challenges in the renovation of historic buildings include the need to meet current code
          requirements, and to ensure seismic safety.
                                                                                                        CI-11

C I T Y O F  C A L I S T O G A G E N E R A L P L A N               2012 COMMUNITY IDENTITY ELEMENT
7.       It is likely that the Planning Area contains still undiscovered archaeological, palentological and
         cultural resources including human burial sites. State and federal law and professional practice
         provide stringent guidelines related to the timing of archival and field study of these resources.
8.       Calistoga is home to the Sharpsteen Museum, which provides displays and interpretive exhibits
         about local history. The Pioneer Cemetery is an important and under-utilized local historic and
         scenic resource that should be enhanced with new facilities.
9.       Community events such as the Fourth of July and Cinco de Mayo celebrations are an important
         aspect of local character that the City should continue to support.

5        CIRCULATION ELEMENT
         The purpose of the Circulation Element is to regulate and develop Calistoga’s transportation
         systems. This Element balances the need to provide efficient ways to get from one place to another
         with the overall vision of Calistoga as a walkable small town, made up of a vibrant main street set
         within pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods.
         The City is committed to the “Complete Streets” goal of creating and maintaining a comprehensive
         and integrated transportation network that provides safe, comfortable and convenient travel, serving
         all types of users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, persons with disabilities, seniors, children, users
         and operators of public transportation, motorists and movers of commercial goods.
The Circulation Element is correlated with the Land Use Element. As required by Government Code
Section 65302(b), this Element contains information on the general location and extent of existing and
proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes and terminals. State law also requires that a
Circulation Element contain data and policies related to the circulation of water, sewage and storm
drainage, and other public utilities. These components are presented in the Infrastructure Element.
A. Background Information
In the last few decades, the need to improve coordination of land use planning and transportation
decisions has become more apparent. Beginning in the 1950s, and continuing for several decades,
federal, State and local governments devoted billions of dollars to expanding highways and other roads
for the use of motorists. More recently, as opposition to the paving of more and more land for
automobile use has grown, priorities have changed.
Today, circulation is perceived to comprise more than just conventional motorized transportation via
individual cars. It also includes walking, cycling, and public transit, even alternative vehicles such as
electric vehicles. Often called “alternative modes,” a more accurate term would be “sustainable,” since
these transportation modes have the following advantages in comparison to the automobile:
    •    Lower energy consumption.
    •    Reduced materials need for the manufacture of vehicles and creation of roads.
    •    Lessened or no air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
    •    Reduction of spills and leaks of fuels, oils, and solid and hazardous waste by-products, which
         contaminate land, surface water, and groundwater.
    •    Less land allocated for streets, parking, highway interchanges, etc.
    •    Less noise.
    •    Fewer injuries and deaths from vehicular collisions and accidents.
    •    Reduced private costs for operation and maintenance.
Instead of only planning for ways to expand motor vehicle capacity, circulation planning recognizes the
need to also provide a network that is safe and inviting for cyclists and pedestrians. This is particularly
relevant in Calistoga, where the city’s small size and existing pedestrian-friendly environment already
                                                                                                                    CIR-1

encourage non-motorized transportation. Consequently, the Circulation Element includes background
information, goals, objectives, policies and actions related to all transportation modes, with special
attention given to bicycles and pedestrians.
Vehicular Circulation System
As is the case throughout California, most travel in Calistoga occurs in motorized vehicles. This section
discusses the current conditions related to this type of circulation.
Existing Street Network. Calistoga is served primarily by Highway 29 (Lincoln Avenue) in the
north/south direction and Highway 128 (Foothill Boulevard) in the east/west direction. Calistoga is
generally characterized by an interconnected street system with several breaks that discourage cut-
through traffic. Several large streets cross Lincoln Avenue to provide access from residential areas to the
downtown core area. The downtown core area is served by a dense grid street system with a single
traffic signal located at the intersection of Highway 29 and Washington Street.
Calistoga’s street system is relatively well-connected, but there are noticeable gaps in the vehicular
circulation system. There is a lack of connectivity parallel to Lincoln Avenue due to the limited number
of bridges over the Napa River, forcing most motor vehicle traffic generated in the central part of the
city to use Lincoln Avenue through the downtown. There is also a lack of east-west connections
perpendicular to Lincoln Avenue in the northeasterly section of the City.
Level of Service Analysis. To measure and describe the operation of the roadway network, traffic
engineers and planners commonly use a grading system called Level of Service (LOS). The LOS grading
system qualitatively characterizes motor vehicle traffic conditions associated with delay resulting from
varying levels of traffic. These levels range from LOS A, indicating free-flow motor vehicle conditions
with little or no delay experienced by motorists, to LOS F, indicating congested conditions where motor
vehicle flows exceed design capacity. When LOS falls below a particular level, a road segment or
intersection can be considered deficient and in need of improvement.
Table CIR-1 presents LOS analysis for key intersections in the city. Most operate at LOS A and B,
which are good levels of service. However, Highway 29 and Highway 128 are highly-traveled regional
roadways with substantial pass-through traffic and, as a result, have intersections that are operating at
LOS D and E.
Typically, preferred motorized levels of service standards in small towns like Calistoga are LOS C or D.
Caltrans has a statewide policy of LOS C on state highways. However, many cities throughout California
have adopted different standards within their General Plans, particularly because it is not always feasible
or appropriate to maintain this LOS standard in downtown locations.
The segment of Lincoln Avenue in the downtown operates at a low level of service. However, attaining a
higher level would require one or more of the following modifications to the street:
     •    Elimination of on–street parking
     •    Adding protected left turn phasing to the existing traffic signal at Lincoln/Washington
     •    Addition of one or more traffic signals with protected left turn phasing
     •    Creation of left-turn lanes at non-signalized intersections
     •    Relocation of the Highway 29 designation to a bypass to discourage through traffic

Although these measures would improve segment and intersection LOS on Lincoln Avenue, they would
lead to a perceived increase in visual clutter and possible degradation in the attractiveness of downtown
Calistoga for pedestrians and erosion of Calistoga’s small-town qualities. However, these avoidable
characteristics need to be weighed against improved pedestrian and bicyclist safety when taken as a
whole in developing a Complete Street network. The opportunity to walk along a network of streets
lined with interesting shops, trees and other amenities is an integral part of local community character. If
LOS concerns predominate and motor vehicles can travel more swiftly through downtown, the
experience of tourists and residents alike would be worsened.
Downtown’s walkability and attractiveness could be reinforced in part by eliminating the state highway
designation on Lincoln Avenue and rerouting it via Dunaweal Lane to reduce pass-through traffic. This
possible improvement is discussed in greater detail in Section C.
There are some safety concerns on Highway 29 (Lincoln Avenue/Lake County Highway) north of
downtown from Wappo Avenue to Tubbs Lane, for which Caltrans continues to explore solutions. The
recent installation of an all–way stop-controlled intersection at Lincoln Avenue and Silverado Trail has
improved safety tremendously. The City only favors improvements to Highway 29 in this area to

improve safety, and only in conjunction with maintenance of the highway’s rural character, particularly at
its intersection with Silverado Trail.
Truck Traffic. Calistoga has no designated truck routes, although through-truck traffic primarily uses the
state highways. While no traffic destination studies have been carried out, it is quite likely that much of
the truck traffic crossing through town is serving businesses on Lincoln Avenue, the Crystal Geyser plant
on lower Washington Street and other parts of downtown. However, there are also regional pass-
through trips to Lake and Sonoma Counties. Diverting the pass-through truck traffic to Dunaweal Lane
would help to alleviate downtown traffic.
Downtown Parking. The downtown core area provides the majority of the commercial, retail, and office
space in Calistoga. Consequently, parking is a major source of concern for merchants, residents and
visitors. Both parallel and diagonal on-street parking is provided in the downtown commercial core area,
with the majority of parking spaces restricted seasonally to a three-hour time limit.
The current situation has not changed significantly since the last inventory of downtown parking was
done in 1988. That study found 137 on-street parking spaces and 529 off-street parking spaces for a total
of 666 parking spaces in the downtown. Of the 529 off-street parking spaces, 117 were public while 412
parking spaces were private. The study found that current demand for parking spaces often exceeds the
supply, especially during the summer months and on weekends.
The single-highest parking generator in the downtown area is the Cal-Mart supermarket on Lincoln
Avenue. This grocery store has its own private parking lot which is frequently almost fully occupied.
There are also numerous small tourist-oriented uses in the downtown that, collectively, constitute a
second major parking generator. These include approximately 17 restaurants on Lincoln Avenue and
adjacent streets, several spas on Lincoln Avenue and Washington Street, and numerous small
commercial and retail shops.
In the future, increased demand for parking in the downtown is likely to come from increases in tourism,
rather than from substantial new development in this largely built-out area. Although there is a
documented parking shortage during peak visitor periods, the City cannot accommodate increased
parking demand indefinitely. Building large additional parking lots in the downtown would negatively
impact the vibrant, pedestrian-friendly environment that is one of the downtown’s most appealing
qualities.
Downtown Calistoga is a major visitor destination in the Napa Valley and visitors tend to park once and
“roam” from business to business. Provision of municipal parking facilities is the most efficient way to
accommodate this type of visitor demand. Presently, the City charges an in-lieu parking fee to
development projects unable to provide on-site parking, which is used to fund the construction of
municipal parking. The City recently updated its in-lieu parking fee to ensure that it reflects current
construction costs and does not adversely affect downtown businesses and the feasibility of continued
downtown development.
Other current strategies to address parking shortages include the stricter enforcement of time-limited
parking. Three-hour parking zones are currently demarcated along the downtown segment of Lincoln
Avenue and along several blocks of Washington Street.

Transit
The City of Calistoga, along with other
municipalities of Napa County, is part
of the Napa County Transportation
Planning Agency (NCTPA). The
NCTPA serves as the region's
Congestion      Management       Agency,
providing input for the Bay Area-wide
Metropolitan              Transportation
Commission's       20-year      Regional
Transportation Plan for prioritizing
projects and allocating state and federal
transportation funds.
The NCTPA provides bus transit
service from Calistoga through Napa                                 A VINE Bus
Valley communities and as far south as
Vallejo and the Fairfield Transit Center
in Solano County. VINE buses follow a
fixed route along Highway 29 with stops
                                                                                 Brannan
on Foothill Boulevard near Dunaweal
Lane, two locations on Lincoln Avenue
in downtown Calistoga, and Brannan
Street.
Residents must walk from adjacent
neighborhoods to access transit. No
service is provided to parts of the city                                   Foothill
north of Lincoln Avenue, which means
that most of the city is poorly served by
transit.
                                                         Bus Transit Routes in Calistoga
Weekday transit service is provided
approximately from about 6:00 a.m. to
10:00 p.m. with half-hour headways during commute times. Service is less frequent during mid-day and
on Saturdays and Sundays.
In addition to this fixed-route service, the Calistoga Shuttle is a dial-a-ride, door-to-door, handicapped-
accessible bus service that operates within Calistoga’s Planning Area year-round, Mondays through
Saturdays, and on Sunday between May and November. Ridership in 2013 exceeded 26,000 1.

Bicycle Network
Calistoga has relatively few bikeways, and much of
the city is underserved by bicycle paths, lanes or
routes. The City’s Active Transportation Plan
includes goals, objectives, policies and programs
directed at providing a comprehensive and safe
bicycle system, and identifies needed bicycle
improvements and the future layout of the city’s
bicycle facilities. Under the Plan, an extensive
network of bikeways would be created that is
integrated with the Napa Countywide Bicycle Plan
and the Vine Trail that will extend from Vallejo to       Cycling is a Popular Mode of Transportation in Calistoga
Calistoga as part of the Bay Trail.
Implementation of the Active Transportation Plan will also:
     •   Improve suitability of routes to the local schools for children.
     •   Reduce traffic congestion in the downtown core along Lincoln Avenue.
     •   Improve safety and convenience of parking a bicycle in Calistoga.
     •   Encourage tourists to ride bicycles in Calistoga, rather than driving once they get to the city.
     •   Encourage residents to use bicycles for short shopping and commuting trips within city limits.
Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian-oriented streets are a key element of safe, active, and livable commercial and residential areas.
Regardless of the type of adjacent land use, attractive and functional sidewalks with pedestrian amenities
generate activity on the street, enhance the economic vitality of commercial areas, encourage walking,
and improve quality of life.
The pedestrian environment encompasses sidewalks and other pathways. Although most arterials in
Calistoga have sidewalks, most of Foothill Boulevard (Highway 128/29) and Highway 29 north of
Wappo Avenue do not. This is because these roadways are state highways built to rural highway
standards. An encroachment permit from Caltrans is required to construct sidewalks within the State
right-of-way. To avoid conflicts, some properties have constructed sidewalks and multi-use pathways just
outside of the State right-of-way.
Sidewalk connectivity from the downtown core area to surrounding residential neighborhoods is
generally adequate on Washington Street, Berry Street and Fair Way. Other streets have discontinuous
sidewalks and major sidewalk gaps exist. Closing these gaps would improve pedestrian access to the
downtown.
Cross walk safety lighting should be pursued at the following locations due to high volumes of
pedestrian and bicyclist traffic:
     •   Lincoln and Cedar
     •   Lincoln and Brannan
     •   Lincoln and Fairway
                                                                                                              CIR-7

     •   Lincoln and Stevenson Avenue
Street crossings in Calistoga tend to be narrow, which facilitates safe pedestrian movement. However,
there is a need to provide a safe crossing at Highway 29 and Brannan Street, where Lincoln Avenue
widens north of the downtown and vehicles travel at higher speeds and on Foothill Boulevard at Berry
Street, which leads to the elementary school. There is currently no controlled intersection for one mile of
Foothill Boulevard that provides a safe crossing for students who reside on the south side of the
boulevard.
The City should explore traffic calming measures on long straight collector streets to reduce speeds in
residential areas. However, the use of stop signs for speed control should be avoided.
The Active Transportation Plan contains goals, objectives, policies and programs directed at providing a
comprehensive and safe pedestrian system in Calistoga.
B. Street Classifications and Standards
For planning purposes, Calistoga’s streets are divided into four categories: arterials, collectors and local
streets. These modifiers relate to historical factors, roadway design, current circulation patterns and the
amount of motor vehicle traffic carried. Figure CIR-2 maps existing and planned arterials and collectors
in Calistoga.
Arterials
Arterials are major thoroughfares that carry large volumes of motor vehicle traffic at relatively high
speeds. Although Calistoga’s arterials have only two lanes, they usually have left-turn pockets and
limitations on on-street parking to facilitate traffic flow. These arterial streets and any new arterials that
may be added in the south part of town should be the focus for moving traffic through the City.
The Highway 128/Petrified Forest Road intersection has the highest traffic volumes in the entire
Highway 128 corridor due to commuters and trucks traveling to and from Sonoma and Lake Counties.
The State has identified the “T” intersections of Highway 128 with Tubbs Lane, Petrified Forest Road
and Lincoln Avenue as “intersections of concern” due to collision rates with fatalities and/or injuries
than are higher than the statewide average.
Lincoln Avenue in the downtown is an exceptional arterial because it serves both as Calistoga’s “Main
Street” and as a component of the state highway system. Unlike most major thoroughfares, it has on-
street parking and slow traffic speeds.
Collectors
Collectors connect local streets to arterials. They usually provide two travel lanes and may also have
bicycle lanes.
Local Streets
All other streets not listed above are considered local streets. Local streets primarily serve individual
parcels. They should be narrow, have low traffic speeds, and be pleasant environments for walking and
bicycling.

C. Modifications to the Street Network
The City intends to implement a number of modifications and improvements to Calistoga’s street
network to optimize service levels for all modes of transportation. These are described as follows, and
illustrated in Figure CIR-3.
Bypass Improvement
The 2003 General Plan Environmental Impact Report reported that approximately 19 percent of the
traffic on Lincoln Avenue within the Downtown area is passing through Calistoga. The improvement
and redesignation of Dunaweal Lane to serve as a new state route cross-valley bypass, particularly for
trucks and other traffic traveling between Lake County and southern Napa County, would improve the
level of service on Lincoln Avenue, Foothill Boulevard just east of Lincoln Avenue and the intersection
of Lincoln Avenue/Foothill Boulevard. A coordinated planning and design agreement would need to
specify whether the construction cost is the sole responsibility of the City, shared between the County
and City, or the responsibility of the County. If, in the latter case, the roadway segment was adopted as
part of the RTP, construction costs for this portion could be allocated through the regional funding
process. If state highway status is shifted to this route, roadway construction would need to conform to
Caltrans’ highway design standards.
Foothill Boulevard/Lincoln Avenue
Signalization of this intersection is needed due to the high volume of traffic that passes through it.
Widening is needed to provide turn lanes; protected left-turn phasing would be provided on Foothill
Boulevard and split phasing on Lincoln Avenue. Additional lanes needed include left-turn lanes on
eastbound and westbound Foothill Boulevard and southbound Lincoln Avenue, and a right-turn lane on
eastbound Foothill Boulevard.
Silverado Trail/Highway 29
The City and Caltrans are working on improvements for this intersection, including safety improvements
on Lake Street and the realignment of the intersection. No widening is proposed; however, signalization
is appropriate to improve LOS at full build-out.
Brannan Street
Brannan Street, which connects Silverado Trail to Lincoln Avenue, is currently used by many motorists
as a short-cut to avoid the stop sign-controlled intersection further to the west. An action is included
that calls for the City to explore traffic calming measures for Brannan Street.
Foothill Boulevard/Petrified Forest Road
Signalization of this intersection is needed due to the high volume of traffic that passes through it.
Protected left-turn phasing on Foothill Boulevard and split-phasing on Petrified Forest Road would be
provided. Widening to provide a third lane on eastbound Foothill Boulevard to allow separate left-turn,
through, and right-turn lanes is expected to be needed.
Grant Street
CMC Section 12.04.130(C) outlines the ultimate street width for Grant Street, as well as pedestrian and
cyclist improvements for various sections.

Money Lane Extension
If needed in the future to accommodate development on the west side of the city, Money Lane will be
extended to Greenwood Avenue to create a new connection with Lake Street and central Calistoga.
Although the extension is not considered necessary at this time, this Element contains a policy to
prevent development on intervening parcels that might preclude it. The City should prepare an Official
Plan Line for this road segment. This provides the greatest constructive notice to the property owners
that there is an expectation of dedication at the time of development and a set aside is required.
Foothill Boulevard/Berry Street
A dedicated left-turn pocket and acceleration lane is needed on southbound Foothill Boulevard (SR 128)
to accommodate drivers turning into and out of Berry Street. Widening on both sides of the road is
assumed; retaining walls will likely be required on the south side.
Lincoln Avenue/Fair Way
Signalization of this intersection is needed due to high volume of pedestrian traffic, the anticipated Vine
Trail Regional Pathway, the proposed public parking lot and high volume of traffic associated with the
adjacent commercial activity centers. Improvements would include permissive left-turn phasing on both
Lincoln Avenue and Fair Way and minor widening to align the Fair Way approaches.
Abandonment of “Paper Streets”
“Paper streets” consist of lands that are owned by the City, mapped as streets in City records, but have
never been paved or used as streets. These paper streets are mostly a result of the 1871 “Morgan Map”
and are not needed for traffic circulation. As shown in Figure CIR-3, City-owned paper streets in
Calistoga are typically located in parts of the residential area adjacent to downtown, and include a
segment on Gold Street between Myrtle Street and Cedar Street and multiple segments southwest of
Lincoln Avenue State law requires jurisdictions to abandon publicly-owned rights-of-way that will not
foreseeably be used for those intended rights-of-way of other public uses. Abandoning these paper
streets could allow the use the land for housing, parks, or other needed uses, except where they may be
needed for circulation improvements.
D. Key Findings
     1.     The following characteristics of Calistoga’s circulation system found in many parts of the
            community make for a livable city:
            •    A interconnected street system with some breaks that discourage cut-through traffic
            •    Generally slow speeds on residential streets
            •    Pedestrian-scale block sizes and lighting
            •    Street trees and other pedestrian amenities
            •    Narrow street crossings.
     2.     The arterial and collector street system in Calistoga is sufficient to accommodate existing and
            future projected motor vehicle traffic demand with two exceptions:
            •    Foothill Boulevard southeast of Lincoln Avenue
            •    Lincoln Avenue in the downtown.

             Both of the street segments operate at LOS E, nearing the capacity of these two-lane arterials
             and exceeding the Caltrans standard of LOS C.
     3.      Lincoln Avenue serves two purposes. It is Calistoga’s main downtown street, but it is also a
             part of the state highway system. In order to maintain downtown Calistoga’s walkable and
             inviting qualities, it would be preferable to eliminate the Highway 29 designation on Lincoln
             Avenue and reroute through traffic onto Dunaweal Lane.
     4.      There is a lack of connectivity parallel to Lincoln Avenue in the southeast part of the city,
             forcing most motor vehicle traffic generated in the central city to use Lincoln Avenue through
             the downtown.
     5.      Although it has acceptable levels of service, there are safety concerns on Lincoln Avenue
             northwest of downtown, especially for pedestrians crossing the road and vehicular egress from
             residential properties and transient lodging facilities lining the road.
     6.      Caltrans is continuing to explore alternatives for the most appropriate way to improve
             Highway 29 from Lincoln Avenue to Tubbs Lane. The City favors roadway improvements in
             this area for safety only in order to maintain lower speeds.
     7.      Downtown parking is a major concern in Calistoga, since parking can be difficult during peak
             seasonal times. This reinforces the importance of the City's existing in-lieu parking fee to fund
             the construction of small municipal parking lots.
     8.      The regional bus transit system serves Calistoga via stops on Lincoln Avenue and Brannan
             Street, and uses Highway 29 to connect to other cities in the Napa Valley. While Lincoln
             Avenue is centrally located in the downtown, residents must walk from adjacent
             neighborhoods to access transit.
     9.      Calistoga Shuttle provides door-to-door bus service to residents and visitors within the
             Planning Area.
     10.     Overall, the bicycle transportation system provides access to most major destinations and
             regional connections in Calistoga. However, existing segments of Class I pathways, and bicycle
             lanes and bicycle routes on surface streets, including high volume arterials, are not
             interconnected.
     11.     Most of Foothill Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue north of Wappo Avenue do not have
             sidewalks. Collectors and arterials such as Oak Street and Lake Street also lack sidewalks.
             Other streets have discontinuous sidewalks and major sidewalk gaps exist.
     12.     There is a need to provide a safe pedestrian crossing at Highway 29 and Brannan Street, where
             Lincoln Avenue widens north of the downtown and vehicles travel at higher speeds.
             Protection for crossing pedestrians is also needed at the Lincoln Avenue/Cedar Street and
             Lincoln/Fairway intersections.
                                                                                                               CIR-13

E. Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions
 Goal CIR-1         Maintain and enhance Calistoga’s street network to serve existing and
                    planned land uses while also maintaining the community’s small-town
                    character.
Objective CIR-1.1         Develop and maintain Calistoga’s street network of arterials, collectors,
                          primary local and local streets as discussed in Section C of this Circulation
                          Element and shown in Figure CIR-3.
Policies
P1.1-1. Through the Capital Improvements Plan and related impact fees, the City shall ensure that
         adequate funds are provided to upgrade and maintain the existing circulation network.
P1.1-2. As described under Community Identity Element Objective CI-1.2, A.2 the City shall consider
         the revision of City street standards to allow local streets to be narrower while maintaining
         adequate width to meet operational, safety, parking and complete street designation
         requirements.
Actions
A1.1-1. Collect a transportation impact fee from new development to pay for citywide transportation
         improvements.
A1.1-2. Cooperate with landowners to eliminate unnecessary “paper streets,” as appropriate.
A1.1-3. The City shall investigate the need for and feasibility of closing Brannan Street to through traffic,
         or implementing other traffic calming measures in order to prevent or reduce the use of this
         local street for regional through traffic.
Objective CIR-1.2         Maintain acceptable Levels of Service on all of Calistoga’s streets.
Policies
P1.2-1. The City shall seek to maintain LOS C or better for all state highways with the exception of the
         downtown area, and LOS D or better for all other streets.
P1.2-2. The City shall seek to maintain peak hour LOS D or better at all intersection.
P1.2-3. Since Lincoln Avenue is Calistoga’s main street and serves pedestrian and commercial purposes
         as much as it does motorized vehicles, it is inappropriate to establish any LOS standard for
         Lincoln Avenue between Foothill Boulevard and Wappo Avenue. Instead, the City shall evaluate
         traffic on Lincoln Avenue on an on-going basis, seeking to balance vehicular, parking, bicycle
         and pedestrian needs. This exclusion is not applicable to intersections on Lincoln.

6        HOUSING ELEMENT
         The purpose of the Housing Element is to work towards accommodating the city’s housing needs
         while maintaining Calistoga’s rural small-town character and appearance, its sense of community,
         and its natural and historic setting.
A.       Introduction
The State Legislature has established the attainment of a decent home and satisfying living environment for
every California resident as a goal of the highest priority. However, this goal is not just a matter of statewide
concern. Each city and county has an obligation to contribute its part by including a Housing Element as one
of the seven mandatory elements of the General Plan. It is a primary goal of the City to provide safe and
affordable housing 1 for all Calistoga residents and to ensure that adequate housing is planned as the
population expands in the future consistent with available resources.
The purpose of Calistoga’s Housing Element is to provide a long-term, comprehensive plan to address the
housing needs for all economic segments of the community. The Housing Element addresses existing and
projected housing demand and establishes goals, quantifiable objectives, policies and actions to assist the City
in implementing the plan, while also striving to protect its rural small-town character and appearance, sense of
community, and natural and historic setting.
This 2014 Housing Element Update also creates a plan for meeting the City’s share of region-wide housing
need for the planning period between February 1, 2015 and January 31, 2023, as required by state law. It is
organized into several sections. The Introduction summarizes State requirements relating to the Housing
Element, followed by a description of the process used to ensure public involvement in the development of
this Update. The Element also updates various demographic and housing data that characterize the
community’s housing profile, existing housing needs and constraints on the development of housing.
Additionally, the Element provides an updated inventory of approved housing projects and sites for the
development of housing, and identifies housing opportunities and resources. The policy portion of the
Element contains goals, objectives, policies and actions, including “quantified objectives” that translate the
actions into expected numbers of housing units to be produced. The City’s general success in implementing
the actions contained in the 2011 Housing Element is contained in Appendix A, along with recommendations
to maintain, modify or delete its actions in light of its success and changed circumstances.
The most current housing data and population information available were used during the preparation of the
Housing Element, including the 2010 U.S. Census. Unfortunately, the 2010 Census did not include a long
form, which in past years provided valuable information regarding demographic trends. Although American
Community Survey data is available for some topics, it is an ongoing statistical survey that samples a small
percentage of the population every year. Due to the small population of Calistoga, there are very high margins
of error associated with this data and it is less reliable. Census data was supplemented with information from
other sources, such as the California Department of Finance.
1 For the purposes of this Housing Element, “affordable housing” means housing affordable to extremely low-, very low-, low-, or
  moderate-income households, as defined in Health and Safety Code §50052.5.
                                                                                                                           H-1

CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN                                                      2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
Other information sources include a housing stock conditions survey that was conducted during 2010, a 2014
study of the city’s mobilehome parks, a 2014 countywide survey of the homeless and contacts with providers
of special needs housing.
Legal Requirements
The California Government Code requires every city and county in California to include a housing element in
its general plan. Unlike the rest of the general plan, which typically encompasses a 20-year time period,
housing elements are prepared approximately every eight years, following timetables set forth in the law.
According to state law, Calistoga and all other San Francisco Bay Area jurisdictions are mandated to complete
and adopt a housing element covering the period from February 1, 2015 through January 31, 2023.
The housing element must be integrated and consistent with all other elements of the General Plan. All
possible steps in the preparation and review of the 2014 Housing Element Update have been taken to ensure
that there are no conflicts in data, goals, objectives, policies and actions.
State requirements for the information to be included in a housing element are identified throughout this
document in each appropriate section.
Public Participation
State law requires a housing element to be prepared with public participation. Specifically, Government Code
Section 65583(c)(7) requires that the City, “make a diligent effort to achieve public participation of all
economic segments of the community in the development of the Housing Element.”
A public workshop was conducted by staff on August 4, 2014, to provide an overview of the Housing
Element, present the Background Report’s findings and receive public comments on the Report. This
workshop was noticed twice in the two local newspapers and notifications were distributed to local
representatives of local agencies and groups involved in the provision of affordable and special needs
housing, as well as the North Bay Association of Realtors and Building Industry Association Bay Area. The
complete Background Report was also posted on the City’s web site and subscribers were notified. Some of
the comments received during and following the workshop were incorporated into revisions to the
Background Report and the recommended revisions to the current Housing Element’s actions, including an
action that would consider a mobilehome park conversion ordinance.
The Calistoga Planning Commission and City Council conducted noticed public hearings on the draft
Housing Element on September 10, 2014 and October 7, 2014. Notification of the hearings was also given to
local representatives of agencies and groups involved in the provision of affordable and special needs
housing. The City Council accepted the draft Element on October 7, 2014 and directed staff to transmit it to
the California Department of Housing & Community Development (HCD) for review. Following revisions
to the draft Element in response to HCD comments, the final Element was adopted by the City Council on
January 6, 2015 (Resolution No. 2015-3).
Comments were received during the public review period from North Bay Housing Coalition, whose mission
is to address the housing needs of people with development disabilities. Information provided by the
Coalition was incorporated into the Element’s section on Special Needs Housing and Action A4.1-8 was
added to address these needs. Comments were also received from several members of the public on the need
for a mobile home park conversion ordinance, which is reflected in Action A3.1-2.

CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN                                                       2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
Review of the 2011 Housing Element
Government Code Section 65588 requires the City to review its housing element to evaluate: (1) the
effectiveness of the housing element in attaining the community's housing goals and objectives; (2) the
progress that the City has made in implementing housing element programs; and (3) the appropriateness of
the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the attainment of the state housing goal.
Appendix A summarizes the policies and actions that were adopted in the 2011 Housing Element, identifies
the status of their implementation, and assesses whether they were successful in meeting their particular
objectives. Information contained in Appendix A was used in this Update to inform where the City can be
more effective in realizing its housing objectives in the next planning period.
The following are highlights of the City’s accomplishments in implementing its 2011 Housing Element over
the last three years, along with any associated Housing Element objectives and actions:
  •    A CDBG grant was awarded to the City to study the long-term viability of Calistoga mobile home
       parks as affordable housing for low-income households, particularly seniors. The study’s findings and
       recommendations have been incorporated into this Update.
  •    The Rent Stabilization Ordinance for the community’s mobile home parks was reviewed to determine
       its effectiveness and whether amendments were appropriate. (H-2.2/A3)
  •    The Fair Way Manor mobile home park was inspected to identify and correct code violations to
       preserve this affordable housing. The City engaged Fair Housing Napa Valley to provide translation
       services and assistance with the park’s Hispanic occupants. (Objective H-4.1)
  •    The City received a $500,000 HOME grant for the rehabilitation of owner-occupied housing, which
       include energy conservation improvements. (Objective H-4.1, H-8.1/A5)
  •    A 48-unit apartment project targeted to households headed by farmworkers with a maximum income
       of 60% of area median income was approved and is expected to be occupied at the beginning of 2015.
       (H-3.2/A2, H-3.4/A1)
  •    Funding was provided to Napa Valley Fair Housing, Community Action of Napa Valley, Calistoga
       Farmworker Center, UpValley Family Center, Napa City and Napa County Housing Authorities and
       Calistoga Affordable Housing to promote affordable and fair housing for special needs groups, such as
       farmworkers, seniors, the disabled, the homeless and families with female heads of household. (H-
       3.4/A2)
  •    Funding was provided to Rebuilding Calistoga to help low-income seniors maintain and upgrade their
       homes, and conserve energy. Approximately 50 work requests were responded to in 2014. (H-4.1/A2
       and H-8.1/A5)
  •    Single- and multi-family design guidelines were approved. (H-1.4/A1, H-2.2/A1)
  •    An update of the City’s development impact and in-lieu fees was undertaken. (H-2.1/A3, H-3.1/A2, H-
       6.1/A2)
  •    Zoning Code amendments were adopted to revise most of the residential zoning districts to align them
       with the General Plan and promote housing. (H-1.2/A2, H-1.2/A4, H-2.1/A2, H-2.1/A4)
  •    The City initiated participation in the CaliforniaFIRST and California Home Energy Renovation
       Opportunity (HERO) Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Programs, which allow residential
       property owners to finance the installation of energy- and water-efficient improvements, and renewable
       energy projects. (H-8.1/A1)

  •    The City adopted the 2013 California Building Standards Code, which include expansive energy-
       efficiency requirements for remodeled and new residential development and provisions allowing
       rainwater catchments and the reuse of graywater. (H-8.1/A3)
  •    An aggressive water conservation program was initiated, which conserves energy by reducing water
       transportation.
  •    Based on construction that has occurred since January 1, 2007, the City has fully met its Quantified
       Objectives for the current planning period in the Moderate-Income category and has partially met its
       objectives for the other income categories with the exception of the Extremely Low-Income category.

Population Characteristics
Understanding who lives in the community and how the population has grown in the past and is expected to
grow in the future is important to establishing policies for the provision of housing. Calistoga’s historic
population since 1950 is shown in Table H-1. The city’s growth rate has varied significantly over the past 60
years. Between 1970 and 1980, Calistoga experienced its most dramatic increase in population, doubling its
population through the addition of nearly 2,000 new residents. Since then, population growth has slowed
substantially. Between 2000 and 2010, the City’s population actually declined by .7 percent, compared to an
increase of more than 16 percent during the previous decade.

Table H-2 shows the comparative growth for Napa County cities and the unincorporated county area
between 1990 and 2014. Calistoga’s population modestly increased between 2000 and 2014, while St. Helena
and the unincorporated area of Napa County experienced a decline. Yountville had a small gain. Only Napa
and American Canyon posted significant gains in population, the latter more than doubling its population.

Between 2000 and 2010, Calistoga saw an increase in the diversity of its population. As shown in Table H-3,
the percentage of the city’s population who categorize themselves as Hispanic grew from 38.4 percent in 2000
to 49.4 percent in 2010, while the share of non-Hispanic White decreased from 59.1 percent to 47.7 percent.
This is especially significant considering that the latter category represented 73.7 percent of the population in
1990. (The city’s populations in the other ethnic categories are too small to make accurate conclusions on
changes during this period.)

Table H-4 shows that the median age in Calistoga increased from 38.1 years to 40 years between 2000 and
2010. This increase appears attributable to an increase in the proportion of the population between 55 and 65
years of age. Calistoga’s median age is virtually the same as Napa County’s as a whole, but nearly 5 years older
than California’s median of 35.2 years.

Employment Characteristics
Hospitality/food services, retail trade, natural resources and manufacturing (bottled water, wine) have
historically been Calistoga’s core industries. As shown in Table H-6, over the last 20 years, employment in all
of these sectors has declined, with the exception of Hospitality/Food Services, which has grown. During the
same period, there was significant growth in the Professional/Scientific/Administrative Services and
Construction sectors.

Household Income
As shown in the following tables, Calistoga has the lowest median household income in the county (more
than $10,000 less than the next highest city) and the highest poverty rate. Median household income was
virtually unchanged between 2000 and 2011. However, it should be noted that the 2007-2011 survey data is
based on relatively small sample sizes with high margins of error, and should be viewed as estimates rather
than definitive numbers. The significant jump in the city’s poverty rate between 2000 and 2011 appears
especially questionable.

Housing Stock Characteristics
The number of housing units in Calistoga more than doubled between 1960 and 2010, with much of the
growth occurring during the 1970s and 1980s. However, only one unit was added to the city’s housing stock
between 2010 and 2014.

Approximately half of the city’s housing units in 2014 were single-family detached units, while mobile homes
constituted approximately one-quarter of the housing supply. Multi-family dwellings comprised just over 20
percent of the City’s dwelling units. Compared to the county’s and state’s housing unit type distributions,
Calistoga has a substantially higher proportion of mobile homes, and a significantly lower share of multi-
family units than the state.

                     by a common wall, commonly referred to as a townhouse, half-plex, or row house. The
                     shared wall or walls extend from the foundation to the roof with adjoining units to form a
                     property line. Each unit has individual heating and plumbing systems. It is differentiated
                     from a two-plex, in which the units share attic space, and heating and plumbing systems.

Housing Conditions Survey
The City of Calistoga conducted a survey of housing conditions in 2010, using a survey instrument that was a
modified version of a sample survey produced by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development. It was limited to single-family dwellings and multi-family buildings in Calistoga (i.e., mobile
homes were excluded).
The survey was conducted in those neighborhoods of Calistoga constructed primarily before 1970. The
survey area consisted of 576 sites containing a total of 634 housing units, which represented approximately 27
percent of the total housing stock in the city.

Each of the sites area was inspected from the street. Where problems were identified with any one of four
categories - foundation, roofing, siding/stucco and windows - a survey form was completed for the property.
In all, 77 sites had survey forms completed (representing only 4.5 percent of the conventionally-constructed

Figure H-1 shows the neighborhoods surveyed and the location of units with some detectable problem.
It should be noted that only exterior visual inspections were conducted, and it is likely that many of the older
homes are in need of such maintenance as new roofs and heating systems, as well as such energy-saving
measures as insulation, double-pane windows and weather-stripping. These conditions could only be
identified by a thorough on-site inspection. However, the 2007-2011 American Community Survey data
reported that all occupied units in Calistoga had complete plumbing and kitchen facilities, as did the 2000
U.S. Census.
A CDBG-funded housing rehabilitation program administered by the City in the late 1980s and early 1990s
resulted in the rehabilitation of more than 50 dwelling units. The generally well-maintained condition of
surveyed homes is also evidence of an interest in conserving the city’s existing units in the face of limited
housing development. There is also a growing recognition and appreciation for the historic qualities of the
homes in many of Calistoga’s older neighborhoods.
In 2008, the decline in the national, state and local economies and its impacts on home ownership and
affordability resulted in an increase in foreclosures. However, there has been no visible impact on local
residential property conditions as a result of foreclosures. This could be attributed to the relatively few
foreclosures that have occurred in the community, their dispersed locations and the continued maintenance
of the properties by the lenders who assume ownership of these properties.
Long-Term Maintenance
Since housing tends to deteriorate with age, there is a continuing concern about the condition of older
housing in the community. Approximately 60 percent of Calistoga’s housing stock is less than 40 years old, as
shown in Table H-14. This housing is generally expected to be in good condition, given its age.

About 38 percent of the housing stock, however, is over 50 years old. Housing of this age requires a high
degree of maintenance to prevent deterioration, particularly if maintenance has been neglected in the past.
High maintenance costs can be a problem both for lower-income homeowners and for landlords. If the
income of the homeowner or landlord is insufficient to pay the maintenance costs, deterioration of the
housing stock will occur. Currently, only a few homes in Calistoga have deteriorated to such a state that they
need to be demolished or replaced.

Susceptibility to Damage from Natural Events
The three main active earthquake faults in Napa County are capable of producing moderate-sized earthquakes
that would be capable of producing a substantial amount of damage. Mobile homes tend to sustain greater
damage from intense shaking than wood-frame buildings. During an earthquake, the jacks on which a mobile
home is typically placed can tip, causing the coach to fall off some or all of its supports. Although the jacks
may punch holes through the floor of the mobile home, it usually sustains no other substantial damage.
Despite the minimal damage, however, the mobile home becomes uninhabitable, as it must be returned to a
stable foundation and reconnected to utilities.
Although single-family, wood-framed homes are less likely to be deemed uninhabitable, significant damage
can occur from falling hot water heaters, failed cripple walls, falling unreinforced masonry chimneys, and
dislocation of structures from their foundations. Two-story homes with living space over garages are
particularly vulnerable to damage. Similarly, multi-family, wood-framed buildings may have living areas above
parking areas, supported only by posts. The “soft” first story may also be constructed of concrete masonry
unit bearing walls. These designs offer little resistance to lateral seismic forces and buildings with this design
could be severely damaged during a seismic event unless they are reinforced.
Residences in certain area of Calistoga are also susceptible to damage from natural events such as flooding
and wildfires. The Public Safety Element of the General Plan contains policies and programs to minimize
damage from all of these threats.

Housing Occupancy
According to the U.S. Census, approximately 300 of the city’s 2,319 housing units were vacant in 2010, for a
vacancy rate of 12.9 percent. This number is nearly 100 units more than in 2000. There were relatively
significant increases in vacancies in the “for sale,” “for season, recreational or occasional use” and “other
vacant” categories.
The increase in the seasonal/recreational/occasional use category is consistent with the growing trend of the
purchase of Calistoga homes as second homes. The city is within easy driving distance from the San
Francisco Bay Area and offers an affordable means of owning a weekend home in the Napa Valley. Of the
178 single-family homes owned by out-of-town residents, nearly 70 percent reside within a two-hour drive of
Calistoga. The increasing purchase of local residences as second homes and the offering of homes as short-
term vacation rentals reduce the housing stock available to those who wish to permanently reside in the
community.
The reasons for the relatively significant increase in the “other vacant” category is more difficult to identify. A
housing unit is classified as “other vacant” when it does not fit into any other year-round vacant category.
Common reasons a housing unit is labeled “other vacant” is that no one lives in the unit because the owner is
making repairs or renovations, does not want to rent or sell, isusing the unit for storage, or is elderly and
living in a nursing home or with family members.
The vacant units that were reported in the first two categories by the 2010 U.S. Census are for a particular
point in time (i.e., March 2010) and appear to contradict the current very tight housing market in Calistoga.
An Internet search conducted for rentals in March 2014 identified only a few homes and no apartments
available for rent, although several room rentals were available 2.

Housing Tenure
Housing tenure - whether a household owns or rents their home - can be affected by many factors, such as
housing cost, housing type (single-family versus multi-family), housing availability, household income, job
availability, and consumer preference.
The 2010 Census reported that approximately 60 percent of the city’s housing units were owner-occupied, an
ownership level that was lower than the county’s as a whole (65.1 percent), but higher than the state’s (56.9

C.       Existing Housing Needs
Housing Affordability
Housing cost is generally the greatest single expense item for households. For owner households, housing
expenses consist of mortgage and interest payments, insurance, maintenance and property taxes; some
owners may also pay homeowners association dues or a special assessment. The housing cost burden for
recent home purchasers is even greater than that of other homeowners, since the relative cost of
homeownership decreases over time (i.e., long-term owner costs do not adjust to the market value of
housing) and the property tax that has limited increases following the home’s purchase is adjusted upwards
when the property sells.
For renter households, housing expenses generally consist of a security deposit, rent and utilities. Rent levels
can fluctuate over the course of occupancy unless local rent controls are imposed.
A major element of the American dream is a home of one’s own in the neighborhood of one’s choice.
Owning a home is one of the primary ways of accumulating wealth in our society, a form of wealth
acquisition that is especially protected in the U.S. tax code. Homeownership stabilizes housing costs for a
family and protects them from the variations that occur in rental housing. Being a homeowner is also known
to increase people’s feelings of control over their lives and their sense of overall well-being. High rates of
homeownership are believed to strengthen neighborhoods as well, by increasing residents’ stake in the future
of their communities.
Local Housing Prices and Rents
Homes in Calistoga generally command higher prices than much of California, given the city’s desirable
climate; its surroundings of vineyards, world-class wineries, wooded hillsides and the Napa River; its

proximity to the San Francisco Bay Area and a full range of services in nearby communities; and its historic
small-town character.
Local housing prices increased dramatically between 2000 and 2007, from a median sales price of $242,000 to
$810,000. The collapse in the housing market that began in early 2008 and the subsequent financial crisis was
accompanied by equally dramatic reductions in housing prices, to between $300,000 and $500,000 in 2010.
An increase in foreclosures resulted in a tight credit market and wary consumers. There were 25 houses in
some state of foreclosure in Calistoga in April 2010 3. So while housing was more affordable than it had been
in years, qualifying for a mortgage was very challenging.
Housing prices have increased substantially since then – 26.1 percent over the last five years. Figure H-2
shows the median price of homes sales in the Calistoga Area between 2000 and 2014. The median sale price
during the year prior to July 2014 was $505,000 and only four foreclosures were listed in July 2014 4. The
average listing price of mobile and manufactured homes in the community was $93,420 in March 2014 5.
Rental rates for single-family homes in Calistoga during April 2014 ranged from a two-bedroom offered at
$1,850 per month to a house plus furnished guest house for $6,500 per month. A shared room in a house
ranged from $750 to $1,000.

Affordability
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) establishes annual income limits in
various income categories that are used in the administration of its programs. They are based on an Area
Median Income (AMI) figure; Calistoga is included within Napa County’s AMI.
Between 2006 and 2010, approximately 1,070 Calistoga households (more than half of total households) were
considered “lower income,” i.e., had a household income of 80 percent or less of AMI. During this period,
approximately 320 households were considered “extremely low income.” 6

The 2014 HUD income limits for Napa County and its jurisdictions are shown in Table H-18. The limits are
based on an AMI of $86,100 for a four-person household. This table also identifies the maximum monthly
housing cost that households in each income category would bear using a maximum expenditure of 30
percent of income for rent and utilities in the case of a rental unit, or for mortgage, property taxes, insurance
and other costs associated with an ownership unit.
Based on these limits, a moderate-income family of four could not afford the recent median $505,000 sale
price of a single-family home in Calistoga.

Higher-income households may choose to spend greater portions of their income for housing expenses.
However, many low-income households must involuntarily spend a large share of their income on housing.
The State of California considers a lower-income household that pays more than 30 percent of its income for
housing (rent or mortgage payment plus utilities) to be living in unaffordable housing and “overpaying” for
housing. Households that spend 50 percent or more of their income are considered “extremely cost
burdened.”
According to HUD sample data for Calistoga between 2006 and 2010:
     •   40 lower-income owner-occupied households and 160 renter households paid between 30 and 50
         percent of their income for housing, and
     •   255 lower-income owner-occupied households and 50 renter households paid more than 50 percent
         of their income for housing
It should be noted that this survey data is based on relatively small sample sizes with high margins of error,
and should be viewed as estimates rather than definitive numbers.
As shown earlier in Tables H-6 and H-8 above, many of the jobs in Calistoga have salaries within the low-
income range. These include jobs in the service sector, such as restaurant staff, room cleaners, and
groundskeepers; in the retail sector, such as sales clerks; and professional jobs such as teachers and
firefighters. In many cases, even the combined wages of two workers result in a lower-income household.

 Existing Restricted Affordable Housing
In addition to housing that is affordable to lower- and moderate-income households by virtue of
characteristics such as amenities, location, condition and age, there will soon be 173 units (approximately
seven percent of total units) within the city whose long-term affordability to these households is assured

  4 Year rehabilitated and affordability agreement executed
The City has facilitated the development of affordable housing in the past by negotiating development
agreements that required the construction of work-force housing restricted to occupancy by low- and
moderate-income households, such as for the Solage Spa and Resort project. Additionally, 48 apartments
affordable to very low-income farmworker households are under construction and expected to be completed
during the current planning period, which will increase the share of restricted affordable units to
approximately seven percent of the total housing stock.
Mobile home parks
However, the 556 mobile homes located in the city’s four mobile home parks represent an important supply
of affordable housing. Most home prices range from the low $60,000s to less than $200,000; average space
rents range from $300 to $575. In order to help preserve this affordable housing, the City created a “Mobile
Home Park” Zoning District in 2007 and applied the zone to all of the parks to help protect the City's
existing local mobile home parks and residences from economic forces that may result in the transition or
removal of this affordable stock of housing to other uses or more conventional housing types.

Additionally, the Mobile Home Rent Stabilization Ordinance controls rent increases for mobile homes. This
is particularly important in consideration of the fact that this affordable housing type is largely occupied by
senior citizens and others on fixed and limited incomes. The City has incurred more than $185,000 in legal
fees defending the ordinance.
Calistoga is one of the few jurisdictions that have assumed responsibility for issuing certain mobile home
building permits and inspecting its mobile home parks. These duties were assumed in order to provide local
service to residents and minimize their need to deal with the State. Since 1964, the City has issued building
permits for the installation of mobile homes in parks and all exterior improvements to mobile homes,
including such items as stairs, lifts, decks and carports. It also inspects one of the parks every year to identify
and address code violations. The City also collects and remits the annual permit to operate fees to the State.
State law provides various protections for mobile home park residents in the event of a proposed conversion
to resident ownership (Govt. Code Sections 66427.4 and 66427.5) or the closure or conversion of a park to
another use (Sections 65863.7 and 65863.8). The latter sections require the entity proposing the change in use
to file a report on the impact of the conversion, closure or cessation of use upon the displaced residents,
including the availability of adequate replacement housing in other mobile home parks and relocation costs.
The City Council may require, as a condition of the change, that the entity take steps to mitigate any adverse
impacts on the ability of displaced residents to find adequate housing in another mobile home park. The
conversion of a mobile home park to another use would require the approval of a zone change by the
Council following a public hearing. An amendment to the Calistoga General Plan Land Use Map would also
be required if the proposed new use was inconsistent with the Medium Density Residential land use
designation that applies to all of the parks.
Overcrowding
Overcrowding is typically defined as a household with more than one household member per room, based on
the Census Bureau’s definition of room (which excludes bathrooms, porches, balconies, foyers, halls and half-
rooms). “Severe overcrowding” occurs when there are more than 1.5 household members per room.
Calistoga’s average household size in 2014 was estimated at 2.56 persons per household, which is less than
the countywide average of 2.73 persons and significantly less than the statewide average of 2.95 persons 7.
However, overcrowding can result when there are not enough adequately-sized units within a community, or
when high housing costs relative to income force individuals or families to share housing. Overcrowding can
be a particular problem in Calistoga during the summer and harvest season, when the community experiences
an influx of seasonal farmworkers. Overcrowding can accelerate deterioration of the housing stock.
Table H-21 provides information on overcrowding according to HUD sample data for Calistoga between
2006-2010. It should be noted that this survey data is based on relatively small sample sizes with high margins
of error, and should be viewed as estimates rather than definitive numbers.
According to these estimates, overcrowded households comprised approximately three percent of total
households, while approximately four percent of households were classified as severely overcrowded. The
disproportionate impact on renter households emphasizes the need to establish priority in policies and
programs to expand housing types and proactively assist in the development of affordable rental housing.

Special Housing Needs
State law requires the Housing Element to assess concerns related to the housing needs of special needs
population groups, including persons with disabilities, seniors, farmworkers, and large families. Subsequent
sections of the Housing Element explain how Calistoga will work to address the specific needs outlined here.
Disabled Housing Needs
Disabilities may affect a person’s housing needs in several ways. A mobility or self-care limitation may
require physical modifications to the home to accommodate the disability. A work disability may limit a
person’s ability to afford adequate housing. Some people with disabilities may require special housing
arrangements, such as group homes, to provide adequate care and support.
The 2010 Census does not include data related to disabilities and ACS data is not available for geographies
with a population that is less than 20,000. Therefore, the data in this section is primarily based on the 2000
Census.
Table H-22 provides statistics on the type of disabilities present in the population of Calistoga and the total
number of disabled persons by age in Calistoga in 2000. Some Calistoga residents have more than one type of
disability. For a condition to be considered a disability, it must have a duration of six months or longer.

The U.S. Census defines disabilities based on the following criteria.
     •    Sensory disabilities include blindness, deafness, or severe hearing or vision impairments.
     •    A physical disability is a condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical activities, such
          as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying.

     •    A mental disability is a physical, mental or emotional condition that makes it difficult to learn,
          remember, or concentrate.
     •    A self-care disability is a physical, mental or emotional condition that makes it difficult to dress,
          bathe, or get around inside the home.
     •    A go-outside-home disability is a physical, mental or emotional condition that makes it difficult to
          leave the home alone to shop or go to the doctor’s office.
     •    An employment disability is a physical, mental or emotional condition that makes it difficult to work
          at a job or business.
According to 2000 Census data, disabilities are more common among the elderly population. Twenty-four
percent of seniors (168 people) had some form of disability, compared to only 14 percent for people 16 to 64
years old.
There are an estimated 55 individuals with developmental disabilities in Calistoga 8. A person with a
“developmental disability” is defined as a disability that develops before a person reaches adulthood and is
usually expected to continue indefinitely after age 18. Examples include intellectual disabilities/mental
retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy and autism. Persons with development disabilities are often faced with
financial hardships when searching for stable, long-term and independent housing due to low income and
limited financial assistance.
Appropriate housing for some of Calistoga’s disabled population would include affordable units in large
group home settings and supervised care facilities. Residential care facilities are allowed in all of Calistoga’s
residential zoning districts. Encouraging housing providers to set aside a portion of new affordable housing
units for persons with disabilities would also help address this need.
Seniors
A large proportion of Calistoga residents are seniors. Nearly 19 percent of Calistoga’s population was over 65
years of age in 2010, compared to 15 percent for Napa County as a whole and 11 percent for the State. This
share is approaching the 22 percent of the population that ABAG expects to be 65 years of age and older
within the Bay Area region by 2040 9.
According to the 2000 Census 10, the majority of seniors in Calistoga lived in family households, defined as
two or more persons related by blood or marriage. However, 63 percent of non-family households was made
up of women living alone, while men living alone comprised only 18 percent. Approximately six percent of
the senior population lived in group quarters, and the remainder lived in non-family households with non-
relatives. In 2014, there were two senior care homes in Calistoga, one with a capacity of 10 residents and the
other with a capacity for six.
In 2000, over half of Calistoga’s senior homeowners lived in mobile homes, three-quarters of which were
occupied by householders over the age of 65. Mobile home parks provide an opportunity for seniors with low
or fixed incomes to own their own houses. An overwhelming share of senior households in 2010 owned their
homes - more than 86 percent – compared to 58 percent of younger households.

Some elderly homeowners are not physically or financially able to maintain their homes. While younger
homeowners can usually perform routine home repairs themselves, elderly homeowners are often too frail to
do so and must rely on others for assistance. They may also not be able to afford modifications that are
needed to ensure their safety and improve their mobility, such as grab bars and ramps. The Study of the Long-
Term Viability of Calistoga Mobilehome Parks as Affordable Housing 11 includes a survey conducted of the city’s
mobile home parks in October 2013, most of which are occupied by seniors. Thirty-seven percent of
respondents reported that their homes need substantial repairs. Younger homeowners may be more willing to
move out of a home if they no longer consider its features adequate. Elderly people are often less willing to
move, despite the physical condition of their homes. Most often the home is paid for, so it is more cost
effective to stay in the home.
Seniors often have fixed and limited incomes. According to the 2000 Census, more than 11 percent of
persons over the age of 65 in Calistoga were below the poverty level. Seniors with low incomes have
particular difficulty affording housing, especially in a market with high house prices and rents, as in Calistoga.
The 2013 mobile home parks survey reported that 82 percent of respondents from the senior parks were
classified as lower-income, with 29 percent of the households in the extremely low income category and 31
percent in the very low category. For 19 percent of the residents, Social Security benefits were their only
income source and 43 percent reported savings of $5,000 or less. Forty-two percent of the households were
spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing expenses and 13 percent of these were spending
more than one-half of their incomes on housing.
Residents with fixed incomes (with limited annual increases), such as Social Security and pensions based on
changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), can find it difficult to afford to pay increases in mobile home
park space rent, especially when the rent increases exceed the Social Security cost of living increases or change
in CPI. Thirty-nine percent of the senior park residents who responded to the survey reported that increases
in space rent caused them to change their spending.
According to the Housing Authority, 13 park residents are currently receiving assistance under the Section 8
Voucher Program. Under this program, participants pay no more than 30 percent of their income for their
housing expenses while the Housing Authority pays the balance, up to $520 for a mobile home. This is less
than five percent of the residents who would likely qualify for the program. However, at this time there is
little chance of additional residents participating. No applications are being taken, as the waiting list has been
closed due to its size.

The Chateau Calistoga and Rancho de Calistoga park owners allow qualifying tenants to defer the rent for all
or portions of their rental obligation that exceed 30 percent of the monthly income of all the persons residing
at the space. Payment of the rent is deferred until the termination of the lease or the sale of the unit.
The UpValley Family Center has an emergency fund that it uses to provide temporary financial assistance to
seniors. In the past, the fund has provided one-time assistance for seniors unable to pay their space rent. Fair
Housing Napa Valley works with mobilehome residents and park owners in the county and at times has been
able to negotiate modifications in rent payments for residents unable to pay.
Due to the large proportion of single-person senior households, there may be a shortage of appropriately-
sized units, and available units may need to be modified for elderly residents with disabilities. The 2013 survey
reported that 40 percent of households in the senior mobile home parks had a disabled member.
The survey also reported that 44 percent of the respondents at the senior parks were 80 years or older and an
additional 23 percent were 70 to 79 years old. There is a concern that a number of these residents may not be
able to continue to live in their mobile homes because of physical limitations or the need for additional
services. Because there are almost no opportunities for these residents to relocate in Calistoga, they will have
to look elsewhere for replacement housing. This could be a hardship, especially for residents who have lived
in the parks for many years.
Farmworkers
Farmworkers are generally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through agricultural labor
and are commonly categorized into three groups: 1) permanent, 2) seasonal and 3) migrant. Permanent
farmworkers are typically employed year-round by the same employer. A seasonal farmworker works on
average less than 150 days per year and earns at least half of their earned income from farm work. Migrant
farmworkers are seasonal farmworkers who have to travel to do the farm work so that they are unable to
return to their permanent residence within the same day.
The 2012 Napa County Farmworker Housing Needs Assessment 12 provides a comprehensive housing needs
assessment of workers employed in the county’s agriculture sector. A focal point of the farmworker housing
study was a survey of 350 local farmworkers, which took place between June and October 2012. In addition,
this report provides findings from background industry analysis, including information acquired through
published data sources, a review of research published by others, interviews with over 20 stakeholders
familiar with farmworker housing conditions in Napa, and a survey of agricultural employers who operate in
Napa County. Findings and recommendations from the assessment are summarized below.
Data from the California Employment Development Department indicate that agricultural employers located
in Napa hire approximately 5,000 farmworkers on average every year, not counting farmworkers employed
informally or those who work for labor contractors based outside of the County. Since these unreported
farmworkers are most likely to supplement the existing workforce during peak suckering and harvesting
seasons, it is likely that farmworker employment during peak seasons exceeds the EDD estimates of 7,000
peak season workers on average. As noted in Table H-6 above, an estimated 234 Calistoga residents are
employed in an agricultural occupation, although there are very few agricultural operations within the city
limits. Light agricultural uses and wineries are allowed in the Rural Residential Zoning District, which is
generally located along the western edge of the city limits.

Farmworker Employment and Income
Approximately 40 percent of the Napa County agricultural workforce is employed full time, 15 percent is
part-time, and the remaining 45 percent is migrant. 13 There are also fewer truly migrant farmworkers, who
follow the crops and do not have a permanent place of residence at all. More common is the trend of residing
permanently in adjacent counties or in the Central Valley, and either commuting to work in Napa on a daily
basis, or residing in temporary accommodations within the County during peak season and returning to the
permanent place of residence following the completion of the harvest. It is estimated that at present
between50 and 80 percent of Napa County’s farm labor force has a permanent place of residence outside of
Napa County but within California. The shortage of housing affordable to moderate-, low-, very low-, and
extremely low-income households makes it difficult for farmworkers to live in the Napa County, prompting
many to commute in to their jobs from less expensive areas in neighboring counties or in the Central Valley
Napa County farmworker employers reported average hourly wages of $12 for laborers, $17 for foremen, $23
for supervisors, and $35 for vineyard managers. Napa vineyard workers are more likely to be employed full
time than agricultural workers elsewhere.
According to the 2007 farmworker survey conducted by the California Institute for Rural Studies,
farmworkers’ average annual income is $15,745 for general laborers, $26,317 for specialized laborers, and
$37,000 for foremen or supervisors. These income levels rise slightly when taking into account other working
members of farmworker households, giving general laborers, specialized laborers, and foreman or
supervisors’ average household incomes of $19,122, $33,268, and $50,294, respectively.
Farmworker Housing Types and Costs
As a result of the current immigration situation and increased demand for year-round farm labor, an
increasing number of farmworkers are choosing to reside in Napa County on a permanent or semi-permanent
basis. This not only increases the need for local, affordable farmworker housing, but introduces issues related
to housing household types other than single adult men. Farmworkers are no longer merely looking for a
temporary bed, but rather are in need of family housing and all the services and neighborhood amenities
associated with raising families and being permanent members of the community within Napa County.
Based on 2014 income levels published by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development, median-priced rental housing in Napa County is not affordable to extremely low- and very
low-income households, although it is affordable to low-income households. The rental market is limited and
is focused on one- and two-bedroom units, with few apartments available to larger households and therefore
few locations that would support larger farmworker households with more income earners. Given the
significant shortage of market-rate rental units that are affordable to households earning farmworker incomes,
demand for subsidized rental housing also far exceeds supply. Farmworker households are not likely to be
able to afford to buy a market-rate home in Napa County, even with a supervisor’s salary.
Approximately 45 percent of farmworkers living in Napa County who rent their housing have housing cost
burdens of greater than 30 percent. Approximately 18 percent who rent their housing pay more than 50
percent of their income towards housing. Among farmworkers who own their housing in Napa County, 40
percent reported paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing and just under 16 percent reported
paying more than 50 percent of their income for housing. These likely represent conservative estimates of the
proportion of farmworkers overpaying or severely overpaying for rental housing in Napa County.

Farmworkers living in market-rate housing are also likely to experience overcrowding. In order for most
market rate residences to be affordable on a farmworker’s income, it would be necessary for two or more
families to share a house or apartment intended for single-family occupancy. A consequence of families
sharing an apartment or house is that overcrowding becomes a financial necessity.
Large Families
Large family households are defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as households comprised of five or more
persons. Large families face an above-average level of difficulty in locating adequately-sized, affordable
housing due to the limited supply of large units. Very few rental projects offer three- or four-bedroom units.
Even when larger units are available, the cost is higher than that of smaller units, and large families with low
incomes may not be able to afford units of sufficient size, particularly in multi-family housing where the units
are typically smaller.
In 2010, only 11.5 percent of Calistoga were classified as large households, compared to 13.4 percent for
Napa County as a whole, and their median household income was estimated to be significantly higher than
the City’s median income 14. A significantly higher percentage of large households lived in rental housing than
ownership housing (18 percent vs. 6.8 percent).

Families with Female Heads of Households
Single-parent households, particularly female-headed households, generally have lower incomes and higher
living expenses, often making the search for affordable, decent and safe housing more difficult. In 2010, 15.6
percent (189) of family households in Calistoga were headed by females. Of these, 63 percent (119) had
children under 18 years of age. Given the small number of families with female heads of households, no
special policies or actions in this regard are needed.
Homeless Families and Persons
Families and persons in need of transitional and supportive housing or emergency shelter include those who
are without homes as well as those who are temporarily displaced from their homes due to abuse, evictions or
natural disasters. It is difficult to measure the numbers of people in these categories since the situation is
often temporary, and those without homes relocate frequently in search of jobs or housing.

The needs of those using available transitional and supportive housing services and emergency shelter
services can vary from basic shelter to development of skills for becoming self-sufficient and/or maintaining
and obtaining permanent housing.
According to the Calistoga Police Department, up to two homeless persons regularly reside in Calistoga.
While the City has worked successfully in partnership with the UpValley Family Center to house other
homeless persons, these one or two persons are chronically homeless. During harvest season, there is a
noticeable increase in the number of persons camping in public areas. This number is estimated at 15 to 20
persons.
The results of a point-in-time count of homeless individuals conducted throughout Napa County on January
29, 2014 are summarized in Tables H-25 and H-26. Of the 285 total homeless person identified by the survey,
73 were chronically-homeless individuals; 42 of these were unsheltered. No chronically-homeless families
were found.

Extremely Low Income Households, Overpayment, and Overcrowding
Households with extremely low income have a variety of housing situations and needs. For example, most
families and individuals receiving public assistance, such as social security or disability, are considered
extremely low-income households.
According to the 2000 Census, approximately 257 extremely low-income households resided in the City,
representing 12.6 percent of total households and 47.3 percent of very low-income households.
Approximately half (54.5 percent) of extremely low-income households were homeowners and experienced a
high incidence of housing problems. For example, over three-quarters of extremely low income homeowner
households faced housing problems (defined as cost burden greater than 30 percent of income and/or

overcrowding and/or without complete kitchen or plumbing facilities). Even further, 40.7 percent of
extremely low-income homeowner households paid more than 50 percent of their income toward housing
costs. Some extremely low-income households could have mental or other disabilities and special needs.

Projected Population Growth
As the regional council of governments for the San Francisco Bay Area, the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG) makes projections for increases in population and the number of households for each
jurisdiction in the nine-county Bay Area. Projections 2013 is the most recent in ABAG’s series of demographic,
economic and land use changes in coming decades. The projections outlined in Projections 2013 cover the
period from 2010 through 2040. Based on the economic composition of the Bay Area and expected growth
nationwide, the region is projected to add approximately 1.1. million jobs between 2010 and 2040. Through
2040, the Bay Area would need over 2.1 million more people to provide a labor force large enough to avoid
an increased rate of in-commuting from jurisdictions beyond the nine counties.
As shown in Table H-27, ABAG expects Calistoga’s population to grow to 5,600 by 2040, an increase of less
than 500 persons, with a very modest growth rate between 2010 and 2040. Total population growth during
this time is projected to be 8.6 percent – which translates into an average annual growth rate of just 0.29
percent per year.

Projections developed by the City for use in a recent development impact fee study anticipate as many as 754
additional residents within the next 20 years, representing a 14 percent increase, which is significantly higher
than ABAG’s projections. These projections assume the potential construction of up to 305 dwelling units
during the period, an estimate based on the possible development of vacation properties. It should be noted
that the economy and market forces will determine whether this development actually occurs and when.
Projected Job Growth
Table H-28 shows that ABAG expects total jobs in Calistoga to increase by 420 by 2040. On an annualized
basis, the projected increase in job growth can be accommodated within the limitations imposed on non-
residential development under the City’s Growth Management Ordinance.

Projections developed by the City for use in a recent development impact fee study 15 anticipate as many as
1,300 additional jobs within the next 20 years, representing a 58 percent increase, which is significantly higher
than ABAG’s projections. Most of the job growth is expected to be generated by new tourist
accommodations and other commercial development such as restaurants. Actual employment growth will
depend on a wide range of factors, including broader economic cycles.
The study includes the following findings regarding the associated anticipated increase in affordable housing
demand as a result of this job growth.
          Calistoga’s historic market orientation towards single-family ownership has resulted in [the] limited
          availability of multifamily housing. Local workers compete for a limited housing supply with retirees who may
          have built substantial equity in their prior homes or higher income households who have more flexibility
          regarding where they choose to live. As a result of this type of demand on the City’s housing supply, it will be
          difficult for new lower wage workers to find suitable housing in the City without a program designed to bring
          the cost of housing down to an affordable range.
Based on assumptions regarding the average number of workers per working households in Calistoga and
average household size, the study concluded that restaurants and wineries are expected to generate the most
significant numbers of households below 65 percent of the area’s median income level, while tourist
accommodations and commercial uses will also generate substantial numbers of households in the 65 to 80
percent of area median income bracket. Many commercial jobs will be in the retail sector, where wages are
below those in other commercial land use sectors (such as office and light industrial).
The study estimated that nearly six households are formed for every ten new employees and could result in
the following housing demand shown in Table H-29.
Some of these jobs will be filled by current residents or by workers who do not desire to reside in Calistoga.
However, if all of the potential development actually occurs, there will be a significant demand for low-
income housing, which will likely take the form of apartments.

CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN                                                        2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
Regional Housing Needs Allocation
State law provides a process for determining each local jurisdiction's fair share of future housing needs, called
the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). The process begins with the State Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD) assigning each regional council of governments a needed number of
new housing units for that region. For the planning period of 2015 through 2022 16, HCD has assigned a total
need of 187,990 new housing units to the nine-county Bay Area.
ABAG has the responsibility of determining the “fair share” of regional housing need that should be assigned
to each city and county in the region. Following extensive discussions and collaboration with Bay Area
jurisdictions, ABAG has determined that Calistoga’s share of the Bay Area housing need for the planning
period is 27 units.
Table H-30 identifies the RHNA for new construction in Calistoga during the planning period which is
distributed among income categories to ensure that each jurisdiction in the Bay Area plans for housing for
households of every income, adjusted to include its need for extremely low-income housing. State law
requires that the City determine the subset of the very low-income regional need that constitutes the
community’s need for extremely low-income housing. Local governments can either identify their own
methodology for calculating the need or presume that the need is 50 percent of the total very low-income
need. (The City of Calistoga has chosen the latter method to estimate its extremely low-income need.)

Table H-31 shows the regional housing needs allocation for all Napa County jurisdictions, divided among
four household income levels. The preponderance of units were allocated to the cities of American Canyon
and Napa, which include designated Priority Development Areas that are near high levels of transit service
and where a large number of jobs are projected. Other considerations in determining the allocations include
directing affordable housing to locations with higher numbers of existing jobs, avoiding the over-
concentration of poverty and assigning jurisdictions at least 40 percent of their expected household growth.

E.        H ousing Opportunities and Resources
Existing Housing Programs
A variety of housing programs are offered by governmental and nonprofit agencies that assist in the
provision, rehabilitation and retention of housing, primarily for lower to moderate-income households.
Additionally, there are a large number of private developers who can assist in providing affordable housing in
Calistoga.
Housing Authority Services
The City has long received support services from the Housing Authority of the City of Napa (HACN),
including affordable housing policy and development assistance, and direct services related to affordable
housing contract monitoring and grant application assistance.
In addition, HACN oversees Section 8 Housing vouchers, which includes 20 participants from Calistoga.
Other housing services provided by HACN include income verification and loan document preparation for
the City’s Down Payment Assistance Program and any subordination requests associated with existing deed
restricted for-sale affordable housing units.
HACN Recently worked with the City to secure a $500,000 HOME grant to establish an owner-occupied
housing rehabilitation program.
Disabled Housing Resources
The City’s Zoning Code allows supportive and transitional housing, and limited residential care by right in the
R-1, R-2 and R-3 zoning districts, and general residential care in these districts with a conditional use permit.
Convalescent and senior care facilities are allowed with a use permit in the Community Commercial Zoning
District.
Chapter 17.60 of the Calistoga Zoning Code allows the Planning and Building Director to approve requests
for reasonable accommodation made by any disabled person when the application of a zoning law or other
land use regulation, policy or practice acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. A request for reasonable
accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting,

CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN                                                       2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and
provide a disabled person equal opportunity to housing of their choice. A nominal processing fee is charged
for these requests.
The City has also adopted a Universal Design Policy stating that accessible design features shall be
incorporated into newly-constructed and substantially-rehabilitated single-family and duplex residences to the
maximum feasible extent. To implement this policy, housing designers and contractors are required to
incorporate as many accessibility features into their plans for newly-constructed and substantially-rehabilitated
single-family and duplex residences as is feasible. Builders of new for-sale homes must provide a checklist of
available universal accessibility features to the home buyer.
The City provides funding to housing rehabilitation programs such as Rebuilding Calistoga, which has
provided assistance to lower-income disabled homeowners with accessibility improvements. Napa County
provides support services for low-income blind, disabled, and elderly adults through its In-Home Supportive
Services program. Fourteen disabled persons received the Section 8 housing assistance described above.
Senior Services
The Area Agency on Aging and Napa County work together to make services and resources, including those
related to housing, accessible to seniors. A County eligibility worker visits the UpValley Family Center weekly
and is available to help seniors determine if they are eligible for various programs and assist with application
paperwork. The Family Center has also provided one-time assistance for seniors unable to pay their space
rent. The Napa Valley Volunteer Center provides volunteer companions, transportation, and home repairs
for seniors. The Calistoga Senior Association is also active in the community.
The Chateau Calistoga and Rancho de Calistoga senior mobile home park owners have a rent deferral
program under which qualifying tenants may obtain a rent deferral for all or portions of their rental obligation
that exceed 30 percent of the monthly income of all the persons residing at the space. Between the two parks,
20 tenants were receiving this form of assistance in 2014. Fair Housing Napa Valley at times has been able to
negotiate modifications in rent payments for park residents unable to pay.
As discussed previously, the City has adopted a Mobile Home Rent Stabilization Ordinance, which controls
rent increases for mobile homes that are largely occupied by senior citizens and others on fixed and limited
incomes. The City has incurred more than $185,000 in legal fees defending the ordinance.
The City also provides funding to Rebuilding Calistoga, which focuses on housing rehabilitation for lower-
income seniors and assists them with needed health and safety repairs that they are unable to afford.
Farmworker Housing Services
The California Human Development Corporation (CHDC) manages three farmworker housing centers in
Napa County (Calistoga, Mondavi and River Ranch) that are designed to serve the short-term housing needs
of unaccompanied male residents during peak agricultural seasons. Residents tend to be employed by labor
contractors and occupy beds for five days during the week, returning home to their families elsewhere in
Northern California on the weekend. The dormitory-style housing in each center has 60 beds (30 rooms with
2 beds each), for a total of 180 beds. None of the centers are open year round; each is closed for portions of
the period from November to February, when the demand for labor goes down. However, the months
during which they close are staggered, such that at least one of the centers is open during any given month of
the year. On average, between 2007 and 2012, the Calistoga Center has been closed for 52 days per year.
                                                                                                            H-33

In addition to the three CHDC centers, there are seven licensed farmworker housing facilities that provide an
estimated 130 beds. One of these, with 24 beds, is located in close proximity to Calistoga.
The City has amended the Growth Management System to give preference to special needs housing projects,
including those for farmworkers, has amended the definition of “one-family dwelling” in the Zoning Code to
includes employee housing for six or fewer persons as provided by California Health and Safety Code Section
17021.5, and has consented to the inclusion of planted vineyard acreage within the city limits in a County
assessment area to acquire, construct, lease and maintain farmworker housing.
In 2013, the City approved the 48-unit Calistoga Family Apartments project that is targeted to very low- and
low-income farmworker households. Expected to be occupied at the beginning of 2015, it will include one-,
two- and three-bedroom units, laundry facilities, clubhouse, community building with a kitchen and computer
room, two playgrounds, barbeque area and on-site vehicle and bicycle parking. The project is located adjacent
to the Napa River and Logvy Community Park, which includes a swimming pool and playfields, and is within
walking distance to all of the community’s schools. It is also within close proximity to the downtown and bus
transit. Processing of the project’s use permit, design review and variance applications was expedited by City
staff, and the project was approved at a single public hearing by the Calistoga Planning Commission. The
project is funded in part by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Section 514/516 Farm Labor Housing
Program.
Homeless Services
The UpValley Family Center provides both a venue for outreach and an opportunity for the Napa County
Health and Human Services to have a local presence in coordinating the delivery of homeless services in
Calistoga. Among its services, the County is able to provide occasional transportation for homeless
individuals who would benefit from services at either the Hope Center or the South Napa Shelter, thereby
relieving the Police Department from having to make these trips. The local interaction between the Human
Services' counselor and members of the Police Department also improves the delivery of services.
Napa County residents who become or are at risk of becoming homeless are fortunate to have access to
extensive local support resources.
Napa County Health and Human Services operates the Hope Resource Center, a weekday drop-in center in
downtown Napa. The Hope Center is the axis of the shelter system; this is the facility where homeless
services start and where during the day referrals are handled for individuals who need shelter or other basic
services. Its main mission is outreach to the "hard to serve" homeless, i.e., the truly down-and-out, including
drug and alcohol abusers who have a hard time abiding by any rules. It provides washers, dryers and showers,
and access to resources.
Under contract with the County of Napa, Community Action of Napa Valley (CANV), a non-profit
organization, operates three homeless shelters and one emergency shelter, all based within the City of Napa,
approximately 25 miles south of Calistoga.
     •    The Samaritan Family Center is an entry point to services for homeless families. Emergency shelter is
          offered along with coaching and case management to assist families in becoming financially self
          sufficient and sustainably housed.
     •    The South Napa Shelter is a facility for clean and sober individuals 18 and older. The facility
          provides coaching and assistance to help its guests increase their income and secure sustainable
          housing.

CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN                                                         2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
     •    The Emergency Winter Shelter is open from mid-November through mid-April. Each year, people
          move from the facility into other shelters and eventually sustainable housing. All guests must be
          referred through the Hope Center (see below).
CANV also offers long- and short-term assistance to help families and individuals avoid homelessness by
maintaining the housing they currently have. Funds may be available for rental deposits, lapsed rent, utilities
and shallow on-going rental subsidy. If authorized, those payments are paid directly to the landlord or
vendor. Its Rapid Rehousing program helps homeless households move into and maintain sustainable
housing. Rental subsidies may be available while intense case management helps to keep the households
housed. CANV estimates that it provided services for twelve Calistogans during the last year. The City
provides annual funding to CANV to support its services.
Recently-opened Hartle Court Apartments, operated in Napa by the Progress Foundation, offers 18 single-
bedroom apartments and six two-bedroom apartments to those transitioning from homelessness or foster
care. To qualify to live in one of the two-bedroom units, one must between the ages of 18 and 25 and just
leaving the foster care system. These apartments will serve as transitional housing, so tenants may stay up to
two years. The single-bedroom units are permanent housing for people ages 18 and older and can be rented
to anyone who is low-income, homeless and has a psychiatric disability. All the ground-level units are
adaptable to people with physical disabilities. Residents will not pay more than 30 percent of their income to
live at the apartments and will receive continued assistance from support professionals.
To facilitate the provision of transitional and supportive housing services within Calistoga, the Zoning Code
treats transitional and supportive housing as residential uses subject to the same permitting processes and
without undue special regulatory requirements, consistent with Government Code Section 65583(a)(5). The
Calistoga Zoning Code also allows emergency shelters without a use permit or other discretionary action in
the Community Commercial (CC) Zoning District (consistent with Government Code Section 65583(a)(4)),
except that an administrative use permit is required if it is located within a General Plan-designated entry
corridor in order to ensure that the design of development is consistent with the rural, small town qualities of
the city. The CC Zoning District is generally located in areas where transit service exists and where basic
necessities can be purchased. There are 16 vacant sites within the CC Zoning District that could
accommodate development of an emergency shelter. These sites range from 5,000 square feet to over 5
acres. The City’s Growth Management System exempts projects sponsored by public and non-profit
organizations that provide medical, dental, social services and the like for residents of Calistoga. An
emergency shelter is a land use that would be considered exempt from the City’s Growth Management
System regulations under this provision.
Fair Housing Services
The City supports fair access to housing for all persons without regard to race, color, religion, sex, marital
status, national origin, or ancestry. The City contracts with Fair Housing of Napa Valley, a private 501(c)(3)
non-profit corporation dedicated to promoting and developing fairness and equality of housing opportunity
for all people, to assist on local issues related to rental housing and tenant rights, housing discrimination and
fair housing advocacy. Fair Housing’s goal is to eliminate housing discrimination and ensure equal housing
opportunity through leadership, education, facilitation, outreach, training, advocacy, and enforcement.

Referral Services
The UpValley Family Center, which maintains an office in Calistoga, provides a wide range of social services,
including referrals to affordable housing, interim housing and fair housing resources. The City provides
annual funding to the Family Center to support these services.
Down Payment Assistance
In 2009, the City established a down payment assistance program for low- and moderate-income households
with members who live or work in Calistoga. The program allows for a maximum City subsidy of 4 percent
of the purchase price or $15,000, whichever is less, in the form of a deferred interest-free loan. The buyer is
required to provide a minimum of two percent of the purchase price of the unit as down payment and closing
cost contribution. To date, only one loan in the amount of $12,000 has been made at an interest rate of three
percent. The program’s lack of success is probably attributable to the relatively small amount that is
contributed by the City, considering the high cost of local housing prices. The City of Napa recently increased
its maximum loan amount to $100,000, and reduced its interest rate to one percent. The program should be
re-evaluated for possible modifications that would improve its success.
Financial Resources
Affordable Housing Fund
The Affordable Housing Fund is a special-purpose fund established by the City to preserve and expand the
stock of affordable housing through construction, acquisition, rehabilitation and provision of subsidies. There
is currently a balance of approximately $334,000 in this Fund.
Linkage Fees
The Affordable Housing Fund is funded primarily through the assessment of a fee on new employment-
generating uses. The basis for this “linkage fee” is the fact that the development of non-residential uses in the
City generates a need for additional workers, many in lower-income categories. Restaurants and wineries
generate the most significant numbers of households below 65 percent of the area’s median income level,
while tourist accommodation and commercial uses also generate substantial numbers of households in the 65
to 80 percent of area median income bracket. Additionally, many commercial jobs are comprised of retail
where wages are below those in other commercial land use sectors (e.g. office, light industrial). 18
Calistoga’s attractiveness and market orientation towards single-family ownership limits the availability of
multi-family housing. Local workers compete for a limited housing supply with retirees who may have built
substantial equity in their prior homes or higher-income households who have more flexibility regarding
where they choose to live. As a result of this type of demand on the City’s housing supply, it is difficult for
lower-wage workers to find suitable housing in the city without a program designed to bring the cost of
housing down to an affordable range. The cost to construct new housing units is higher than can be
supported by the rents that many workers can pay. The difference between costs and affordable rent levels is
considered an “affordability gap.”
The linkage fee is assessed on new commercial and industrial projects, and additions to existing facilities. The
fee is paid in conjunction with issuance of a building permit in the amounts noted below.

Linkage fees are also negotiated as part of development agreements. The Affordable Housing Fund balance
would rise to nearly $1 million upon completion of the Indian Springs Expansion and Silver Rose projects.
In-Lieu Fees
Additional contributions to the Affordable Housing Fund are generated by fees paid in-lieu of constructing
the affordable housing required by the City’s inclusionary housing program (see description under
Government Constraints section). The fee has been determined on a project basis in the past; however, the
City is currently in the process of establishing a set fee per unit. Development agreements negotiated for
several large projects that are using this alternative could generate more than one million dollars for the
Affordable Housing Fund during the planning period if all of them are constructed 19.
Loan Repayments
The Affordable Housing Fund occasionally receives loan repayments associated with the Down Payment
Assistance Program and second mortgages that the City holds on homes that were purchased under a first-
time homebuyer program.
Affordable Housing Subsidies
The City has supported the development of affordable housing through financial allocations and in helping to
secure project funding from public and private sources.
     •    In 2003, the City allocated $540,000 for the development of the 18-unit Saratoga Manor project,
          which is comprised of 18 two- and three-bedroom units available for purchase by low-income
          families. Two non-profit organizations, Calistoga Affordable Housing (CAH) and Burbank Housing
          Development Corporation collaborated to construct the project. The City also committed to
          reducing development fees. The combined subsidy from the City was approximately $30,000 per
          housing unit.
     •    In 2006 and 2007, the City assisted CAH in obtaining funding for two affordable housing projects.
          These efforts resulted in $7.8 million of funding (including $3.1 million from the HOME Program)
          for the Palisades Apartments in 2008.
     •    In 2007, the City provided an $80,000 loan to CAH to fund the Lakewood I Multi-Family Rental
          Rehabilitation Project which includes eight deed-restricted very low-income units (including four
          deed-restricted farmworker units).
     •    In 2012, the City approved variances in support of a 48-unit rental farmworker project developed by
          Corporation for Better Housing. The City also assisted the developer with its state and federal
          funding applications.
These and other non-profit organizations can be important providers of affordable housing in the
community, and the City will continue to work with them as it implements this Housing Element.

Public Funding Sources
There a number of programs potentially available to assist the City in increasing and improving its affordable
housing stock.
     •   HOME program funds can be used to develop and support affordable rental housing and home
         ownership affordability. For Calistoga, these funds are made available on an annual competitive basis
         through the State’s small cities program. Allowed activities include acquisition, rehabilitation,
         construction, and rental assistance. As mentioned above, HOME funds were used to support
         construction of the Palisades Apartments and will be used to rehabilitate owner-occupied housing in
         the community, beginning in 2014.
     •   The federal Section 8 Rental Assistance Program provides rental subsidies to very low-income
         families. A portion of the family’s monthly rent is paid in the form of a subsidy directly to the
         landlord by the Housing Authority of the City of Napa (HACN). Participants pay approximately 30
         percent of their adjusted gross income to the landlord for rent. HACN staff assure that Section 8-
         assisted housing is safe and of high quality by requiring owners to meet housing quality standards and
         local codes. Section 8 vouchers currently assist 20 households containing a total of 27 residents over
         the age of 18 within the 94515 zip code, which includes Calistoga. Fifteen of the vouchers are held by
         seniors. The same number of voucher holders was reported to be disabled and may be the same
         households. Fourteen of the voucher holders are female.
     •   Community Development Block Grant funds have been used by Calistoga for housing rehabilitation
         loans, infrastructure improvements, public facilities and public services. Proceeds from those
         activities are deposited into a revolving loan fund established from low- interest loans for
         rehabilitation and could be a resource for housing stock preservation.
     •   Under the Community Reinvestment Act, federal law requires that banks, savings and loans, thrifts,
         and their affiliated mortgaging subsidiaries annually evaluate the credit needs for public projects in
         communities where they operate.
     •   The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program provides federal and state tax credits for private
         developers and investors who agree to set aside all or an established percentage of their rental units
         for low-income households for no less than 30 years. The recently-constructed Calistoga Family
         Apartments project was the beneficiary of tax credits.
     •   Recently-approved Proposition 41, the Veterans Housing and Homeless Prevention Bond Act of
         2014, authorized $600 million of general bonds to provide multi-family housing for veterans and
         their families. To access funds in this program, the City would work with veterans organizations in
         addition to nonprofit housing developers.
New Housing Opportunities
Table H-32 and Figure H-3 identify housing units that are under construction or that have been approved
and could be constructed during the planning period. Comparing the City’s total regional housing need of 27
units for the planning period as shown in Table H-30 to Table H-32 demonstrates that this need can be
readily accommodated. Furthermore, the 48-unit Calistoga Family Apartments project, which is under
construction, will more than fulfill the City’s total lower-income allocation of eight units, while the Silver
Rose project, which will begin construction in the coming months, will exceed its Above-Moderate Income
allocation of 15 units. The only short-fall would be one unit in the Moderate Income category.

Development Site Inventory
In addition to the approved housing identified above, Table H-33 identifies 16 sites in Calistoga (illustrated in
Figure H-4) that provide realistic development opportunities for the provision of housing to all income
segments within the community.
Most of the properties in the inventory below are vacant; a few are underutilized (e.g., developed with one
single-family residence) and could be developed with more-intense residential uses.
Therefore, in combination with the approved units identified in Table H-32, the City can readily
accommodate its RHNA of 27 units for the planning period. It is important to note that identification of a
site in this inventory does not restrict or require that it be developed exactly as described in the inventory.
Likewise, sites that are not identified in the inventory are not precluded from developing with residential uses
that would help fulfill the City’s regional housing need. The purpose of preparing the site inventory and
analysis is to comply with state law that requires the City to demonstrate it has adequate housing sites for
meeting projected housing needs.
Potential Development Constraints
Sites identified for potential residential development in the city were analyzed to determine their relationship
to public facilities and services and existing or potential physical constraints to development. Of the 16
identified sites, only one (Site 15) has significant constraints that may limit its development. The following
sub-sections provide a general discussion of potential development constraints known to exist within the city.
                                                                                                                              H-39

CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN                                                        2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
•    Public Services
Nearly all of the identified sites are convenient to water and sewer lines. In 1998, the City purchased 500 acre
feet per year of domestic water from the City of American Canyon’s North Bay Aqueduct entitlement. In
2000, an additional 925 acre feet of water per year were purchased from Kern County. These purchases,
combined with the City’s original North Bay Aqueduct entitlement and its Kimball Reservoir water supply is
projected to provide an adequate water supply in Calistoga through the next 20 years. The City recently
completed construction of a 1.5 million-gallon water tank on Mt. Washington to improve storage capacity
and better manage municipal water supply during peak demand times. The City expanded its wastewater
treatment plant in 2003. This expansion provides 20 to 30 years of development capacity based on the annual
average growth rate between 2000 and 2009 of 0.30 percent.
•    Flooding
Certain areas of Calistoga lie within the 100-year floodplain of the Napa River and are at risk of flooding.
Residential areas known to be prone to flooding include areas around Silver Street, from Gold Street to
Spring Street, between the river and Myrtle Street; a crescent-shaped area around Washington Street, starting
southeast of Oak Street, rising up Lake Street and Fourth Street, and extending to Second Street; and the area
from Pine Street southeast to the city limits, between the river and Foothill Boulevard. Policies and actions
contained in the Safety Element will ensure that new development would not be exposed or vulnerable to
risks associated with flooding.
Another part of Calistoga that could be subject to flooding is property downstream of the Kimball Reservoir.
If the dam were to fail, inundation could occur in the northern part of the Planning Area as far south as
Tubbs Lane. South of Tubbs Lane, dam failure would cause the Napa River to overflow its banks through the
rest of the city. The risk of dam failure is small, so the impact of additional development within the dam
inundation area is not considered to be a significant constraint.
•    Special Status Species and Sensitive Natural Communities
Occurrences of several plant and animal species with special-status have been recorded or are suspected to
exist within Calistoga. Most of these are associated with the forest, woodland, and grassland along the fringe
of city limits and the outer Planning Area. A few species have been reported from the floor of the valley,
generally associated with the aquatic habitat of the Napa River and the freshwater marsh in geyser-fed swales
where disturbance has been limited. Figure OSC-1 in the Open Space and Conservation Element illustrates
the location of sensitive species and communities known to exist within the City. Site No. 11 is located
adjacent to a stretch of the Napa River that is known to provide habitat for a sensitive animal species. In
addition, there are numerous mature trees on the property. Given these conditions, the amount of
developable land area may be constrained. Development of a few of the sites will result in the loss of
grassland and savannah; however they are not considered to be particularly sensitive resources and therefore
their potential loss is not considered to be a constraint to development.
•    Archaeological Resources
Archaeological resources known to exist within the city include remnants of Native American villages and
campsites and other evidence of habitation. Prehistoric archaeological sites are generally located along
seasonal and/or perennial watercourses, at or near vegetation ecotones, and at the base of foothills. There is
a possibility that sites located in these areas may contain undiscovered archaeological and paleontological
resources that could be impacted from development activities involving ground removal or disturbance.
                                                                                                           H-43

Policies contained in the Community Identity Element require pre-development consultation with tribal
representatives and will ensure respectful treatment of resources.
Zoning for a Variety of Housing Types
•    Mixed Use Development
A mix of residential and commercial uses is allowed in both of the General Plan’s primary commercial land
use designations (i.e., Downtown Commercial and Community Commercial). Additionally, within these
designations, residential development is excluded from the calculation of a project’s maximum floor area
ratio, which is an important incentive for such development.
•    Multi-Family Units
One duplex or two one-family dwellings are permitted by right (i.e., without a use permit requirement) on a
lot of at least 9,000 square feet in the R-2 Two-Family Residential District. Multi-family dwellings are allowed
by right in the R-3 Multifamily/Office District. Multi-family housing is also permitted in the Downtown
Commercial Zoning District above the ground floor, and in the Community Commercial Zoning District
with a use permit.
•    Second Dwelling Units
Second dwelling units are permitted through a non-discretionary administrative permit in all residential
districts. The maximum lot coverage in the R-1 district may be increased from 30 percent to 37 percent with
administrative approval to accommodate accessory structures. This provision is intended to facilitate
construction of second units on smaller lots that may have been previously constrained by the 30 percent
restriction.
•    Licensed Care Facilities
The California Welfare and Institutions Code declares that mentally- and physically-disabled persons are
entitled to live in normal residential surroundings, and that the use of property for the care of six or fewer
disabled persons is a residential use for the purpose of zoning. A state-authorized, certified, or licensed family
care home, foster home, or group home serving six or fewer disabled persons or dependent and neglected
children on a 24-hour-a-day basis is considered a residential use that is permitted in all residential zones. No
jurisdiction may impose stricter zoning or building and safety standards on these homes than is otherwise
required for homes in the same district.
In accordance with state law, the Zoning Code permits licensed residential or community care facilities with
six or fewer beds by right in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 residential zoning districts, and allows facilities serving
more than six persons in these districts with a use permit.
    Mobile Homes
The Zoning Code allows manufactured, mobile and factory-built homes in any zoning district that allows
single-family residential development. Manufactured, mobile and factory-built homes are subject to the same
design standards that apply to conventional “stick built” homes.
•    Farmworker Housing
The Zoning Code provides for a variety of housing types that would accommodate farmworker housing
needs, including multi-family housing, manufactured housing, and second units. In addition, the Zoning

CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN                                                         2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
Code allows agricultural employee housing for six or fewer persons by-right in the R-1 (Single-Family)
Zoning District.
•    Emergency Shelters and Transitional and Supportive Housing
The Zoning Code allows emergency housing shelters and transitional and supportive housing without a use
permit or other discretionary action in the Community Commercial Zoning District. Additionally, transitional
and supportive housing are permitted uses in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 Residential Zoning Districts.
•    Single-Family Attached Units
To address the need for housing that is affordable to moderate income households, the R-2 Zoning District
allows the development of one duplex or two one-family dwellings per lot with only design review required.
•    Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Housing
Single-room occupancy residential units (SROs) are a form of affordable housing consisting of a single room,
often between 150 and 350 square feet in size for lower- income individuals, homeless, seniors, and persons
with disabilities. SROs can have private or shared cooking and sanitary facilities. Currently, SRO housing is
not identified as a permitted or conditionally-permitted use in any zoning district. However, it could
potentially be allowed in the R-3, DC or CC Zoning Districts subject to a “similar use” determination by the
Planning Commission. Applicable General Plan land use densities for the subject zoning districts would limit
the number of SRO units in a given project to a maximum of 20 units per acre, although these densities could
be higher if rooms do not include cooking facilities and are therefore not considered dwelling units in the
traditional sense.
F.       Energy Conservation
New homes and residential additions are subject to the California Building Code, which includes stringent
energy efficiency requirements. Larger landscaping projects are required to conform to the State’s water-
efficiency landscape standards, which minimizes the amount of energy required for water transport and
irrigation.
The City has not adopted any restrictions on the design or placement of photovoltaic energy systems on
residential property in order to encourage their installation. The Calistoga Family Apartments project will
include solar panels on carports and roofs that will generate 356kW of energy, enough to meet the complex’s
entire electricity demand.
Opportunities for improving energy conservation in the design of residential development include ensuring
the consistency of tentative tract maps with Section 66473.1 of the Subdivision Map Act, which requires the
designs of subdivisions to provide for future passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities. The City also
requires the planting of trees along streets and in parking lots to reduce heat island effects.
To encourage energy efficiency improvements to the city’s existing housing stock, the City has joined the
CaliforniaFIRST and California Home Energy Renovation Opportunity (HERO) Programs that allow
residential property owners to finance the installation of energy- and water-efficient improvements, and
renewable energy systems. Both programs are Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Programs, which
allows the property owners to pay the loans back as a line item on their property tax bill.
Additionally, the HOME grant that the City recently received for owner-occupied residential rehabilitation
will require each of the rehabilitated homes to be upgraded to meet the current state energy code.
                                                                                                           H-45

CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN                                                         2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
The City has initiated an extensive water conservation effort that will have the added benefit of reducing the
energy used for water transport. The program offers rebates for residential toilet and washer replacement
with water-efficient models and turf replacement with low-water use landscaping or artificial turf. Free
residential water audits of both homes and landscaping are offered and kits containing water conservation
devices, such as low-flow shower heads and faucet aerators, are distributed.
G.        Constraints to the Development of H ousing
Governmental Constraints
State law requires each Housing Element to include an analysis of potential and actual governmental
constraints on the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels and persons
with disabilities.
Governmental regulations and exactions are designed to achieve desirable land use patterns, coordinate
development with infrastructure expansion, finance capital improvements, equitably distribute the cost of
public services, maintain the ambiance of existing neighborhoods, improve the urban environment, and
preserve open space and unique ecosystems. However, they should be evaluated to determine whether they
are excessive and represent an unnecessary constraint on the availability or affordability of housing being
built, or contribute to the loss of existing affordable housing.
In its efforts to remove governmental constraints, Calistoga must also be guided by Government Code
Section 65580(e), which notes that the City also has “…the responsibility to consider economic,
environmental, and fiscal factors and community goals set forth in the general plan…”.
The most direct government affect on housing production is the regulation of land use through the General
Plan and Zoning Code. Every municipality in the Bay Area limits the location of housing and the number of
units that can be built on a property by designating and zoning land for different types of uses and by
specifying the range of dwelling units allowed (the density) in each residential land use category.
Development standards, such as minimum lot sizes and building setbacks also affect the type and cost of
housing that may be developed.
Calistoga mitigates the effects of land use controls on housing production by:
     •    Providing a range of zoning categories and densities to allow for all types of housing.
     •    Permitting and encouraging mixed-use developments that combine housing with other uses.
     •    Providing incentives for affordable housing and second dwelling units, as well as single-family
          residences on existing residential lots of record.
Calistoga General Plan
Calistoga’s General Plan includes a wide range of residential land use designations, including Rural Residential
(1 unit/acre), Rural Residential-Hillside (0.5 units/acre), Low Density Residential (2 to 4 units/acre), Medium
Density Residential (4 to 10 units/acre) and High Density Residential (10 to 20 units/acre). The Downtown
Commercial and Community Commercial land use designations allow for mixed-use development, including
residences within a density range of 4 to 20 units per acre. Minimum densities are required for most of the
designations in order to maximize residential development on a limited supply of land and achieve a balance
and variety of housing types. Consistent with state law, density bonuses may be approved for projects that
include dedicated affordable housing and senior housing to exceed the maximum density otherwise allowed.

The maximum densities allowed for the High Density Residential land use designation are not an impediment
to the development of affordable multi-family projects. The La Pradera Apartments project, whose 48 units
are limited to occupancy by low-income households earning a maximum of 60 percent of the area median
income, was constructed at a density of 10.5 units per acre. The Calistoga Family Apartments project, which
targets very low- and extremely-low households, was approved at a density of 14.5 units per acre.
Zoning Code
Zoning Districts
The City regulates the type, location, and scale of development through its Zoning Code. The Code includes
a wide range of residential zoning districts that allow a variety of housing types, including single-family, multi-
family, second units, mobile homes, transitional and supportive housing, and residential care.

  1 Second dwelling unit permit required
  2 Use permit required
Each district ensures that the type of residential development is consistent with and implements the City’s
General Plan land use designations. For example, the R-3 Zoning District implements the “High Density
Residential” General Plan land use designation, which is intended for multi-family development, by allowing
multi-family dwelling units as a permitted use (i.e., not subject to a use permit).
The Zoning Code currently requires approval of a “second dwelling unit permit” by the Planning and
Building Director for second dwelling units (i.e., an independent living unit that is subordinate to the main
dwelling on a lot), after providing written notice to property owners within 300 feet of the proposed unit.
This additional step could constrain the development of second units by adding time to the review process.
Development Standards
Provisions in the Zoning Code specify minimum lot areas, lot widths, lot depths and setbacks; and maximum
lot coverage and building heights. Additional development regulations specify parking requirements.
Development standards applicable to residential development are summarized in Tables H-35 and H-36.
These standards are typical of many California communities and contribute to the protection of the public
health, safety and welfare, and the maintenance of the city’s quality of life.
•    Building height and lot coverage
The Zoning Code limits the height of residential buildings to a maximum height of 25 feet in residential
zones and 30 feet in commercial zones. However, heights up to 30 feet in residential zones and 35 feet in
commercial zones are allowed where a finding can be made that the taller building height would be more
compatible with surrounding buildings due to their special historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and
that the taller building height does not encroach on the light or views of adjacent properties.
This provides more than enough height to accommodate two-story construction, but can make it difficult to
construct a three-story building with sufficient height to accommodate a pitched roof on a parcel designated
for high density and mixed-use development. Furthermore, the Zoning Code measures building height at the
point that is half the distance between the ridge and eave on a gable roof, rather than to the highest point of
the roof, thereby allowing additional height for sloped roofs.
Limits on lot coverage and building height have not been a constraint to the development of housing for any
income groups, including affordable housing projects. All of the projects have been two-story, and the lot
coverages for the Palisades Apartments and Calistoga Family Apartments were 26% and 15%, respectively.
•    Setbacks
Setback requirements in the Zoning Code reflect the importance of maintaining adequate buffering between
adjoining properties to avoid potential use conflicts. These setbacks are typical of similar communities and
have not appeared to be an impediment to the development of housing. The commercial zoning districts do
not require any setbacks unless located adjacent to or across the street from a parcel located in a residential
zoning district.

•    Parking
The Code prescribes minimum parking requirements for residential uses to minimize potential off-site
impacts from overflow parking. These have not proved to be an impediment to housing development.
Furthermore, parking is not required to be covered, which differs from the covered parking requirement of
most jurisdictions. Additionally, the shared use of parking facilities is allowed for mixed use-type projects,
which can reduce the number of overall required parking spaces. However, the current parking standard of
two spaces per senior housing unit may be excessive for some types of senior housing and should be revised
to allow fewer parking spaces under appropriate conditions.
•    Second dwelling units
Second dwelling units are an affordable and efficient means of increasing the housing stock. However, very
few have been constructed in the City. There are a number of development standards included in Chapter
17.37 of the Zoning Code that could constrain their development. These requirements include, but are not
limited to:
     • Approval of a separate permit by the Planning and Building Director and notification of property
         owners within 300 feet
     • Occupation by the property owner of either the primary dwelling or second dwelling unit
     • Conformance with the rear yard setback requirements for a primary dwelling unit
                                                                                                                                        H-50

     •   Screening of trash and recycling areas
     •   Prohibition of visually separating a second dwelling unit from the primary dwelling unit
The Zoning Code allows the establishment of planned development districts in which the development
standards may be specifically tailored to the project that is proposed, allowing design flexibility. Both the
Palisades Apartments and La Pradera Apartments affordable housing projects have their own planned
development districts.
Definitions
SB 745, which took effect on January 1, 2014, generally amends Government Code Section 65582 to replace
prior Health and Safety Code definitions of "supportive housing," "transitional housing" and "target
population" with definitions now more specific to housing element law. Therefore, Zoning Code Chapter
17.04, Definitions, needs to be amended to revise the existing definitions for "supportive housing" and
"transitional housing" and to add a definition for "target population."
The Code’s definition of “family” also needs to be updated to reflect current case law.
Processing and Permit Procedures
The Zoning Code states the type of residential uses permitted within the City’s residential and commercial
zoning districts and specifies whether the use is permitted by right, or requires administrative review or
approval of a use permit. Uses permitted by right are those that are allowed without discretionary review as
long as the project complies with all development standards. Uses requiring administrative review are
approved by the Planning and Building Director, which allows some flexibility on the part of the City to
ensure basic health and safety, and general welfare concerns are met. Use permits are subject to approval by
the Planning Commission. Many uses subject to a use permit also require design review, which is processed
concurrently with the use permit application. Findings for use permit and design review approval include that
the project is consistent with the General Plan, the use is compatible with surrounding uses, meets certain
design objectives, and addresses basic public health, safety and general welfare concerns.
The time required to process a project varies greatly from one project to another and is directly related to the
size and complexity of the proposal and the number of actions or approvals needed to complete the process.
Table H-37 identifies general processing timeframes for various planning permits. It should be noted that
projects do not necessarily have to complete each step in the process (i.e., small-scale projects consistent with
the General Plan and Zoning Code would not require an environmental impact report, General Plan
amendment, rezone or variance). It should also be understood that multiple applications for a project are
usually processed concurrently.
These processing times are comparable to those of other communities. The City has a consolidated and
streamlined permitting process in order to expedite building and planning applications as much as possible.
For example, most design review occurs at the administrative level and final maps are only considered at the
City Council level. When a project requires rezoning or amendment of the General Plan, the City strongly
encourages that those requests be processed concurrently.

•    Design Review
Design review of proposed residential development is required in order to ensure conformance with the
Calistoga General Plan, to promote high quality design and a harmonious relationship of buildings, to
preserve the unique character and ambiance of Calistoga, to ensure compatibility of new development with
existing development, and to promote the preservation of historic structures.
The Planning and Building Director is empowered to grant design review approval for one-family dwelling
units in the RR, R-1/R-1-10 and R-2 Zoning Districts. The Planning Commission conducts design review for
all other types of residential development applications
Potential applicants are encouraged to submit their preliminary plans for review by city department
representatives at no cost to the applicant, and/or the Planning Commission, for a nominal fee. The
applicants obtain feedback that can be readily incorporated into the final project design.
The design review process often results in an improved design that benefits both future project residents as
well as neighbors. The Planning Commission includes an architect who can facilitate the non-design
professional members’ understanding of project designs.
In approving a design review application, the Director or Commission must find that the proposed design:
     •      Is in accord with the General Plan and any applicable planned development.
     •      Is in accord with all applicable provisions of the Zoning Code.
     •      Is consistent with any adopted design review guidelines to the extent possible
     •      Will not impair or interfere with the development, use or enjoyment of other property in the vicinity
            or the area
The design review approval process is typically completed within four to six weeks, which is considered very
short when compared with other jurisdictions. Even the Calistoga Family Apartments project that required
preparation of a mitigated negative declaration was recently approved within three months of the
application’s initial submittal.
H-52

CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN                                                        2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
The review of project site plans, elevation drawings and landscaping plans is guided by adopted Residential
Design Guidelines, which help facilitate projects through the review process by eliminating ambiguity in
design expectations. They also promote both variation in design and compatibility with the desirable qualities
of existing development. Manufactured homes located outside of mobilehome parks are subject to the same
design standards as conventionally-constructed housing.
The multi-family design guidelines are intended to encourage designs that maximize common space, blend
with the surrounding community, limit views of parking facilities from public streets, provide architectural
compatibility of accessory buildings, and direct on-site lighting on driveways and walkways and away from
adjacent properties. All of these standards are compatible with the typical design of recently-constructed
affordable housing projects. The Zoning Code and General Plan also provide guidelines for residential
development that occurs in commercial areas and on hillsides in order to promote compatible design.
•     Building Permits
Upon submittal of a complete set of plans for a typical single-family residence, plan check is conducted and a
building permit is issued within approximately two to four weeks, and about four to six weeks for a typical
multi-family plan check. The City sometimes contracts with a consultant for more complex plan checks in
order to expedite their review; however, such plan checks are done on a time and materials basis to minimize
the cost.
In summary, Calistoga’s processing and permit procedures are reasonable and more expeditious compared to
those in many other California communities. The permit process only increases in complexity and duration
when the circumstances of individual projects warrant extra consideration on the part of staff and officials.
This is especially true of the environmental review component of the process, yet the City of Calistoga has
little flexibility to change this, since the California Environmental Quality Act specifies procedures that local
jurisdictions must observe in reviewing the potential environmental impacts of development projects.
Growth Management
Growth has been a significant issue in Calistoga for nearly three decades. The City’s Growth Management
System was established as a regulatory mechanism for ensuring that population and employment growth is
commensurate with the City’s ability to provide essential public services and facilities. The System has been
designed to facilitate and implement goals and policies contained in the Calistoga General Plan. Its primary
objectives include:
      •   Prioritize projects with housing that is affordable to lower-income households.
      •   Promote infill development over new development at the edges of town.
      •    Reduce dependency on the automobile by providing a mix of housing types in areas located close to
           services, transit and City parks.
      •    Provide a balance of residential and non-residential growth to ensure the community’s unique quality
           of life and economic well-being.
Consistent with the General Plan, the Growth Management System is based on an annual growth rate of 1.35
percent. Based on Calistoga’s average household size, the 1.35% growth rate equates to approximately 28 new
units annually. The City’s Regional Fair Share Housing total allocation of 27 units for the 2015 - 2022
planning cycle is well within these limits.
The Growth Management System is implemented through an annual allocation process. Preference for
residential allocations is generally given to projects that include one or more of the following:
                                                                                                            H-53

CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN                                                      2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
     •   The majority of project units count towards fulfillment of the City's remaining regional housing need
         in the very low-, low and moderate-income housing categories
     •   Housing for moderate-income households
     •   Housing proposed as part of a mixed-use development project
     •   Housing proposed on vacant, underdeveloped or redeveloped land with necessary public
         infrastructure in place
     •   Housing for special need housing groups or populations.
Allocations are not required for second dwelling units or the construction of a single-family residence on an
existing lot of record.
The City has a documented history of periodically reviewing and adjusting the Growth Management System
program to ensure the process is as efficient and streamlined as possible, including adoption of Resolution
2009-103, which suspended the procedures requiring: (1) an annual determination of available resources by
the City Council, (2) submittal of applications only during the annual enrollment period (applications for
growth management allocations can now be submitted any time during the year), and (3) approval of
requested allocations by the City Council (administrative authority to approve allocation requests has been
delegated to the Planning and Building Director). This continued monitoring and adjustment of the Growth
Management System program as needed in response to market conditions will ensure that the program does
not impose a significant constraint to the production of housing.
There are still certain aspects of the program that could constrain the production of housing, such as the
one-year time frame to complete the project once an allocation had been awarded. For affordable housing
projects in particular, the one-year time frame may not be enough for securing funding commitments from
multiple public and private funding sources and securing planning and building permits. The one-year time
frame is also challenge for projects involving subdivision maps.
Another potential constraint is the absence of a provision that allows unused/expired allocations to be rolled
over from one five-year cycle to the next. In the last year of a five-year cycle, there may not be a sufficient
number of allocations available or remaining to award to a larger development project. Because allocations
cannot be borrowed from the next five-year cycle, the allocation award would have to be delayed for a year.
Fees and Other Exactions
Development Impact Fees
The City recently updated its development impact fees that generate funding for capital facilities and
equipment investments associated with the police, fire, cultural/recreation, City administration, and
transportation functions. These one-time charges on new development are used to cover the cost of capital
equipment and facilities that are required to serve new growth. The fees are typically collected upon issuance
of a building permit, though in some cases on issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final inspection. While
these fees may affect housing prices, the only alternatives would be their payment by existing Calistoga
taxpayers or no further residential development, neither of which is feasible. The City Council elected to
adopt fees below the maximum supportable level, in part to avoid deterring development in the community.
They are similar to those of similar communities in the vicinity. The City’s impact fees associated with
domestic water service and wastewater treatment are generally higher than most other communities. The fees
are based on the estimated reasonable costs of providing the services and the construction, reconstruction
and maintenance of the related facilities, which were derived from a detailed analysis and projections
H-54

CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN                                                                             2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
regarding the City’s system costs, improvements and revenue needs. The connection charges for second
dwelling units, which may be constructed on many lots with single-family residences and are limited in size to
750 square feet, are the same as those for single-family units and represent a significant deterrent to their
development.
Processing and Permit Fees
Generally, the fees associated with processing planning and building permit applications are consistent with
other communities.
Table H-38 summarizes development fees, including impact, processing and permit fees. Table H-39
identifies these fees as a percentage of development costs. For a typical 2,000-square foot detached home,
development fees would be approximately 9.5% of total cost. For a 48-unit multi-family apartment building,
development fees would be approximately 13.8% of total per unit cost. The per unit fee portion as a
percentage of total cost for new single-family and multi-family development is within a range that is
considered to be acceptable.
The City Council has the authority to reduce development fees for affordable housing developments. In
2003, the City subsidized the majority of exactions and permit processing fees for an 18-unit low-income
ownership housing development (Saratoga Manor).

Inclusionary Housing Program
The cost of land and its relatively limited availability within the City create market conditions that make it
difficult for the private sector to produce housing that is affordable to moderate- and lower-income
households. In the interest of facilitating development of housing that is affordable at these income levels, the
City requires certain residential projects to contribute to the production of affordable housing within the City.
Under the inclusionary housing requirement, residential development projects consisting of five or more units
must restrict 20% of the units in the project at a cost affordable to moderate- or lower-income households.
Alternatives to the 20% on-site inclusionary requirement, such as payment of in-lieu fees, dedication of land
or other equivalent action that would provide a comparable or superior benefit to the on-site requirement,
may be considered by the City Council.
Developers must enter into an agreement with the City that sets forth the provisions of affordability for the
project before the issuance of a building permit or the approval of a final map if the project involves a
division of land. Inclusionary housing requirements for residential (or commercial) development projects for
which a development agreement has been entered into with the City are negotiated as a term of the
development agreement.
Under the auspices of the inclusionary housing requirements, the City negotiated the dedication of land (now
developed with the Palisades Apartments affordable housing project), construction of on-site housing units,
and agreements that could result in the payment of several million dollars of in-lieu housing fees during the
planning period. These fees are deposited into the City’s Affordable Housing Fund and may be used to
subsidize the development of affordable housing.
An update of the inclusionary housing requirement is necessary to limit its applicability to ownership projects
in light of recent court decisions that have interpreted the limitation on rents charged for rental inclusionary
unit as a form of rent control. The inclusionary housing requirement could be replaced with an in-lieu fee for
smaller projects due to the substantial cost to the developer of selling a unit at a below-market price.
Codes and Enforcement
The City has adopted the California Building Standards Code. The City may adopt amendments to the State
Code where local conditions warrant more-restrictive regulations. In the case of Calistoga, climatic,
geographical and topographical conditions justify a more-restrictive Fire Code, such as the following
requirements:
     • Illuminated or reflective address numbers
     • Brush clearance and fire-resistant roofing materials
     • Automatic sprinkler systems for certain building additions, alterations, repairs and changes in
       occupancy
While code requirements might increase the cost of providing housing, they also provide an important
safeguard for the local population.
The City enforces its codes on a “complaint basis.” While the enforcement of building and housing codes
could conceivably reduce the number of units and increase the cost of housing, code enforcement provides a
public benefit in that it ensures that housing is safe and sanitary. This is especially important for low-income
households who may not have the option of moving elsewhere if the housing they live in is not maintained.

On- and Off-Site Improvements
The Subdivision Ordinance requires a subdivider to provide the following infrastructure and improvements:
     • paved streets
     • concrete curbs and gutters
     • street name and traffic control signs
     • street trees
     • sanitary sewage collection and pumping system
     • water distribution and fire protection systems
     • storm water drainage systems
     • undergrounded utility lines
     • fences and landscaping along the rear of lots backing onto streets or highways
Developers may also be required to provide off-site improvements necessary for the general health, safety
and welfare. In some instances, off-site improvements may be reimbursed using impact fees that have been
collected from other projects, or by establishing a reimbursement fund that subsequent developers in the area
pay into.
The local street width standard is two travel lanes and two parking lanes. Sidewalks may be required along
non-rural streets and highways. With sidewalks and easements, total right-of-way width is a minimum of 56
feet, although it is wider in some areas. This design is intended to adequately accommodate traffic, parking,
pedestrians and drainage. These standards may be modified if warranted by individual circumstances, and
therefore are not a constraint on development.
The extent to which these improvements are required varies according to the size, type and intensity of the
proposed development. Moreover, these requirements are typical of those in similar communities, and
necessary for the health and welfare of those living in the subdivision or to mitigate impacts on the
surrounding community. Many of the requirements, such as those for street paving, street name signs, and
traffic control signs, have little impact on housing construction since the street network is already completed
in most areas of the city.
Constraints to Housing for the Disabled
This section provides an analysis of governmental constraints on the development, maintenance and
improvement of housing for persons with disabilities. As described above, the City facilitates permit
processing for all types of housing and retrofit efforts through its rapid processing times for most housing
projects. In addition, most retrofit improvements for accessibility, such as installation of ramps, do not
require design review, and are only subject to inspection for building permit approval in order to ensure safety
compliance. To keep in conformance with State ADA requirements, the City adopts the California Building
Standards Code every three years and amends local code provisions as needed. In addition, the City has
established a Building Standards Advisory and Appeals Board to hear and decide on disabled access issues as
they relate to building code provisions specific to unreasonable hardships.
As further described above, no specific limitations or restrictions are contained in the Zoning Code
concerning special needs housing, as they are allowed by right in all residential zones. Additionally, the Code
provides for the approval of requests for reasonable accommodation by the Planning and Building Director.
A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any disabled person when the application of a
zoning law or other land use regulation, policy or practice acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. A
                                                                                                           H-57

request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards and
practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate
regulatory barriers and provide a disabled person equal opportunity to housing of their choice. If an applicant
needs assistance in making the request, the Planning and Building Department endeavors to provide the
assistance necessary to ensure that the process is available to the applicant.
Non-Governmental Constraints
Non-governmental constraints are those that are not created by a local government, but may be lessened
through its actions.
Construction Costs
Housing prices are influenced partly by the types of construction materials used. Homes in Calistoga are
generally of wood frame construction and finished with stucco or wood siding. This type of construction is
the least-expensive conventional method (brick, stone and concrete block are more costly). Composition
shingle and built-up roofs, which are found on a large share of the community’s homes, are also the least
expensive, followed by wood shingle, wood shake, concrete tile, metal tile and clay tile.
The cost of lumber and wood products accounts for approximately one-third of the costs of materials used to
build a home. A typical 2,000-square foot home uses nearly 16,000 board feet of lumber and 6,000 square feet
of structural panels, such as plywood, and every $1 increase in the average wholesale price of 1,000 board feet
of lumber increases the cost of a typical home about $20 21. The recent downturn in the housing construction
industry reduced the average price for framing lumber in 2009 to $222 per thousand board feet, compared to
$400+ in the late 1990s. However, prices rebounded to an average of $384 in 2013. Similarly, structural panel
composite prices have increased from $259 per thousand square feet in 2009 to $426 in 2013 22.
Labor costs are the single biggest expense in a home’s construction after land. Over the long term, direct
construction costs (including materials and labor) have decreased as a proportion of total costs due to a
dramatic drop in the number of person-hours required to construct a unit, and the use of less-skilled (and
therefore, lower-paid) workers because of a greater use of pre-fabricated materials.
The City can minimize construction costs by not requiring more costly kinds of building materials on
residences, such as clay tile roofs. However, there is little within the City’s power to affect the cost of skilled
labor and building materials.
Design Preferences
Housing costs are affected in part by a residence’s design, including the number and type of amenities and
size. There has been a dramatic change over the last 30 years in the size of housing units and the amenities
provided to them, which has resulted in higher prices for housing. New single-family homes sold in 2007 had
the following characteristics according to the U.S. Census:
     • The average house had 2,521 square feet, 801 more square feet than in 1977.
     • 38 percent of new homes had four or more bedrooms, almost double the rate of 20 years ago, despite
        the drop in average household size. The larger number of rooms was partly due to the rise of specialty
        rooms such as home offices, sunrooms, media rooms and exercise rooms.
     • In homes with four or more bedrooms, over half (57 percent) had three bathrooms or more.

     • 27 percent of new homes had three or more bathrooms, nearly triple the rate from 1987.
     • 90 percent of new homes had air conditioning, compared to 36 percent in 1971.
     • Nearly 20 percent of new homes had at least a three-car garage.
     • Half of the new homes had at least one fireplace, compared to 36 percent in 1971.
Land Costs
Approximately 25 percent of housing costs are attributable to land costs in most real estate markets. A major
component of this cost is land speculation. Land costs are also affected by such factors as zoning density, the
availability of infrastructure, the existence or absence of environmental constraints and the relative amount of
similar land available for development.
Land costs for single-family lots in Calistoga range between $200,000 and $400,000, depending on the size of
the parcel and its location. A 7,400-square foot vacant lot zoned R-1, which is centrally located, flat and ready
to build on, was recently listed at $225,000. Vacant lots of approximately 14,000 square feet in the Brogan
subdivision sold for $350,000. All of these properties had City sewer and water services available, but the
price of the lot did not include the connection charges.
In 2013, the Corporation for Better Housing, a non-profit developer, purchased 3.32 acres of property at a
cost of $2.5 million for the 48-unit Calistoga Family Apartments project, which equates to approximately
$52,000 per unit in land costs for high-density rental housing.
Financing Costs
Home Financing
Mortgage credit is difficult to obtain for most first-time buyers and the recent tightening of underwriting
standards also hinders the ability of households at the low and middle tiers to move up.
Mortgage rates are currently at historic lows. Besides lowering monthly interest payments for buyers, low
interest rates allow existing homeowners to refinance their homes, thereby lowering monthly housing costs
and perhaps preserving their ownership status.
In the past, mortgages for homes above the half-million-dollar mark, commonly known as “jumbo loans,”
were more difficult to obtain, even for well-qualified buyers. However, in federally-designated high-cost
counties, which includes Napa County, conventional and FHA loan limits have been increased to $625,500 to
assist homebuyers. Furthermore, jumbo loans have become comparatively cheaper. Lenders are currently
offering rates that are more than a quarter of a percentage point lower than those on the conforming loans
backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and are increasingly holding these jumbo loans on their books as a
revenue enhancer. As the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie and Freddie, seeks to
boost the two agencies' reserves against losses from mortgage defaults, it has raised fees and other costs for
borrowers. Since Fannie and Freddie don't back jumbo mortgages, those fees don't apply and therefore aren't
passed on to borrowers.
The City of Calistoga assisted 27 low- and moderate-income first-time homebuyers in purchasing homes in
the Palisades, Emerald Oaks and Silverado Place Subdivisions by providing each buyer with a “silent second”
mortgage to close the gap between the appraised value of the homes and the price affordable to the particular
household. A deed restriction was recorded on each property that required the City be provided with an
option to purchase the home in the event of re-sale in order to try to keep the homes in the community’s
affordable housing inventory.
                                                                                                             H-59

CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN                                                        2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
Many major financial institutions and mortgage lenders that finance housing have offices in nearby cities.
Homes sales are occurring in all parts of the community, and there is no evidence of mortgage-deficient areas
in the community for new construction or rehabilitation loans.
The ability to accumulate a down payment is a formidable barrier to many potential homebuyers. Low-
income households find it difficult to make the transition from rental to ownership units because they cannot
accumulate a down payment while renting. Similarly, very low-income households may be unable to obtain
rental housing because they cannot accrue the necessary security deposits and first and last months’ rents.
Construction Financing
Overall, construction financing usually represents a small portion of total housing costs. Financing costs for
construction are affected partly by how early in the development process loans must be taken out and how
long the loans must be carried. Project delays can increase total interest payments, as well as create greater
financial risk for a project. Construction financing for higher-density in-fill projects is generally harder to
obtain than for conventional single-family construction.
Community Acceptance of Residential Development
Public resistance to residential development proposals, especially affordable, multi-family and/or in-fill
projects, can result in lengthy and expensive review processes as well as the loss of potential units. In general,
Calistoga residents are accepting of development if such concerns as privacy impacts and additional traffic are
addressed. During the recent review and approval process for the Calistoga Family Apartments project –
consisting of 56 very low- and low-income apartments on an in-fill site, few neighbors expressed concerns
about the project. This resulted in the unanimous approval of the project by the Planning Commission, with
no loss of units or an appeal of their decision to the City Council.
H.       Key Findings
The key findings of the above analysis are summarized below. Any issues should be addressed in the Housing
Element’s goals, policies and actions.
Population, Employment and Household Income Characteristics
1.       Between 2000 and 2010, Calistoga saw an increase in the diversity of its population. The percentage
         of the city’s population who categorize themselves as Hispanic grew from 38.4 percent in 2000 to
         49.4 percent in 2010, while the share of non-Hispanic White decreased from 59.1 percent to 47.7
         percent. This is especially significant considering that the latter category represented 73.7 percent of
         the population in 1990.
2.       The median age in Calistoga increased from 38.1 years to 40 years between 2000 and 2010. This
         increase appears attributable to an increase in the proportion of the population between 55 and 65
         years of age. Calistoga’s median age is virtually the same as Napa County’s as a whole, but nearly 5
         years older than California’s median of 35.2 years. The city’s distribution is very similar to Napa
         County’s, while it has a higher elderly share and lower youth share than the State’s.
3.       Although housing prices in Calistoga have declined in recent years, they are expensive when
         compared to the average income levels of local residents. Approximately 200 low-income households
         devote more than 30 percent of their income for shelter, which is considered overpayment, and 500
         low-income households pay more than 50 percent of their income for housing.

4.    Accommodations, spa services and food service businesses employ the most workers in Calistoga.
      The local school district is also a large employer.
5.    Many local employees are members of very-low, low-income and moderate-income households,
      which include service workers in the restaurant, visitor accommodation and personal service
      industries; and entry-level teachers; firefighters and police officers.
6.    Calistoga has the lowest median household income in the county (more than $10,000 less than the
      next highest city) and the highest poverty rate. (However, it should be noted that the 2007-2011
      survey data is based on relatively small sample sizes with high margins of error, and should be viewed
      as estimates rather than definitive numbers.)
Housing Stock Characteristics
7.    While 70 housing units were added to the city’s housing stock between 2000 and 2010, only one has
      been added since 2010.
8.    Compared to the county’s and state’s housing unit type distributions, Calistoga has a substantially
      higher proportion of mobile homes, and a significantly lower share of multi-family units than the
      state.
9.    According to a survey of housing conditions in 2010, only 4.5 percent of the community’s
      conventionally-constructed units need some level of rehabilitation. The generally well-maintained
      condition of surveyed homes is also evidence of an interest in conserving the city’s existing units in
      the face of limited housing development. There is also a growing recognition and appreciation for
      the historic qualities of the homes in many of Calistoga’s older neighborhoods.
10.   The purchase of local residences as vacation homes and the offering of other homes as vacation
      rentals reduce the housing stock available to those who wish to permanently reside in the
      community.
11.   There has been no visible impact on local residential property conditions as a result of foreclosures.
      This could be attributed to the relatively few foreclosures that have occurred in the community, their
      dispersed locations and the continued maintenance of the properties by the lenders who assume
      ownership of these properties.
12.   There are very few housing units – both homes and apartments – available for rent in the
      community.
13.   A moderate-income family of four cannot afford the recent median $505,000 sale price of a single-
      family home in Calistoga.
14.   There are 172 affordable, deed-restricted housing units existing or under construction in the city,
      including single-family homes, townhomes and apartments, which represent approximately seven
      percent of its total housing inventory. Their affordability ranges from extremely low (≤30 percent of
      area median income) to moderate income (≤120 percent of area median income) and include units
      targeted to first-time homebuyers and farmworkers.
15.   Calistoga’s average household size in 2014 was estimated at 2.56 persons per household, which is less
      than the countywide average of 2.73 persons and significantly less than the statewide average of 2.95
      persons. However, approximately 195 renter households are living in overcrowded or severely-
      overcrowded units.
                                                                                                        H-61

CITY OF CALISTOGA GENERAL PLAN                                                    2014 HOUSING ELEMENT
Special Needs Housing
16.     A large proportion of Calistoga residents are seniors. Nearly 19 percent of Calistoga’s population was
        over 65 years of age in 2010, compared to 15 percent for Napa County as a whole and 11 percent for
        the State. Some elderly homeowners are not physically or financially able to maintain their homes.
        Seniors with low incomes have particular difficulty affording housing, especially in an area with high
        house prices and rents such as Calistoga. In 2000, more than 11 percent of persons over the age of
        65 in Calistoga were below the poverty level.
17.     Over half of Calistoga’s senior homeowners live in mobile homes and there are limited opportunities
        for alternate housing in the community. A survey of the senior mobile home parks reported that 42
        percent of the households were spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing expenses
        and 13 percent of these were spending more than one-half of their incomes on housing.
18.     Approximately 45 percent of farmworkers living in Napa County who rent their housing have
        housing cost burdens of greater than 30 percent. Approximately 18 percent who rent their housing
        pay more than 50 percent of their income towards housing. Farmworkers living in market-rate
        housing are also likely to experience overcrowding.
19.     Up to two homeless persons regularly reside in Calistoga. A 2014 countywide survey identified 73
        chronically-homeless individuals; 42 of these were unsheltered. No chronically-homeless families
        were found.
20.     There are an estimated 55 individuals with developmental disabilities in Calistoga. Persons with
        development disabilities are often faced with financial hardships when searching for stable, long-term
        and independent housing due to low income and limited financial assistance.
Projected Housing Needs
21.     The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) expects Calistoga’s population to grow to 5,600
        by 2040, an increase of less than 500 persons, and expects total jobs in Calistoga to increase by 420
        by 2040. ABAG has determined that the city’s “fair share” of regional housing for the planning
        period of 2015 through 2022 is 27 housing units.
22.     Projections developed by the City anticipate as many as 754 additional residents within the next 20
        years and as many as 1,300 additional jobs within the next 20 years, many of which will pay low-
        income wages. If this development occurs, up to 400 units could be needed, most of them at
        affordable prices and rents.
Housing Opportunities and Resources
23.     There is a broad range of services available to assist the City and its residents with housing needs,
        including special needs groups. However, the City’s down payment assistance program for low- and
        moderate-income households has had limited success and needs to be re-evaluated.
24.     The City’s Affordable Housing Fund is used to preserve and expand the stock of affordable housing
        through construction, acquisition, rehabilitation and provision of subsidies. Funds are generated
        primarily through the assessment of a fee on new employment-generating uses. The basis for this
        “linkage fee” is the fact that the development of new non-residential uses in the City generates a need
        for additional workers, many in lower-income categories. Development agreements negotiated for
        several large projects could generate more than one million dollars for the Affordable Housing Fund
        during the planning period if all of them are constructed. Additional contributions to the Affordable

       Housing Fund are generated by fees paid in-lieu of constructing the affordable housing required by
       the City’s inclusionary housing program.
25.    Over the last 10 years, the City has assisted with the development of 98 affordable housing units.
26.    There are a number of state and federal programs potentially available to assist the City in increasing
       and improving its affordable housing stock.
27.    Seventy-three housing units have been approved and could be constructed during the planning
       period.
28.    In addition to the approved housing units, 16 sites in Calistoga provide realistic development
       opportunities for the provision of housing to all income segments. Most of the sites are vacant and
       only one has significant constraints that may limit its development.
29.    The Zoning Code allows for a wide range of housing types, including mixed use, multi-family,
       second dwelling units, licensed care facilities, mobile homes, farmworker housing, emergency
       housing shelters and transitional and supporting housing.
Energy Conservation
30.    New homes and residential additions are subject to the California Building Code, which includes
       stringent energy efficiency requirements. Larger landscaping projects are required to conform to the
       State’s water-efficiency landscape standards, which minimizes the amount of energy required for
       water transport and irrigation. The City has not adopted any restrictions on the design or placement
       of photovoltaic energy systems on residential property in order to encourage their installation.
31.    The City has joined the CaliforniaFIRST and California Home Energy Renovation Opportunity
       (HERO) Programs that allow residential property owners to finance energy-efficient improvements
       and renewable energy systems. Additionally, the HOME grant that the City recently received for
       owner-occupied residential rehabilitation will require each of the rehabilitated homes to be upgraded
       to meet the current energy code.
32.    The City has initiated an extensive water conservation effort that will have the added benefit of
       reducing the energy used for water transport.
Governmental Constraints
33.    Calistoga’s General Plan includes a wide range of residential land use designations and allows
       residential development at up to 20 units per acre, which has not proven to be an impediment to the
       construction of affordable housing. The Zoning Code includes a wide range of residential zoning
       districts that allow a variety of housing types, including single-family, multi-family, second units,
       mobile homes, transitional and supportive housing, and residential care.
34.    The Zoning Code’s development standards are typical of many California communities. However,
       the current parking standard of two spaces per senior housing unit may be excessive for some types
       of senior housing and should be revised to allow fewer parking spaces under appropriate conditions.
       Additionally, the review process, development standards and impact fees for second dwelling units
       constrain the development of this type of housing.
35.    The City’s processing times for project applications are comparable to those of other communities.
       The City has a consolidated and streamlined permitting process in order to expedite building and
       planning applications as much as possible.
                                                                                                         H-63

36.      The one-year time frame to complete a project once a Growth Management System allocation has
         been awarded may be insufficient for affordable housing projects and projects involving subdivision
         maps.
37.      The Growth Management System does not allow unused/expired allocations to be rolled over from
         one five-year cycle to the next. In the last year of a five-year cycle, there may not be a sufficient
         number of allocations available or remaining to award to a larger development project. Because
         allocations cannot be borrowed from the next five-year cycle, the allocation award would have to be
         delayed for a year.
38.      The City assesses one-time charges on new development to cover the cost of capital equipment and
         facilities that are required to serve new growth. While these fees may affect housing prices, the only
         alternatives would be their payment by existing Calistoga taxpayers or no further residential
         development, neither of which is feasible. The City is currently updating these fees.
39.      There is a need to update the City's current inclusionary housing requirements to exclude their
         applicability to rental projects and to evaluate the feasibility of providing affordable housing within
         market-rate residential projects.
Non-Governmental Constraints
40.      The size of homes and the number and types of amenities have increased over the last 30 years in
         response to consumer demands.
41.      Mortgage credit is difficult to obtain for most first-time buyers and the recent tightening of
         underwriting standards also hinders the ability of households at the low and middle tiers to move up.
42.      The ability to accumulate a down payment is a formidable barrier to many potential homebuyers.
         Low-income households find it difficult to make the transition from rental to ownership units
         because they cannot accumulate a down payment while renting. Similarly, very low-income
         households may be unable to obtain rental housing because they cannot accrue the necessary security
         deposits, and first and last months’ rents.

Quantified Objectives
The following quantified objectives are based on the Housing Element’s identification of existing and
projected housing needs, potential housing development sites and financial resources, and the Element’s
analysis of constraints to the development and maintenance of housing. This information has been used to
establish reasonable estimates of what these programs and policies can accomplish.
The tables below estimate the number of units that could be constructed, rehabilitated and
conserved/preserved during the planning period (i.e., February 1, 2015 through January 31, 2023). The
quantified objectives do not represent a ceiling, but rather set a goal for the City to achieve, based on needs,
resources and constraints.
Construction Objectives
The quantified objectives for housing construction are based on the approved and under-construction
housing units shown in Table H-32, modified to reflect what is likely to be constructed during the planning
period. The 80 potential units greatly exceed the City’s share of regional housing needs for the period (i.e., 27)
and nearly two-thirds of the anticipated units would be affordable to low- and moderate-income households.
It should also be noted that 48 of the units are targeted to the farmworker special needs group.

11          PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT
The Public Safety Element provides information about risks in Calistoga due to natural and created hazards. Its policies are
designed to protect the community as much as possible from seismic, flood, geologic and wildfire hazards.
As required by State law, the Public Safety Element addresses the protection of the community from any
unreasonable risks associated with the effects of:
        •   Geologic hazards, including earthquakes, ground failure and subsidence and slope instability.
        •   Flooding, dam failure, tsunami and seiche.
        •   Wildland fires.
This element also contains information and policies regarding hazardous materials, airport safety and general
emergency preparedness.
The Public Safety Element establishes mechanisms to reduce death, injuries, damage to property and to
address the negative results from public safety hazards like flooding, fires and seismic events. Hazards are an
unavoidable aspect of life, and the Public Safety Element cannot eliminate risk completely. Instead, the
Element contains policies to create an acceptable level of risk.
I. GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
A. Background Information
Calistoga’s Basic Geology
The Napa Valley, in which Calistoga is located, lies within the east-central portion of the Coast Ranges
geomorphic province, a region characterized by northwest-trending valleys and mountain ranges. This
alignment of valleys and ridges has developed in response to folding and faulting along the San Andreas fault
system, which includes several faults east and west of Calistoga. Most of the Planning Area is located near
the center of the broad alluvial plain that occupies the floor of the Napa Valley, while part of it extends up
toward the surrounding hills.
Bedrock in the Calistoga area consists mainly of Sonoma Volcanics, dating from two to seven million years
ago. These rocks are mainly interbeded sediment, tuff and rhyolite. 1 Alluvial deposits ranging from two
million years old to less than 11,000 years old blanket the Napa Valley floor. These unconsolidated sediments
consist of interbedded sand, silt, clay and gravel deposited by the ancestral Napa River and its tributaries.
Seismic Activity and Related Geologic Hazards
As is the case for most of California, people and property in Calistoga are subject to risks from seismic
activity. Earthquakes have the potential to threaten humans, wildlife and infrastructure. As a result, it is
crucial to identify the risks associated with seismic activity and related phenomenon such as liquefaction and
collapse of soils.
1 Tuff is a rock composed of volcanic ash. Rhyolite is a volcanic flow rock.
                                                                                                                     SAF-1

PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT – 2014 UPDATE
Earthquakes can give rise to various seismic hazards including ground shaking, liquefaction, ground rupture
and the generation of large waves in bodies of water. These seismic hazards can cause damage to structures
and risk the health and safety of citizens, particularly in unreinforced masonry buildings. Seismic hazards vary
widely from area to area, and the level of hazard depends on both geologic conditions and the extent and type
of land use. There are two common measurements of earthquakes:
        •  The strength of an earthquake is measured using the Richter Scale, a numerical scale for quantifying
           earthquake magnitude. The Richter Scale is a logarithmic scale that measures the amount of energy
           released during an earthquake based on the amplitude of the highest peak recorded on a seismogram.
        •  The force of an earthquake at a particular place is measured on the Modified Mercalli Scale, which is
           a subjective ranking of earthquakes’ effects on persons and structures. Lower numbers on the scale
           indicate less severe shaking.
Table SAF-1 summarizes the Modified Mercalli Scale in relation to the Richter Scale.

Unlike many nearby communities, Calistoga has experienced only minor effects from recent major
earthquakes, most notably in 1989 with the 7.1 magnitude Loma Prieta earthquake and in 2000 with a smaller
5.2 magnitude earthquake centered nearby in Yountville. Although felt only slightly in Calistoga, the
September 3, 2000 Yountville Earthquake was the largest earthquake in this area since 1969. In that year, two
earthquakes, magnitude 5.6 and 5.7, struck Santa Rosa about 80 minutes apart. These three events are the
only earthquakes with magnitude greater than 5.0 to be felt in the Calistoga area since 1906. While the 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake (magnitude 6.9) caused widespread damage in many parts of the Bay Area, it was
scarcely perceptible in Calistoga.
During the last 200 years, however, several major earthquakes of Richter magnitude 7.0 or greater have
occurred along active faults 2 in the San Francisco region, resulting in loss of life and extensive property
damage. The largest earthquake to affect the region was the Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906, which

occurred on the San Andreas Fault. That earthquake caused extensive damage throughout the region. In
Calistoga, many chimneys were toppled and two brick buildings were destroyed.
Earthquakes are associated with faults. Faults in Napa County roughly parallel the northwest-southeast course
of the San Andreas Fault. Principal active faults located nearby are the Cordelia, Green Valley and West
Napa faults. No active faults are known to exist in Calistoga. The active fault closest to Calistoga is the West
Napa fault, the north terminus of which is approximately 15 miles south of Calistoga. A portion of this fault
was the cause of the Yountville earthquake, which shook the area in 2000. Another geological feature, known
as the Hunting Creek fault, is actually the northward extension of the Green Valley fault. In addition to these
faults, other seismic activity on more distant faults could also cause serious ground shaking in Calistoga.

200 years) displacement has occurred. Additional information on local and regional faults is contained in

The three main active faults in Napa County are capable of producing earthquakes with a Richter magnitude
of up to 6.7. Such an earthquake, which is considered a moderate-sized event, would be capable of producing
a substantial amount of damage. There is a high risk of an earthquake occurring in the next 50 years on one
of the nearby or regional faults listed in Table SAF-2. Consequently, the community is at significant risk from
earthquake activity.

Recent estimates prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey's Working Group on California Earthquake
Probabilities indicate that the overall probability of one or more large earthquakes, specifically with a
magnitude 7.0 or greater, in the Bay Area is approximately 67 percent in the next 30 years. Such earthquakes
are considered most likely to occur on the San Andreas, Rodgers Creek or Hayward faults. Although less
information is available for the other active faults in the region, they are also considered active and capable of
generating large earthquakes. Assuming that the earthquake epicenter is located on a nearby segment of one
of the principal active faults, strong ground shaking intensities of approximately VII to VIII on the Modified
Mercalli scale could be expected in the Calistoga area.
Earthquakes can cause a series of specific hazards, each of which is described below.
Ground Shaking. Earthquake ground shaking is the source of the most widespread earthquake damage. The
intensity of ground shaking can be several times larger on sites underlain by thick deposits of saturated
sediments than on bedrock. The amount of ground shaking at a particular site depends on:
       •   Characteristics of the earthquake source (magnitude, location, and area of causative fault surface).
       •   Distance from the fault.
       •   Amplification effects of local geologic deposits.
The US Geological Survey and the Association of Bay Area Governments have worked together to map the
likely intensity of groundshaking throughout the Bay Area under various earthquake scenarios. The greatest
mapped groundshaking scenario for Calistoga assumes a 6.7 magnitude earthquake on the Maacama Fault.
The predicted groundshaking in Calistoga from such an earthquake is mapped in Figure SAF-2.
Liquefaction. Liquefaction occurs when the strength of saturated, loose, granular materials such as silt, sand,
or gravel is dramatically reduced as a result of an earthquake. This earthquake-induced deformation
transforms a stable material into a temporary fluid-like state in which solid particles are virtually in
suspension, akin to quicksand.
Within Calistoga, liquefaction is a significant risk only in portions of the flat areas within the Napa River
floodplain. While no record of liquefaction has been found in Calistoga, the problem could occur due to the
alluvial nature of valley sediments. This potential risk is routinely assessed during site planning. The
California Building Code, adopted by ordinance by the City, specifies investigative measures to be
incorporated into site preparation and construction.
Ground Rupture. Ground rupture due to earthquakes occurs along fault lines. Since no known active faults
pass through Calistoga, no portion of the City or its Planning Area is thought to be subject to ground rupture.
Land Subsidence. Land subsidence, or settlement, is a slow-to-rapid downward movement of the ground
surface that can be caused by a variety of factors. Typically, significant subsidence occurs only in areas
underlain by soft soils such as marsh deposits or in areas susceptible to liquefaction. Because of the depth
and composition of alluvium in the Planning Area, land subsidence is likely to be restricted to instant com-
paction during earthquakes. Because the alluvial materials are relatively thin and granular, the risk of other
types of subsidence or settlement is low.
Tsunamis. A tsunami is a large sea wave generated by earthquakes. These waves travel cross the ocean at
hundreds of miles an hour and are capable of causing waves cresting tens of feet high. Since Calistoga has no
ocean frontage, the risk of a tsunami is very low. A tsunami at the Golden Gate opening of the San Francisco
Bay, with a run up of twenty feet, is likely to occur only once every 200 years, and even that size tsunami
would have no impact on Calistoga. Consequently, no action by the City is required with regard to tsunamis.

Unreinforced Masonry Buildings. Unreinforced masonry buildings, which are brick, stone or concrete
buildings built without structural steel reinforcements, represent a particular earthquake hazard since they can
easily fail in earthquakes.
State law requires cities to identify potentially hazardous Unreinforced Masonry (URM) buildings, develop
mitigation programs to reduce the hazards and submit the results to the State Seismic Safety Commission.
Some unreinforced buildings are exempt from the program under the law, including residential buildings with
five or fewer living units, buildings owned by the federal or State government, and warehouses or similar
buildings with few occupants, unless used for emergency services or supplies. Although historic buildings are
also exempt, the Seismic Safety Commission recommends they be included in mitigation programs.
Five URM buildings have been identified in Calistoga, primarily in the downtown area. One of these is in the
process of being, seismically upgraded. The construction type of another 10 buildings needs to be reviewed
by a licensed engineer to determine presence or absence of reinforcement.
Soils and Development
A range of different soil types are found within the Planning Area. Each of the soil types has properties that
may affect any development of the site that contains the soil.
Limitations to development due to soil type can range from slight (soil properties are favorable for the
specified use; any limitation is minor and easily overcome) to severe (soil properties or site features are so
unfavorable or difficult to overcome that a major increase in construction effort, special design or intensive
maintenance is required). The Calistoga Planning Area has no soil types that create severe development
limitations that could not be addressed through appropriate engineering techniques. Despite this, it remains
an important part of the planning approval process to ensure that appropriate soil studies and engineering are
carried out prior to development to ensure that soil-type limitations are adequately addressed.
Landslides and Ground Failure
Within and around the Napa Valley, landslides are common on most of the hills and mountains as loose
material moves down the slopes. Some of the natural causes of this instability are earthquakes, weak
materials, stream and coastal erosion, and heavy rainfall. In addition, certain human activities tend to make
the earth materials less stable and increase the chance of ground failure. Activities contributing to instability
include extensive irrigation, poor drainage or ground-water withdrawal, removal of stabilizing vegetation and
over-steepening of slopes by undercutting them or overloading them with artificial fill. These causes of
failure, which normally produce landslides and differential settlement, are augmented during earthquakes by
strong ground motion.
Figure SAF-3 provides a general indication of slope stability. It indicates four levels of slope-stability for
Calistoga and its Planning Area. Since a majority of the Planning Area is on the flat valley bottom, it has a
negligible slide risk. Land in these areas is generally stable and there is a low risk to life and property from
slide occurrence. Most of the lands surrounding the City, where the topography is gently sloping, are areas of
low slide occurrence and low risk to life and property.
Small areas near the outer northern, eastern, and western boundaries of the Planning Area have moderate to
high slide occurrence risk. Landsides have been experienced in the past 25 years in areas to the southwest of
Foothill Boulevard due to excessive rainfall, tree removal and grading. The danger from mudslides, also
known as debris flows, is similar to that for landslides.

The California Building Code requires that potential landslide risk be assessed during site planning. The City
also routinely requires geotechnical investigations and construction inspections for development.
B. Key Findings
1. The overall level of risk associated with geological hazards, including ground shaking and other
    earthquake hazards, liquefaction and landsliding, creates an important planning consideration in all parts
    of Calistoga.
2.   Four URM buildings (following completion of the current retrofit) pose a high risk of destruction during
    earthquakes unless retrofitted. The reinforcement status of another 10 buildings needs to be verified to
    determine whether seismic retrofits are required.
3. While construction engineering is generally able to compensate for particular development constraints
    presented by local soil types, it remains an important responsibility of the City to ensure that soils are
    adequately investigated and that buildings and sites appropriately engineered prior to development. The
    use of drought-tolerant plants for landscaping is also an important means of minimizing earth movement
    due to watering.
4. The California Building Code, which specifies requirements for seismic design, site planning,
    foundations, and drainage, is the most effective mechanism to address geologic hazards that exist in
    Calistoga.
C. Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions
      Goal SAF-1        Reduce risk to the community from earthquakes and other geologic hazards.

II. FLOODING AND INUNDATION
A. Background Information
Napa River Flooding
The Napa Valley is subject to extensive flooding from the Napa River and its tributaries. This flooding occurs
primarily due to heavy rains, generally in the period from December through March. Since 1862, more than
27 major floods have plagued the Napa Valley, resulting in significant loss and damage to property. Calistoga
experienced major flooding in 1983, 1986, 1995, 1997 and 1998, causing damage to property in developed
areas.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides guidance for floodplain management.
FEMA manages the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), providing insurance to the public in
communities that participate in the program. Property owners following FEMA regulations qualify for
federal flood insurance coverage.
FEMA uses the concept of the 100-year flood in its analysis. The 100-year flood represents a flood that is likely
to occur only once every 100 years, or, stated another way, which has a one percent chance of occurring
during any particular year. This event is also termed the base flood. The 100-year floodplain is the area that has
a one percent chance of being inundated during any particular 12-month period. This term does not mean
that such flooding will only occur once in a century; it is possible that the 100-year flood will occur more
often.
The 100-year floodplain is divided into two parts: the floodway and the fringe. The floodway is the channel
of a river and the adjacent land areas large enough to convey the 100-year flood with no more than a one-foot
rise in water surface. The floodway fringe makes up the rest of the floodplain. Areas of shallow flooding
may occur to a depth of up to three feet within the fringe. Within certain constraints, development is
typically allowed to encroach in this portion of the floodplain. FEMA’s 2008 Flood Insurance Rate Map

                                                                  PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT – 2014 UPDATE
(FIRM) delineates the 100-year floodplain (i.e., floodway and floodway fringe) for Calistoga (see Figure SAF-
4).
The most significant areas within the city limits that are subject to 100-year flooding are:
       • Areas around Silver Street, from about Gold Street to Spring Street, between the Napa River and
         Myrtle Street.
       • A crescent-shaped area around Washington Street, starting southeast of Oak Street, rising up Lake
         Street and Fourth Street, and extending almost to Second Street.
       • From Pine Street east to the city limits, between the Napa River and Foothill Boulevard.
       • Currently-vacant and publicly-owned land on the northeast side of the Napa River, from privately-
         owned Camp Street east to the city limits.
Existing development in these areas include single- and multi-family dwellings, bed and breakfast inns and
some commercial businesses on lower Washington Street that back up to the river. Public facilities located in
these areas include Calistoga Elementary School, the City’s corporation yard and the City’s wastewater
treatment facility, lift stations and storage ponds. Several critical aerial water and sewer lines also cross over
the Napa River, as do two bridges.
Future development in these areas could occur on privately-owned property that is currently zoned for
industrial, commercial and residential purposes. No new critical public facilities or roads are planned in these
locations.
Other Areas Subject to Flooding
Figure SAF-4 also depicts flood hazard areas that have the potential for development in areas that are not
mapped by the NFIP. These flood hazard areas have been identified along Cyrus Creek and Blossom Creek.
Flood Control Regulations
The floodplain management requirements of the Calistoga Municipal Code (Title 18) include the following
regulations that are intended to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions.
       •    New and substantially-improved residential construction in the floodplain must elevate the lowest
            floor, including basement, two feet above the base flood elevation.
       •    New and substantially-improved non-residential construction must comply with the elevation
            requirement or be flood-proofed below the base flood elevation so that the structure is watertight
            with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and have structural components
            capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
       •    New construction and substantial improvements with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor
            (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage must
            be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the
            entry and exit of floodwater.
       •    New and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems must be designed to minimize or
            eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems, and discharge from the systems into flood
            waters. On-site waste disposal systems must be located to avoid impairment to them, or
            contamination from them during flooding.
                                                                                                              SAF-11

        •   Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new
            development, are prohibited within the floodway unless a registered professional engineer certifies
            that encroachments will not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence
            of the base flood discharge.
Flood Control Efforts
The Napa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District and the US Army Corps of Engineers are
implementing the Napa River/Napa Creek Flood Protection Project, which is intended to minimize flood
dangers on the downstream portions of the Napa River. The project is based on a “living river” strategy that
relies on integrated flood control, combining watershed management and ecosystem protection to avert the
threat of future flooding. Project features include dike removal, channel modifications, biotechnical bank
stabilization, a dry bypass channel, limited set-back levees and floodwalls, bridge relocations, pump stations,
utility relocations, building demolition, maintenance roads, and recreation trails.
The project is being partially funded through a half-cent sales tax measure (Measure A) approved by Napa
County voters in 1998. By 2018, the sales tax is projected to generate over $120 million (1998 dollars) for the
living river strategy. All sales tax revenues in excess of bond debt service requirements will be allocated to
Napa County jurisdictions to finance local watershed projects. During the entire 20-year term of Measure A
revenues, Calistoga’s share is expected to be approximately $11 million, but could vary up or down,
depending upon continuously changing sales tax and interest rate assumptions.
Funds from the sales tax have been allocated to Calistoga projects, including flood protection and drainage
improvements in the Grant Street area, the replacement of a culvert that had collapsed at Fischer Street and
Lake Street, and other critical areas to protect residents and businesses from flooding.
Dam Failure
Calistoga is within the inundation area of the Kimball Reservoir. If the reservoir’s dam were to fail,
inundation could occur in the northern part of the Planning Area as far south as Tubbs Lane, as shown in
Figure SAF-5. Water from the overflow pond of the Kimball Dam would extend south as far as Tubbs Lane.
South of Tubbs Lane, dam failure would cause the Napa River to overflow its banks through the rest of the
City. Inundation data for the downstream part of the Planning Area in the event of a Kimball Reservoir
failure is unavailable. Measure A funding is being used to stabilize Kimball Reservoir.
Seiche
A seiche is a wave generated in a bay or lake, which can be compared to the back-and-forth sloshing of water
in a tub. Seiches can be caused by winds, changes in atmospheric pressure, underwater earthquakes, or
landslides into the water. Bodies of water including reservoirs, ponds, and swimming pools are likely to
experience seiche waves up to several feet in height during a strong earthquake. The risk of a serious seiche
occurring in Calistoga is quite low. Consequently, the City need not include actions with regard to seiche in
the Public Safety Element.
B. Key Findings
1. Areas of the city are subject to flooding from the Napa River and several creeks.
2. Much of Calistoga could be inundated by a failure of Kimball Dam.

           subsequent site-specific studies without the approval of a variance by the City Council.
    Actions
    A1.    Continue to administer the City’s floodplain management regulations.
    A2.    Encourage property owners in Calistoga to purchase National Flood Insurance to reduce the
           financial risk from flooding and mudflows.
    Objective SAF-2.2 Minimize risks associated with potential failure of Kimball Dam.
    Actions
    A1.    Maintain an evacuation plan for all land within areas subject to inundation downstream from
           Kimball Dam that could fail as a result of an earthquake.
    A2.    Encourage the state and federal governments to develop dam safety programs, including the
           preparation of contingency plans for urbanized areas in the proximity of dams.
III. WILDLAND FIRES
This section addresses wildland fires. Information and policies regarding urban fires are contained in the Fire
Protection Section of the Public Services Element.
A. Background Information
With its Mediterranean climate, Calistoga and its Planning Area experience a long, dry summer with high
wildland fire hazards. In 1964, the community was seriously threatened by a wildfire that led to the
evacuation of its residents. The Hanly Fire destroyed 35 to 45 homes in the Calistoga area and burned 52,000
acres in an area between Mt. Saint Helena, Knights Valley and Santa Rosa.
The risk of wildland fire hazard is related to a combination of factors, including winds, temperatures,
humidity levels, and fuel moisture content. Of these four factors, wind is the most critical. Steep slopes also
contribute to fire hazard by intensifying the effects of wind, and making fire suppression difficult. Features in
some parts of the Planning Area, including highly flammable vegetation, warm and dry summers, rugged
topography and occasional human presence create a situation that results in potential wildland fires.
                                                                                                             SAF-15

PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT – 2014 UPDATE
Fire Hazard Areas
To quantify this potential risk, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) has
developed a Fire Hazard Severity Scale that utilizes the following criteria to evaluate and designate potential
fire hazards in wildland areas: fuel loading (vegetation), fire weather (winds, temperatures, humidity levels and
fuel moisture contents) and topography (degree of slope).
Wildland fire hazards in the Planning Area are shown in Figure SAF-6. As shown in this figure, most of
Calistoga is not subject to wildfires. However, nearly all of the 370 acres south of Foothill Boulevard, which is
characterized by steep, wooded slopes is located within the Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, while the
area north of the Silverado Trail/Lincoln Avenue intersection is primarily classified in the High Fire Hazard
Severity Zone.
Wildfire Prevention
New development in Very High and High Fire Hazard Severity Zones is required by state law to utilize fire-
resistant building materials and provide adequate access for emergency vehicles. California Fire Code Chapter
49 establishes fire safety requirements for new construction in the wildland-urban interface fire area, which
have been incorporated into the Calistoga Municipal Code (CMC Chapter 15.36). New construction in
these zones is required to adhere to guidelines for defensible space, vegetation management in a fire-safe
manner, financial responsibility for maintenance of landscaping and open parcels (forest), and other
measures. In addition, a wildfire behavior model is required to specify building setbacks and fire resistive
ratings.
When a specific project or development is proposed within the wildland-urban interface fire area and cannot
meet the requirements of the building code, a wildland fire protection plan (WFPP) prepared by a license or
registered specialist is required to be submitted for review and approval. The protection plan
recommendations are then incorporated into conditions of approval for the project or development.
The Fire Department routinely inspects properties and homes in the Very High Fire Hazard Area to enforce
vegetation management requirements, and publicizes the chipping program provided by the Napa
Communities Firewise Foundation, which encourages the removal of dangerous vegetation. The Department
is familiar with the locations of all structures in this Area and available access.
However, the City does not have sufficient staff or funding resources to formally educate Area residents
about defensible space planning and construction, fire-safe landscaping, emergency supplies and evacuation,
wildfire behavior and “fire hardening” their homes to survive an advancing wildfire.
Wildfire Response
Because of limited local resources, a significant wildfire in Calistoga would require outside support from the
County, Cal Fire and nearby cities. A plan to coordinate this potential fire-fighting effort is needed to ensure a
timely and effective response.
Wildfire Recovery
Following a significant wildfire, prompt action is needed to avoid erosion, landslides and mudflows, and
provide for revegetation. The City does not have a recovery plan to coordinate these efforts.

PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT – 2014 UPDATE
B. Key Findings
1. The majority of the City is classified as being at low risk from wildland fires because of its flat topography
      and limited flammable vegetation. However, higher wildfire hazards exist south of Foothill Boulevard
      and north of Silverado Trail in steeply sloping areas surrounding the City.
2. Residents within the Very High Fire Hazard Area need to be educated about wildfire prevention and
      mitigation, and be involved in these efforts.
3. A plan to coordinate the response to a significant wildfire is needed.
4. A plan for impact minimization and recovery after a significant wildfire is needed.

P2.    Support efforts to organize residents within the Very High Fire Hazard Area to promote fire-wise
       practices.
Actions
A1.    As resources are available, educate residents about defensible space planning and construction, fire-
       safe landscaping, fire-wise construction, emergency supplies and evacuation, wildfire behavior and
       “fire hardening” their homes to survive an advancing wildland fire through workshops and
       providing information.
A2.    As resources are available, work to establish a Fire Safe Council and the preparation of a
       community action plan that prioritizes hazard mitigation actions and provides a sustained program
       of wildfire mitigation.
A3.    Support events that involve residents in vegetation clean-up.
A4.    Seek fire safety grants to fund wildfire mitigation activities such as vegetation management.
Objective SAF-3.4 Respond to wildfires in an effective and coordinated manner.
Policies
P1.    Maximize the use of outside resources in responding to wildfires.
P2.    Maintain effective communications during major mutual aid incidents.
Actions
A1.    Work with Cal Fire to develop a coordinated plan that effectively addresses wildfires in the city and
       its environs.
A2.    Participate in countywide local hazard mitigation planning efforts and the implementation of fire
       hazard mitigation actions.
A3.    Continue to implement state and federal communication and interoperability guidelines and
       maintain sufficient communication equipment.
Objective SAF-3.5 Minimize post-wildfire damage and promote recovery.
Policies
P1.    Be prepared to minimize damage after a wildfire from erosion, landslides and mudflows.
P2.    Promote appropriate revegetation after a wildfire.
Actions
A1.    Seek funding for and prepare a burn area recovery plan that provides for revegetation; control of
       noxious weeds; restoration of native species and wildlife habitats; minimizes flooding, sediment
       flows and landslides; protects water quality and reduces other risks.
A2.    Plan for the disposal of debris and ash, building inspections, and building and grading permits
       post-wildfire.
                                                                                                          SAF-19

PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT – 2014 UPDATE
IV. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTE
A. Background Information
The State Water Resources Control Board maintains an up-to-date database of known hazardous waste sites.
In March 2013, there were two sites within the city, both of which involve clean up of former leaking
underground fuel tanks. Information on this database is shared by the City with members of the public who
may be concerned about these sites, particularly when they are for sale or lease by prospective purchasers or
tenants.
Cleanup of sites that exceed State standards for contamination by toxic materials is required prior to
development or reuse of the site. No cleanup requirement exists where there is no potential for site
disturbance, such as grading. The cleanup process is monitored by the California Department of Toxic
Substances Control.
B. Key Finding
1. There are two known hazardous waste sites in Calistoga, both of which are being remediated.
C. Goal, Objective and Actions
        Goal SAF-4          Protect the community from the harmful effects of hazardous materials.
      Objective SAF-4.1 Minimize Calistoga residents’ exposure to the harmful effects of hazardous
                               materials and waste.
      Actions
      A1.    Consider the potential for the production, use, storage, and transport of hazardous materials when
             reviewing new development, issuing business permits and approving changes in business
             operations. Provide for reasonable controls on such hazardous material use.
      A2.    Work with property owners to remediate hazardous waste sites.
V. AIRPORT SAFETY
A. Background Information
Calistoga is within the distant flight path of Travis Air Force Base in Solano County. Travis Air Force Base is
approximately 40 miles from Calistoga so the altitudes at which its aircraft fly over Calistoga area do not
constitute a particular hazard.
VI. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
A. Background Information
Calistoga has established emergency preparedness procedures to respond to a variety of natural and man-

associated with an emergency, such as an earthquake or flood, including mitigation, preparedness, response,
and recovery. The Department’s primary emergency services responsibilities are to:
         •     Administer effective preparation activities through training and education for City government
               and the public in order to prepare for emergencies and disasters.
         •     Identify potential disaster situations and provide mitigation solutions.
         •     Design and practice effective response plans for emergencies or disasters.
         •     Design and administer effective recovery activities that include both public and private sectors,
               including coordination with local jurisdictions, the County, the State, and federal agencies for
               both financial and material resources.
         •     Supplement operating procedures of City departments and provide for coordination between
               these departments in emergency situations.
         •     Provide for the continuity of government during emergencies.
During certain emergencies, the Emergency Operations Center is opened at the fire station and is operated in
accordance with the Standardized Emergency Management System, a statewide system that manages response
to multi-agency and multi-jurisdiction emergencies. The Emergency Response Plan for the City of Calistoga
Water System further provides a standardized response and recovery protocol for emergencies and disasters
that affect the community’s water supply.

13 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
   The Economic Development Element reflects the community’s desire to
   maintain a balanced mix of economic activity for residents and visitors
   alike and to encourage the development of particular economic sectors in
   Calistoga. The Economic Development Element contains goals, objectives,
   policies and actions to encourage the development of the kinds of business
   and commercial activities deemed to be suitable for Calistoga’s quality of
   life and economic viability, while also preserving Calistoga’s rural, small-
   town character.
   A. Background Information
   Like much of the Napa Valley, the City of Calistoga and its Planning
   Area are a popular tourist destination. Although it has only one winery       Calistoga’s up-valley location
                                                                                 and unique geothermal resources
   and limited vineyards, Calistoga is home to numerous restaurants, hotels,
                                                                                 have created a distinct economic
   spas, and other hospitality-related businesses. Yet Calistoga is distinct
                                                                                 environment and local character
   from the other cities in the Napa Valley due to its access to geothermal
                                                                                 that sets it apart from other
   resources. The unique hot springs, geysers and other geothermal features
                                                                                 Napa Valley communities.
   shape the economic landscape of Calistoga. At the same time, Calistoga,
   with its up-valley location, away from the better known Napa wine-
   producing areas, is somewhat removed from the center of the winery-
   based Napa Valley tourist trade. Instead, Calistoga attracts visitors who
   seek its unique qualities and relaxed character.
   Calistoga has also traditionally enjoyed a fairly large trade area due to its
   location at the far northern end of the Napa Valley, away from the draw
   area of the larger city of Napa. The City serves as a commerce and service
   center for its own residents, as well as certain southern Lake County and
   northern Napa County communities.
   Recent Trends in Economic Growth
   Calistoga’s economic expansion in recent decades has been more re-
   strained than that of the wider Napa Valley. Although the Planning Area

                                   not been focused on its industrial sector, and as a result the City has not
                                   experienced the same industrial boom that has characterized much of the
                                   down-valley region around the city of Napa. This is due in large part to
                                   Calistoga’s location in the uppermost part of the Valley, away from major
                                   population centers and far from direct access to freeways.

                                   While Calistoga’s limited growth in recent years might be interpreted
                                   negatively when considered purely in terms of economic development, it
                                   is important to note that it is this same trend that has allowed the City to
                                   preserve its small-town, rural community character and quality of life,
                                   and to avoid the commercialization and corresponding loss of rural char-

high-paid employment in Calistoga. As shown in Figure ED-1, relatively
few jobs in the community are in skilled sectors such as finance, insurance

Commercial Real Estate Market
The majority of businesses seeking commercial space in Calistoga are ei-
ther high-end retailers or lodging businesses seeking to expand into the
Calistoga market. High-end retailers generally seek small- to medium-
sized spaces, offering 1,200 to 2,000 square feet. Lodging businesses gen-
erally seek large undeveloped parcels of several acres in natural or aes-
thetically-pleasing surroundings.
Calistoga’s supply of such commercial spaces and parcels does not match
demand. The mismatch between supply and demand for retail and lodg-
ing space has been heightened by a lack of new commercial development

Fiscal and Financial Conditions
Calistoga, like virtually every other city in California, funds most of its
public services through its General Fund. A breakdown of General Fund
revenue sources is shown in Figure ED-2.
Constituting almost half of all General Fund revenues, the transient occu-
pancy tax (TOT), which derives exclusively from the taxation of tempo-
rary overnight lodgings, is the single largest source of revenues available
for discretionary spending by the administration of Calistoga.
Other General Fund revenues come from property tax. The City collects
relatively low amounts of property tax, which can be attributed to two
factors:
  ¡ An older housing stock combined with a low resale rate, which keeps
     assessed values locked at a level significantly less than current market
     value.
  ¡ Large vacant and agricultural parcels with minimal improvements
     that have been transferred intergenerationally from owner to owner.
     This also has the effect of locking property values below their current
     market value.
City Procurement of Services

services and products. To a certain extent it can represent the concerns of   Purchasing decisions made by the

Opportunities for Economic Expansion
Given the issues, opportunities and constraints described above, Calistoga
can focus on five specific areas that offer the potential for economic ex-
pansion in keeping with the City’s existing character:
 ¡ Strategies for economic development should focus on the City’s
    strengths, including its small-town character and lifestyle, its compact
    pedestrian scale, and the affordable housing stock relative to other
    Napa County communities. Such strategies should recognize these
    assets while at the same time embrace opportunities for diversifica-
    tion.
 ¡ Where growth occurs in spas, lodging and hospitality services, focus
    on areas where the existing market has not captured customers. As
    noted above, lodging supplies roughly half of the City’s General
    Fund revenues through TOT taxes and also provides much of the
    City’s current employment base. Although existing lodging facilities
    can be maintained to serve the existing clientele, new visitor accom-
    modations should focus on a higher-end customer base. New, well-
    ness-based services are a further area of opportunity for business ex-
    pansion in Calistoga. Each of these uses will offer even more reve-
    nues and some higher paying jobs without competing directly with
    the existing spa and visitor-serving market, the qualities of which are
    an important component of local community character.
 ¡ Increased involvement in the wine industry. This can include vine-
    yards and wineries, as well as corollary businesses such as cooperages,
    printers and distributors. Although the southern Napa Valley has
    locational advantages for these industries due to its proximity to the
    Bay Area’s major population centers and transportation infrastruc-
    ture, the continuing expansion of the wine industry may lead to op-
    portunities in the north part of the Napa Valley as well.
 ¡ Development of knowledge-based "new economy" businesses such as
    software and internet development and other information technol-
                                                                        ED-9

CI TY OF CALI STOGA

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
    ogy-based enterprises. Such businesses, particularly those with only a
    few workers, can work within existing and potential spaces that can
    be offered in downtown Calistoga.
  ¡ Freeing up the highly-visible street-level commercial spaces along
    Lincoln Avenue for small retailers, which would create a solid iden-
    tity for Calistoga’s downtown while also maximizing the amount of
    space dedicated to commercial activities around the downtown core.
    By creating more of a critical mass of diverse businesses – both retail
    and non-retail – in the downtown along Lincoln Avenue, this strat-
    egy could bring more foot traffic onto Lincoln Avenue and increase
    its desirability as a place to congregate, socialize, and spend money.
B. Key Findings
1.       Given Calistoga’s unique character, the City needs tailored eco-
         nomic development strategies that will help to ensure that new
         economic development fits within and maintains "small-town"
         character.
2.       Land use and economic development policies must treat Calis-
         toga’s spa and visitor accommodation industry as a critical asset,
         while at the same time look for opportunities to diversify the
         economy.
3.       Because of the City's relatively remote location, the options for
         bringing new non-visitor-serving economic activities to Calistoga
         are comparatively limited. Where there is very little market in-
         terest in conventional industrial development in Calistoga, de-
         mand for small-office space is strong, and may reflect the poten-
         tial for development of knowledge and information-based busi-
         nesses in the City that seek such facilities.

4. Any economic diversification strategy for Calistoga must be
   based on the City’s strengths, which include:
   ¡ A compact pedestrian scale.
   ¡ An affordable housing stock relative to other locations in
       Napa County.
   ¡ The existing small-town lifestyle.
5. Calistoga has a relatively large number of low-skill, low wage jobs
   filled by people living outside the City, and a lack of higher-
   paying, higher-skilled jobs.
6. Calistoga has a limited supply of existing retail space and sites for
   lodging relative to very high demand.
7. The City’s existing visitor accommodations occupy a market
   niche as family-oriented businesses with an emphasis on moder-
   ately-priced rest and relaxation. They serve the needs of an im-
   portant portion of the potential clientele, and should be retained.
   Additional visitor accommodations, with or without spas, serving
   more upscale clientele could also be developed.
8. The burgeoning Napa Valley wine industry offers opportunities
   for economic expansion in Calistoga, both in vineyards and win-
   eries and in related secondary industries.
9. “New economy” businesses based on science and technology may
   have the potential to locate in Calistoga, both because they tend
   to be less influenced by locational constraints such as distance to
   markets, and because they often have fewer employees and spe-
   cialized space requirements, so can be accommodated within ex-
   isting and potential space available in Calistoga.

10.   Opportunities also exist for development and expansion of inno-
      vative businesses focusing on health and wellness.
11.   The underutilized sites in the downtown offer several good op-
      portunities to intensify development without necessarily chang-
      ing the area’s overall character or scale. New office business can
      take advantage of the small-scale downtown by locating in exist-
      ing office mixed-use buildings.
12.   Opportunities for expanding and maintaining a local serving eco-
      nomic presence, in areas such as professional services, medical of-
      fices, and non-visitor oriented retail exist at the edge of the down-
      town, and as second story uses along Lincoln Avenue.
13.   As a corporate entity and public citizen, the City of Calistoga can
      directly affect the local economy, through its regulatory and pur-
      chasing powers.

12 GEOTHERMAL ELEMENT
   Given their importance to Calistoga’s economy and character, geothermal
   resources warrant special treatment in the City’s General Plan. The
   Geothermal Element provides the City with direction in the regulation
   and enhancement of geothermal resources in Calistoga.
   A. Background Information
   Calistoga is located in a geothermal area that essentially underlies the
   entire city and much of the surrounding area. The geothermal aquifer in
   the area has relatively low temperature, on the order of 200 to 210 degrees
   Fahrenheit. Because the geothermal temperatures are fairly low, the
   geothermal resource is most suitable for direct-use projects such as heating Calistoga’s worldwide reputa-
   of buildings, greenhouses, spas and other facilities.                        tion as a spa/resort community
                                                                                has brought significant develop-
   Geothermal Resources                                                         ment and the creation of an
   Calistoga has several related geothermal resources that are used in the spa  economy based largely on
   and mineral water industries. A Geothermal Resource Assessment study,        tourism.
   was completed in 1986 by the California Energy Commission. This study
   mapped the geochemical and hydrological characteristics of the               Other issues associated with this
   geothermal reservoir, and examined the rate of its use by the City, local    resource are addressed elsewhere
   water bottlers and spas. The report concluded that Calistoga’s geothermal    in     the    General      Plan,
   resources had an expected life of only 100 years. Monitoring and             particularly in the Land Use
   managing geothermal activities is necessary to prevent over-depletion of     and Economic Development
   these vital resources.                                                       Elements.
   Hot Springs. Two of Calistoga's major industries, the spa/resort industry
   and mineral water bottling, rely on the City’s world-famous mineral
   water resources. Calistoga's historic roots lie in its development as a spa.
   Since those early days, the name “Calistoga” has continued to invoke
   associations with healing waters and rural relaxation, and the City’s image
   as a spa/resort location seems as strong today as ever. The spas, resorts,
   retail stores and restaurants that cater to visitors attracted by the hot
                                                                           G-1

GEOTHERMAL ELEMENT
springs and related facilities comprise the City’s largest single source of
employment.
Cold Water Aquifer. Calistoga's cold-water aquifer provides water for a
number of properties that are not connected to the City's water supply
and instead rely on wells. The cold water aquifer also contributes to local
mineral waters, as described below. Maintenance of sufficient quantity
and quality of the cold-water aquifer water is therefore vital to the use of
geothermal resources.
Mineral Water. Mineral waters are derived from the mixing zone
between the cold water aquifer and geothermal resource. The local water
bottling industry relies on the quality and purity of Calistoga's mineral
water resources. Calistoga's two major bottling plants provide the
majority of employment in Calistoga's manufacturing sector.
Production of mineral waters is not likely to cause significant depletion of
the geothermal resource, which is deeper than the zone from which
mineral waters are derived. However, it is critical that the purity of both
the geothermal resource and the cold water aquifer be maintained if the
mineral water industry is to thrive.
Volcanic Ash. Volcanic ash, deposited millions of years ago from
eruptions of nearby Mount St. Helena, is used by the local spa industry
for mud baths. Most spas in the City own property where ash is
excavated, or they buy ash from local property owners.
While the size of the City’s volcanic ash deposits are not known, they are
believed to be abundant, with current levels of use depleting them at a
relatively slow rate. However, Calistoga’s volcanic ash resources, which
are non-renewable, have never been comprehensively surveyed. Further
studies would be required to establish the likelihood of this resource being
exhausted within the City limits in the foreseeable future.

                                                   GEOTHERMAL ELEMENT
On a regional level, volcanic ash is an abundant constituent within the
Sonoma Volcanics, which is a geological formation appearing in many
places throughout much of Lake, Napa and Sonoma counties. Therefore,
protection of the volcanic ash resource is probably unnecessary from a
regional perspective. Disposal of volcanic ash waste from mud bath use is
not considered to be problematic, since it is a non-toxic, naturally
occurring mineral substance.
Geothermal Resource Uses
As noted above, Calistoga’s spa and mineral water industries are based on
geothermal resources. Current uses of the geothermal resource are
primarily direct use for heating of spas, greenhouses and a few private
residences.
At the same time, the geothermal resource beneath Calistoga is relatively
little used for energy. Currently, there is no power generation using
geothermal resources in the Calistoga area. During the late 1980’s and
early 1990’s studies were conducted by Dames & Moore to assess the
feasibility of constructing a heating system for the downtown area. The
project was judged to be feasible from an engineering standpoint and the
heating system was never constructed.
Geothermal Resource Regulation
In evaluating policies which the City of Calistoga might employ to
regulate or encourage geothermal development, it is important to
understand that the City regulates only the above ground portion of
geothermal projects, even with the city limits. Well permits are issued by
Napa County, and overall responsibility for regulation of the geothermal
industry lies with the California Department of Conservation Division of
Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources and the California Energy
Commission. Although the City may undertake geothermal exploration
or development, it does not have regulatory responsibility for permitting
or monitoring of geothermal development or maintenance of geothermal
                                                                       G-3

resources. The City does, however, require a Conditional Use Permit for
these uses.
B. Key Findings
1. Based on a 1986 study completed by the California Energy
    Commission, Calistoga's geothermal resource then had an expected
    life of only 100 years. Geothermal activities need to be monitored
    and managed to prevent over-rapid depletions of this vital resource.
2. Calistoga's geothermal resources are a significant contributor to the
    local economy, supporting Calistoga's reputation as a spa destination,
    the associated hospitality, restaurant and retail sectors, and the local
    mineral water bottling industry.
3. Volcanic ash resources in the City should be protected since they are
    non-renewable. However, there are large deposits of volcanic ash
    throughout the region, so on-going use is appropriate.
4. Geothermal development is already subject to extensive regulation by
    State and County agencies. Public interests are sufficiently protected
    through these regulations without establishment of extensive new
    City regulations. However, the City should monitor geothermal
    development to determine if and when new City regulations are
    warranted for protection of local interests.

7        INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
         The Infrastructure Element provides information and policy guidance related to community infrastructure
         available in Calistoga and its Planning Area.
State law does not require an Element covering these topics, however it does require the Land Use
Element to include “the proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses of the
land for...solid and liquid waste disposal facilities...”1 and it requires the Circulation Element to include
information on “the general location and extent of existing and proposed...public utilities and facilities.” 2
These components are included in this Element, which covers the following topics:
     •   Water Facilities and Service
     •   Wastewater Collection and Treatment
     •   Water Reclamation
     •   Stormwater Collection
Where a project is proposed and is accompanied by a development agreement providing significant
benefit to the City, the timing of both the buildout of the project and the City’s provision of utilities
thereto shall be established.
I.       WATER FACILITIES AND SERVICE
A.       Background Information
The City of Calistoga’s water system has grown from a small municipal reservoir in Feige Canyon in the
first half of the century to include a municipal reservoir in Kimball Canyon, drinking water production
from wells in Feige Canyon and the construction of the 12.3-mile North Bay Aqueduct (NBA)
connection to the City of Napa’s water system. The latter development, completed in 1984, represents
the most recent major water facilities upgrade in the City. Since the Feige wells are currently inactive, all
public water in Calistoga is currently provided by the Kimball Reservoir and NBA sources.
Water Facilities Plan
The City contracted with Summit Engineering, Inc. in February 1999 to prepare a Water Facilities Plan.
Partial impetus for this plan came from the State Department of Health Services (DHS) requirement that
the City develop a plan and schedule to address Calistoga’s water supply deficit. The Water Facilities
Plan was developed to provide water sufficient for growth projections contained in the 1990 General
Plan, which was then in force and which projected a population at build out of 8,025 residents.
Published in May 2000, the Final Water Facilities Plan provides an exhaustive look at water facilities and
supply for Calistoga. It identifies improvements necessary to continue to provide adequate, dependable

and safe drinking water. Most information in this section of this Infrastructure Element is taken from
the Final Water Facilities Plan.
Water Service Area
The City provides water service to approximately 1,960 accounts within the city limits and a few
properties just outside. Most properties in the unincorporated part of the Planning Area rely on their
own wells. The general extent of existing water service is shown in Figure I-1.
Approximately four percent of the water accounts are connections outside of the city limits, primarily
along Petrified Forest Road and on Route 128 northwest of the City. Residential users represent 90
percent of the water accounts but only 60 percent of water consumption. Commercial accounts
consume one-quarter of the water while representing only 8 percent of all water accounts. Industrial and
public/institutional uses consume 11 percent and 3 percent of the water, respectively, while each
represents only 4 percent of the water accounts.
The Equivalent Dwelling Unit (EDU) provides a convenient method to compare water usage among
different accounts equally. This is accomplished by converting commercial, industrial and other non-
residential consumption amounts into a figure representing the number of dwellings that would consume
an equivalent amount of water. On this basis, the current 1,960 accounts are equal to 2,485 EDUs,
where each EDU is equivalent to the average water demand of Calistoga households, i.e., 272 gallons per
day. The EDU is used for facility planning to convert industrial and commercial water demand into the
comparable residential need.
Existing Water Storage Facilities
The City of Calistoga historically derived its water supply from three different sources: Kimball
Reservoir, the NBA, and wells located at Feige Canyon. The Feige Canyon wells are currently inactive.
More information about these facilities can be found in the Infrastructure and Service Analysis Working
Paper published as an existing conditions report in preparation of the 2003 General Plan.
Calistoga’s water system is driven by the water level in the one-million gallon Feige water tank. The City
typically sets the Kimball Reservoir in the lead position until the Kimball Reservoir storage level drops to
between 20 and 30 million gallons, at which point the NBA source is set in the lead position. This
alteration system is known as a “lead-lag” arrangement.
Calistoga has a current annual entitlement to 1,000 acre-feet of State Water project supply, received via
the North Bay Aqueduct pipeline as a subcontractor to the Napa County Flood Control and Water
Conservation District. The City has entitlement to an additional 925 acre-feet of State Water Project
water to ensure that it can receive 1,000 acre-feet during periods of restriction. The structure of the
contracts includes a “build-up” schedule that allows for an additional 25 acre-feet of water each year
until the maximum annual water entitlement is reached. In 2000, the City completed an agreement to
purchase 925 acre-feet of State Water Project entitlements from the Kern County Water Agency.
The City maintains finished water storage facilities at Feige Canyon. Typically, storage capacity should
satisfy peak-day demand, meet fire-reserve needs and serve as emergency reserve in case of disruption of
supply or transmission. In addition, the 25,000 gallon High Street tank is filled from the City system to
serve a limited number of properties in that part of Calistoga.

The one-million gallon Feige Tank is the City’s primary storage facility for treated water. The 25,000
gallon High Street tank was overhauled in 1994 and is currently operating without any problems. The
City currently lacks the water storage capacity needed to provide adequate operating storage, fire-reserves
storage and emergency reserves for its existing water system. The current storage deficit is 0.859 million
gallons, and is projected to increase under build out conditions of the 2003 General Plan.
The City is currently in the process of developing preliminary engineering and environmental review of a
new 1.5 million gallon water tank on the east side of town, which would hydraulically balance the system
and solve the current storage deficit. A third storage tank will still be needed to serve build out.
Water Transmission and Distribution System
The City maintains approximately 134,000 lineal feet of potable water distribution piping made up of a
number of materials, including cast iron, ductile iron, spiral-wound steel, asbestos cement and plastic,
varying in diameter from two to twelve inches. In addition to the City-owned NBA, two transmission
mains connect the Kimball and Feige supplies with the Feige storage tank.
Water Supply and Demand
Water supply and demand was calculated in the Water Facilities Plan for 2015 and 2032, and not for the
General Plan horizon year of 2020. Therefore, information in this section refers to 2015 and 2032.
For water supply planning purposes, it is necessary to identify the quantity of water that can be reliably
obtained from each source. The quantity of water available from an individual water supply source will
vary over a given period depending on numerous factors, such as hydrologic conditions like rainfall,
regulatory limitations and contractual agreements with water contractors.
A public water supply is required by State law to have capacity to “adequately, dependably and safely”
meet the maximum demands of the system. This capacity is known as the firm yield. The DHS has
accepted the “90 percent reliability yield estimate” as the firm yield value to be used in determining
future source development needs for Calistoga. This approach uses historical production results over an
extended period of time to identify the yield that can be expected to occur 90 percent of the time. The
Water Facilities Plan considered below-normal water yield to be equivalent to the firm yield and to the 90
percent reliability yield value.
Table I-1 compares current and projected water demand and yield with available resources for three
water-years. It includes all approved water entitlements (including that obtained from the Kern County
Water Agency in 2000) and assumes that the Kimball Reservoir will be dredged for maintenance and
equipped with an inflatable dam by 2005.
The City’s two active supply sources, Kimball Reservoir and the NBA, provided a total of 606 acre-feet
of below-normal-year yield in 2000 and 627 acre-feet in 2002. This will increase annually by 25 acre-feet
(normal year), which represents a below-normal-year flow of 13 acre-feet, through 2019. The 925 acre-
feet of Kern County Water Agency water entitlements provides an additional 480 acre-feet of below-
normal-year-yield, for a current (2002) below-normal-year yield of 926 acre-feet and a below-normal-year
yield in 2015 of 1,078 acre-feet.
As shown in Table I-1, the City currently has a water supply surplus of 509 acre-feet in a normal year,
and a water surplus of 4 acre-feet in a below-normal water yield year. Below-normal-year demand under

2002 and 2015 conditions is calculated at 922 acre-feet and 1,072 acre-feet, respectively. As the table
shows, except in dry years, the City will have adequate water supplies past the General Plan buildout year
of 2020. Since the table assumes an annual growth rate of 1.5 percent, and the General Plan Update
assumes a 1.35 percent growth rate, the demand would actually be less under the Update. These water
use projections are based on long-term average per capita water usage and population growth, assuming
that the ratio of residential and commercial/industrial development stays the same. Any deviation from
the current land use balance may result in water demands that were not anticipated in the Water Facilities
Plan.

Approximately two-thirds of this amount is associated with the capital cost of facilities upgrades
necessary to address current water system deficiencies, while the remainder is needed to serve future
growth.
These capital improvements will also generate additional operational costs. Planned upgrades include:
     •    Pipeline replacement, including replacement and realignment of the Kimball and Feige
          transmission mains.
     •    Kimball Water Treatment Plant improvements.
     •    Installation of an inflatable dam on the Kimball Reservoir spillway and maintenance dredging of
          the reservoir.
     •    Pump Station reconfiguration.
     •    Construction of a new water storage tank and repair of the Feige Tank.
     •    Feige wells restoration.
These improvements, in conjunction with the KCWA entitlement purchase in 2001, are anticipated to be
sufficient to satisfy projected buildout water demands.
                                                                                                                     I-5

Water Reuse and Conservation Measures
Historically, Calistoga’s water conservation program has been limited to toilet and showerhead
replacement and a leak detection and repair program. The Water Facilities Plan recommends water
conservation programs to help address the City’s current and buildout needs during the most extreme
dry year occurrences.
The City recently adopted the California Urban Water Conservation Council’s Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) Regarding Urban Water Conservation in California as a requirement of the City’s
application for State Revolving Fund financing for the Wastewater Treatment Plant Upgrade Project.
This document contains a series of comprehensive and potential conservation Best Management
Practices (BMPs), and outlines potential water savings from application of these conservation measures.
The City developed a draft water conservation plan, which was completed in June 2002, in conformance
with the MOU.
Savings of 10 to 15 percent of water use for a single-family home can result from the installation of ultra
low flow fixtures such as toilets, showerheads and faucets. Data obtained in a study sponsored by the
American Water Works Association indicates that inside water use can be reduced by 32 percent by
installing water efficient fixtures and appliances readily available to the average resident. Installation of
water efficient landscaping, including the use of drought-tolerant native plants and xeriscaping, has also
been shown to significantly reduce water consumption, with water-efficient landscaping requiring up to
30 percent less water than standard landscaping.
B.        Key Findings
1.        The existing water system is generally well designed and operated. The City has two current
          sources of supply which adequately meet water demands in the normal year and below-normal
          year situations. Decisions made in the past which established these sources of supply were well-
          founded and will allow the City to effectively meet water planning needs in the future.
2.        Calistoga’s needs during the most extreme dry year occurrences can be addressed by full use of
          the recent entitlement purchase coupled with annual banking of unused State Water Project
          water, existing water conservation measures and future upgrades to the Feige wells for
          intermittent use.
3.        Construction of a third storage tank in addition to the new 1.5-million gallon tank on the
          northeast side of the Napa River will be needed to address water storage deficits that would
          occur under projected City buildout.

         new development. A policy should also be developed for existing developments that is based on
         a voluntary program with compelling incentives to achieve specific targets for water
         conservation. Examples include:
         •   Ultra-low flush toilets
         •   Plumbing retrofits
         •   Leak detection

         •   Swimming pool and spa conservation measures such as covers to reduce evaporation
         •   Xeric landscape design standards
II.      WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT
A.       Background Information
Information on the existing wastewater system is somewhat difficult to assemble, due to the fact that the
City has no wastewater master plan. Therefore, the identification of current and future deficiencies
contained here was based primarily on discussions with Department of Public Works staff and spatial
analysis of the existing system layout by Summit Engineering staff. New information will be available
when the City prepares a wastewater system master plan, which is currently budgeted for 2002.
Wastewater Collection System
The network of pipes through which wastewater flows from homes and businesses is known as the
sanitary sewer system or wastewater collection system. The pipes that directly connect indoor plumbing
systems to the public wastewater collection system is known as either the sewer service or the lateral
connection; the latter term is used in this chapter.
Service Area
The City of Calistoga operates a wastewater collection system that currently serves about half the area
within the city limits, in the areas shown in Figure I-2. The other parts of Calistoga, and the rest of the
Planning Area, use private septic systems to dispose of their wastewater.
Private septic systems have the potential to generate problems due to failure and discharge of
contaminants into the environment. The City’s Municipal Code requires all structures with plumbing
which are on properties within two hundred feet of a wastewater sewer to connect to the public system.
This measure has not always been enforced, however.
                                                                                                         I-9

C I T Y  O F  C A L I S T O G A G E N E R A L P L A N                   2003 INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
Existing Wastewater Collection Facilities
Calistoga’s wastewater collection system consists of pipes made up of a variety of materials, including
concrete, clay, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and asbestos cement. Pipes range in diameter from 4 to 18
inches. Figure I-2 shows the layout of the wastewater collection system. Many components of the
system require improvement.
Installed in the mid-1960s, the 18-inch clay trunk line that runs along Washington Street to the
wastewater treatment plant appears to be severely undersized. A significant portion of its alignment is
partially above ground, where it is subject to the elements and to damage from surface activities.
It is reported to have minor cracks along its length. Improvements are also needed in several other parts
of the wastewater network.
Wastewater Quality
The wastewater collection system is affected by the character and quality of the flows discharged to the
sewer. The variety of non-domestic facilities within the City, particularly spas and other customers using
mud and geothermal resources, as well as the large number of restaurants, present significant challenges
to the operation and maintenance of the wastewater collection and treatment system. Title 13 of the
Municipal Code requires a permit for any discharge other than domestic sewage. However, Calistoga
currently has few resources available to monitor and enforce the provisions of these permits.
The Municipal Code also requires that grease, oil and sand traps or interceptors be provided for
restaurants, carwashes, breweries, mud baths and bottling plants. Most establishments are reported to
have interceptors; however, there is no inspection program in place to ensure that these facilities are
adequately maintained and functional.
Installation of grease traps or interceptors at commercial establishments in the downtown would be
problematic due to the lack of available space along the Lincoln Avenue frontage. Mud traps and the
implementation of best management practices would help reduce sediment problems, but requiring them
may not be enforceable. The City has therefore requested that private pretreatment facilities retain
wastewater for an interval of time to permit solids to settle and to allow oil and grease to separate.
Wastewater Treatment
The City of Calistoga owns, operates and maintains an advanced wastewater treatment plant near
Dunaweal Lane. As required by State law, it is regulated by the San Francisco Regional Water Quality
Control Board.
Calistoga’s wastewater treatment system uses anaerobic digestion to break down the primary sludge and
aerobic digestion to process secondary (algae) sludge. Treated effluent is disposed of in two ways.
When the Napa River has sufficient water flow -- generally from September 30 to May 15 -- the Water
Quality Board allows discharge to the river. Pond and turf reclamation facilities are used during the rest
of the year. The sludge is placed in sludge drying beds until the liquids are removed, and then delivered
to a landfill.
Existing and Projected Treatment Demands. The wastewater treatment plant currently has a capacity of
0.70 million gallons per day (mgd), although flows reach 0.69 mgd. The 1997 Wastewater Treatment
Plant Master Plan and its subsequent amendment reported a current average dry weather flow (ADWF)
                                                                                                       I-11

C I T Y  O F  C A L I S T O G A  G E N E R A L P L A N                  2003 INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
of 0.67 mgd between May and October. Actual flow measurements observed in 1999 equaled this value.
The Master Plan predicted that new development would increase ADWF to 1.0 mgd by 2020 and 1.16
mgd by 2032. Since the Master Plan was based on the projections of the 1990 General Plan, i.e., a 1.5
percent annual growth, under development projections of the 2003 General Plan, ADWF would
probably be somewhat less than this projection.
Flows in the wastewater collection system increase during wet weather. This is due to seasonal
inflow/infiltration (I/I). The peak wet weather flow is estimated to be 4.0 mgd. It is possible that flows
have reached as much as 7.5 mgd; however reliable measurement beyond 5.9 mgd is not currently
possible.
Wastewater Treatment Expansion Plans. Construction is currently underway for a major upgrade to the
entire wastewater treatment system, including the plant and the reclamation system. Completion is
planned for 2003. In addition to capacity increases that are necessary to meet the needs of new
development projected in the 2003 General Plan, these upgrades are needed to meet Water Quality
Board health requirements, provide reliable treatment and comply with National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System requirements and Waste Discharge Requirements. The Wastewater Treatment Plant
Upgrade Project is designed to accommodate 0.84 million mgd, which was the flow projected for 2012,
assuming a 1.5 percent growth rate and water conservation actions. Again, since the current projected
growth rate is 1.35 percent, the Upgrade Project may meet capacity needs for a few years beyond 2012.
Expansion work will address the following:
     •    Meet future waste load levels
     •    Improve treatment results
     •    Attain current State disinfection
          standards
     •    Meet DHS water quality standards
          and treatment
     •    Ensure        sufficient     reclamation
          storage capacity to prevent the
          discharge of treated wastewater into
          the Napa River during the summer.
                                                            Calistoga’s Wastewater Treatment Pond
Other Wastewater Issues
There are several variables that must be accounted for to predict the actual amount and type of effluent
that will have to be processed by Calistoga’s wastewater treatment system; only some of these variables
are known at this time. Factors include:
•    User types. The wastewater treatment planning assumes the same mix of different types of users as
     the current situation. Given that much of Calistoga’s economy is based on water (spas, spring water
     production facilities, etc.), it is possible that over the design life of the upgrade project, the
     wastewater treatment plant may have to deal with different amounts and types of inflow, especially if
     less housing development and more visitor accommodation is constructed than had been previously
     predicted.
I-12

C I T Y O F  C A L I S T O G A G E N E R A L P L A N                  2003 INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
•    New waste discharge requirements. The City was issued a new waste discharge permit in
     November 2000. A number of new discharge requirements have been added to the permit as well as
     some interim limits on some constituents. The City will also be required to submit a pollution
     prevention plan in 2002 to help minimize or reduce pollution to the State’s waters.
•    Success of water conservation measures. The upgrade is projected to be sufficient until 2020 in
     part due to the successful implementation of water saving measures by the Calistoga population
     based on the water conservation plan currently being developed. Since these measures have not yet
     been enacted, the exact reduction in inflow cannot be guaranteed: projected savings may not all
     occur.
B.       Key Findings
1.       Although a complete wastewater collection system analysis has not been done, a broad range of
         improvements to collection systems has already been identified by City consultants and staff.
2.       The need for expanded capacity is based on best estimates. However, adjustments may have to
         be made during the design-life of the expansion projects, especially if environmental regulations
         are modified.
3.       Inadequate pretreatment of wastewater by restaurants, spas and other producers of non-
         domestic sewage increases the sediment and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Enforcement
         of existing sewer ordinance requirements would reduce these impacts.

A2.5-3 In the next Wastewater Master Plan, incorporate the evaluation of options to separate and/or
         eliminate boron from the primary wastewater stream to reduce the level of boron in reclaimed
         water, making it a viable source of water for local vineyards.
III.       WATER RECLAMATION
A.       Background Information
An integral part of Calistoga’s wastewater treatment system is water reclamation, which is used when
weather conditions permit. The purpose of water reclamation is primarily to reduce the amount of water
discharged into the Napa River. Conservation of potable water is a secondary consideration.
Water Reclamation System
The Regional Water Quality Control Board requires a 10-to-1 dilution for discharge into the Napa River
and prohibits the discharge of treated wastewater from May 15 to September 30 or longer during dry
years. Reclaimed water produced by the wastewater treatment plant is disinfected tertiary water which
could be used for a variety of irrigation, storage and cooling uses. However, the boron concentration in
the reclaimed water (approximately 2.8 mg/L), which results from geothermal water being discharged
                                                                                                     I-15

into the sanitary sewer system, effectively limits its use to boron-tolerant crops like turf grasses.
Removal of boron is possible through pre-treatment.
As part of the overall wastewater effluent management system, the City currently irrigates 14 sites with
treated effluent. Table I-2 details the names and sizes of current irrigation sites. The locations of the sites
and the reclamation water pipe system are shown in Figure I-3. The existing reclaimed system comprises
approximately 15,000 feet of 4- to 8-inch water lines. The total irrigation area is approximately 132 acres,
either City-owned, contracted, or otherwise controlled on a long-term basis for effluent irrigation. In
addition to the existing effluent irrigation sites, Calistoga operates 4 evaporation ponds totaling 2.7 acres,
one 10-million-gallon storage pond and two leased storage ponds totaling 8 million gallons.

IV.        STORMWATER COLLECTION
A.       Background Information
Existing Stormwater System
As shown in Figure I-4 the existing storm drainage system consists of pipes and ditches serving a portion
of the developed areas of the City. Piping, ranging in diameter from 6 to 54 inches, is undersized in
many locations. Shallow drainage ditches comprise approximately 50 percent of the current drainage
network.
Items of Concern
The capacity of the existing storm drain piping is exceeded regularly during average precipitation events
at several locations. This causes localized flooding. In areas without drainage piping, rain causes sheet
flows to the river and creeks, which also results in localized flooding. A formal analysis of the storm
drainage system has been conducted for several sections of the City. Figure I-4 shows the area for which
detailed analysis is required, and the locations of proposed improvements.
Many of the existing storm drainage problems appear to be the result of the fact that land development
occurred incrementally; as impervious surfaces increased, more water was directed to the storm drainage
system. The low amount of naturally-occurring ground slope is also a contributing factor.
The portion of the City between Foothill Boulevard and the Napa River experiences severe flooding due
to under-sized storm drains and a lack of continuity between pipes. The southeast quadrant of the City
currently has only one run of storm drainage piping serving a small area. No problems with seasonal
flooding have been reported in this quadrant. However, future developments in this area would require
expansion of the storm drain system.
Deficiencies in the storm drainage system also exist in the northeast quadrant of the City, an area
containing a watershed of approximately 966 acres. Several natural tributaries of the Napa River
intersect in this area, some of which drain into public and privately-owned drainage ditches and culverts
that are at or over their existing capacities, resulting in periodic localized flooding and erosion during
large storm events.
In recognition of the lack of adequate infrastructure to address large storm events, and to provide for
future expansion of uses within the this area without exacerbating existing deficiencies, the City has set
aside funds in the FY 2002-03 budget to study this issue. This project is intended to provide for a
hydrologic survey of the ditches and storm drain systems serving the northeast quadrant of the City.
This study will identify deficiencies and make recommendations for future improvements. The City will
receive a grant from the Flood Assessment District to offset partial costs of preparing this study.
                                                                                                      I-19

C I T Y O F  C A L I S T O G A G E N E R A L P L A N                 2003 INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
Recommended Improvements
As enumerated above, deficiencies in the
existing stormwater collection system are
causing     problems         under     current
conditions. Other components of the
existing storm drainage system require
upgrading to satisfy future conditions.
A key principle that could be established
is “no net increase” in peak storm
drainage runoff from development.
Many jurisdictions, including Napa
County, have adopted such a requirement
of new development.                                                 New infrastructure
The no net increase principle would have significant impacts on flooding of the Napa River and on
water quality because runoff from developed surfaces tends to be more rapid than runoff from natural,
pervious surfaces. Also, runoff from building roofs, parking lots and roads contains impurities that
pollute the watershed. Methods for obtaining no net increase in runoff from a development include
detaining storm drainage onsite and reducing flow velocity.
B.       Key Findings
1.       Although a complete stormwater collection system analysis has not been done, a broad range of
         improvements to stormwater collection systems has already been identified by City consultants
         and staff.
2.       The need for stormwater collection facilities can be minimized through appropriate planning and
         design that allows for on-site percolation and minimizes runoff.

  Goal I-4 Collect, store and dispose of stormwater in ways that are safe, sanitary and
              environmentally acceptable.

         installation of new pipes between Foothill Boulevard and the Napa River.
A4.2-3 Select and implement a method to eliminate flooding on the dirt road providing access to the
         reclaimed water storage pond, such as:
         •   Construction of a single span bridge over the culvert.
         •   Extension of the ditch from the mobile home park directly through the City’s irrigation field
             to the Napa River and installation of a single span bridge or culvert along the south side of
             the Gliderport property.
Objective I-4.3 Encourage coordination between land use planning, site design and
                     stormwater water control.
Policies
P4.3-1 The approval of new development shall be conditional on the extension of necessary stormwater
         infrastructure, particularly in the following areas:
         •   Along Grant Street and near the fairgrounds, where new storm drain pipes are needed.
         •   Near the intersection of Foothill Boulevard and Petrified Forest Road, where replacement of
             the 12-inch Caltrans culvert is needed.
         •   In the northeast along with the southeast area of the City, where additional storm drainage
             piping is needed.

Actions
A4.3-1 Revise the Subdivision Ordinance and other Municipal Codes to reduce the creation of
         impermeable surfaces in new development. Examples of strategies to reach this goal might
         include:

             terminate on turf or groundcover).
         •   Modifying minor and local street design standards to reduce road and sidewalk width
             requirements, and to eliminate curb-gutter requirements.
         •   Requiring the use of vegetative swales (biofilters).
         •   Requiring detention/infiltration basins.

The following noise sources are potentially of community-wide
significance in Calistoga:
    •    Noise from vehicular traffic on regional highways and city arterials.
    •    Local industrial sources, including the bottling plants.
    •    Other ground stationary sources such as seasonal noise from wind machines and the sprint car
         races at the County Fairgrounds.
The gliderport was not considered in this analysis since its use as a landing field was abandoned in 1999
and the site is currently vacant. Also not subjected to technical analysis are extremely localized noise
sources and the City siren, which is sounded daily at noon. Intermittent noise sources are regulated by
the Noise Ordinance; issues concerning the City siren are discussed in greater detail below. As part of
the General Plan, the Noise Element establishes overall policy guidance for new development that could
create or be subject to noise impacts and does address each potential noise source. The Noise Element
includes an action to revise the Noise Ordinance address individual noise sources.
Understanding Noise
Noise can be defined in many ways, but is usually associated with                Noise may be defined as unwanted

with people’s daily life, such as in the evening when people are
having a conversation over dinner, or trying to sleep. In Calistoga, noise interference is particularly
important given the interest in retaining the small-town character of the community, and because of the
community’s tradition of being a destination for rest and relaxation.
The objectionable nature of sound is caused by its pitch or its loudness. Pitch is the height or depth of a
tone or sound, depending on the relative rapidity (frequency) of the vibrations by which it is produced.
Higher-pitched signals sound louder to humans than sounds with a lower pitch. Loudness is caused by
                                                                                                                    N-1

There are several methods of refining decibel scales to make them
reflect human perception. Most commonly used in California is the A-weighted sound level or dBA. This
scale gives greater weight to the frequencies of sound to which the human ear is most sensitive.
Representative outdoor and indoor noise levels in units of dBA are shown in Table N-2. For example,
light traffic heard from a distance of 100 feet would have a level of 50 dBA. A jet taking off 200 feet
away would create 120 dBA.
Because sound levels can vary markedly over a short period of time, a method for describing either the
average character of the sound or the statistical behavior of the variations must be used. Most
commonly, environmental sounds are described in terms of their level of acoustical energy averaged over
a period of time. This energy-equivalent sound/noise descriptor is called Leq. The most common Leq
averaging period is hourly, but Leq can describe noise events of any specified time period.
Since sensitivity to noise increases during the evening and at night – because excessive noise interferes
with the ability to sleep -- 24-hour descriptors have been developed that increase the weighting for noise
that occurs during quiet times of day. The increase is referred to as a penalty. For example, the
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) measures the cumulative noise exposure in a place, with a 5
dB penalty added to evening (7:00 pm - 10:00 pm) and a 10 dB penalty added to nocturnal (10:00 pm -
7:00 am) noise levels. The Day/Night Average Sound Level, Ldn, is essentially the same as CNEL, with
the exception that the evening time period is dropped and all occurrences during this three-hour period
are grouped into the daytime period.

races at the Napa County Fairgrounds. Noise from intermittent localized sources such as lawnmowers
and leafblowers has also been expressed as a concern by some residents. In the past, the gliderport also
contributed to community noise levels in Calistoga, but this facility closed in 1999. If the gliderport were
to re-open, nearby residences could be affected by this noise source.
Noise Survey. A noise survey, consisting of both long-term and short-term noise measurements, was
conducted in May 2000 to quantify representative noise levels throughout Calistoga. Measurement
locations are mapped in Figure N-1. Long-term monitoring of noise levels was conducted at four
locations over a period of approximately four days. A graphical representation of the results is contained
in Figures N-2 and N-3. In addition, short-term samples were gathered at six other locations in
Calistoga. During these short (10-minute) measurement periods, concurrent traffic counts were done to
assist in calibrating the traffic noise model used in the development of noise contours. These measures
have not been graphed because the time periods were brief. Instead, data is tabulated in Table N-3.
Table N-4 shows calculated noise contours along major roads in the City based on the noise survey
results. Where no long-term measurements were conducted, noise levels were estimated based on
standard engineering practices calibrated with the six short-term noise measurements. The noise
contours represent roadside levels without the additional attenuation provided by roadside noise barriers,
structures or topographical features.
The following paragraphs provide information about findings at each noise survey site. Unless the text
states otherwise, measured noise levels are acceptable for all uses. The results show that the noise
environment in Calistoga is generally one of a country town. As shown in Table N-4, most of the City is
outside the 55 dB noise contour, where noise levels are acceptable for all uses. Figure N-5 provides, in
graphic format, noise compatibility guidelines for different land uses. One important consequence of
Calistoga’s relatively quiet environment is the fact that even small increases in noise levels may seem
substantial here, compared to other noisier places.

NORMALLY ACCEPTABLE
Specified land use is satisfactory: any buildings involved could be of normal conventional construction, no special insulation
requirements.
CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTABLE
Specified land use to be permitted only after detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements and inclusion of noise
insulation features in the design.
UNACCEPTABLE
New construction or development should generally not be permitted because mitigation is usually not feasible.

Measurement Location L3: Foothill Boulevard at the Wayside Inn. This measurement was made 45 feet from the
centerline of Foothill Boulevard, across from Silver Street. Automobile and truck traffic on Foothill
Boulevard dominated the noise environment. The measured Ldn was 69 dBA. This rating is considered
extremely noisy for a residential area, although it should be noted that noise drops off quickly with
distance from the roadway.
Measurement Location L4: Washington Street at Second Street. The noise monitor was placed 100 feet from the
roadway centerline. Vehicular traffic in the area was the only significant source of noise. The measured
Ldn was 54 dBA, which is considered somewhat quiet.
Short-Term Measurement Locations. Although measured noise levels at the six short-term measurement
locations were relatively high, all measurement locations were close to major roadways and all were for
short durations of time. Noise levels over longer periods would be lower, since quieter periods would be
averaged in.
As noted in Table N-3, the variation between L10 and L90 is wide at several of the measurement sites.
This means there were short periods of loud noise during the measurements, but that there was less
noise than at other times. Each of these locations is subject to intermittent loud noises but the median
noise levels (L50 ) for all of but one of the sites is less than 60 dBA, which means no significant noise
impact indoors and limited impact for outdoor activity.
Traffic Noise. Only location S4, at Highway 29 south of Pine Street, is noisy for most of the time period
measured. The measured Leq of 73 dBA is above the threshold of 68 dBA at which noise interferes with
normal speech for people trying to converse standing outside at the measurement site. This noise level
would not impair conversation indoors nor would the noise level be unacceptable if the receptor is
separated from the street by a sound barrier such as a wall. Thus, noise levels in this area are marginally
acceptable.
The noise survey results show that the major source of noise in
Calistoga is traffic. Much of the noise is generated by vehicles              The use of open-grade asphalt and

neighborhoods surrounding the fairgrounds are substantially
higher than normal. Because of the limited time and duration of the races, the Leq during the event is the
most representative noise measurement. The contours show that throughout a large part of Calistoga,
noise is significant during the sprint car events. Therefore, this Noise Element includes actions to
reduce problems from sprint car races.

Wind Machines. Wind machines are also a source of intermittent noise in Calistoga. Wind machines are
used to combat the effects of frost in the vineyards and other frost-sensitive crop areas. The
intermittent and seasonal nature of their operation makes the Leq (hourly average noise level descriptor)
the most appropriate noise measurement. The locations of Leq contours around a typical wind machine
are given in Table N-5. The table indicates that the noise level would be perceived as loud, i.e. 70dbA,
within an area extending 1,125 feet from the machine. This is similar to hearing a vacuum cleaner in the
same room.
Industry. Little manufacturing or other potential sources of industrial noise are located in the Calistoga
area. Industry is limited to two water bottling plants. One of these plants has intermittently been a
source of community noise in Calistoga. In 1999, noise from new mechanical equipment at the plant
resulted in complaints from the neighbors. The company instituted measures to reduce noise produced
by its activities and it appears that the problem has been solved.
B.       Key Findings
1.       Calistoga is relatively quiet. The only on-going source of significant noise is roadway traffic.
         Other secondary sources include light industry, agricultural operations, agricultural wind turbines
         and sprint car races at the Napa County Fairgrounds. No heavy industrial activities are located
         in the Calistoga vicinity. However, because the level of noise is so low, increases that might
         seem small elsewhere could have a more perceptible effect here.
2.       Given the relatively low level of noise, Calistoga’s Noise Element need not be as extensive as
         that of other communities that are denser or more industrialized. Calistoga need not incorporate
         a broad array of planning policy related to noise. The incidence and extent of noise are such that
         most problems can be successfully addressed through the Noise Ordinance.
3.       The only places in Calistoga where noise is a consistent problem are immediately adjacent to
         heavily traveled roads, where noise borders on unacceptable levels for residential use. The
         principal way to address traffic noise is through measures to reduce speeds. In the long term,
         there may be additional ways to reduce the amount of noise produced by modifying vehicles or
         even the materials used on the roadway itself.
4.       Additional noise in Calistoga is caused by sprint car racing. Like many exterior recreational
         activities, the car racing creates noise that is likely to be more objectionable for the part of the
         community not attending. Measures could be instituted to work with the race organizers to
         attenuate the noise impacts.
5.       Community noise is also generated by frost-preventing wind machines which are a component
         of Calistoga’s agricultural base. Given the necessity of these machines to protect crops and their
         intermittent use, it is not appropriate to regulate them.
6.       Some residents have expressed concerns about intermittent localized noise sources such as leaf
         blowers, lawn mowers and garbage trucks. Noise from such uses is extremely difficult to
         quantify or regulate in a policy document like the General Plan. Instead, these types of local
         noise nuisances should be addressed in the City’s Noise Ordinance.
                                                                                                        N-15

7.      The Gliderport is currently closed. If it reopens, there could be noise incompatibility problems
        with housing located in the residential part of Washington Street downvalley from Lincoln
        Avenue.
8.      Given the existing low noise levels, the addition of new development sensitive to noise in most
        parts of the City and Planning Area would not expose these sensitive receptors to unacceptable
        noise levels. Despite this, new development sensitive to noise should seek to minimize potential
        noise exposure through attenuating site and architectural design methods.
9.      There is a need to prevent new development from creating unacceptable noise levels in the quiet
        parts of the City.
C.      Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions

Policies
P1.4-1 New residential projects shall be required to meet the following noise level standards:
         •   A maximum of 45 dB for interior noise level.
         •   A maximum of 60 dB for exterior noise level, especially when outdoor activities are
             important components of a project (e.g., multi-family housing).
P1.4-2 A noise study, including field noise measurement, shall be required for any proposed project
         which would:
         •   Place a potentially intrusive noise source near an existing noise sensitive receptor, or
         •   Place a noise-sensitive land use near an existing potentially intrusive noise source.
P1.4-3 New development projects shall not be approved unless they are generally consistent with the
         Noise Compatibility Guidelines contained in Figure N-5.
P1.4-4 The City shall encourage the inclusion of site design techniques for new construction to
         minimize noise impacts, including building placement, landscaped setbacks, orientation of noise-
         tolerant components (i.e., parking, utility areas, and maintenance facilities) between noise sources
         and the sensitive receptor areas.
P1.4-5 The City shall encourage the use of architectural design techniques to meet noise attenuation
         requirements, such as:
         •   Using noise-tolerant rooms (garages, kitchens, bathrooms) to shield noise sensitive rooms or
             areas (living rooms, bedrooms).
         •   Using architectural design techniques and building facade materials that help shield noise.

9         OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
          The purpose of the Open Space and Conservation Element is to ensure the comprehensive and long-range
          preservation and management of open space land for the protection of natural resources, for economic uses,
          for outdoor recreation and as a scenic resource. The Open Space and Conservation Element seeks to
          maintain Calistoga’s rural, small-town setting by preserving open space and natural resources.
Calistoga’s open space and natural resources are central to many
of the City’s most important qualities. Agricultural open space                       Open space, including agricultural

is concerned with the management of open space resources within
the Planning Area. The Conservation Element is concerned with the conservation of natural resources,
including plants and animal wildlife, rivers, lakes, and watersheds, forests, soils and minerals. Since the
air is a natural resource, issues related to air quality are also addressed in this Element.
Since most natural resources are located in open space land, the Calistoga General Plan combines these
two elements into one. Combining the State-mandated Open Space and Conservation Elements avoids
redundancy by allowing the similar and often overlapping aspects of these two elements to be explored
in a single place in the General Plan.
A. Background Information
This section provides information about biological resources, agricultural lands and soils, open space and
parks and scenic resources present in the Calistoga Planning Area.
Open space is any parcel or area of land and water that is essentially unimproved. Government Code
Section 65560 describes four categories of open space: Open Space for the Preservation of Natural
Resources, Open Space for the Managed Production of Resources, Open Space for Outdoor Recreation,
and Open Space for Public Health and Safety. Information in this Open Space and Conservation is
organized according to these categories. The types of open space that are included in these categories
are described below in Table OSC-1, along with examples of each taken from Calistoga.
                                                                                                                       OSC-1

variety of species, including a number of special-status plants and
animals. Consequently, in addition to the enjoyment that human
beings get from walking through and viewing these open spaces, the General Plan contains policy
language related to preserving open space for other species.
The biological resources in the Planning Area can be divided into those that are very significant and
those that are moderately significant. “Very Significant” refers to resources that are unique to Calistoga,
and/or are of special concern because of their rarity or declining numbers. “Moderately significant”
refers to resources that lend biological diversity to the area and should be preserved, but which also exist
in abundance elsewhere in the region. Biological resources are mapped in Figure OSC-1.
Natural Communities
Calistoga and its Planning Area contain several diverse plant and animal communities, which are
described below. Several of these communities have been given a high priority ranking by the California
Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) due to rarity and threats; all of them are important to the diversity
of the Planning Area.

habitat for fish, amphibians, reptiles and invertebrates, including several special-status species, such as
the California freshwater shrimp and the Northwestern pond turtle. Water quality is an important
contributor to the health of riparian ecosystems. Pesticide runoff from agricultural lands can be a
significant source of water pollution in rural areas like Calistoga, and efforts should be made to minimize
the use of pesticides in agricultural activities.

corridors for wildlife on the valley floor. They are designated as high priority by the CNDDB.
Therefore this General Plan seeks to maintain and improve water and habitat in these corridors.
Wetlands. Wetlands in the Planning Area constitute a very significant resource and consist of creeks and
drainages, scattered ponds and freshwater marsh associated with drainages and areas of geothermal
activity.
Freshwater marshes associated with geothermal areas are particularly distinctive to Calistoga and are
known to support populations of special-status plant species. Unusual hydrologic conditions generated
by the upwelling of warm underground springs along with mineral deposition by geothermal waters
combine to create a unique environment in which only certain types of plants can survive. Special-status
plant species associated with these marsh areas include the Calistoga popcorn flower and Napa blue
grass, both of which are designated as State and federal endangered species. Geothermal marshes are
designated as high priority by the CNDDB. One of the most important areas for of geothermal
marshlands is the gliderport. It is critical that the wetland resources found there be protected as part of
any future development.
Figure OSC-1 also shows the location of freshwater marsh and riparian wetlands mapped as part of the
National Wetlands Inventory but does not include wetland habitat on undeveloped parcels, the extent of
which would need to be confirmed through more detailed survey. It also does not include wetlands
found in association with the City’s network of drainage ditches and channels. These types of shallow
drainage ditches compromise approximately 50 percent of the current drainage network in Calistoga, and
thus contribute significantly to the City’s wetland resource base.
Any proposed modifications to wetlands and other waters are subject to the provisions of Section 401 of
the Clean Water Act and Sections 1601-1606 of the CDFG Code, which entails review by the California
Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) and US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps).
Rock Outcrops. Rock outcrops occur in the grassland and woodlands in the eastern fringe of the
Planning Area, and provide a unique habitat for certain wildlife. These landforms provide perches for
raptors and other birds, and sunning locations for reptiles. Crevices provide abundant hiding places for
numerous lizards, snakes, and possibly bats. Larger cavities may be used as shelter and denning locations
by mammalian predators such as bobcat, coyote, and mountain lion. Rock outcrops are a very significant
resource. They are not mapped in Figure OSC-1 due to their isolated location.
                                                                                                          OSC-5

Grasslands and Savannah. Non-native grasslands occupy most of the vacant parcels and lower
elevations in the eastern portion of the Planning Area, composed of introduced grasses and broadleaf
weedy species which quickly recolonize disturbed areas. In Calistoga, as throughout California, intensive
grazing, dryland farming, and other disturbance have eliminated most of the native grasslands that once
formed the area’s historic rangelands. Native species that remain in local grasslands tend to be common
perennials, such as California poppy (Eschscholzia californica), lupine (Lupinus sp.), and wild hyacinth
(Dichelostemma pulchellum). A number of special-status plant species are known from grasslands of the
Calistoga vicinity, such as Jepson's linantus (Linanthus jepsonii), Clara Hunt's milk-vetch (Astragalus
clarianus), and Napa blue grass (Poa napensis).
Areas of native grassland are designated high-priority by the CNDDB. Although none have been
mapped in the Planning Area, remnant stands of native grasslands most likely still occur in some
locations in the Planning Area.
Grasslands support a variety of mammals, birds, and reptiles. Grassland cover provides foraging,
nesting, and denning opportunities for resident species such as western fence lizard, northern alligator
lizard, gopher snake, western meadowlark, goldfinch, ring-necked pheasant, red-winged blackbird,
California ground squirrel, California vole, Bottae pocket gopher, black-tailed jackrabbit, and
occasionally black-tailed deer. These rodent, bird and reptile populations offer foraging opportunities
for avian predators such as white-tailed kite, northern harrier, American kestrel, red-tailed hawk, golden
eagle, barn owl, and great horned owl, and mammalian predators such as gray fox, long-tailed weasel,
bobcat, and mountain lion. Foraging activity of these predatory species is generally limited to the
undeveloped fringes of the Planning Area where habitat fragmentation has not occurred and human
activity is limited.
Woodland, Forest and Chaparral. The fringe of the Napa Valley floor is bordered by open savanna,
woodland, and forest habitat, with chaparral on steeper, south-facing slopes in the upper elevations.
Trees in the savanna are dominated by valley oak (Quercus lobata) and coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia). The
understory layer is generally poorly developed or composed of non-native grassland species in the open
savanna and oak woodland, but becomes considerably denser in areas with mixed-evergreen forest. The
trees and dense understory of the woodland, forest, and chaparral habitat provide important cover for
wildlife, and the complex vertical distribution of canopy and understory vegetation provides for a great
diversity of wildlife.
Woodland, forest and chaparral is a moderately significant
                                                                          State law provides no environmental

Special-Status Species
Special-status species include those listed as threatened or endangered by the
State or federal governments, candidates for listing, species of special concern
to the California Department of Fish and Game, and plants listed by the
California Native Plant Society. Several special-status plant and animal
species have been recorded or are suspected to occur in the Calistoga
Planning Area. Most of these are associated with the forest, woodland, and
grassland along the fringe of the Planning Area. A few species have also been
reported on the valley floor and are generally associated with the aquatic
habitat of the Napa River or the freshwater marshes in geyser-fed swales
where disturbance has been limited. The locations of known occurrences of
special-status species are shown in Figure OSC-1.
                                                                                     Calistoga Popcorn Flower
While a variety of special-status species are known or suspected to occur
in particular locations within the Planning Area, there is also the possibility
that previously unidentified or undetected species could exist at other sites
in Calistoga. Site-specific studies are necessary to conclusively determine
whether special-status species, sensitive natural communities and wetland
resources occur on previously unsurveyed properties that may be affected
by future development. Policies and actions in this Open Space and
Conservation Element include requirements to complete surveys on
previously undeveloped properties proposed for development so that
sensitive species and communities can be identified and protected where
necessary, thus ensuring the continued richness and diversity of Calistoga’s
natural resources.
Plant Species. Several special-status plant species have been reported in
the Planning Area. Based on recorded geographic range and preferred                        Napa Blue Grass
habitat, numerous other species may potentially occur in the Calistoga vicinity. Many are considered rare
(List 1B) by the California Native Plant Society (CNPS). A few have legal protective status under the
Endangered Species Acts, including the State and federally-endangered Calistoga popcorn flower
(Plagiobothrys strictus) and Napa blue grass (Poa napensis). Both of these plants are associated with the
freshwater marsh habitat supported by geothermal runoff on the valley floor. Other special-status plants
include Jepson’s linantus (Linanthus jepsonii), and Bakers Navarretia (Navarretia leucocephala ssp. bakeri),
both of which are found on the valley floor in freshwater seep areas, and Calistoga ceanothus (Ceanothus
divergens), which is found in upland areas at the southern fringe of the Planning Area.
Animal Species. Table OSC-2 provides information on the name,
status, preferred habitat, and reported occurrences of special-status
animal species known or considered to have the highest potential for
occurrence in the Planning Area. Of the species listed in the table,
only a few have actually been reported in the Planning Area by the

These include the federally-threatened northern spotted owl (Strix
occidentalis caurina) which is known from old growth forest and woodland
areas in the southwestern part of the Planning Area. Northwestern pond
turtle (Clemmys marmorata marmorata) a species of special concern to the
California Department of Fish and Game, and the State and federally-
endangered California freshwater shrimp (Syncaris pacifica) are known to
occur in the Napa River corridor through Calistoga.
Several other species considered sensitive by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service and/or the California Department of Fish and Game, but not
mapped in the inventory by the CNDDB, are known in the Planning
Area. These include many of the species of birds shown in Table OSC-2,
including golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), peregrine falcon (Falco pergunus
anatum), Cooper's hawk (Accipter cooperi), northern harrier (Circus cyaneus),       Northern Spotted Owl
white-tailed kite (Elanus caeruleus), prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus). Most
of these avian predators inhabit the fringes of grassland and savannah
areas where they forage on small mammals, birds and reptiles. Mammalian, invertebrate and
amphibian species considered as Species of Concern by the California Department of Fish and Game are
also known from the Planning Area including American badger (Taxidea taxus), California mastiff bat
(Eumops perotis californicus), Pallid bat (Antrouzous pallidus) and Townsends’ big-eared bat (Plecotus townsendii).
Both the California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and Western spadefoot toad (Spea hammondii)
are associated with aquatic pool habitats within grassland areas found on the valley floor.
Biodiversity. Beyond protecting the individual types of habitat and species described above, this General
Plan also seeks to protect biodiversity. Biodiversity is a term that to refers to the variety of life in all its
forms, levels and combinations. It includes ecosystem diversity, species diversity, and genetic diversity.
The health of each of these individual elements is inseparable from that of the others. The General Plan
is a comprehensive planning document for the Calistoga Planning Area, which encompasses a wide
range of habitats and ecosystems. It thus provides an important opportunity to focus on wider biological
communities and the relationships between them, rather than simply considering the protection of
individual species and habitat types.
Open Space for Managed Production of Resources
This section discusses existing conditions and issues associated with open space for the managed
production of resources. In Calistoga, such resource production occurs primarily through agriculture,
mineral water and volcanic ash extraction. Because geothermal mineral resources are so strongly related
to the City’s unique character, discussion of them is found in a separate Geothermal Element. Other
types of resource production lands, such as commercial forests, do not occur in Calistoga or its Planning
Area, so they are not addressed in this Element.
Agriculture, especially viticulture, is a major activity within un-incorporated portions of the Planning
Area. Currently, approximately 3,500 acres are under intensive agricultural cultivation within the
Planning Area, including 268 acres in the City. Vineyards, organic crops, fruit, vegetables and orchards
are the main types of agriculture.

within the city limits to non-agricultural uses. The Land Use
Element of this General Plan contains policies that seek to limit
the excessive subdivision of these parcels.
The coexistence of agriculture and urban uses in Calistoga can lead to land use conflicts between
agriculturalists and residential neighbors. Such problems are often caused by inadequate information and
education for residential property owners about the inherent problems associated with proximity to
agricultural operations. An example of this is the creation of noise impacts to residential neighbors from
operation of wind turbines to avoid frost damage to grape crops. These issues are addressed in this
General Plan through actions suggesting adoption of a Right to Farm Ordinance that establishes a series
of “Good Neighbor” policies to minimize potential conflicts between agriculture and its neighbors.

also highly valued by its residents, identifying Calistoga’s unique setting amongst the fields and orchards
of Napa Valley edged by hills and dramatic ridgelines.
Parks and Recreation
Existing Facilities. Parkland and other recreational opportunities are key elements for the quality of life
of Calistoga residents. Table OSC-4 lists existing recreational facilities available in Calistoga, including
both those owned by the City and others. The locations of recreational resources in the Planning Area
are shown in Figure OSC-3. Within the city limits Calistoga residents are able to enjoy a range of
recreational resources, including larger City parks such as Pioneer and Heather Oak Park, as well as the
facilities at the Monhoff Center which include racquetball and tennis courts.
Table OSC-4 includes the Logvy Community Park, which is currently being developed for recreational
activities. The Logvy Community Park is a 9.5-acre parcel bordered by Washington Street and the
County Fairgrounds to the north, and the Napa River to the south. The parcel was acquired by the City
in 1998. A Master Plan was prepared for its use as a recreational center for Calistoga, including playing
fields, a swimming pool, a purpose-built community recreation building, and a Napa River walk. At
present, none of the major facilities have been constructed.
The community has expressed a strong desire for the provision of additional recreational facilities in the
City. Temporary ballfields were put in place on the Logvy site in 2001, and these are receiving substantial
use by the community. It is possible that these fields will remain in place for the long term; however,
their current location is considered by the City to be temporary. A new swimming pool has been
identified by the community as the highest priority for a recreational facility in Calistoga. A Calistoga
Community Pool Preliminary Feasibility Study was completed by the City in 2002 to consider where a
pool might be located without disturbing the interim playing fields. This General Plan includes policies
and actions to work towards the siting and development of new recreational facilities, and an action to
implement the development of a new swimming pool for the City.
An additional important recreational resource in Calistoga is the Napa River. The river is a central
feature of the City, providing a swath of green space within the urban area and a unique environment for
passive enjoyment. Despite the River’s centrality and value to Calistoga, there are few points along its
length in the City that are publicly accessible. Enhancing access to the river would greatly enhance the
recreational opportunities associated with the River, increase its value as a visitor attraction, and take
advantage of this unique community asset. Under this General Plan, the City will explore ways in which
access and recreational opportunities along the Napa River can be improved.
Other recreational resources in the Planning Area include the Oat Hill Mine Trail, a popular mountain
bike and hiking trail that begins at Silverado Trail near Lake Street and follows the alignment of a road
that once served the local quicksilver mine. In late 2000, the Land Trust of Napa County acquired 530
acres of land in the Palisades, just east of the Planning Area. The Oat Hill Mine Trail, which is part of
this acquisition, now provides access to the Palisades Trail, and to Robert Louis Stevenson State Park, an
important regional open space resource. Due to the trail’s increasing popularity there is now a need to
provide organized parking and restroom facilities at the trailhead.

softball and playing fields, a track and field area and a gymnasium.
Parkland Ratios. Under the State’s Quimby Act, cities with an existing high ratio of park space to
inhabitants can require new development to provide up to 5 acres per thousand persons that would live
in the development. However, cities with a lower current ratio can only require the provision of up to
three acres of park space per thousand population. The calculation of a City’s park space to population
ratio is based on a comparison of the population count of the last federal census to the amount of city-
owned parkland. In the 2000 census Calistoga's population was 5,190, and city-owned park space
amounted to 14.19 acres. Based on these calculations, Calistoga has a ratio of 2.73 acres of park space
per thousand inhabitants. Thus the maximum provision of park space that the City can require of new
development under the Quimby Act is only 3 acres per thousand. If the City were to improve this ratio
by acquiring more recreational land in Calistoga, the higher requirement for new development could be
instituted.
Although the calculations above may seem to suggest that Calistoga has a relatively low ratio of park
space to population, it is important to note that this amount does not include the approximately 70-acre
Napa County Fairgrounds and school recreational facilities, both of which provide important
recreational facilities for Calistoga residents. If these spaces are included in the calculations, Calistoga
has 17.36 acres of recreational open space per 1,000 residents. Despite this, the application of a standard
that increased the provision of city-owned parks to a minimum five acres per thousand would set a
measurable goal for provision of new park facilities in Calistoga, and would, more importantly, allow a
similar ratio to be required of all new development. This General Plan contains policies that seek to
implement this standard.
Several potential sites for new parks in Calistoga have been identified by the CAC and the Planning
Department. These sites, which are shown in Figure OSC-3, include a 22.5 acre parcel located south of
the gliderport at the eastern edge of the City, a site within the gliderport property itself, and an
approximately 6.3-acre parcel located in the northwest part of the City, near the intersection of Money
Lane and Michael Way.
Scenic Resources
Calistoga's vistas and scenic corridors are a valued local asset for the community. Views of and from the
City serve to situate the community in its local environment and landscape, and comprise an important
element for Calistogans’ sense of place.
Most of Calistoga’s scenic vistas and corridors are associated with the open space and natural resources
of the Planning Area. Such areas include the Napa River corridor, views of the rural and undeveloped
lands surrounding the City, and Calistoga’s hillside areas. Views of the surrounding countryside,

ridgelines and hilltops are an important contributor to the quality of life and community identity of the
City.
Many of the scenic resources valued by Calistogans are located outside the city limits or even beyond the
Planning Area boundary. These resources are generally protected by County development policy or
through public ownership. This General Plan seeks to regulate development within the city limits that
might block or impede scenic views. It also encourages the development of a more visually harmonious
cityscape through, for example, regulation of rooflines and roofing materials and building clustering.
Scenic resources in the Planning Area include:
     •    Views of the Palisade and Western Ranch from downstream
     •    Open space associated with the Gliderport
     •    Rural lands along Silverado Trail, including views of Mt. Washington
     •    Views of Mount Lincoln from upper Lincoln Street
     •    Mora Avenue, Greenwood Avenue and upper Grant Street corridors
     •    Corridor through Pioneer Cemetery to the open space of the Herrero property across Highway
          128
     •    Corridor alongside the Bounsall property and adjacent agricultural parcels
     •    Canopy of trees along Cedar Street
     •    Highway 128 North of Petrified Forest Road
Calistoga does regulate some types of development that can affect scenic resources. Most notable is the
Hillside Development Ordinance, which considers the visual impact that development along the
ridgelines surrounding the City will have on views from the Valley floor. However, no regulations are in
place that specifically protect public or private views. The Napa County General Plan identifies several
policies for preserving and providing “visual access to the natural beauty" of the County. In particular it
identifies the proliferation of telecommunications antennas, which are usually sited on hilltops and ridge
lines, as a major threat to local scenic resources. No similar regulations are in place in Calistoga.

In order to protect Calistoga’s corridors, this General Plan include policies directed at maintaining the
scenic qualities of these areas.

         source when viewed against a dark background.
     •   Light trespass, which is the spilling of light from beyond the property where the light is located.
     •   Sky glow, where excess and poorly designed lighting obscures views of the night sky.
Overlighting and poorly designed lighting can obscure sky views, create a visual nuisance, and cause a
hazardous visual distraction for vehicles and pedestrians. Overlighting is also wasteful of electricity
resources, and can drive up maintenance costs because of higher utility bills. This General Plan calls for
guidelines for incorporation of light efficient exterior fixtures in new development as part of the design
review process to help address light pollution problems.
Air Quality
Air is a critical element in the natural environment, and the availability of clean, non-polluted air is an
important factor for human health and quality of life. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District
(BAAQMD) monitors air pollutant levels continuously throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. The
BAAQMD’s Napa and Santa Rosa monitoring stations are the closest to Calistoga. They are at a direct
distance of 24 and 13 miles away, respectively. Air pollutant levels measured at these stations are
typically slightly higher than actual levels occurring in Calistoga, due to the more rural surroundings
associated with Calistoga. However, since air pollutant levels are not monitored in Calistoga itself, levels
in these nearby communities are taken to represent general conditions in the Planning Area.
Based on the data reported by the BAAQMD, maximum 1-hour ozone levels exceeded the State
standard of 0.09 parts per million on 1 day or less annually in Santa Rosa and 0 to 4 days annually in
Napa. The 24-hour PM10 levels also exceed the State standard of 50 kg/m3 on about 0 to 12 days
annually in Santa Rosa and 6 to 15 days annually in Napa. The federal standards for 1- and 8-hour ozone
levels were not exceeded during the 5-year period in Santa Rosa, but were exceeded on 0 to 1 day
annually in Napa. The maximum levels for all other criteria air pollutants were below thresholds (both
California and National Ambient Air Quality Standards). As described above, these figures reflect
conditions in the closest nearby communities where monitoring occurs. Air quality in Calistoga is
expected to be somewhat better.
The primary source of air pollution in and around Calistoga is traffic. Carbon monoxide emissions are
the pollutant of greatest concern at the local level. However, modeling of carbon monoxide
concentrations at the busiest intersections in Calistoga (Foothill Boulevard/Lincoln Avenue and Foothill
                                                                                                       OSC-19

C I T Y   O F  C A L I S T O G A  G E N E R A L   P L A N       2003   OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
Boulevard/Petrified Forest Road) indicates that concentrations are below California and national
ambient air quality standards. 1
From an air quality perspective, Calistoga is fortunate to have no major industrial sources of air
pollution. However, wood burning from residential fireplaces and wood stoves is a substantial source of
particulate matter emissions in wintertime. According to air quality modeling performed, it is estimated
that up to 474 pounds per day of particulate matter are emitted by residential fireplaces or woodstoves in
Calistoga during the winter. Use of new natural gas or Environmental Protection Agency-certified
fireplaces would reduce these emissions substantially.
Generally, Calistoga residents enjoy clean air and low levels of air pollution compared to other parts of
the Bay Area. Calistoga does not contribute a significant amount of air pollution to the Bay Area
because the City does not support any particularly polluting land uses. Ambient air quality in Calistoga is
better than in other parts of the region. Nonetheless, maintenance of Calistoga’s high air quality and
safeguarding against any deterioration in current standards is an important community goal, and this
General Plan contains policy language that seeks to achieve this.
B. Key Findings
Natural Resource Preservation
1.         The Calistoga Planning Area contains a rich variety of habitat types which are home to a broad
           range of plant and animal species. If these are not protected, these habitats could become
           degraded or eradicated, threatening the health and diversity of Calistoga’s important natural
           communities. Through this General Plan the City will enact polices that seek to protect its
           important habitat areas.
2.         The Napa River and its tributaries form a significant biological resource in the Planning Area.
           They serve not only as a critical habitat and scenic resource, but also as an important wildlife
           movement corridor. It is the responsibility of the City to consider the impacts of land use
           decisions on the Napa River and tributary drainages and seek ways to enhance and improve
           these resources.
3.         Wetlands are important natural resources that should be protected. Wetlands are recognized for
           their high inherent value to fish and wildlife, use as storage areas for storm and flood waters, and
           water recharge, filtration and purification functions. This General Plan specifies actions that the
           City will take to identify and map wetlands as well as specific policies to preserve wetland areas.
4.         A number of special-status plant and animal species exist in the Planning Area, including species
           which are endemic to the region, such as Calistoga popcorn flower and Napa blue grass. Many
           of Calistoga's special-status and endemic species are contained within areas of freshwater marsh
           associated with geothermal resources. Through this General Plan, the City will seek to protect
           these special status species as far as possible.

5.       Forest lands within the city limits are predominantly located in Calistoga's hillside areas and
         provide an important habitat type for numerous wildlife species as well as a component of the
         scenic appearance of the hillsides.
6.       Other than the Napa River, the gliderport property in Calistoga is the most significant location
         for special-status species within the city limits. Seasonal wetlands and special-status habitat are
         known within the property, but their extent has not been mapped. If this area is to develop in
         the future, a comprehensive survey of wetland resources and special- status species is needed in
         order to minimize potential impacts to them.
7.       Forest and chaparral habitats in the Calistoga Planning Area are threatened by conversion to
         vineyards. It is ironic that local efforts to protect one type of open space, that important for
         agriculture, have the potential to endanger another open space type. Greater recognition of the
         habitat value of forest and chaparral environments through policies and actions designed to
         protect these habitats could help to balance the need to preserve both types of resource.
Managed Resource Production
8.       Land within the city limits that is zoned Rural Residential (RR) is at risk for conversion to non-
         agricultural uses, since current zoning permits subdivision to parcels as small as 20,000 square
         feet under certain conditions. There are also several large parcels currently being used for
         agriculture that are zoned as single family residential. These could also be potentially converted
         to other uses. This possible loss of agricultural lands conflicts with community interest in
         protecting it as an element of its regional and local identity.
9.       Approximately 268 acres of land currently being used for vineyard and other high intensity
         agriculture is located within the city limits. Much of the Planning Area outside of the city limits is
         in agricultural use and is protected from conversion to non-agricultural uses by Napa County’s
         Agricultural Preserve designation. An exception to this is a 75 acre area located southeast of the
         city limits at Highway 29, which is zoned rural residential.
10.      Conflicts between agricultural non-agricultural land uses have proven to be a problem in
         Calistoga, particularly as regards the use of noise-generating farm equipment such as wind
         turbines to prevent frost damage to grape crops. This General Plan includes actions that direct
         the City to address such problems through the establishment of “Good Neighbor” policies that
         would reduce potential opposition to local agricultural operations.
Recreation and Scenic Resources
11.      Parks and recreational facilities contribute to the quality of life of Calistoga residents. Calistoga
         currently offers a range of recreational resources and access to fee-based private recreational
         opportunities in the Planning Area. This General Plan includes actions that aim to supplement
         and maintain access to existing public recreational facilities.
12.      The Napa County Fairgrounds comprise over 84 percent of the Calistoga’s total recreational
         open space. While the fairgrounds provide recreational opportunities for local residents, many
         of them are fee based. City-owned parks cover only 14.19 acres, offering 2.73 acres of parkland
         per thousand population. This acreage includes the Logvy site, which is currently planned for
         various recreational facilities. This ratio of City-owned parkland is below the minimum
                                                                                                      OSC-21

C I T Y O F  C A L I S T O G A G E N E R A L P L A N 2003   OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
         standards specified by many California communities. This General Plan contains policies that
         seek to implement a higher minimum standard for provision of City-owned public parks.
13.      Calistoga requires new development to provide parkland or in lieu fees at a rate of three acres
         per thousand population. Through this General Plan the City will implement actions that ensure
         new development provides the required park land or fees, and policies that consider increasing
         the current ratio of parkland per thousand population to a minimum of five acres, so that this
         ratio could be demanded of new development.
14.      The Logvy Community Park Master Plan includes a swim center. Repeated community surveys
         have identified a swimming pool as the top priority of Calistoga residents. Every effort should
         be made to implement the development of a swimming pool as identified in the Logvy Master
         Plan.
15.      The Napa River is an important recreational open space resource in Calistoga. The use of the
         Napa River as recreational open space for the community is currently limited by a lack of public
         access and developed riverside trails. This General Plan includes policy direction for the City to
         explore ways to increase public access to the River so that the potential offered by this important
         community recreational asset can be better realized in the future. Any increases in public access
         will need be balanced with goals of protecting the River from possible adverse impacts from
         these uses.
16.      Although many scenic resources, including views of surrounding hillsides and ridgelines, and
         scenic corridors, are associated with Calistoga, they have not been officially recognized by policy
         or formally designated. Doing so, as specified through General Plan policies, will help to protect
         views of these scenic areas.
17.      Many of the areas that are considered important scenic resources for Calistoga lie outside the
         Planning Area. The City cannot, therefore, act directly to protect these areas from development
         that might compromise their scenic quality. However, the City can work with Napa County and
         local non-profits such as the Land Trust of Napa County to support their efforts to protect these
         areas.
18.      Light pollution and glare can detrimentally affect views of the night sky, an important part of the
         natural environment in Calistoga, and create a source of visual nuisance and hazard. Regulation
         of exterior lighting through the design review process can not only preserve night sky views, but
         will also incorporate greater energy efficiency. This General Plan contains policies that seek to
         achieve these aims.
Air Pollution
19.      The biggest contributors to air pollution in the Planning Area are vehicle emissions and
         particulate matter from wood-burning stoves. Despite the fact that Calistoga, in general, enjoys
         good air quality this General Plan includes policies aimed at ways that the City might seek to
         reduce these pollution sources.

Global Conservation
20.      Calistoga, like most U.S. cities, consumes a disproportionate share of global resources. Policies
         of this General Plan reinforce the importance of seeking ways to reduce the City’s consumption
         and dependence on fossil fuels and consumption of non-renewable resources, and of developing
         as a more sustainable community.
C. Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions
  Goal OSC-1. Conserve the value and function of Calistoga's open space as a biological
                    resource.

                          species that are sensitive, rare, declining, unique or represent valuable
                          biological resources.
Policies
P1.1-1 When reviewing development proposals the City should include assessment of impacts on both
         individual species and overall biodiversity within the Planning Area.
P1.1-2 Impacts to movement corridors that link wildlife habitat areas should be considered when
         reviewing development proposals. These corridors should be protected.
P1.1-3 The City should encourage efforts to identify and map biological resources on the gliderport
         property, which provides an important and unique habitat area within the city limits.
P1.1-4 The City shall explore the possibility of designating parcels as Natural Resource Preservation
         Areas in areas of the City known to contain sensitive and unique species, in order to protect
         these resources. Examples of such sensitive natural resource areas include the gliderport, Mount
         Washington, geothermal marshland areas and the Napa River corridor. Any such designation
         would respect property rights.
Actions
A1.1-1 Prepare and maintain an updated list of State and federal rare, threatened and endangered species
         known or suspected to occur in the Planning Area, as well as special status or rare and
         endangered species identified by the California Department of Fish and Game and the California
         Native Plant Society. This list should be monitored and updated at least every two years.
A1.1-2 Develop and adopt guidelines establishing wildlife corridors, biological habitat preservation
         techniques, and wetlands restoration methods.
A1.1-3 Work with applicable agencies to ensure that biological resources are analyzed in local review of
         development proposals.

         protection of native tree species, riparian vegetation, important concentrations of natural plants
         and important wildlife habitat.
P1.2-3 Prior to approving specific development plans on undeveloped parcels, biological and wetland
         assessments to determine the presence or absence of populations of special-status species,
         sensitive natural communities, and wetland resources shall be conducted. Assessments shall:
         •   Be conducted by qualified specialists in botany, wildlife biology and wetland ecology.
         •   Include, as necessary, detailed field surveys conducted during the appropriate time of the
             year to permit detection of sensitive resources.
         •   Produce mitigation plans for impacts to biological resources, as necessary. These mitigation
             plans should include wildlife preservation management plans, where necessary, including
             adequate mitigation for loss of wildlife habitat components that are critical to maintenance
             of special-status and other important species.
Actions
A1.2-1 Amend the requirements of the Hillside Development Ordinance to specifically include
         preservation of forest lands.

         in the Planning Area. Drainage ways shall be considered when evaluating impacts of proposed
         development on wetland resources.
P1.5-3 Wetlands shall be protected and enhanced.          Adequate mitigation shall be provided where
         complete avoidance is not feasible.
P1.5-4 Any proposed modifications to wetlands shall require appropriate coordination with
         representatives of the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), and US Army Corps
         of Engineers (Corps) to ensure that the concerns and possible requirements of both agencies can
         be easily incorporated into the proposed plans.

Actions
A2.2-1 Revise the Subdivision Ordinance and other Municipal Codes to incorporate alternative
         stormwater management policies that reduce the creation of impermeable surfaces in new
         development. Examples of such policies include:
         •   Ensuring separation of new driveways from the storm drain system (requiring sheet flow to
             terminate on turf or groundcover).
         •   Modifying minor and local street design standards to reduce road and sidewalk width
             requirements and eliminate curb-gutter requirements.
         •   Requiring the use of vegetative swales (biofilters).
         •   Requiring detention/infiltration basins.
A2.2-2 Amend the Zoning Ordinance to include the following provisions:
         •   Require development proposed in erosion-prone areas to include a soils and hydrological
             analysis for environmental review.
         •   Permit and encourage the use of gravel and other permeable materials in parking lots, where
             feasible, especially in outlying spaces used only during peak demand or for occasional use.
Objective OSC-2.3 Incorporate water quality control measures into public activities.
Policies

         from their properties.
Actions
A2.3-1 Introduce a landscape maintenance program for publicly managed lands and rights-of-way that
         seeks to minimize pollutant runoff, e.g. by reducing the use of chemical pesticides, fertilizers and
         similar products through the use of viable alternative techniques.
A2.3-2 Wherever feasible, incorporate stormwater infiltration and detention systems on public land in
         order to reduce the amount and rate of stormwater runoff to waterways.
A2.3-3 Implement water quality control measures as required by federal, State and regional regulatory
         agencies.

P2.4-2 The City shall encourage cooperation and consensus among groups (including CDFG, USFWS,
         property owners, flood control experts) with varying interests related to flood control, special-
         status species, habitat protection, and prevention of property loss for landowners. The City shall
         work with them to develop a plan to address:
         •   Evaluation of hazards.
         •   Identification of options to respond to those hazards and provision of recommendations for
             appropriate methods that accommodate the interests of all groups.
         •   Creation of an approval process that incorporates the concerns of all responsible agencies.
P2.4-3 Public and private resources shall be utilized to coordinate flood damage work.
P2.4-4 All waterways should be managed as coherent ecological systems, including hydrological,

8        PUBLIC SERVICES ELEMENT
I. FIRE PROTECTION AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (updated January 2014)
This section addresses urban fire issues. Wildland fires are addressed in the Public Safety Element.
A. Background Information
Fire Services
Fire services are primarily provided in Calistoga by
the City of Calistoga Fire Department, which
maintains a station at 1113 Washington Street. The
6,400-square foot single-story structure, originally
constructed in 1969, was seismically-retrofitted and
modernized in 2006.
The Fire Department is currently equipped with the
following modern apparatus:
      •  Two Type 1 engines with a pump capacity in
                                                                  The fire station at 1113 Washington Street
         excess of 1000 gallons per minute (gpm)
      •  One Type 2 water tender that can also be used as a Type 2 engine
      •  One Type 3 engine for use in wildland fires
      •  One patrol truck
      •  Two support vehicles.
The Fire Department has one full-time fire chief and three full-time firefighters. The Department also has up
to 15 part-time firefighters; however, not all are available at any given time. Response time from the station
during the day is approximately one minute. During the evening, the response time is usually within three
minutes.
The City has 202 fire hydrants, which deliver between 500 and 1,000 gpm. Water storage capacity is adequate
for fire protection purposes. The City recently completed construction of a 1.5-million gallon water tank,
which has greatly increased the residual pressures throughout the city.
The Fire Department receives approximately three calls per day. Of all calls received by the Fire Department,
approximately 6 percent are for fire service, 76 percent for emergency medical service, and 18 percent for
other reasons, including hazardous condition calls such as downed power lines, service calls for accidental
lock-outs and false alarms. A significant amount of the medical service calls are due to the large number of
elderly people living in Calistoga. Tourists account for approximately 10 percent of the calls.
The City assesses a fee on new development to fund capital improvements and equipment needed to offset
public safety impacts.
The Calistoga Police Department routes local 911 calls for fire service to the California Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) dispatch center. Outside of the city limits, 911 calls for all emergency
                                                                                                             SER-1

C I T Y   O F  C A L I S T O G A   G E N E R A L P L A N
P U B L I C   S E R V I C E S  E L E M E N T
services are routed by the Napa County Sheriff’s Department. Cell phone calls for 911 service are answered
by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) Golden Gate office, which routes all non-traffic-related calls to the
appropriate jurisdiction. For Calistoga and the Planning Area, this would be either the Calistoga Police
Department or the Napa County Sheriff.
Fire Code
The City has adopted the following regulations in addition to those mandated by the State in order to further
promote fire safety:
        •    New and existing buildings shall have approved illuminated or reflective address numbers, building
             numbers or approved building identification placed in a position that is plainly legible and visible
             from the street or road fronting the property.
        •    All buildings and winery caves shall have approved radio coverage for emergency responders within
             the building or winery cave based upon the existing coverage levels of public safety communication
             systems of the jurisdiction, at the exterior of the building.
        •    If deemed necessary by the Fire Code Official, additions to existing residential and non-residential
             buildings that increase the square footage by 50% of the existing gross floor area and/or results in
             the building exceeding 3,600 square feet shall be installed with an automatic fire sprinkler system
             throughout.
        •    If deemed necessary by the Fire Code Official, repairs to existing buildings that have sustained
             damage of more than 50% of the floor area or more than 50% of the value of the building shall
             meet the requirements for a new building.
        •    A change in use or occupancy of an existing building that results in a more hazardous use or
             occupancy shall meet the automatic fire sprinkler requirements for a new building.
Fire Protection in the Unincorporated Planning Area
In accordance with California law (Government Code Section 65300), cities are also required to look beyond
their borders when considering issues which in a city’s judgment bear relation to its planning.
The Napa County Fire Department (NCFD) is the fire authority for the unincorporated portions of the
Planning Area (see Figure INTRO-2 for the boundaries). NCFD contracts with Cal Fire for fire protection
services, which staffs the fire stations. Cal Fire operates a fire station 3.6 miles south of Calistoga’s city limits
on Highway 29. As a State-funded fire authority, Cal Fire also has the responsibility for wildfire protection in
the designated State Responsibility Areas.
Fire protection within the unincorporated Planning Area is rated 6 for properties located within 1,000 feet
from a fire hydrant and rated 9 for properties located further than 1,000 feet from a hydrant. The ISO ratings
cannot be reduced in the unincorporated Planning Area since it is not possible at this time to provide an
uninterrupted water supply of at least 250 gpm to all properties located further than 1,000 feet from a
hydrant.
Fire Safety Issues
The Insurance Service Office (ISO) provides a Public Protection Classification for fire protection, with Class
1 representing the best public protection and Class 10 representing no recognized protection. In California,
approximately 62 percent of communities maintain an ISO rating of 5 or better. Fire protection within the
Calistoga city limits has an ISO rating of 5 for properties located within 1,000 feet of a fire hydrant and 9 for
SER-2

                                                               C I T Y O F  C A L I S T O G A  G E N E R A L  P L A N
                                                                           P U B L I C  S E R V I C E S E L E M E N T
properties located further than 1,000 feet from a fire hydrant. However, the City’s Fire Department has the
ability to provide uninterrupted water supply in excess of 250 gpm to all properties located further than 1,000
feet from a hydrant. The ISO has given the city credit for the Fire Department’s ability to provide
uninterrupted water supply at 250 gpm for those few circumstances within the city limits where a hydrant is
located further than 1,000 feet from a property, as provided in Section 611(F) of the ISO’s Fire Suppression
Rates Schedule. For these reasons, the ISO ratings for the city limits are considered to be adequate.
The fire station’s location is not optimal, since route options to and from the station are limited. Increased
traffic congestion on Washington Street and Lincoln Avenue in the future may further impede emergency
response. Furthermore, a few parcels along Myrtledale Road in the far northern part of the City are more
than 1.5 miles from the station; the ISO recommends a distance of 1.5 miles or less. Despite these issues,
there are significant benefits to its present downtown location, including ample parking for personnel and
good community visibility, which increases awareness of fire prevention.
It has been suggested that Calistoga needs an additional road across the Napa River to improve fire
protection access. The construction of a new “southern crossing” of the Napa River from Washington Street
to Foothill Boulevard would provide another route for emergency vehicles, but is not essential for
maintenance of adequate fire protection unless considerable development were to occur on the south side of
the city.
Wildfires are a significant hazard in some parts of the City and much of the Planning Area. While parts of the
City located on the valley floor are considered at low risk from wildfires, heavily vegetated hillside areas such
as those found at the edges of the city and Planning Area are considered at greater risk. The Public Safety
Element describes and maps wildfire hazard in greater detail, and contains goals, objectives, policies and
actions to protect life and property from these risks.
The downtown has a large number of old buildings built in close proximity to each other. Both the age of
these buildings and their proximity to each other present a fire hazard. However, the City has adopted a
more-restrictive fire sprinkler ordinance than required by state law, as described above, to address this issue
over time. The Fire Department also inspects multi-family residential projects, and commercial and industrial
business on an annual basis. The latter is also inspected upon change of occupancy.
Emergency Medical Services
Medical emergency treatment, including basic and advanced life support, and transport is provided by
American Medical Response. The Calistoga Fire Department also provides basic life support.
Mutual Aid
Cal Fire, NCFD and the Calistoga Fire Department maintain a mutual aid agreement for emergencies,
including wildfires, structure fires and traffic incidents. The Fire Department also has formal and informal
mutual aid agreements with a number of local fire protection agencies, including the Cities of St. Helena and
Napa, the American Canyon Fire Protection District, and the Knights Valley and Mountain Fire
Departments. These agreements are expected to continue.
B. Key Findings
     1. Fire protection and emergency medical service provision within the city limits is adequate.
     2. The City has adopted regulations that exceed the State’s in order to maximize fire safety.
                                                                                                              SER-3

      3. While the present location of the fire station is not optimal because of somewhat limited accessibility
          and increasing levels of traffic downtown, the present location is beneficial because it raises the
          profile of the Fire Department and increases awareness of fire prevention in Calistoga. Therefore,
          there is no need to plan for a new fire station at this time.
      4. Current water storage capacities are adequate for fire protection reserves and fire flows.
      5. An additional north-south circulation route in Calistoga would provide benefit from a public safety
          perspective, but is not essential to maintenance of adequate fire protection in the City unless
          development in the south part of Calistoga were to significantly increase.
      6. The downtown is densely developed and has many older commercial buildings. The provision of fire
          sprinklers would enhance their safety.
      7. The Fire Department inspects multi-family residential projects, and commercial and industrial
          business on an annual basis. The latter are also inspected upon change of occupancy.
      8. Wildfire is a significant hazard in some portions of the City and Planning Area. These hazards are
           discussed further, and goals, objectives, policies and actions to address them can be found in the
           Public Safety Element.

II. LAW ENFORCEMENT
A. Background Information
The City of Calistoga Police Department provides police services in Calistoga. Law enforcement within the
part of the Planning Area located outside of city limits is provided by the Napa County Sheriff's office located
in Napa. The Sheriff serves a population of 55,000 in the communities of Yountville, American Canyon and
the unincorporated areas of the county.
The current ratio of police officers per thousand population in the City is 2.2, which exceeds standard
industry ratios. It should be noted that during peak summer tourist season, up to 10,000 visitors a day may
be in the City in addition to the resident population. Although police services are adequate to meet the needs
of this large non-resident population, consideration of the impact of tourist visitors on police services needs
to be considered in future assessment of law enforcement needs. The Police Department operates out of its
headquarters at 1235 Washington Street and has eleven sworn officers including one chief, one lieutenant,
two sergeants, six patrol officers and one investigator. The Department also has thirteen non-sworn
positions, including four full-time and two part-time dispatchers, five parking enforcement officers, a juvenile
division officer and a policing technician. The emergency services coordinator is also under the direction of
the Police Department.
The Police Department considers police service in the City to be adequate according to industry standard
ratios. Response time within city limits is approximately two minutes. Although the Police Department is
not responsible for responding to incidents outside of city limits, police officers do go into the Planning Area,
                                                                                                               SER-5

C I T Y  O F  C A L I S T O G A   G E N E R A L P L A N
P U B L I C  S E R V I C E S  E L E M E N T
thus placing an increased burden on police services within the City. Response times are approximately five
minutes outside the city limits, depending on location. The City of Calistoga also maintains mutual aid
agreements with all area law enforcement entities within Napa County.
The most frequently reported crime in Calistoga is theft; burglary and assault the next most common
offenses. There were a total of 136 felony crimes, and 661 misdemeanor crimes reported in Calistoga in
2000. Total reported crime in 2000 was almost identical to the previous year (799 crimes) and approximately
13 percent lower than in 1998 (908 crimes). All felony offenders are taken to the Napa County Department
of Corrections jail for detention, while misdemeanor offenders are held in a temporary holding facility at the
City Police Department.
While crime rates and types of crime in Calistoga reflect that of a small, rural community, this may change as
the City grows to reflect more “urban” types of crime like gangs and drugs. The Police Department has, in
recent years, begun to increase its focus on these types of crime. According to the Police Chief, there has
been some increase in gang and drug-related arrests in Calistoga over the past five years; some of that increase
is attributable to the additional attention paid to this type of crime, as well as an actual increase in its
incidence. Monitoring of trends in criminal activity in the City should continue so that police services and
programs can be tailored to meet the population’s changing needs.
B. Key Findings
      1. Police service within the city limits and Planning Area is adequate. No changes to service appear to
          be needed given current resident population and tourist visitor levels.
      2. The current ratio of 2.2 officers per thousand population is adequate. This ratio should be
          maintained for the projected build out population. Consideration of the large number of non-
          resident visitors that create additional demands on police services needs to be given determining the
          need for additional police officers.
      3. The City’s Police Department regularly responds to calls outside the city limits.         It might be
          appropriate to seek reimbursement from the County for these calls.
      4. Crime rates and types may change to reflect more “urban” crime problems such as gangs and drugs.
          Trends in criminal activity should continue to be monitored so that police services can appropriately
          and adequately address crime in the City.
C. Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions

                                Calistoga’s changing population.
     Policy
     P1.     Maintain adequate police staffing, performance levels and facilities to serve Calistoga’s existing
             population as well as any future growth.
     Actions
     A1.     Information on crime prevention should be disseminated to the community.
     A2.     Calistoga’s crime rates and types of crime should continue to be monitored to determine the most
             appropriate methods to target and reduce crime in the City.
III. SOLID WASTE
A. Background Information
The City of Calistoga contracts with Upper Valley Disposal Service, a private company, for solid waste
disposal. Solid waste is taken to the Cloverflat Landfill located on Silverado Trail east of Calistoga. This
facility has been accepting solid waste from Calistoga since 1963. No solid waste or hazardous waste facilities
are located within the Calistoga Planning Area.
The Cloverflat Landfill receives a total of approximately 38,000 tons of municipal solid wastes per year,
consisting of residential wastes, debris-box material, commercial and industrial wastes and plant debris.
Approximately 30 percent of this amount comes from the area north of the landfill, which includes the City
of Calistoga and its Planning Area.
At the end of 1999, the landfill contained approximately 796,000 tons of refuse fill. The total capacity of the
landfill is approximately 2.6 million tons, leaving a remaining capacity of approximately 1.8 million tons. This
capacity is not expected to be reached until 2032.
                                                                                                              SER-7

C I T Y  O F   C A L I S T O G A   G E N E R A L P L A N
P U B L I C  S E R V I C E S   E L E M E N T
Upper Valley Disposal Service also provides recycling services. Various types of recyclable materials collected
at the curbside are separated at the landfill. Materials such as green waste, lumber, and concrete are reused in
order to help preserve landfill capacity. These materials are recycled into compost, wood chips and road
materials. Other materials such as paper and cans are recycled for consumer use.
The area served by Upper Valley Waste Management, which includes Calistoga, St. Helena, Yountville and
unincorporated parts of Napa County north of Yountville, currently meets the State-mandated goal of
diverting at least 50 percent of solid waste to recycling because of the high proportion of recycling done in
wine-making. Approximately half of the recycled material in the area is contributed by the wine industry,
which generates recyclable grape pumice as a by-product of the wine-making process. Since such a large
proportion of total recycling tonnage can be attributed to the vineyards, the majority of which are located in
outside city limits, it is likely that a much smaller percentage of domestic and commercial solid waste is
actually being recycled in Calistoga. Upper Valley Disposal Services has identified local businesses and the
fairground, which generates a large amount of recyclable glass and aluminum, as targets for efforts to
encourage additional recycling.
The City of Calistoga maintains representation on the Board of Directors of the Upper Valley Waste
Management Agency. The Agency regulates solid waste disposal, and periodically updates its recycling
program. Revisions currently underway incorporate efforts to expand waste diversion efforts, including
single-stream residential and commercial recycling collection, expanded public education programs to
encourage recycling, and a cathode ray tube disposal program at Cloverflat Landfill.
There are several options for disposal of hazardous waste in Calistoga. Twice a year the landfill holds a
countywide hazardous materials waste disposal program and will accept materials such as batteries and paint
for recycling. There are also hazardous materials pickups at the County Fairgrounds at least twice a year.
B. Key Findings
      1. The Cloverflat Landfill adequately serves Calistoga at present and has capacity through 2032.
      2. The area served by Upper Valley Waste Management, which includes the City and its Planning Area,
          currently meets the State-mandated goal of diverting 50 percent of solid waste to recycling.
          However, a large proportion of the recycled material is grape pumice, generated as a by-product of
          the wine industry. Recycling programs in Calistoga and programs to encourage use of recycled
          materials could be expanded.
C. Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions
        Goal SER-3          Collect, store, transport, recycle and dispose of solid waste in ways that are
                            safe, sanitary and environmentally acceptable.
      Objective SER-3.1             Promote the recovery of recyclable materials and energy from solid waste
                                    generated within Calistoga.
      Policies
      P1.    The City will seek to meet or exceed State requirements with regard to waste diversion and
             recycling.

             altered or expanded.
    A3.      Work with the Fair Board to expand recycling of glass and aluminum at the fairgrounds.
    A4.      The City will study the transfer system for trash collection, including its impact on adjacent uses
             and the possible creation of transfer zones.
    Objective SER-3.2                Reduce the amount of solid waste that must be recycled or disposed.
    Actions
    A1.      Encourage community-wide rummage sales and joint garage sales.
    A2.      Explore the possibility of collaborating with the schools to allow Calistogans to drop off used
             materials that can be used in art projects and other educational activities.
    A3.      Encourage the use of post-consumer recycled paper and other recycled materials in all City
             operations.
IV. SCHOOLS
A. Background Information
The City of Calistoga is served by the Calistoga Joint Unified School District. The District operates three
main facilities: Calistoga Elementary School (grades K-6), Calistoga Junior/Senior High School (grades 7-12)
and Palisades High Continuation School for students between the ages of 16 and 18. As shown in Figure
SER-1, the District serves the City of Calistoga and the Planning Area as well as the upper northwest corner
of Napa County, southern Lake County and parts of eastern Sonoma County.
The District enrollment in October 2001 was 935 students, which breaks down by school as shown in Table
SER-1. Historically, school enrollments have increased at a rate of three to four percent annually since 1990,
and this trend is expected to continue. Table SER-1 also shows projected enrollment though 2004, and
adjusted capacity at each school facility in Calistoga. 1 These figures show that capacity at the Junior/Senior
High School would be adequate through 2004, but projected enrollment at the Elementary School is
projected to exceed capacity by the same date.
1 Adjusted capacity reflects the number of students a facility can be expected to accommodate based on the amount of instructional
  space available after allowance for special needs and kindergarten students.
                                                                                                                          SER-9

Although the figures suggest that capacity at the Junior/Senior High School will be adequate, it is important
to note that State loading standards do not accurately reflect actual capacity of classrooms in Calistoga
schools. In order to provide a sufficiently broad curriculum in this small school, most classes consist of
significantly fewer than 27 students. According to the Superintendent, the present facilities will be at capacity
by 2004 if current growth rates continue. Thus capacity is a serious problem for the Calistoga Joint Unified
School District at both the elementary and junior high/senior high levels. It is likely that new facilities will be
needed to accommodate future growth, since the small size of present school sites limits the possibility of
adding additional classrooms at existing locations. Identification of a new school site of sufficient size to
accommodate needed school facilities, as well as additional residential or mixed-use development, is an
important priority.
Potential sites for additional school facilities are identified in Figure SER-2. Each is over 20 acres in size,
which is large enough for a school site as well as additional residential or mixed use development. Therefore,
these sites could be dedicated to the School District or sold at a reduced rate at the time of a proposed
subdivision.
In order to help pay for new schools, the Calistoga Joint Unified School District collects $2.14 per square
foot from residential development to compensate for growth impacts and $0.34 per square foot from
commercial development, which is the maximum amount allowed by State law. 2 These fees only account for
30 to 45 percent of the actual cost of providing for additional students.
The City’s ability to plan for school facilities is limited to some degree by State law. School districts are not
required to follow local General Plans, and State legislation limits the ability of local governments to
condition the approval of new development on the availability of school facilities. However, school districts
are required to present potential school sites to the Planning Commission, and local zoning requires a
Conditional Use Permit for a school facility. While classroom facilities are exempt from local zoning
regulations, and issuance of a building permit is exempt from local control, some local control is maintained;
for example, through application of local codes concerning access, grading and flood control.

Calistoga High School
B. Key Findings
     1. School facilities for the City and Planning Area are currently adequate. However, capacity limits both
          at the elementary and junior high/senior high school levels are expected to be reached by 2004.
     2. The small size of Calistoga’s existing school sites limits the possibility of new classroom construction
          on existing sites, so a new site is needed. An ideal site would be at least 10 acres in size and centrally
          located in Calistoga.
C. Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions
      Goal SER-4        Provide education facilities sufficient to meet the demands of existing and new
                        development.
     Objective SER-4.1           Develop new school facilities to serve Calistoga’s current and future
                                 population.
     Policies
     P1.    To the extent allowed by State law, the City shall ensure that school facilities to serve new
            development are available concurrently with need.
     P2.    The City will collaborate with the Calistoga Joint Unified School District to ensure the provision of
            educational facilities sufficient for the existing and anticipated K-12 population.
     P3.    The City will assist the School District in the provision of a site for a new school that meets all or
            most of the following requirements:
            •    Adequate size.
            •    Proximity to existing residentially developed areas.
                                                                                                                SER-13

C I T Y  O F   C A L I S T O G A   G E N E R A L P L A N
P U B L I C  S E R V I C E S   E L E M E N T
             •    Proximity to existing elementary school and high school sites.
             •    Affordability. The City will give preference to subdivision and development plans for any site
                  whose owner offers dedication of an adequate site for a new school for the School District.
      P4.    The City will not approve a development project on any of the indicated school sites in Figure
             SER-2 without first ensuring that adequate school sites will be available in the City.
      Actions
      A1.    Work with the School District to develop a process that can provide timely information about new
             development and its impact on school capacity.
      A2.    Support efforts to expand State funding of the public school system as long as it is not to the
             detriment of municipal funding.
      Objective SER-4.2             Expand the use of school sites.
      Policy
      P1.    The City shall support the School District's efforts to maintain a Family Center that provides
             accessible and affordable resources related to the social, physical and mental health of families.
      Action
      A1.    Explore the joint use of recreational facilities provided by the City and the School District, e.g.,
             after-school access to schoolyards.
V. LIBRARIES
A. Background Information
The library system is governed by the Napa County Board of Supervisors. In addition to the City of
Calistoga and its Planning Area, the Napa City-County Library system serves American Canyon, the City of
Napa, the Town of Yountville and all unincorporated parts of Napa County. The Napa City-County Library
system is, in turn, part of a consortium that includes other cities in Napa and Solano Counties and two junior
colleges. Consequently, Calistogans have access to over 500,000 items through the entire library consortium.
Almost all funds for the operations and maintenance of the Calistoga Library are provided by the County; the
City pays for one day of service each week and provides janitorial service to the library building. The City
owns the land occupied by the library, and leases it at the nominal sum of $1 per year.
The existing City library was constructed in 1924 to serve 500 people. Its collection includes approximately
17,500 titles. Currently, almost half of Calistoga residents hold library cards, so there is a discrepancy between
the size of the facility and the population it currently serves. The Logvy Community Park Master Plan,
adopted by the City in 2000, contains a new library site. However, this Master Plan has been in a state of flux
and there may not be sufficient room on the site to accommodate all desired uses, including the library.
Some possible alternative library sites are shown in Figure SER-2. A recent funding application to the State
for a new library facility was not successful, so the most likely alternate funding sources will be local.

B. Key Findings
   1. Calistoga’s current library is inadequate to serve the City and the Planning Area. A new library on a
       new site is needed. Previous plans called for a new library on the Logvy site, but this may not be
       possible due to site constraints there.
   2. Recent efforts to receive State funding for the construction of a new library facility in Calistoga,
       which would have provided up to 66 percent of construction costs, were unsuccessful.
C. Goals, Objectives, Policies and Actions
    Goal SER-5        Provide sufficient library service to meet the information, cultural and
                      educational needs of the population of Calistoga.
   Objective SER-5.1          Continue City support of the Calistoga Public Library.
   Actions
   A1.    Maintain or expand City funding of library operations as the City budget allows.
   A2.    Continue to provide a City representative on the Library Commission.
   Objective SER-5.2          Develop a modern library for Calistoga.
   Policies
   P1.    The City shall encourage Calistogans to participate in efforts to raise funds for library expansion.
   Actions
   A1.    Study the possibilities to finance the construction of a new library building on the Logvy Site or on
          some other site. Possible library sites are shown in Figure SER-2.
   A2.    Coordinate with other municipalities' efforts to seek increases in State and federal funding for
          library construction.
                                                                                                            SER-15
