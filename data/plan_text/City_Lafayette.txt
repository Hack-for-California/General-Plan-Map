PURPOSE
Although Lafayette experiences a significant amount of regionally-generated through traffic, it is
important to achieve a balance between the potentially conflicting goals of improving traffic
flow and maintaining and enhancing the City’s quality of life and sense of place, particularly in
the Downtown Core.
The basic concept of the Circulation Chapter is to make the existing system work as efficiently
as possible. This position is based on the assumptions that 1) No substantial expansion of the
system or its capacity is envisioned, and 2) Traffic levels within the city are influenced by land
use decisions outside the city’s control – with significant traffic load generated by the Town of
Moraga to the south.
At the center of the city’s traffic congestion is the Lafayette “Y” formed by Moraga Road, Mt.
Diablo Boulevard, Oak Hill Road and First Street. The Plan envisions no change to the
configuration or overall capacity of these streets and their intersections. The traffic signals that
control traffic through the “Y” and along Mt. Diablo Boulevard will be designed to balance the
needs of vehicular traffic and pedestrians. In areas away from these intersections, the balance
will favor pedestrians and bicyclists.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Traffic is a highly sensitive issue in Lafayette. Citizen involvement and participation in the
circulation planning process will enable residents to let the City know of their needs, share their
ideas, and bring about positive change that would benefit the community at large.                    It is
important that the public is fully informed and participates in discussions about proposed
changes to the circulation system.
Effective public participation depends on several key factors. The public must receive clearly
written information early in the planning process. The format chosen, whether small
neighborhood workshops or community wide town hall meetings, should reflect the amount of

public interest in a given issue. It takes time to build community consensus, but the results are
decisions, which are solidly based on the values of the community.
SCOPE OF THE CIRCULATION CHAPTER
Government Code §65302(b) requires every General Plan include a transportation element that
consists of “the general location and extent of existing and proposed thoroughfares,
transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with
the land use element of the General Plan.” This chapter conforms with the requirements of the
Government Code.
The Circulation Chapter discusses transportation and circulation issues for the Lafayette
Planning Area. It briefly describes the existing circulation system and travel characteristics,
projects future traffic based on the build out of the land uses described in the Land Use Chapter,
and identifies the resulting anticipated roadway conditions. Policies and implementation
programs in this chapter provide a guide for decisions regarding circulation system
improvements needed to accommodate Lafayette's anticipated growth. In addition, this chapter
takes into account the traffic impact of anticipated regional development and the roadway
improvements adopted by regional agencies such as the Contra Costa Transportation Authority
(CCTA) and Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC).
The Circulation Chapter is based on several underlying themes and findings summarized below:
     •    Single-passenger automobiles have strained the inter-city transportation system. State
          Route 24 – the main inter-city roadway is nearing its capacity during commute hours.
          This situation will only worsen unless transportation service levels are improved and
          greater emphasis is placed on alternatives to the single-occupant automobile, such as
          bus and rail transit, bicycling, ridesharing, walking, and telecommuting. It is essential
          to reduce the demand for travel through growth management to ensure that future
          development does not exceed the capacity of the transportation system
     •    Land use and circulation are inextricably connected. They must be coordinated so that
          future development and circulation will be balanced with each other. The land use and
          growth management policies in this Plan reflect this relationship.
     •    Transportation facilities must be accessible to all sectors of the community including
          seniors, children, the disabled, persons with low-income, and persons who depend on
          public transportation.
     •    The provision of efficient routes for transit service, emergency and other service
          vehicles continues to be a high priority for the City.
     •    The intrusion of through-traffic onto local streets must be minimized so as to preserve
          the quality of residential neighborhoods.
     •    Future improvements to the circulation system must be consistent with and support the
          other goals and policies of the General Plan.
     •    Traffic is both a local and a regional issue. Effective improvements to the circulation
          system depend on the multi-jurisdictional cooperative effort of multiple agencies such

THE STREET CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
Lafayette's street system is classified into four categories based on function. A definition of the
street classification system is shown in Table 1 below.

Because the function, design and traffic loads of collectors and local streets vary greatly and
sometimes overlap, specific collectors are not identified in this plan.

TRAFFIC LEVEL OF SERVICE
Traffic engineers and planners use level of service grades to evaluate the relative congestion of
roads and highways. The level of service (LOS) for roadways is a scale that measures the amount
of traffic a roadway or an intersection may be capable of handling. Level of service "A"
represents free flow conditions and level of service "F" represents jammed conditions where
traffic flow is over the theoretical capacity of the roadway and consequently moves very slowly.
Level of service calculations can then be used to determine where and what type of roadway
improvements are required, such as the location and timing of traffic signals, the redesign of
intersections, and the number of lanes and turn pockets needed for a particular street.
Lafayette uses both the Contra Costa Transportation Authority and Highway Capacity Manual
methods for calculating level of service on roadways and intersections (See Table 2). The CCTA
bases its level of service standard at signalized intersections on a comparison of the turning
movements in an intersection with the capacity of the intersection to serve these movements,
expressed as a ratio of the volume to capacity1. The CCTA level of service method tends to
underestimate the congestion found at some of the intersections in Downtown Lafayette. In
contrast, the HCM method describes traffic flow based on the length of time a vehicle is delayed
at a signalized intersection. The CCTA and the HCM methods of determining level of service
are described in the Traffic Analysis Report2. The CCTA and the HCM methods are used by this
Plan both to describe level of service at signalized intersections in order to meet the requirements
of the CCTA and to have a reliable, locally adopted LOS procedure. The CCTA method serves
as the standard for assessing congestion, and the HCM method serves as a goal.

EXISTING ROADWAY CONDITIONS
The City’s street system, topography and soil stability have been and continue to be the primary
factors in shaping the circulation and land use patterns in Lafayette. Lafayette is bisected by
State Route 24, and by several roads carrying heavy volumes of through-traffic such as Moraga
Road and Pleasant Hill Road connecting surrounding communities to this highway. Traffic
generally moves well, experiencing little delay during the non-commute hours of the day.
Significant traffic congestion occurs, however, during the peak morning and afternoon commute
hours.
The City street system can be divided into five transportation corridors. Each corridor represents
a major flow of traffic through or within the city, serves a different origin and destination pattern,
and has its characteristic problems and potential solutions. Existing intersection levels of service
are described below and in Table 3 and on Map II-1: Existing Intersection Levels of Service.
They are based on traffic counts taken in October 1998.
In 2012, the City adopted the Downtown Specific Plan. The environmental impact report
(“EIR”) for the Specific Plan analyzed existing and projected levels at 25 signalized and
unsignalized intersections in and around the downtown. Refer to the end of this section for the
analysis from the Downtown Specific Plan’s EIR.
Downtown Corridor. The downtown corridor is defined as the area along Mount Diablo
Boulevard from the westerly to easterly limits of the downtown area. Downtown intersections
are those that are located on Mt. Diablo Blvd. between Risa Road and Carol Lane, and the
intersections of Moraga Road with Moraga Blvd. and Brook Street/School Street. The source of
the traffic problem in the downtown area is clear. Traffic passing through the downtown on the
way to the Route 24 freeway or to the BART station must compete with local traffic. The north-
south through traffic is particularly difficult to serve because of the layout of the downtown
street system. The Lafayette "Y" requires that all north-south traffic must dog leg through two
heavily used downtown intersections. The legs of the "Y" are Moraga Road to the south and
Oak Hill Road on the northwest and First Street on the northeast. Mt. Diablo Boulevard
connects the three legs of the "Y" together. The traffic pattern formed by the "Y" means the
segment of Mt. Diablo Boulevard between Oak Hill Road and First Street must carry both the
north-south and east-west traffic flows.
As shown on Table 3, the greatest congestion in the downtown occurs at the intersection of Mt.
Diablo Boulevard and Moraga Road. However, recent improvements at this intersection have
reduced congestion and delay. Using the HCM procedures and the most recent (October 2001)
traffic counts, this intersection is found to operate at LOS D in the afternoon peak hour and at
LOS C in the morning peak hour. The LOS procedures of the CCTA result in a LOS A in the
morning peak hour and afternoon peak hours at this intersection. The CCTA LOS calculation
method appears to underestimate the congestion and delay that is found at this intersection.
Using the HCM procedures, the intersection of Mt. Diablo Boulevard with Oak Hill Road
operates at LOS D in the afternoon peak hour and at LOS C in the morning peak hour. The LOS
procedures of the CCTA result in service level A in the morning and afternoon peak hours at this
CIRCULATION CHAPTER                                                                               II - 6

intersection. Again, these procedures result in a level of service that does not appear tot
accurately reflect the actual conditions observed in the field.
Using the HCM method and the most recent 2001 traffic counts, the third intersection in the "Y",
Mt. Diablo Boulevard at First Street, is found to operate at LOS C in both the morning and
afternoon peak hours. The CCTA methods result in LOS A in the morning peak hour and LOS
B in the afternoon peak hour at this intersection.
The intersection of Mt. Diablo Boulevard and Happy Valley Road operates at LOS D in the
afternoon and LOS C in the morning peak hours. All of the other intersections in the downtown
area function at LOS C or better at peak traffic hours.
Pleasant Hill Road Corridor. Pleasant Hill Road north of State Route 24 carries the highest traffic
volume of any of the streets in Lafayette. This street functions to connect Lafayette, the
Lafayette BART station, and State Route 24, with the cities of Walnut Creek, Pleasant Hill and
Martinez. Since completion of the Route 24/I-680 interchange, Pleasant Hill Road has
experienced a reduction in through traffic. (Reso. 2009-021, 2009)
The conditions on Pleasant Hill Road north of Route 24 experience some congestion. The
intersection that experiences the worst problems is Pleasant Hill Road at Deer Hill Road/Stanley
Boulevard, as shown in Table 3. According to the HCM method, the intersection operates at
LOS D in both the morning and afternoon peak hours. However, the procedures of the CCTA
result in LOS E in the morning and LOS F in the afternoon peak hours. It appears that on
Pleasant Hill Road the CCTA method over estimates the existing degree of congestion and delay.
At the intersection of Pleasant Hill Road with Springhill Road the CCTA procedures result in a
LOS E in the morning and LOS C in the afternoon peak hours. The HCM method produces LOS
C and B respectively at these hours. The intersection of Pleasant Hill Road with Reliez Valley
Road operates at LOS C or better at both morning and afternoon peak hours under either the
CCTA or the HCM LOS calculation procedures.
The Pleasant Hill Road Action Plan, as adopted by the City Council, has been included by the
CCTA in the Countywide Comprehensive Transportation Plan. Designated as Lafayette’s only
Route of Regional Significance, it is not subject to the adopted Level of Service Standards for
non-regional routes. Instead, an Action Plan has been prepared that establishes Mult-Modal
Transportation Service Objectives (MTSO’s). (Reso. 2009-021, 2009)
Deer Hill Road Corridor. Deer Hill Road serves the area north of downtown and north of the
Route 24 freeway. The Deer Hill Road corridor is defined as the area along Deer Hill Road from
Happy Valley Road to Pleasant Hill Road. The primary vehicle trip generator along Deer Hill
Road is the BART station parking lot.
The intersection of Deer Hill Road with Pleasant Hill Road was discussed above. At the
westerly limit of the Corridor, the stop sign controlled intersection of Deer Hill Road with Happy
Valley Road operates at LOS F for westbound traffic in the morning peak hour and LOS D for
westbound traffic in the afternoon peak hour.
CIRCULATION CHAPTER                                                                            II - 7

The all-way stop controlled intersection of Deer Hill Road with Oak Hill Road operates at LOS
D at peak hours. Traffic volumes are high enough that a traffic signal is warranted on Deer Hill
Road at both the Happy Valley Road and the Oak Hill Road intersections. With signalization
both intersections would operate at an acceptable LOS. A traffic signal was recently installed at
the intersection of Deer Hill Road with the SR 24 Ramps. This intersection currently operates at
LOS C in both the morning and afternoon peak hours.
Moraga Road Corridor. Moraga Road provides the primary route for traffic from the south
traveling to and through the downtown area. The corridor runs from Mount Diablo Boulevard
to the southerly City limit. The operation of the intersection of Moraga Road with Mount Diablo
Boulevard was discussed above. A traffic signal was recently installed at the intersection of
Moraga Road with Moraga Boulevard. This intersection operates at LOS A in both the morning
and afternoon peak hours.
The intersections of Moraga Road with School and with Brook Streets are separated by
approximately 150 feet. Because the two "T" intersections are located in close proximity, they
function as a single four-legged intersection. The existing traffic signal system has been designed
to control both intersections under a single operating design. As shown on Table 3, under the
HCM procedures, the combined intersections are found to operate at LOS E in the morning peak
hour and LOS C in the late afternoon peak hour. The CCTA LOS method finds the intersection
operating at service levels D and B in the morning and afternoon peak hours respectively.
The morning operation of the intersection is designed to permit the safe crossing of the street by
school children. All vehicle traffic is stopped by the pedestrian phase of the signal. This phase
is called for in about one-third of the signal cycles in the morning peak hour. The time lost to
vehicle traffic during the all-red pedestrian phase causes the intersection to operate with
significant delay for motorists.
The greatest traffic delay at the School Street intersection is experienced by parents who drop-off
students at Stanley Intermediate School, located approximately one quarter mile east of Moraga
Road on School Street, and then have to wait at the traffic signal before entering Moraga Road in
either north or southbound directions, as well as the parents who drop-off students at the
Lafayette Elementary School. The queue of vehicles attempting to turn onto Moraga Road
extends from the intersection back past Stanley School. This traffic queue lasts for about 20 to
30 minutes each school day morning. These vehicles experience significant delay and LOS F.
Both the HCM and CCTA LOS calculation methods result in a LOS B for the intersection of
Moraga Road and St. Mary’s Road in both the morning and afternoon peak hours. While there is
substantial congestion experienced along Moraga Road at peak hours, the capacity of the
intersection with St. Mary’s Road is not a primary cause of existing traffic delay.
The intersections of Hamlin Road and Tanglewood Drive with Moraga Road are separated by
about 75 feet. Traffic is controlled by stop signs on Hamlin Road and on Tanglewood Drive. A
southbound left turn pocket is provided for turns from Moraga Road into Hamlin Road. Traffic
attempting to enter Moraga Road from the side streets experiences significant delay, particularly
CIRCULATION CHAPTER                                                                             II - 8

for left turns during the morning peak hours. The level of service for traffic making the left turn
from Tanglewood Drive is LOS E at morning peak hour and LOS C at afternoon peak hour.
Most traffic from Hamlin Road makes a right turn onto Moraga Road and experiences less delay
than is experienced by the traffic on Tanglewood Drive.
Silver Springs Road is the easterly leg and Mt. View Drive is the westerly leg of a standard four-
legged intersection with Moraga Road. Old Jonas Hill Road intersects Moraga Road
approximately 180 feet south of Silver Springs Road/Mt. View Drive intersection. The
intersections are close enough, however, to be evaluated as a single intersection for traffic
operations purposes. Each of the three side streets is controlled by a stop sign. Separate lanes
are provided on Moraga Road for both northbound and southbound left turning traffic. Because
left turn pockets are provided on Moraga Road, there is little delay for northbound or southbound
through traffic. There is some delay (LOS B) for traffic on Moraga Road turning left into the
side streets. Average side street service level at this intersection is LOS C in the morning and
LOS B in the afternoon peak hours.
Burton Valley Corridor. The Burton Valley Corridor includes Reliez Station Road, Glenside
Drive, and St. Mary’s Road between the Pleasant Hill Road Corridor and the southerly City
limits on St. Mary’s Road. In recent years, several roadway improvements have been made in
this corridor to improve traffic safety and to serve pedestrians.
Most of the intersections in this corridor are controlled by all-way stop signs. While there is a
significant volume of through traffic using the local streets that make up this corridor, the
maximum calculated average stopped delay per vehicle over a one-hour peak period is 22
seconds. This means that all of the local street intersections operate at LOS D or better in both
the morning and afternoon peak hours. It should be noted that the LOS reported is the average
condition over the one-hour peak period. At some intersections, much greater congestion may
occur for short time periods. For example, there is a peak flow of parents intending to drop-off
students at the Burton Valley School southbound around 8:15 a.m. and returning northbound
around 8:30 a.m. All-way stop intersections are particularly inefficient when serving high peak
direction traffic flows. At these times delays are greater for a few minutes than are shown on
Table 3 for the full one-hour condition.

EXISTING DOWNTOWN CIRCULATION (DOWNTOWN SPECIFIC PLAN)
All of the signalized study area intersections currently operate at “good” LOS D or better except
the following three intersections:
   Moraga Road/School Street: LOS F during the AM and mid-day (2:15 to 3:15 PM) peak
    hours. Although the worst congestion occurs for less than one hour during each peak period,
    which coincides with the adjacent school drop-off and pick-up activity, the intersection level
    of service is unacceptable in the AM and mid-day peaks.
   Moraga Road/Brook Street: “Poor” LOS D during the mid-day (2:15 to 3:15 PM) peak hour.
    Although the peak hour level of service is acceptable for this downtown intersection, it is
    severely affected by both queue spillover and constrained traffic flow from the adjacent
    Moraga Road/School Street intersection during both the AM and mid-day peak hours.
   Deer Hill Road/State Route 24 Westbound Ramps: “Poor” LOS D during the AM and PM
    peak hours is unacceptable for this intersection outside downtown. The Mount Diablo
    Boulevard/Moraga Road intersection operates at an acceptable LOS D during the AM, mid-
    day, and PM peak periods based on the overall average delay at the intersection, which
    determines the level of service.
All of the unsignalized intersections operate at LOS C or better except Deer Hill Road/Happy
Valley Road, which operates at LOS F during the AM peak hour. This does not meet the General
Plan LOS goal. Traffic volumes are higher at some of the study area intersections during the
noon hour when compared to the mid-day (2:15 p.m. to 3:15 p.m.) peak hour used in this
analysis, however, separate level of service calculations (using HCM methodology) showed that
those intersections currently operate at LOS C or better during the lunchtime hour. The 2:15 to
3:15 p.m. period clearly represents the worst-case mid-day conditions at most study area
intersections.

COORDINATING LAND USE AND CIRCULATION
The coordination of land use and circulation is essential to balance the capacity of the existing
circulation network with the traffic growth generated by new development. To understand the
relationship between land use and circulation, a traffic forecasting model was used in preparing
this General Plan.3 The model predicted the amount of traffic that will occur when all of the land
covered by the General Plan is built out, including the anticipated development in the
surrounding cities of Moraga, Orinda, Concord, Pleasant Hill and Walnut Creek. The traffic
projections estimate how much traffic will be generated by new development, what traffic
problems will occur, and the roadway improvements to relieve traffic congestion.
The policies and programs in the General Plan ensure that land use and circulation are
coordinated. Standards for traffic levels of service and for fire, police, parks, sanitary facilities,
water and flood control illustrate a comprehensive long-range method of matching the demand
for public facilities generated by new development with plans, capital improvements and
development mitigation programs.
The traffic projections indicate that the development permitted by the General Plan would cause
an increase in traffic congestion on the city's street system. The impact of added traffic on each
of the 25 key intersections in Lafayette is summarized by Tables 4 and 4a.
Projected traffic would meet the levels of service established by the CCTA for signalized
intersections at all but one intersections: Moraga Road at Brook/School Streets.
3   3Draft Environmental Impact Report on the Lafayette General Plan Revision, Traffic and Circulation, Leonard Charles
    and Associates and Robert L. Harrison Transportation Planning, 2002.
CIRCULATION CHAPTER                                                                                             II - 12

The City anticipates that the intersection of Moraga Road and School/Brook Streets will not meet
the adopted LOS standards at some point in the future. The period of excessive congestion will
primarily occur during the Peak AM hour and only while school is in session. On non-school
days congestion would be less at this intersection. The City recognizes that there are a variety of
options for reducing traffic congestion, including signalization or re-routing traffic. Such options
must be evaluated against other considerations – specifically, pedestrian access and safety, and
protection of the quality of life in surrounding residential neighborhoods. These concerns may
cause the rejection of certain traffic management options.
Routes of Regional Significance are excluded from service level standards by the CCTA since
Traffic Service Objectives (TSO's) are used instead. This approach allows local jurisdictions to
develop programs that emphasize performance characteristics other than peak hour level of
service at intersections. In Lafayette, Pleasant Hill Road north of State Route 24 is a Route of
Regional Significance and is subject to the TSOs adopted in the Pleasant Hill Road Action Plan.
These are:
   Improve the existing peak hour peak direction Delay Index by 10% by the year 2010.
   Maintain or increase the average vehicle occupancy to 1.2 persons per vehicle by 2010.
Traffic projections indicate there would be three unsignalized intersections, which are projected
to operate at a highly congested LOS E or LOS F. These are:
          The intersection of Deer Hill Road with Happy Valley Road.
          The intersection of Deer Hill Road with Oak Hill Road.
          The intersection of Pleasant Hill Road with Olympic Boulevard
In addition, State Route 24 during peak hours is projected to decline to LOS F. This would occur
regardless of whether or not the build out permitted by the Lafayette General Plan occurs.
The intersections and State Route 24 described above are primarily impacted by traffic generated
outside of Lafayette. A significant proportion of traffic growth is attributable to through traffic,
which passes through Lafayette, but originates and has destinations outside of the City. Local
trips are defined as travel entirely within Lafayette. Regional trips traffic includes all trips that
originate outside of Lafayette and pass through the City without stopping.
The traffic projections indicate that local traffic growth accounts for only 20 percent of the total
projected traffic growth on Moraga Road, Burton Valley, Pleasant Hill Road and Deer Hill Road
corridors to about 35 percent of the projected traffic growth in the Downtown corridor.

The City is committed to maintaining a safe and efficient roadway system that respects the
tranquility of surrounding neighborhoods. Alternatives to the single-occupant vehicle, such as
increased use of public transit and carpools, and reducing the travel demand through better land
use planning are important locally and countywide. This Plan includes land use policies and
designations that reduce the need to travel by vehicle to work, recreation and shopping. Higher
density residential development near public transportation combined with mixed use
designations Downtown, will permit more Lafayette residents to live closer to their jobs and will
encourage public transit use.
Land use and circulation are coordinated by General Plan policies permitting a level of potential
development that can be served by the existing and planned circulation system. The Growth
Management Section of the Land Use Chapter contains policies and programs to ensure that new
development does not exceed the capacity of the roadway system and other public services.

PROJECTED DOWNTOWN CIRCULATION (DOWNTOWN SPECIFIC PLAN)
All of the signalized study area intersections would operate at an acceptable LOS D or better
except the following four intersections by 2030:
     Mount Diablo Boulevard/Moraga Road: LOS E during the PM peak hour. The intersection
      would operate at an acceptable LOS D during the AM and mid-day peak periods based on the
      overall average delay at the intersection, which determines the level of service.
     Moraga Road/School Street: LOS F during the AM, mid-day, and PM peak hours.
     Moraga Road/Brook Street: LOS E during the mid-day peak hour. Although the AM and PM
      peak hour level of service would be acceptable for this intersection, it would be severely
      affected by both queue spillover and constrained traffic flow from the LOS F conditions at
      the Moraga Road/School Street intersection during all three peak hours.
     Deer Hill Road/State Route 24 Westbound Ramps: LOS E during the AM and PM peak
      hours.
Three of the four unsignalized study intersections would operate at an unacceptable level of
service during at least one of the peak hours:
         Deer Hill Road/Happy Valley Road: LOS F during the AM peak hour and LOS E during
          the PM peak hour.
         Deer Hill Road/Oak Hill Road: LOS E during the PM peak hour.
         First Street/State Route 24 Eastbound On-Ramp: LOS F for the southbound left turn to
          the freeway on-ramp during the PM peak hour.

For the routes of regional significance, the CCTA traffic model was used assuming buildout of
the General Plan. The Delay Index measures travel congestion and is expressed as the ratio of
time required to travel between two points during the peak hour (the congested travel time)
versus the time required during uncongested offpeak times. A Delay Index of 2.0, which is the
acceptable standard of significance for State Route 24 and Pleasant Hill Road north of State
Route 24, means that congested travel time is twice as long as during an off-peak travel time.
The Delay Indexes were calculated during the AM and PM peak hours on State Route 24 in both
the eastbound and westbound direction between St. Stephens Drive and Interstate 680. State
Route 24 will operate with an unacceptable Delay Index of over 2.0 for westbound traffic in the
AM peak hour and eastbound traffic in the PM peak hour. For Pleasant Hill Road in both the
northbound and southbound direction between State Route 24 and Taylor Boulevard, the Delay
Indexes were calculated during the AM and PM peak hours. Pleasant Hill Road will operate with
an unacceptable Delay Index of over 2.0 for southbound traffic in the AM peak hour and
northbound traffic in the PM peak hour.
Goal C-1              Develop a safe and efficient circulation system that respects Lafayette’s
                      quality of life and community character and is consistent with other City
                      goals.
Policy C-1.1          Public Participation and Education in Transportation Decisions: Continue to
                      actively seek the participation of Lafayette residents and businesses in the
                      preparation and review of local and regional transportation plans and issues.

                        Program C-1.1.1: Disseminate information describing proposed transportation
                        projects through signs in affected areas, newspapers, newsletters, electronic
                        media and other appropriate means to inform and encourage community
                        participation in decisions regarding transportation planning.
                        Program C-1.1.2: Hold public meetings and hearings for the purpose of
                        planning and evaluating proposed transportation plans and improvements.
                        Program C-1.1.3: Work with residents, businesses and property owners who
                        wish to improve traffic safety and solve circulation problems.
                        Program C-1.1.4: Provide staff to assist residents with information and
                        direction regarding the City’s process for recommending ideas for traffic safety
                        and circulation improvements.
                        Program C-1.1.5: Develop a comprehensive city-wide handbook providing
                        information on traffic calming devices, conditions appropriate for use, fees
                        and/or costs and procedures for implementation.
                        Program C-1.1.6: Continue to support and participate in MORTRAC’s (the
                        Moraga Road Transportation Advisory Committee) efforts to:
                        (1) address community concerns regarding the level of vehicular traffic, traffic
                             congestion, pedestrian and bicycle safety, and neighborhood character
                             along the Moraga Road corridor, and
                        (2) develop a plan regarding circulation and related quality of life issues on
                             and around Moraga Road.
Policy C-1.2            Level of Service Standards and Goals: Establish the following level of service
                        (LOS) standards and goals. Transportation improvements must be consistent
                        with the community's strong desire to preserve Lafayette's unique identity and
                        quality of life.

5   The level of service standard established by the Draft General Plan uses the CCTA methodology to calculate level of
    service standards. The HCM method is used to calculate level of service goals. Under the CCTA Growth Management Plan
    service level grades, such as LOS "A" or "B", are divided into high or low categories. A "high D". for example, means a
    higher volume to capacity ratio than does a "Low D". This definition has caused confusion since the Growth Management
    Plan definition states that a "high" letter grade means a worse level of service than does a "low" grade of the same letter. In
    order to clarify these definitions the LOS letter grades in the Draft General Plan are divided by categories defined as
    "Good" or "Poor". For example, a "Good D" in the Draft General Plan is equivalent to a "Low D" in the CCTA's Growth
    Management Plan.

              laws.
              Program C-1.6.2: Periodically analyze the locations of traffic accidents to
              identify problem areas and utilize this information in prioritizing
              improvements as a part of the City’s Capital Improvement Program.
              Program C-1.6.3: Minimize the number of driveway accesses to arterial streets
              in the core area. Encourage shared access where appropriate. Require that all
              new proposals for access be reviewed for safety by the city traffic engineer.
Policy C-1.7  Traffic Control Devices: Optimize the functioning of traffic control devices in
              order to efficiently manage vehicular and pedestrian traffic flow. When
              planning new traffic control devices consider their environmental and aesthetic
              impact.
Goal C-2      Regulate traffic so as to preserve the peace and quiet of residential areas.
              Through-traffic tends to take the route of least resistance, often resulting in a
              high through volume of traffic taking residential streets located adjacent to
              busy traffic corridors. It is essential that through traffic on local streets be
              discouraged to protect the quality of life and safety of residential
              neighborhoods located adjacent to heavily-traveled corridors.

              encouraging a pedestrian-oriented design and scale; and on maintaining the
              quality of life and identity of residential neighborhoods than on
              accommodating through-traffic.
              The roadway improvements required to accommodate through traffic to
              achieve more efficient traffic flow shall not be implemented if they are found to
              have significant adverse impacts on the quality of life and safety of residential
              neighborhoods.
              Program C-3.1.1: Require that a traffic study be carried out for proposed
              change in access to local streets from arterial or collector streets. Include in the
              traffic study the projected increase in average daily and peak hour traffic that
              would result from the proposed change; include any traffic safety-related
CIRCULATION CHAPTER                                                                          II - 20

              matters and consider alternative feasible options. Conduct new traffic counts
              when and where needed.
Policy C-3.2  Response to Citizen Concerns: Continue to provide a system whereby residents
              can address automobile, bicycling and pedestrian issues.
              Program C-3.2.1: Work with residents to implement traffic-calming measures,
              as appropriate, to address traffic safety, circulation, speed, and other
              neighborhood and downtown traffic concerns.
              Program C-3.2.2: Work with residents who wish to develop tools such as
              neighborhood traffic management plans tailored to address the concerns and
              needs of a targeted area. These plans should be reviewed periodically to ensure
              consistency with the goals and policies of the General Plan.
              Program C-3.2.3: Consider identification of locations where aesthetically
              pleasing traffic calming devices can be installed.

              can be adequately served by Lafayette’s circulation system.
              Program C-4.1.1: Require applicants for new development to demonstrate that
              there is adequate transportation capacity to handle the additional traffic their
              project would generate. Evaluate area-wide cumulative traffic impacts as well
              as the impacts of any proposed mitigations in development review.
              Program C-4.1.2: Consider transit-oriented developments, which are consistent
              with the goals and policies of the General Plan.
              Program C-4.1.3: Approval of development expected to generate over 50 peak
              hour vehicle trips shall occur only if found to be consistent with Lafayette’s
              growth management goals and the other goals and policies of the General Plan.
Policy C-4.2  Traffic Mitigation: Require new developments to pay their fair share of
              circulation improvements.
              Program C-4.2.1: Ensure that new development mitigates its off-site adverse
              impacts on the circulation system and, if applicable, contributes to a citywide
              traffic mitigation fee program.
              Program C-4.2.2: Ensure that new developments provide adequate on-site
              improvements, such as delivery access, on-site vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian
              circulation amenities, public transit facilities, and off-street parking, as
              appropriate.
Goal C-5      Preserve and enhance the scenic quality of Lafayette’s roads.
CIRCULATION CHAPTER                                                                      II - 21

Policy C-5.1       Protect Irreplaceable Resources: When planning new roads or roadway
                   improvements, protect resources such as open space, hillsides, ridgelines,
                   riparian corridors, and recreational facilities. Circulation projects must be
                   consistent with goals and policies of the Open Space and Conservation
                   Element.
                   Program C-5.1.1: No road should be constructed within 250 horizontal feet of
                   the centerline of a major ridgeline. This prohibition does not apply to a road
                   and attendant underground utilities which cross a major ridge if the crossing is
                   necessary for orderly development.
                   Program C-5.1.2: In designing road improvements consider seismic risk, soil
                   stability, drainage, scenic character, and privacy. Require compliance with
                   current engineering standards and practices. Require peer review as needed.
Policy C-5.2       Aesthetics: When planning road and circulation system improvements, require
                   that views of and from the roadway are in keeping with Lafayette’s semi-rural
                   character.
                   See the Land Use and Open Space Chapters for additional goals and policies
                   on the preservation of natural areas and Lafayette’s semi-rural character.
                   Program C-5.2.1: Establish a process to ensure effective design review of
                   circulation projects.
                   Program C-5.2.2: Adopt specific criteria for street lighting. Street lighting
                   installed for safety reasons should incorporate every effort to maintain the
                   semi-rural character of the area.
Policy C-5.3       Scenic Routes: Designate and protect scenic routes consistent with goals and
                   policies of Lafayette’s General Plan.
                   Program C-5.3.1: Adopt specific criteria for scenic routes with regard to
                   applicable signage, landscaping and lighting.
ALTERNATIVES TO THE AUTOMOBILE
Traffic congestion will continue to worsen significantly despite the roadway improvements
recommended in this Plan. Improving the roadway system is not the only solution. Providing
effective alternatives to the single-occupant automobile must be an essential component of
circulation planning. This includes increased use of public transit, carpools, flexible work hours,
bicycling, walking and telecommuting in conjunction with land use patterns and measures to
reduce travel demand. Alternatives to the automobile contribute to energy conservation, reduce
air and water pollution and the immense cost of building and maintaining additional highways
and roads.
Goal C-6           Provide an attractive, well-designed system of walkways for safe and
                   efficient pedestrian movement in Lafayette. The walkway system should
CIRCULATION CHAPTER                                                                           II - 22

              connect residential areas with the local and regional trails system, public
              transportation, schools, parks and other community amenities, and the
              Downtown Core area.
              Walking remains the least costly form of transport for all people. Walkways
              are crucial to promoting the health and sustainability of streets and
              neighborhoods. Walkways are designed to connect where people live, work,
              attend school, shop, and play without dependence on the automobile. Many
              opportunities exist to build well-designed walkways that serve the needs of the
              pedestrian.
              Refer to the Parks, Trails and Recreation Chapter for policies and programs
              regarding trails.
Policy C-6.1  Master Walkways Plan: Continue to update and implement the Master
              Walkways Plan.
              Program C-6.1.1: Identify and preserve rights-of-way needed to implement the
              Master Walkways Plan.

              pedestrian routes; upgrade and maintain them as necessary.
              Program C-6.2.2: Establish a walkway pavement improvement program.
Goal C-7      Reduce automobile travel demand.
              Measures to manage travel demand, called Transportation Systems
              Management (TSM), are directed at reducing the number of single-occupant
              vehicles using the circulation system during peak hour commute periods.
              These programs include advocating public transit; promoting carpooling and
              vanpooling; encouraging telecommuting and compressed work weeks;
              providing shuttle buses to transit facilities; providing incentives and rewards
              for bicycling, walking and telecommuting; and offering preferred parking for
              carpools.
              The CCTA Growth Management Program requires each jurisdiction in Contra
              Costa County to adopt a Transportation Systems Management Ordinance. The
              TSM programs also enable the City to achieve the "Clean Air Goals"
              established by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.

COMPLETE STREETS
In September 2008 the Governor signed into law the California Complete Streets Act, requiring
General Plans to develop a plan for a multi-modal transportation system. “Complete Streets” are
CIRCULATION CHAPTER                                                                            II - 26

defined as streets that serve everyone—pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, and drivers—and
they take into account the needs of people with disabilities, older people, and children. Complete
Streets design concepts can improve safety by considering all user groups, improve people’s
health by promoting an active lifestyle that involves more walking or bicycling instead of
driving, and allow all modes of travel to be used safely and efficiently in a community and the
region. Implementation of Complete Streets concepts can result in improved mobility for people
who cannot or do not drive and result in less reliance on automobiles. A reduction in automobile
use would result in a reduction in local vehicle-miles travelled, along with a corresponding
reduction in transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions created by the burning of fossil
fuels.
The existing goals, policies and programs throughout the Circulation Element are generally
consistent with the Complete Streets concept. These policies address consideration of
pedestrians, reducing automobile travel demand, alternatives to the single-occupant automobile,
and providing access for the mobility-impaired, all with context sensitivity and public input. The
following additional goal, policies and programs supplement Lafayette’s Complete Streets
concept. (Reso. 2012-46, 2012)
Goal C-11       Provide a balanced, multimodal transportation network that meets the needs
                of all users and provides safe and convenient travel that is consistent with
                local conditions and needs of the community. (Reso. 2012-46, 2012)
                Already consistent with many goals and policies of Lafayette’s existing General
                Plan, the Complete Streets concept reiterates a balanced approach to
                transportation design that provides flexibility to best accommodate all users and
                modes given the unique characteristics of the community. All streets are different,
                and the needs of various users will need to be balanced in a flexible manner. The
                Complete Streets concept acknowledges that there is a need for varying degrees
                of accommodation for each type of user in different settings, while still ensuring
                basic accommodation is provided for all permitted users. (Reso. 2012-46, 2012)
Policy C-11.1 All Users: Design and operate city streets based on a ”Complete Streets” concept
                that enables safe, comfortable, and attractive access and travel for pedestrians,
                bicyclists, motorists, movers of commercial goods and transit users of all ages and
                abilities. (Reso. 2012-46, 2012)
Policy C-11.2 Context Sensitivity: Ensure that the designs of public right-of-way improvements
                are consistent with the character of the project neighborhood. (Reso. 2012-46, 2012)
Policy C-11.3 Connectivity: Provide a connected network of facilities accommodating all modes
                of travel in the transportation system. This includes looking for opportunities for
                repurposing existing publicly-owned rights-of-way to enhance connectivity for
                cyclists, pedestrians, and transit users to schools, parks, commercial areas, civic
                destinations and regional non-motorized networks. (Reso. 2012-46, 2012)
Policy C-11.4 All Departments: Work towards making Complete Streets practices a routine part
                of everyday operations. Each City of Lafayette department should approach
                relevant projects, programs, and practices as an opportunity to improve streets and
                the transportation network for all users, and work in coordination with other
CIRCULATION CHAPTER                                                                             II - 27

              departments, agencies, and jurisdictions to maximize opportunities for Complete
              Streets connectivity. (Reso. 2012-46, 2012)
Policy C-11.5 All Projects and Phases: Apply Complete Street concept to the planning, funding,
              design, approval and implementation phases of roadway projects, including those
              involving new construction, reconstruction, retrofits, major rehabilitation, or
              changes in the allocation of pavement space on an existing roadway, as well as
              those that involve new privately built roads and easements intended for public
              use. Specific infrastructure for a given category of users may be excluded if an
              exemption is approved via the process set forth in Policy C11.6, “Exemptions.”
              (Reso. 2012-46, 2012)
              Program C11.5.1: Solicit early input from the Circulation Commission and
              Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee, or their representatives, during
              project development to verify bicycling and pedestrian needs for projects. (Reso.
              2012-46, 2012)
              Program C-11.5.2: Coordinate the implementation of Complete Streets concepts,
              as appropriate, with ongoing transportation programs and plans such as the
              Pavement Management Program, Capital Improvement Program, Transportation
              Demand Management Program, Traffic Calming Program, Master Walkways
              Plan, and Bikeways Master Plan. (Reso. 2012-46, 2012)
              Program C-11.5.3: Include “Complete Streets” considerations in all circulation
              improvement projects when planning, reviewing, and implementing capital
              improvement plans, major roadway rehabilitation and development review
              applications. When appropriate, these design considerations may include, but are
              not limited to, the following:
              1. Minimize the number of driveway accesses (Consistent with Program C-1.6.3)
              2. Public transit facilities, like bus stops and related improvements
              3. Safety considerations such as lighting, sight distance, and traffic calming
                  measures for residential streets
              4. Sign design (e.g. street signs, entry signs, directional signs);
              5. Street furniture; paving material, landscaping
              6. Type, width and routing of pedestrian facility and supporting improvements
              7. Type, width and routing of bikeway, bike parking and supporting
                  improvements

      OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION
                                             Adopted in entirety by Resolution 2002-56 on October 28, 2002
PURPOSE
Open space serves several functions. It preserves natural resources such as riparian areas and
plant and animal habitats; it provides recreational opportunities in natural environments and
areas with scenic interest; it limits development in areas with hazardous conditions such as
unstable soils and steep hillsides; it provides visual relief from developed areas and provides
Lafayette with much of its distinctive character.
This chapter addresses the state requirements for the Open Space Element and the Conservation
Element. Open Space, as defined by State law, is “any area of land or water which is essentially
unimproved and devoted to open space use and which is designated on a local, regional or state
open space plan as open space for the preservation of natural resources, the managed production
of resources, outdoor recreation, or for public health and safety.”
The chapter emphasizes the preservation of natural resources and scenic views. Open space and
natural resources are a vital part of life in Lafayette as they offer ecological, aesthetic,
recreational, educational, social and economic benefits.
There are two sections to this chapter: Section I contains goals, policies and implementation
programs to ensure that Lafayette residents will enjoy the benefits of open space as the city
continues to develop. Section II contains goals, policies and implementation programs to protect
the natural environment. They address biological resources, environmentally sensitive areas,
water resources, air quality, solid waste and recycling, and energy conservation. Open space for
public health and safety is discussed in the Seismic and Geological Hazards and Flood Hazards
sections of the Safety Chapter. Open space for recreation is discussed in the Parks, Trails and
Recreation Chapter.
OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION CHAPTER                                                                   III-1

SECTION I: OPEN SPACE
There are three categories of open space in Lafayette: (1) publicly-owned land, such as Briones
Regional Park and the Lafayette Reservoir; (2) dedicated land, which is privately-owned and
maintained, that has a recorded open space, scenic or conservation easement requiring that it
remain permanently as open space; or (3) land which has a trail easement permitting public use
for hiking. Trail easements are discussed in the Parks, Trails and Recreation Chapter. A list of
publicly owned open spaces in the Lafayette Planning Area is presented in Table I.

Lafayette is fortunate to be surrounded by an extensive network of open space lands. Residents
have long recognized the vital role that open space plays in defining the character of the
community and our quality of life. Large open space areas along the ridgelines can include
public access and scenic trail opportunities, linking open space areas to community and regional
parks. Lafayette’s streams and creeks are a unique natural resource that provides riparian areas
and aquatic and wildlife habitat, as well as scenic enjoyment.
Goal OS-1:      Preserve areas of visual prominence and special ecological significance as
                Open Space.
Policy OS-1.1       Protection of Major Ridgelines. Preserve Major Ridgelines in their natural state
                    as scenic resources and wildlife corridors.
                    Major ridgelines are shown on a map on file in the City offices and are
                    illustrated on Map III-1: Hillside Overlay Area.
                    Program OS-1.1.1: Require a setback from the centerline of Major Ridgelines
                    for all development including roads, grading, fencing, and introduced
                    vegetation other than indigenous native vegetation, wherever feasible. The
                    centerline of a ridge is the line running along the highest portion of the ridge.
                    Program OS-1.1.2: Limit the height of structures near major ridgelines to a
                    plane sloping downward at a 15-degree declination from the ridge.
OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION CHAPTER                                                                III-2

               Program OS-1.1.3: Require open space, scenic, or conservation easements as
               conditions of development approval.
               Program OS-1.1.4: Designate publicly owned or dedicated open space areas on
               visually prominent ridgelines with the Open Space Land Use Designation.
Policy OS-1.2  Ridgeline Protection: Protect all ridgelines consistent with their function as
               scenic resources for the community and as wildlife corridors.
Policy OS-1.3  Conserve a Variety of Open Space Features: Protect areas of special ecological
               significance, including ridges, hillsides, woodlands, wildlife corridors, riparian
               areas, steep slopes, prominent knolls, swales, and rock outcroppings.
               Program OS-1.3.1: Protect areas of special ecological significance through the
               use of open space, scenic and conservation easements as conditions of
               development approval.
               Program OS-1.3.2: Require that land dedicated as open space as a condition of
               development approval be permanently restricted to open space uses by
               recorded map or deed.
               Program OS-1.3.3: Develop a standard Open Space/Scenic and Conservation
               Easement which requires that dedicated land be restricted to open space uses in
               perpetuity and which establishes standards for the protection of natural features
               and open space functions.
Policy OS-1.4  Specific Open Space Use Criteria: Leave in or restore open space areas to their
               natural state. Limit uses to those with minimal environmental impact.
               Program OS-1.4.1: Revise the Zoning Ordinance to require that open space
               areas be left in their natural state and permit only uses which have minimal
               environmental impact. Define standards for the protection of natural features
               and open space functions.
Policy OS-1.5  Open Space for Wildlife Habitat: Preserve, protect, and where necessary,
               restore open space for wildlife habitat to assure the continued viability and
               health of diverse, natural animal and plant communities.
Policy OS-1.6  Continuous Open Spaces: Assemble open space areas from contiguous parcels
               to provide continuous scenic and wildlife corridors wherever feasible.
               Program OS-1.6.1: Maintain and update a map Open Space/Scenic and
               Conservation Easements.
Policy OS-1.7  Open Space for Wildlife Corridors: Assure that adequate open space is
               provided to permit effective wildlife corridors for animal movement between
               open space areas, along watercourses, and on ridges.
               Program OS-1.7.1: Prepare a study to identify wildlife corridors.

Goal OS-2      Expand the amount of publicly owned open space.
Policy OS-2.1  Open Space Strategy: Develop a strategy to expand public ownership and
               stewardship of key parcels.
               Program OS-2.1.1: Pursue available grants and government funding sources
               for the acquisition and preservation of open space.
               Program OS-2.1.2: Seek dedication of open space through public and private
               trusts, non-profit organizations, local and regional agencies, special interest
               groups, and other means.
               Program OS-2.1.3: Consider placing a measure on the ballot for a tax,
               assessment, or General Obligation Bond for the purchase of open space.
               Program OS-2.1.4: Work actively with neighboring jurisdictions and
               participate in their public processes to protect ridgelines and prominent open
               spaces, which can be viewed from Lafayette.
               The City considers the EBRPD as the appropriate agency to manage large
               open space areas and will continue to coordinate future open space
               dedications, particularly in areas where regional trails are planned. Other
               smaller private open spaces are protected by scenic and conservation
               easements.

SECTION II: CONSERVATION
Section II presents goals, policies and programs to conserve Lafayette's natural resources,
including plants, animals, soil, scenic views, water and air. Open space policies are mentioned
again in this section as they apply specifically to the conservation of scenic and biological
resources. Energy conservation and reduction of solid waste are also discussed.
SCENIC RESOURCES
Many hillsides and ridgelines within the City constitute significant natural topographical
features. The retention of these hillsides in as near a natural state as feasible is an important
community value.
Goal OS-3         Maintain the semi-rural character and beauty of the city by preserving its
                  open and uncluttered natural topographic features.
Policy OS-3.1     Protect natural features of the lands: The character and natural features of hills,
                  steep slopes, riparian areas, woodlands, and open areas will be preserved in as
                  natural a condition as feasible.
                  Program OS-3.1.1: Ensure that grading does not detract from the natural forms
                  of hillsides and that development retains the ecological characteristics of the
                  site. This includes prominent geological features, individual trees, woodland,
                  riparian vegetation, rock outcroppings, streams, ponds, drainage swales, and
                  other natural features. Minimize the disturbance or removal of vegetation.
                  Program OS-3.1.2: Limit the scarring and cutting of hillsides caused by
                  grading, especially for long roads and driveways.
Policy OS-3.2     Preserve the predominant views of the hill areas: Require that structures in
                  identified environmentally sensitive areas be substantially concealed by
                  existing vegetation or terrain when viewed from lower elevations, to the
                  maximum extent feasible.
                  The Viewing Evaluation Map, on file at the City offices, illustrates areas within
                  the city from which views will be considered.
                  Program OS-3.2.1: Require structures in identified environmentally sensitive
                  areas be located away from prominent locations such as hilltops, knolls and
                  open slopes, wherever feasible.
                  See Goal OS-1 for policies protecting Major Ridgelines.
                  See the Land Use Chapter for other policies aimed at protecting the scenic
                  qualities of hillsides.
OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION CHAPTER                                                             III-5
BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
Although Lafayette is a mature community located in a developed region of the County, it retains
an abundance of valuable biological resources. A large variety of native plant and animal
species can be found in open space areas, hillsides, and in riparian areas. Many slopes and
undeveloped ridgelines contain native grassland and oak woodlands. Chaparral, a unique plant
community composed of dense, mainly evergreen shrubs and small trees, occupies many slopes
including the Lafayette Ridge, the Burton Ridge and the Lafayette Reservoir. Along creeks and
streams there are riparian woodlands, where a variety of larger oaks, walnut, California buckeye,
cottonwood, and bay trees thrive.
Open space areas support a range of animal life including such mammals as the black-tailed deer,
opossum, raccoons, gray squirrels, and jackrabbits. Larger species, such as fox, bobcat, coyote
and mountain lion can also be found in undeveloped areas.
Riparian areas function both as wildlife corridors and drainage ways. They are particularly
important to wildlife, providing travel routes from one habitat to another, cover, water, and a rich
supply of foods. This Chapter also seeks to preserve and enhance creeks and their associated
vegetation. Undeveloped ridge lands can connect open spaces that contain a variety of
vegetation.
The Lafayette Planning Area has thirteen Sensitive Plant Species and ten wildlife species that are
classified as sensitive or endangered by either the state or federal government. These are listed in
the EIR and in the General Plan Background Report.
Groves of trees have become a valuable resource to the community. A number of trees have
been identified as “Grand Trees.” A book entitled Trees for Lafayette by Russell Beatty lists
trees and tree groves which are candidates for designation as “Grand Trees” or “Distinctive Tree
Groves.” It is included in the General Plan Background Report.

                       protection for significant native trees and woodlands.
                       Program OS-4.3.2: Require replacement and maintenance of native trees
                       and/or woodland areas when a project results in the loss of woodland habitat.
                       Replace trees accidentally damaged or removed during construction with trees
                       substantially larger than normally required.
                       Program OS-4.3.3: Consider establishing an in-lieu mitigation program to
                       allow off-site replacement of trees damaged or removed for development.
Policy OS-4.4          The Developed Landscape: Protect important groves of trees and significant
                       existing vegetation. Encourage the planting of native, drought-tolerant and fire-
                       resistant species, as well as the planting of herbaceous species that have a high
                       wildlife value. Avoid the cutting of mature trees.

                       new development preserve existing healthy trees and native vegetation to the
                       maximum extent feasible.
                       Program OS-4.4.2: Continue to use Trees for Lafayette by Russell Beatty as a
                       guide to principles of planting in Lafayette and as a guide to appropriate tree
                       species. Update and reprint the booklet.
                       Program OS-4.4.3: Emphasize the use of native plants in the public landscape
                       and right-of-way, where appropriate.
Policy OS-4.5          Biotic Resource Analysis: Require a biotic resource analysis prior to
                       development of properties located within, or adjacent to, identified
                       environmentally sensitive areas.
                       The general location of environmentally sensitive land, which includes
                       riparian areas, wildlife corridors, steep hillsides1, and major ridgelines, is
                       indicated on Map III-1: Hillside Overlay Area. This map is not intended to be
                       exhaustive, and should be used as a guide to locating environmentally sensitive
                       land in the Lafayette Planning Area. It may be supplemented by additional
                       information provided by specific plans, EIR's and other documents or studies.
                       Program OS-4.5.1: Require development proposals, for land in or adjacent to
                       an environmentally sensitive area, to develop a Biotic Resource Analysis of the
                       property. This analysis shall determine the presence and location of threatened

                   and endangered plant and animal species, and other information relevant to the
                   preservation of significant biotic resources.
                   The Biotic Resource Analysis will take place before development proposals are
                   formally accepted as complete by the City. Qualified biologists, arborists, and
                   other professionals will be selected by the City to conduct the Biotic Resource
                   Analysis paid for by the developer. The Biotic Resource Analysis will be used
                   in, and integrated with, the environmental review of the project.
                   The determination that a Biotic Resource Analysis is required will be made by
                   the Community Development Department staff and can be appealed to the
                   Planning Commission. The Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations
                   will be amended to include regulations regarding the processing of a Biotic
                   Resource Analysis as a part of development review.
WATER RESOURCES
Lafayette is traversed by several creeks and streams, which are affected by pollution from storm
drains and other sources. These creeks, streams and associated ponds and wetlands represent an
environmental resource on which wildlife and plants depend.
Two general types of pollutant discharges affect the quality of surface water and groundwater in
the Lafayette Planning Area:
                •   Point source discharge, which consists of discharge from a pipe or other
                    device directly into the receiving waters. Discharge of treated wastewater
                    from a sewer plant or an industrial or other commercial building into a stream
                    are common examples. Point sources can be managed through monitoring and
                    treatment methods.
                •   Non-point source discharge, which consists of storm water runoff that runs
                    over streets, parking lots, landscaped areas, and minor watercourses before it
                    reaches a major creek, river or other water body. Runoff can contain litter,
                    debris, soil, and natural and man-made pollutants. Typical pollutants include
                    organic materials that contribute to biochemical oxygen demand, suspended
                    solids, pathogens, sediment from erosion, gasoline additives, oil, grease,
                    nitrogen and phosphorus from chemical fertilizers, animal waste, leached
                    acids from leaves, and pesticides.
                    Once pollutants from surface runoff reach the receiving waters, they can cause
                    water quality problems similar to those found in municipal and industrial
                    point source discharges.
                    The Land Use Chapter discusses the supply of potable water in the Growth
                    Management section. The Safety Chapter addresses flooding.
OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION CHAPTER                                                            III-8

Goal OS-5      Preserve and protect creeks, streams, and other watercourses in their
               natural state.
               Streams, creeks and other riparian areas are considered to be in a natural
               state when they support their own environment of vegetation and wildlife and
               have not been concreted or otherwise channeled.
Policy OS-5.1  Stream bank stability: Protect stream bank stability.
               Program OS-5.1.1: Ensure that new development does not increase peak flows
               in watercourses. Where this is not feasible, the increase must be mitigated.
               Refer also to program S-3.1.1 of the Safety Chapter.
               Program OS-5.1.2: Encourage the use of alternative drainage systems that rely
               on increased retention capacity to lessen or eliminate the need for structural
               modifications to watercourses wherever possible.
               Program OS-5.1.3: In cooperation with the Contra Costa County Flood Control
               District and the California Department of Fish and Game, develop a long-term
               management plan for addressing creek bank stability on Las Trampas Creek,
               Grizzly Creek, and other creeks with bank slumping problems. This plan
               should identify the location of problem areas and develop a strategy for
               addressing these problems on a watershed basis. Since responsibility for many
               problem areas rests with private owners, the City should assist owners in
               addressing these problems by:
                1) Compiling a list of stability management practices recommended for the
                    particular stretch of creek.
                2) Compiling a list of possible contractors available to do the work.
                3) Investigating potential funding sources including public and non-profit
                    agencies and foundations.
                4) Expediting the permitting process so that an owner does not need to
                    submit studies and data to local, State, and federal agencies to obtain
                    separate permits.
               Program OS-5.1.4: Develop guidelines for the construction and maintenance of
               watercourses in cooperation with the County and the California Department of
               Fish and Game. These guidelines should assure that (1) native vegetation is
               not unnecessarily removed and (2) maintenance minimizes disruption of
               wildlife breeding activities. Incorporate these guidelines into the City’s
               maintenance procedures, where appropriate.
               Program OS-5.1.5: Publish and distribute educational and resource materials
               such as a Creek Care Guide that provide guidelines for maintaining and
               improving creeks in an ecologically sound manner.

                       Program OS-5.1.6: Seek State and federal funding for the repair of stream bank
                       erosion, planting of riparian vegetation to stabilize creek banks, and removal of
                       debris obstructing water flow.
                       Program OS-5.1.7: Work with private property owners, regional agencies, and
                       organizations in Contra Costa County to restore creek and riparian habitat.
                       Program OS-5.1.8: Use the City's regulatory powers to preserve and reclaim
                       the natural state of watercourses, reduce runoff and contaminants, and improve
                       water quality for habitat preservation and recreation.2
                       See Policy OS-4.5 Biotic Resource Analysis for additional measures to protect
                       watercourses and riparian areas.
Policy OS-5.2          Creek Corridors: Provide opportunities for visual and educational access to
                       natural creeks and riparian areas along public right-of-way, where feasible.
                       Program OS-5.2.1: Prepare and adopt a Creeks Master Plan. The Creeks
                       Master Plan will initially undertake the planning and design of creek corridors
                       along the public right-of-way.
                       Program OS-5.2.2: Encourage creek access for educational programs.
                       Research the feasibility for developing educational access to public creeks and
                       riparian areas.
Goal OS-6              Improve water quality in watercourses.
Policy OS-6.1          Reduce Watercourse Pollution: Minimize pollutants in storm water runoff.
                       Program OS-6.1.1: Enforce the Municipal Code prohibiting: (1) the discharge
                       of any substances other than storm water into storm drains and creeks, (2)
                       illicit dumping of wastes into storm drains and creeks, and (3) the dumping of
                       debris and refuse in and near waterways and their riparian areas.
                       Program OS-6.1.2: Consider adopting the erosion and sedimentation controls
                       described in ABAG's Manual of Standards for Erosion and Sediment Control,
                       published in June 1995.
                       Program OS-6.1.3: Require that new development provide for source control
                       and reduction of pollutants in conformance with the City's Stormwater
                       Management Program and other National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
                       System (NPDES) criteria.
                       Program OS-6.1.4: Require that new development implement measures to
                       control soil erosion and minimize runoff into creeks. As part of project review,
                       include mitigation measures to reduce the potential pollutants in runoff.

                   Program OS-6.1.5: Encourage the use of non-polluting herbicides near
                   watercourses.
SOILS
There are no prime agricultural soils being farmed within the City or its Sphere of Influence.
Despite the limited agricultural activity in the Lafayette Planning Area, it is important to
conserve soils. Soil is removed by wind and water and can be contaminated by chemical spills.
Limiting soil erosion contributes to a healthy ecosystem. Soils often lose their protective
vegetative cover during construction, particularly during the rainy season, and are washed away
filling creeks with sedimentation.
Goal OS-7          Protect and preserve soil as a natural resource.
Policy OS 7.1      Control Soil Erosion: Control soil erosion to prevent flooding and landslides,
                   maintain water quality, and reduce public costs of flood control and
                   watercourse maintenance.
                   Program OS-7.1.1: Continue to require grading permits for new construction as
                   a part of the development review process. Require soil erosion measures and a
                   revegetation plan.
Policy OS-7.2      Reduce Soil Contamination: Reduce soil contamination from chemicals
                   through careful regulation of the storage, transportation and use of chemicals.
                   Program OS-7.2.1: Reduce the use of chemical herbicides and fertilizers by the
                   City to the maximum extent feasible. Wherever possible use substitutes that
                   are biologically safe and/or organic.
                   Refer to the Safety Chapter for policies and programs regarding the storage
                   and transportation of flammable and toxic substances.
WATER CONSERVATION
The East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD), the City's water provider, has sufficient
capacity to serve the community's existing and projected future demand. It is nonetheless
essential to conserve water. Potable water has become a scarce resource throughout California
and it comes at an ever-increasing cost. The Water Conservation Act adopted by the State in
1990 requires cities to adopt a water-efficient landscape ordinance.
Goal OS-8          Reduce per capita water consumption.
Policy OS-8.1      Water Conservation: Develop a water conservation program.
                   Program OS-8.1.1: Implement the Water Conservation Ordinance which
                   addresses water reclamation and landscaping including:
                           Low-flow irrigation systems
                           Reducing the amount of turf area
OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION CHAPTER                                                           III-11

                          The use of native plants and other vegetation with low water-use
                           requirements
                   Program OS-8.1.2: Encourage the use of water-saving devices for residential
                   and commercial uses.
                   Program OS-8.1.3: Use reclaimed water for irrigation when it becomes
                   available in Lafayette, consistent with the City’s recycled water ordinance.
                   Refer to the Growth Management and Infrastructure Section of the Land Use
                   Chapter for policies regarding potable water supply.
SOLID WASTE REDUCTION
Solid waste is any unwanted or discarded material that is not a liquid or a gas. Common solid
wastes include paper, glass, metals, plastics, cloth, food scraps, yard clippings and wood.
There is an acute shortage of suitable landfill sites statewide. California enacted the Solid Waste
Management Act in 1989, which requires waste disposal in landfills to be reduced by 25 percent
by 1995, and by 50 percent by the year 2000. The law also requires local jurisdictions to adopt
Source Reduction and Recycling Plans that specify how they will achieve solid waste reduction
goals.
Goal OS-9:         Reduce the volume of solid waste generated in the City.
Policy OS-9.1      Recycling and Reuse of Solid Waste: Comply with State requirements to
                   reduce the volume of solid waste through recycling and reuse of solid waste.
                   Program OS-9.1.1: Participate in the County's Source Reduction and Recycling
                   Program.
                   Program OS-9.1.2: Purchase goods containing recycled materials and which
                   are themselves recyclable for City use, wherever possible.
Policy OS-9.2      Recycling Drop-off Areas: Encourage on-site drop-off areas for recycling in
                   commercial, office and multifamily residential developments.
Policy OS-9.3      Solid and Hazardous Wastes: Comply with State and Federal requirements
                   regarding reduction of solid and hazardous wastes.
AIR QUALITY
The potential for air pollution in Lafayette is relatively high compared to other portions of the
Bay Area. The dilution of pollutants during calm periods is reduced by the surrounding hills,
particularly when a temperature inversion occurs. Abundant sunshine and warm temperatures in
summer are ideal conditions for the formation of photochemical oxidants, even in the absence of
local air pollution sources, since sea breezes often transport contaminants from urban areas west
of the City.
The Bay Area Air Quality Plan prepared by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG),
the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) and the Metropolitan Transportation
Commission (MTC) is the blueprint for meeting the standards required by the federal Clean Air
OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION CHAPTER                                                            III-12

Act. Such a regional approach is essential to improving air quality, since air pollutants transcend
municipal and county boundaries.
Improving air quality at the local level requires coordination between various General Plan
chapters. Other chapters of this Plan will have a beneficial effect on air quality. The majority of
remaining developable land in Lafayette is located Downtown, near to public transit and the
BART station. This Plan encourages multiple family and mixed-use development to occur
Downtown, which can reduce the need for automobile travel and the related potential air quality
impacts. Other examples are listed below:
 •      The Circulation Chapter encourages public transit, and calls for extending bicycle and
        pedestrian paths throughout the community. Bicycle and pedestrian-friendly features are
        required in new developments Downtown.
 •      The Open Space and Conservation Chapter has policies to plant additional street trees,
        reduce energy use, and encourage open space.
 •      The Land Use and Housing Chapters actively encourage multifamily housing affordable
        to a range of incomes near to public transit and the BART station.
The policies and implementation programs to improve air quality focus on identifying and
mitigating the air quality impacts of projects, particularly in areas near to schools, parks and
other sensitive receptors. Measures are also included to assure compliance with regional and
State air quality standards.
Goal OS-10: Improve air quality.
Policy OS-10.1      Regional Planning: Work with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District
                    (BAAQMD) to implement the Regional Clean Air Plan.

ENERGY CONSERVATION
Reducing energy consumption is essential for a sustainable future. The methods typically used
by local government include improving the efficiency of transportation systems, encouraging a
more compact development pattern, replacing older inefficient fixtures with newer and more
efficient equipment, promoting recycling, and promoting the use of renewable energy resources.
Local regulations encouraging the use of solar energy for space and water heating involve site
planning, building construction and landscaping.

PURPOSE
The Land Use Chapter is the heart of the General Plan because it contains the goals and policies
for the appropriate use of every parcel of land within the City limits and within the City’s Sphere
of Influence.     Land use designations and standards for development are established for
residential and commercial uses, public facilities and public utilities, and for the protection of
natural areas. The Land Use Map and the tables herein establish standards of population density
and building intensity. The goals, policies, and programs in this chapter seek to ensure that
development in Lafayette is not only harmonious with the City’s natural environment and
compatible with its existing neighborhoods, but that future development can be accommodated
with existing and planned infrastructure.
This Chapter covers these major policy areas:
     Natural and Scenic Lands
     Residential Land Uses
     Commercial Land Uses
     Public Facilities
     Sphere of Influence
     Interjurisdictional Coordination
     Growth Management and Infrastructure
     Cultural Resources
This Chapter also contains guidelines to help Lafayette preserve and strengthen its distinctive
community identity and small town character by :
     preserving scenic views of the surrounding hillsides and ridgelines;
     shaping development such that it is harmonious with the immediate natural and built
        environment;
     maintaining the quality of the residential neighborhoods;
     encouraging distinctive development Downtown;
     better defining the entries to the city;
     preserving and enhancing buildings and sites with historical or architectural significance;
LAND USE CHAPTER                                                                                        I-1

        and
       preserving areas with environmental, scenic or recreational significance as open space.
THE LAFAYETTE PLANNING AREA
The City's Sphere of Influence, prescribed by the Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO), is identical with the City limits with two exceptions. There are approximately 130
acres of land west of Taylor Boulevard near the northeast corner of the City and about 200 acres
south of Highway 24 and east of Pleasant Hill Road. The former area contains some existing
large-lot residential development and approximately 44 acres of vacant land with limited
residential development potential. The latter area consists mainly of existing residential
development located just east of the current City Limits. The City's Sphere of Influence is
consistent with the Urban Limit Line defined in the Contra Costa County General Plan. The
acreage of each land use designation is presented in Table 1 below. Over 75 percent of the land
in Lafayette is designated for single family residential uses. Commercial uses account for less
than 3 percent of land and are concentrated along the Mt. Diablo Boulevard corridor. Fifteen
percent of land in Lafayette is devoted to open space.

POPULATION GROWTH TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS
Population Growth Trends
The City of Lafayette was incorporated in 1968. The City's population has increased steadily
since the 1960's, with the greatest increase occurring in the decade between 1960 and 1970,
largely due to annexations along Reliez Valley Road and in the Springhill Road area. Table 2
indicates that the City's population has increased very gradually since 1980. This is because most
of the buildable land in Lafayette had been developed by 1980. Population increased by 1,302
persons (5.4%) between 1980 and 1990, as compared with a 3,519 - person increase (17.2%)
between 1970 and 1980.

Population Projections
Table 3 shows population projections for the City of Lafayette, prepared by the Association of
Bay Area Governments (ABAG). The projections indicate that the City's total population is
expected to increase by less than five percent during the periods 2000-2005 and 2005-2010.

For the same periods, Contra Costa County’s population is slated to increase by 7% and 6%
respectively.
HOUSING AND JOBS
Lafayette has historically been a residential community with most employed residents working in
other communities. At the time of incorporation, most residents traveled west to jobs in Oakland
and San Francisco. With the rapid development of employment centers stretching from Concord
to Pleasanton and the Silicon Valley, more residents now travel to the east and south to their jobs
than ever before.
LAND USE CHAPTER                                                                                     I-3

Job growth in Lafayette has roughly paralleled the increase in population and employed residents.
Office developments completed during the 1980s and more recent expansion of retail space have
been the primary sources of new jobs. Due to its land use patterns, the City remains an exporter
of employees.

These numbers do not reflect that many of the jobs in Lafayette are not filled by Lafayette
residents and that more residents are spending many of their working hours at home using
computer and telecommunications technologies.
While Lafayette has relatively little area designated for commercial activities, much of it is
subject to renewal with more intensive uses that will create more jobs. Furthermore, the City’s
proximity to both the Oakland and Diablo Valley employment and population centers, coupled
with its access to BART will enable businesses to attract employees commensurate with the
anticipated increase in population.

LAND USE MAP
There is a Land Use Map (Map I-1) that is part of this Plan. It is necessary to refer to this map
and the text of the Plan, along with the Zoning Ordinance, to determine how a parcel of land may
be developed.
Maximum densities and Floor Area Ratios (FAR’s) described in this chapter can only be
achieved after complying with the goals, policies and programs of this General Plan. In addition,
the zoning and subdivision ordinances contain measures that may limit the density of any parcel
of land in the City below the density specified in the General Plan.
LAND USE CHAPTER                                                                              I-4

Other maps that show the locations of public facilities, environmentally sensitive areas, potential
geotechnical and flood hazards, the street system, parkland and trails are an integral part of the
General Plan. Such maps should be consulted in order to obtain a complete interpretation of the
Plan’s goals, policies and programs applicable to a given area or parcel of land.
DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL
There is relatively little land in the City where additional development can occur. Most of the
remaining vacant or underdeveloped land is located in environmentally constrained areas
characterized by steep hillsides, oak woodlands, and unstable soil conditions; this land is
designated Rural Residential on the Land Use Map. The majority of new single-family residential
construction will be on infill lots scattered throughout the City's existing residential
neighborhoods and in mixed-use developments located Downtown. A description of Lafayette's
residential buildout potential is presented in the Housing Chapter. (The “Additional Housing
Units” shown in Table 6 include both single-family and multi-family residential units.)
Downtown Lafayette has vacant and underutilized parcels, which have the potential to
accommodate a mixture of commercial and residential uses. Table 6 presents the projected
General Plan buildout for all parcels. This projected buildout is less than the maximum potential
allowed by base zoning standards (height and yard requirements), since it reflects overall
development constraints, such as undersized parcels, underutilized parcels, parking and open
space standards and topographic limitations.

West End Commercial
East End Commercial
Multifamily Residential/Office
The General Plan establishes Land Use Designations both within the City limits and within the
City's Sphere of Influence as defined by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO)1.
The Sphere of Influence represents the probable ultimate physical boundary of the City. The
designations defined below are shown on Map I-1: Land Use Map.
Population Density and Building Intensity
State law requires general plans to establish standards of population density and building
intensity. Estimates for population in these land use categories are based on an average
household of 2.6 persons, except for the High-Density Multifamily Residential designation,
which is based on an average of 2.1 persons per household. If there is a discrepancy between

NATURAL AND SCENIC LANDS
Natural and Scenic Lands include the land use designations which preserve the natural
environment through the protection of open space, parklands, ridgelines, hillsides and riparian
corridors. Development is to be allowed only in areas designated Rural Residential and only
when it is subordinate to and supportive of the preservation of natural conditions.
These land use designations will enable the City to meet the goals, policies and programs
outlined in the Open Space and Conservation Chapter. The general location of these lands is
indicated on Map III-1: Hillside Overlay Area.
Natural and Scenic Land Uses
        Open Space: This designation applies to areas of land which are essentially unimproved
        and used for the preservation of natural resources and habitats, agriculture, passive
        outdoor recreation, visual amenities such as view corridors and scenic vistas, or the
        maintenance of public health and safety. Development is limited to 400 square feet per
        parcel. Only structures that support the use, such as shelters and storage sheds, are
        allowed.
        Parkland: This designation applies to existing and proposed active and passive parks.
        Allowed structures are shelters, restrooms, storage sheds, and other ancillary structures
        needed to accommodate a public use or to provide for the maintenance of the land and
        recreational facilities. The maximum floor area ratio (FAR) shall not exceed 0.01.
        Rural Residential: This designation is intended to retain hillsides in as nearly a natural
        condition as is feasible while allowing residential development which is subordinate to
        and supportive of preserving scenic views and the natural hillside character of the area.
        Houses shall be sited, designed and of such a size so as to blend into the natural
        environment and have minimal impacts on it. Visibility of any development shall be kept
        to a minimum. Development density shall not exceed 0.1 dwelling units per acre.
LAND USE CHAPTER                                                                                                                            I-7

        Rural Residential-5: At the time of the adoption of this General Plan, there were no
        properties in this land use designation. This abstract category is in place to accommodate
        properties whose land use designations may be changed at a future date from Rural
        Residential to Rural Residential-5. As with the Rural Residential classification, this
        designation is intended to retain hillsides in as nearly a natural condition as is feasible
        while allowing residential development, which is subordinate to and supportive of
        preserving scenic views and the natural hillside character of the area. Houses shall be
        sited, designed and of such a size so as to blend into the natural environment and have
        minimal impacts on it. Visibility of any development shall be kept to a minimum.
        Development density shall not exceed 0.2 dwelling units per acre.
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
Lafayette is primarily a residential community and it is the City's residential neighborhoods that
largely define its character. Residential development is located on either side of the Mt. Diablo
Boulevard corridor, along valley floors and on the surrounding hillsides. These neighborhoods
present a diverse visual environment, offering a variety of housing types, and architecture that is
sensitive to the hilly landscape.
A long-standing priority of the community has been to ensure that development remains
harmonious with the existing natural and built environment. Carefully regulating development
on hillsides and ridgelines protects the public safety and maintains the scenic beauty and
character of the community. Formal review of residential development is essential to ensure that
it is attractive and respects the surrounding neighborhood. The City has adopted, and
periodically updates Residential Design Review Guidelines. These guidelines establish standards
for residential development that protect public health, safety and general welfare by regulating
development in sensitive environmental areas and by protecting natural features. Additional
programs are included in this plan to protect scenic views and ensure that new development is
compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.
The goals, policies and programs of this General Plan continue the community's tradition of
working with developers and architects to create attractive residential neighborhoods.

                    Program LU-6.1.1 Adopt an administrative procedure that provides for a
                    review of appropriate density at the request of persons owning property in areas
                    designated “Rural Residential” and limited to a maximum density of 0.1
                    dwelling units per acre.
                    Program LU-6.1.2: Prior to redesignating any property to Rural Residential-5, a
                    CEQA review will be required to determine if development of the property
                    would result in additional site specific or cumulative impacts not assessed in

                    comply with CEQA prior to approval.
COMMERCIAL LAND USES
In 2012, Lafayette adopted its first Downtown Specific Plan. Built on the foundation of the General Plan,
the specific plan provides a detailed land use and design framework to guide private development and
public investment in the downtown. The General Plan orders that a number of downtown planning tasks
be completed, including the creation of three distinctive areas – Downtown Core, East End, and West
End. It also demands that the City establish urban design guidelines, provide public parking and other
amenities, and encourage housing in the downtown. Finally, it calls for the updating of the specific plans
completed more than 20 years ago. The Downtown Specific Plan represents the completion of these
tasks.
The Downtown Specific Plan was developed through a five-year process designed to maximize public
input and participation. It articulates a vision to preserve and enhance the small town character while
guiding change that will occur over the next 20 years.
Following is the primary vision statement of the Downtown Specific Plan.
     Create a downtown, with small town character and a sustainable quality of life that includes a
        central core, pedestrian relationships between services, and is a place where residents can
        congregate, shop, enjoy cultural activities, conduct their civic affairs, and savor the beauty and
        ambience of a small town.
     Encourage the evolution of a distinctive Lafayette character that is informal with variations in
        architectural styles, massing, and setbacks while maintaining scenic views to surrounding hills
        and maximizing the enjoyment of its natural environment.
LAND USE CHAPTER                                                                                      I-12

      Reinforce downtown as the city’s center for business, civic and cultural activities with land use,
         circulation and design policies that retain the focus of the downtown as a retail center and
         multifamily residential neighborhood.
      Encourage economic activity beneficial to the community and support, enhance and maintain the
         community.
The objectives of the Downtown Specific Plan are to:
      Foster, create, and nurture a sustainable downtown that provides options for getting around,
         including increasing opportunities for walking and bicycling and for a variety of housing while
         preserving our natural resources.
      Preserve the small town character through a district based strategy while guiding development to
         enhance this character.
      Guide public investment allocating scarce resources to create maximum effect.
      Provide quality housing choices for all ages and income levels.
      Enhance transportation options to improve downtown circulation..
      Foster a healthy business environment through careful planning, guided private development, and
         public investment.
      Provide additional parking opportunities for customers and employees.
      Develop community amenities and facilities to complement the downtown.
      Protect and enhance the downtown’s natural resources.
      Nurture a culture of good building and sensitive site design.
The Downtown Specific Plan uses districts to describe and plan the downtown. Lafayette has a linear
downtown – stretching over two miles along Mount Diablo Boulevard – and areas have their own
distinctive characters. The Downtown Specific Plan envisions districts whose different physical
characteristics and land uses complement each other while providing variety and texture to the entire
downtown. There are four downtown commercial districts – West End, Downtown Retail, Plaza, and
East End, and three Downtown Residential Neighborhoods – Mountain View Drive / West Road, Brook
Street / Hough Avenue, and Carol Lane. The Downtown Retail and Plaza Districts form the Downtown
Core.
For more detailed information on the Downtown, refer to the Lafayette Downtown Specific Plan.
LAND USE CHAPTER                                                                                    I-13

Downtown Lafayette is the City’s commercial, civic and cultural center. The primary goal for
the downtown is to establish a distinct, convenient, attractive, and safe commercial area that
serves and complements the residential neighborhoods of the City, while enhancing its tax base.
Downtown Lafayette extends along the Mt. Diablo Boulevard corridor from Risa Road on the
west to Pleasant Hill Road on the east. Three distinct areas comprise this commercial area as
illustrated on Map I-3: Downtown: the Downtown Core, East End Commercial and West End
Commercial. Commercial uses are confined to these areas.
Downtown Lafayette is characterized by one and two story buildings along Mt. Diablo
Boulevard, with some taller buildings behind. They set the scale and illustrate what is desirable
downtown. The City seeks to avoid tower-like buildings typical of larger cities that dwarf
pedestrians, reduce visible sky, limit scenic views and produce long, wide shadows. The building
height regulations for the commercial areas are intended to produce a Mt. Diablo Boulevard
facade that is generally consistent with the roofline of existing buildings in the Downtown.
The Downtown Core is the City’s primary retail center and its most pedestrian-friendly
commercial district. Recent public and private projects have enhanced the visual attractiveness
of the core, taking advantage of quaint side-street areas, such as Lafayette Circle and Golden
Gate Way, or accentuating pedestrian-only zones, such as Lafayette Plaza and the Town Center
creek plaza. An assortment of successful retail establishments mark the Downtown Core as a
vibrant place for shopping, dining and socializing.
The West End has witnessed a different growth pattern, where office buildings, restaurants and
related services predominate. Multi-family residential buildings are also found here. Most uses
are located directly along Mt. Diablo Boulevard, with little off-street development. Two major
exceptions are the Oak Hill West office complex and the Hillside Inn, both setback to the north
of Mt. Diablo Boulevard.
The East End is the least focused of the city’s three commercial areas, although it does serve as
the City’s auto-oriented commercial corridor. Auto service establishments and drive-through
restaurants are found here, with other retail, office and specialty services mixed in. Some of
these uses – notably auto repair and heavy commercial such as lumber yards – have ebbed in
recent years, as they have consolidated into larger, more regionally-centered locations. The
City’s premier lodging facility – the Park Hotel – is found in the East End, as is the Lafayette
Cemetery.
The main concepts underlying the policies for the downtown are:
        Establish a Downtown Core area along both sides of Mt. Diablo Boulevard bounded by
         Mountain View Drive, Highway 24 and First Street, as indicated in Map I-3 Downtown.
         The Downtown Core represents the focus for Lafayette's commercial and cultural life.
         The policies and programs of this chapter capitalize on the BART Station. They
         encourage a mixture of retail, office, commercial and residential uses to meet business,
         service, shopping and dining needs of the community and visitors alike. The Downtown
         Core should be a pedestrian-friendly and safe environment, both day and night, where
         residents of the downtown and the community at large can shop, eat and enjoy cultural
         events.

              Program LU-7.1.5: Provide pedestrian amenities such as benches, bike racks,
              public art.
Policy LU-7.2 Lighting: Use lighting to develop a sense of security and enhance architecture.
              Lighting should not overpower the surrounding environment.
              Program LU-7.2.1: Establish lighting design guidelines as part of the
              Commercial Design Guidelines.
Policy LU-7.3 Public Spaces: Enhance the appearance of the downtown with well-designed
              public spaces.

              public signs in the Downtown.
Policy LU-7.5 Commercial Entryways: Commercial entryways to the City should be
              distinctive and attractive and should convey a positive image of the
              community.
              Entryways are the visual doorways to the community. They make a powerful
              impression on residents and visitors alike. The commercial entryways are at
              the city's central freeway off-ramps at Oak Hill Road and First Street, the
              Lafayette BART station and the east end of Mt. Diablo Boulevard. Map I-2
              Entryways shows the location of Lafayette's entryways. They should be
              distinctive and attractive, establishing a positive image of the community.

              Happy Valley Creek as a primary visual corridor from the BART Station to Mt.
              Diablo Boulevard, and Lafayette Creek as a local visual corridor, south of
              Golden Gate Way.
Policy LU-7.7 Scenic Views: Preserve scenic views of Mt. Diablo and hillsides from
              Downtown Lafayette.
              While it is not possible to entirely prevent some blockage of scenic views
              downtown, it is important to preserve views of the surrounding hillsides and
              ridges from Mt. Diablo Boulevard. Scenic views can be preserved by
              maintaining a variety of building heights, providing open view corridors
              between buildings, and utilizing setbacks and building height limits.
              Program LU-7.7.1: Utilize Map I-5: Scenic View Corridors as a guide to
              protecting and enhancing scenic views in the development process.
              Program LU-7.7.2: The impact on view corridors shall be carefully evaluated
              when reviewing development proposals for buildings and signs.
Goal LU-8     Enhance commercial vitality and encourage a variety of businesses
              Downtown.
Policy LU 8.1 Commercial Uses: Permit a range of retail and commercial uses Downtown,
              while distinguishing between appropriate land uses for the Downtown Core
              and the East End and West End Commercial areas.
              Program LU-8.1.1: Consider revisions to the zoning regulations or creation of
              specific plans to permit a wider range of retail, commercial and office uses in
              the West End Commercial and East End Commercial land use designations.
Policy LU-8.2 Parking Facilities: Seek to increase the availability of off-street parking
              throughout the downtown.
              Parking facilities occupy a significant proportion of the city's commercial
              areas. The economic vitality of the Downtown depends on having well located,
              off-street public parking facilities.
              Parking often uses 40 percent or more of the ground floor area in commercial
              districts. Parking facilities should not dominate the landscape Downtown, but
              should be unobtrusive and blend with the surrounding buildings. Design
              guidelines can reduce the visual impact and improve the effectiveness of
              parking facilities.
              Program LU-8.2.1: Encourage shared parking, parking lot consolidation, and
              common driveways and access ways.

              conflict with the primarily retail focus of this area.
              Program LU-8.3.1: Develop incentives to promote retention and development
              of residential units in buildings Downtown.
              Program LU-8.3.2: Develop additional findings relating to noise, privacy, light
              and glare for new commercial development near existing residential units to
              make sure that the quality of life for residents is maintained.
              Refer to the Housing Chapter for policies and programs, which ensure that
              existing residences are not converted to non-residential uses in commercial
              areas.
Goal LU-9     Maintain the Downtown as a convenient and safe commercial area, which
              enhances the tax base and serves the shopping and business needs of the
              local region.
Policy LU-9.1 Benefit the Local Economy: Encourage commercial, retail, mixed use, and
              office development which benefits the local economy, generates employment
              for Lafayette residents, and provides goods and services needed by the
              community.
Policy LU-9.2 Redevelopment Agency: Use the City’s Redevelopment Plan to attain General
              Plan goals and policies.
              Program LU-9.2.1: Implement the Redevelopment Plan.
Policy LU-9.3 Community Involvement: Encourage Lafayette residents and business people
              to participate in implementation of the Redevelopment Plan.
              Program LU 9.3.1: Facilitate community participation in the evaluation and
              prioritization of redevelopment projects and in the monitoring of their
              implementation.
Policy LU-9.4 Rehabilitate Commercial Buildings: Rehabilitate and retrofit existing
              commercial buildings to meet current market needs and building code
              requirements.
              Program LU-9.4.1: Consider implementing an "adaptive reuse" grant and loan
              program for the rehabilitation and retrofit of existing commercial structures to
              meet contemporary market needs and the goals and policies of the General
              Plan.
              Redevelopment funds could be used to finance such a program. A combination
              of low-interest loans and grants could be made available for this purpose.
LAND USE CHAPTER                                                                         I-19

Policy LU-9.5  Economic Vitality: Protect and enhance the economic vitality of Lafayette's
               commercial areas.
               Program LU-9.5.1: Work with the Lafayette Chamber of Commerce and local
               businesses to determine the level of interest in establishing a Business
               Improvement District that would provide funding for a variety of
               improvements to benefit Downtown businesses.
Goal LU-10     Downtown Core: Encourage a concentration of pedestrian friendly retail
               uses and improve the appearance and identity of the Downtown Core.
               The Downtown Core is the “heart” of the community; a pedestrian friendly
               and safe environment where the community can shop, eat and enjoy cultural
               events. It is also the historic center of Lafayette. This central business district
               consists of attractive, well-constructed buildings offering desired services and
               retail outlets in a convenient and safe environment for pedestrian shoppers.
               Adequate public parking, both on- and off-street, is provided, relieving the
               parking burden placed on individual property owners. The scale and feel of
               the core is that of the traditional small town “Main Street”.
               The Core area provides a wide variety of retail and personal services
               establishments at a scale that is attractive to the pedestrian shopper. .
               Residential and offices uses are not permitted on the ground floor of buildings
               along Mount Diablo Boulevard in the Downtown Retail district and along
               Plaza Way in the Plaza district. Examples of permitted uses are clothing
               stores, gourmet food shops, stationers, galleries, restaurants, and civic and
               cultural uses.
Policy LU-10.1 Downtown Core Amenities: Downtown Core amenities shall have a distinctive
               appearance and shall be pedestrian-friendly.
               Program LU-10.1.1: Implement the “Small Town Downtown” program which
               is designed to enhance the small town character of the downtown.
               Program LU-10.1.2: Actively pursue funding to implement the Downtown
               Street Improvement Master Plan. Funding sources could include grants,
               redevelopment funds, and a business assessment district.
Policy LU-10.2 Building Height: Regulate building height in the Downtown Core to preserve
               its scale and identity.
Policy LU-10.3 Building Frontage: Site planning in the Downtown Core fosters a pedestrian
               friendly environment through zero or reduced front setbacks and access to the
               rear through alleyways, paseos, small plazas.
               Program LU-10.3.1: Consider revisions to the Zoning Ordinance requiring the
               siting of buildings in the Downtown Core to be adjacent to the sidewalk with
               parking at the rear or side.
LAND USE CHAPTER                                                                             I-20

Policy LU-10.4 Ground-Floor Uses: Provide a pedestrian-friendly retail environment through
               the exclusive use of retail on the ground floor.
               Program LU-10.4.1: Continue the Zoning Ordinance provisions to preserve the
               ground floor of buildings fronting Mt. Diablo Boulevard for pedestrian-
               oriented retail and other related commercial uses.
               The Downtown Core should be the location for commercial, retail and
               multifamily residential uses, preferably developed with a mix of uses on a
               given site. Ground floor space fronting arterials such as Mt. Diablo Boulevard
               should be kept in retail uses to encourage a lively, interesting and pedestrian-
               friendly atmosphere. Such retail uses would include specialty retail stores and
               restaurants, rather than office or residential uses.
Goal LU-11     East End Commercial: Improve the function, identity and appearance of
               the East End Commercial Area.
               The East End district, like the West End, contains a variety of service
               businesses, retail uses, apartments and offices. The eastern Mt. Diablo
               Boulevard corridor has developed with auto-dependent commercial uses.
               However, there is no singular identity to the East End, where auto repair
               garages, fast food restaurants, and a car wash share frontage with retail
               stores, office buildings, a hotel and cemetery. Further, the district appears
               ready for private redevelopment as many properties are underutilized and
               many buildings are old.
               Previous goals and policies for the East End distinguished the area from the
               Downtown Core. However, the goals were not fulfilled through the adoption
               of specific zoning regulations. This General Plan calls for a focused planning
               effort for the East End. The purpose of this program is to establish a vision for
               the future of the East End that supports the City’s overall community vision, as
               well as its goals for the Downtown Core.
Policy LU 11.1 Long-Range Vision: A long-range vision for the East End Commercial Area
               will guide the establishment of zoning regulations and the review of site-
               specific development projects.
               Program LU-11.1.1: Develop a long-range plan that establishes a vision for the
               future of the East End Commercial Area, based on the community’s overall
               vision for Lafayette, its vision for the Downtown Core, and on future trends in
               commercial, retail and auto-oriented land use activities.
               Program LU 11.1.2: Modify zoning regulations for the East End Commercial
               Area to implement a long-range plan.
Policy LU-11.2 Street Design of the East End: Consider changes to the street design to improve
               the safety, appearance, and operation of Mt. Diablo Boulevard within the East
               End Commercial area.
LAND USE CHAPTER                                                                           I-21

                    Program LU-11.2.1: Consider modifying Mt. Diablo Boulevard between Carol
                    Lane to Pleasant Hill Road to control traffic speeds, provide additional public
                    parking and to facilitate bicycle and pedestrian circulation.
                    Program LU-11.2.2: Enhance the aesthetic quality and design of the streetscape
                    by providing landscaped medians or planting strips with trees, specialty
                    lighting fixtures, sign and other design features which mitigate the adverse
                    aesthetic impact associated with a wide street design.
 Policy LU-11.3 Residential Uses: Preserve the existing multi-family residential uses in this
                    area, where practicable.
                    See the Housing Chapter for additional goals and policies on the preservation
                    of residential uses in the Downtown Core Area.
Goal LU-12          West End Commercial: Strengthen the West End Commercial area as an
                    office commercial district with related support services.
                    The West End Commercial district, between Risa Road and Mountain View
                    Drive, contains a variety of businesses, retail uses, apartments and offices that
                    are of a use or scale that may not be appropriate in the Core yet are essential
                    to the City’s economy and serve both community and regional needs. The West
                    End has an office population that can support personal services and
                    restaurants. Additional office use is encouraged as well. While several new
                    office buildings have been developed over the last 20 years, there are still
                    parcels which may be redeveloped. Residential units should be preserved,
                    where practicable.
Policy LU-12.1      Office Uses: Continue to encourage office uses that are well designed. Ensure
                    that commercial uses remain compatible with nearby residential uses.
DEER HILL ROAD CORRIDOR
Deer Hill Road, a major arterial in Lafayette, runs parallel to Hwy 24 from Pleasant Hill Road
to Happy Valley Road. As stated in the Circulation Element, the primary traffic generator along
this arterial is the BART station and its attendant parking lots. Both the freeway and Deer Hill
Road serve as dividing lines between the Downtown to the south and the semi rural single-family
residential neighborhoods to the north. The development allowed under current zoning along
the Deer Hill Road corridor must be consistent with Lafayette’s semi-rural community identity.
Eastern Deer Hill Road (from Elizabeth Street east to Pleasant Hill Road)
This area, particularly the triangular shaped parcel south of Deer Hill Road, is the most
significant undeveloped property in the community because of its high visibility, its location as
an entryway to the community, and its proximity to major thoroughfares as well as regional open
space. For these reasons, any development that occurs should be consistent with the semi-rural
character of the community. This area deserves a careful and detailed analysis of all the
opportunities and constraints that will form the basis of future land use decisions. It is therefore
LAND USE CHAPTER                                                                                I-22

recommended that a specific plan be prepared for this area immediately following the adoption
of the General Plan. (See Map I-1)
Goal LU-13:         Ensure that the Eastern Deer Hill Road area near the intersection of
                    Pleasant Hill Road is developed, where development is appropriate, in a
                    manner consistent with Lafayette’s community identity.
Policy LU-13.1      Preserve and enhance the semi rural single-family residential character north
                    of Deer Hill Road where not adjacent to Pleasant Hill Road.
Policy LU-13.2       Consider options for development south of Deer Hill Road and north of Deer
                    Hill Road where adjacent to Pleasant Hill Road.
                    Program LU-13.2.2: Prepare through a community planning process an
                    Eastern Deer Hill Road Specific Plan that includes the following
                    requirements:
                     a) Protect and enhance the rural character of the area north of Deer Hill Road
                     where not adjacent to Pleasant Hill Road.
                     b) Preserve prominent views.
                     c) Include development standards that maintain the semi-rural character of
                     the area and the community.
                     d) Utilize the property south of Deer Hill Road to help communicate the
                     image of Lafayette as a semi-rural community.
Remainder of Deer Hill Road Corridor (from Elizabeth Street west to Happy Valley Road)
Due to the proximity to the Downtown and the BART station, this section of Deer Hill Road and
the single-family neighborhood that lies north of Deer Hill Road are constantly faced with
development pressures to utilize the infill areas more intensively than currently planned or
zoned. It is specific intent of the community to restrict commercial and multifamily uses to the
south side of the freeway, which in this area is the terminus of the Downtown to the south, in
order to protect the single-family residential neighborhoods that lie north of the freeway.
Goal LU 14:          Protect the single-family residential neighborhoods north of Hwy 24
                     from commercial and multi family development.
Policy LU-14.1     Continue to maintain the freeway as the dividing line separating the Downtown
                     from the semi rural, single-family residential areas to the north.
                    Program LU-14.1.1 Consistent with the community’s identity, allow only
                    those uses on Deer Hill Road that are permitted by right, or with a use permit,
                    in the single-family residential zoning districts.
PUBLIC FACILITIES
Public facilities such as the roadway system, storm drain and flood control facilities, and
telecommunications equipment are integral parts of the City's infrastructure, which may pose a
significant visual impact. Public facilities should be designed to be unobtrusive and blend
harmoniously with their surroundings. They should be constructed with generous amount of
LAND USE CHAPTER                                                                               I-23

                 Program LU-15.1.2: Include the following requirements in design review
                 guidelines for residential, commercial, and public improvements:
                 a)   criteria for evaluating the visual and aesthetic impacts of capital
                      improvements and the City's Capital Improvement Plan (CIP); and
                 b) require capital improvement projects to protect landforms and provide
                      adequate landscaping to mitigate the visual impacts on surrounding areas;
                 c)   retain significant plants and trees and the natural landscape to the
                      maximum feasible extent;
                 d) locate structures, such as retaining walls, light fixtures and utility facilities
                      to preserve visual quality along the roadway.
Policy LU-15.2   Inter-Agency Coordination: Work with agencies who carry out capital
                 improvements in the City to ensure that they are aware of, and comply with,
                 the city's aesthetic standards and review procedures.
Goal LU-16       Ensure that public utilities and telecommunications facilities are
                 constructed in a visually unobtrusive manner.
Policy LU-16.1   Overhead Power Lines: Require the installation of underground utility lines
                 wherever feasible. Underground existing utility lines as funding becomes
                 available.
                 Program LU-16.1.1: Continue to require developers to underground utility
                 lines on building sites.
                 Program LU-16.1.2: Continue to pursue funding sources to underground
                 existing utilities along Mt. Diablo Boulevard, Moraga Road, St. Mary's Road
                 and other arterials and collectors.
Policy LU-16.2   Telecommunications Equipment: Ensure that telecommunications antennae
                 and equipment are sited and constructed to be harmonious with the
                 surrounding area with minimal visual impacts.
                 Program LU-16.2.1: Continue to enforce, and revise as needed, performance
                 criteria in the Zoning Ordinance regarding the location and design of
LAND USE CHAPTER                                                                                I-24

                 signage to minimize their visual impacts. Require that telecommunications
                 equipment and facilities do not encroach on scenic viewsheds.
SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
State law provides for the establishment of Spheres of Influence to indicate the area that may be
annexed to a City and for which urban services could be provided if they are available. Spheres
of Influence ensure that urban development takes place in an orderly manner, and that
conservation and development policies are recognized in areas that may eventually be a part of a
city. The Sphere of Influence boundary is functionally related to the conservation and
development goals of the City. Policies regarding sphere of influence extensions and annexations
are included to ensure that future development occurs in a fiscally sound manner and that
“leapfrog development” does not occur.
Goal LU 17       Establish and maintain clear limits to the future growth of Lafayette.
Policy LU-17.1   Boundaries of the Sphere of Influence: Maintain Lafayette’s Sphere of
                 Influence boundaries as a shown on Map I-7.
Policy LU-17.2   Demonstrate Net Benefit Prior to Annexation: Approve annexations only after
                 determining that a net benefit to the City and other districts will result.
                 Consider the costs of providing public services, improvements and possible
                 liabilities for at least a five year period including transportation, police, fire,
                 parks, sewage treatment and disposal, water, flood control, and schools.
                 Program LU-17.2.1: Require that annexations meet all of the following criteria:
                  a) Areas to be annexed must be able to be served by existing City services or
                      by services provided by other districts or agencies, or by environmentally
                      and economically feasible extensions to these services, to be paid for by
                      the proposed area of annexation. Findings to support annexations must be
                      made indicating that infrastructure to support the area is available
                      including transportation, water, fire, waste water treatment, schools, and
                      other necessary public services and facilities.
                  c) A specific development plan, including maps and text, must be prepared
                      for the proposed annexation, showing how the proposed development
                      contributes to the attainment of General Plan goals and policies.
                  d) The proposed development must be consistent with the proper land use
                      designation and meet all other requirements of the General Plan.
                 Program LU-17.2.2: Require a fiscal impact analysis of the proposed
                 annexation at the applicant's cost, if deemed appropriate. The fiscal impact
                 analysis shall take a minimum five year perspective.
Policy LU-17.3   Annexations to Sanitary District: Consider, on a case-by-case basis, supporting
                 the connection of existing structures both within and outside City limits, but

                   agencies refer all projects that are proposed within the Lafayette Sphere of
                   Influence to the City for review and comment prior to taking action.
                   Program LU-17.4.2: Request that Contra Costa County adopt land use policies
                   consistent with the Lafayette General Plan within the Sphere of Influence.
INTERJURISDICTIONAL COORDINATION
Development review and environmental protection in Lafayette involve various agencies in
addition to the City of Lafayette. These include Contra Costa County, the Contra Costa
Transportation Authority (CCTA), the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), the
Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), the Bay Area Regional Water Quality District,
the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, the East Bay Regional Parks District, the East
Bay Municipal Utilities District (EBMUD), Contra Costa County Transit Agency (CCCTA),
Contra Costa Sanitary District, Central Contra Costa Solid Waste District, and other special
service districts. Planning among jurisdictions is often necessary to avoid land use conflicts and
to address the allocation of public services.
Goal LU-18         Coordinate with other jurisdictions to protect and restore environmental
                   resources and to provide public services.
Policy LU-18.1     Interjurisdictional Participation: Participate in interjurisdictional planning.
                   Program LU-18.1.1: Consider the regional implications of land use decisions
                   when reviewing development proposals and revisions to the Zoning Ordinance

                   Program LU-18.1.2: Work with other public entities to ensure that
                   development in their jurisdictions does not adversely impact Lafayette’s ability
                   to achieve its General Plan goals.
Policy LU-18.2     Coordination of Public Services: Coordinate water supply, flood control,
                   wastewater and solid waste disposal, soil conservation, and open space
                   preservation with other jurisdictions to create the greatest public benefit and
                   the least degree of environmental impact.
                   Program LU-18.2.1: Periodically review level of service standards with the
                   districts providing water supply, flood control, wastewater and solid waste
                   disposal, soil conservation, and open space preservation.

                    Refer to the Circulation Chapter for policies and programs related to the City's
                    participation in regional transportation planning. Refer to the Growth Management
                    and Infrastructure section regarding specific policies and programs of the Growth
                    Management Plan.
GROWTH MANAGEMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE
The goals, policies and programs in this section are consistent with the requirements of Contra
Costa’s Transportation Sales Tax Expenditure Plan (“Measure J”), approved by Contra Costa
County voters in 2004, and with Government Code §65303. (Reso. 2009-021, 2009)
Growth management is a concept that allows for a rate of growth that can be supported by the
City's infrastructure and does not diminish the community's quality of life and identity. This
General Plan establishes policies and standards for traffic levels of service and performance
standards for fire, police, parks, sanitary facilities, water and flood control in order to implement
a comprehensive long-range method of matching the demand for public facilities generated by
new development with plans, capital improvements and development mitigation programs.
(Reso. 2009-021, 2009)
Lafayette has several constraints to meeting these standards. The most significant constraint is
the large volumes of through-traffic on Lafayette’s streets, especially Mt. Diablo Boulevard,
Moraga Road, and Pleasant Hill Road north of Highway 24. Another significant constraint is that
the City provides a limited range of services. Lafayette depends on separate jurisdictions for most
of its essential services including: potable water supply from the East Bay Municipal Utility
District; wastewater treatment from the Contra Costa County Sanitary District; and fire
protection from the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District. The City contracts with the
Contra Costa County Sheriff's office for police services. The City maintains ongoing
communication with provider agencies for all services.
This section establishes the goals, policies and programs needed to support the land uses
identified in this General Plan. The Safety Chapter contains goals, policies and programs dealing
with fire and police protection and emergency services.
See Chapter VIII Growth Management for a complete compilation of goals, policies and
programs relating to growth management from this and other chapters.
Goal LU-19          Maintain the existing infrastructure essential to the public health and
                    safety of the community.
Policy LU-19.1      Capital Improvement Program: Maintain and update the five-year Capital

               ensure consistency with the General Plan.
               Program LU-19.1.3: Continue the practice of including in the CIP a multi-year
               budget for projects including specific pavement management projects, an
               annual allowance for discretionary projects, and a fund for emergencies.
               Program LU-19.1.4: Evaluate projects for the CIP using the following criteria:
               compliance with the General Plan; potential threat to health and safety;
               financial liability; protection of investment; cost of future maintenance; and
               visual impacts on the surrounding area. Other criteria may be added as needed
               to prioritize projects.
               Program LU-19.1.5: Coordinate the timing of City capital improvement
               projects and those of other agencies (e.g. CalTrans, the East Bay Municipal
               Utility District, the Central Contra Costa Sanitary District, and the Contra
               Costa County Fire Protection District) to optimize resources and minimize the
               impacts on residents.
               Program: LU-19.1.6: Plan for adequate staff to implement the program.
Policy LU-19.2 Finance Capital Improvements: Provide public facilities to meet the needs
               generated by new development within Lafayette through continued planning
               and budgeting for public facilities and coordination with other agencies for
               public services the City does not provide.
               Program LU-19.2.1: Evaluate the operating and maintenance costs of
               infrastructure improvements needed to support development.
               Program LU-19.2.2: Provide information on development applications to other
               service-providing agencies, to enable them to assess the appropriate fair share
               impact fees. Request that the County require proof of payment of these fees
               before issuing a building permit.
               Program LU-19.2.3: Implement the City's pavement management program to
               maintain Lafayette's roadways.
               Program LU-19.2.4: Require new developments to pay their "fair share" of
               capital improvements and the cost of public services to maintain adequate
               levels of service. New development that creates incremental demand that
               exceeds the capacity of existing infrastructure shall be considered only through
               the development agreement process.
               Program LU-19.2.5: Maintain development and mitigation fees at a level
               adequate to finance infrastructure costs. Periodically review the City's fee
               structure to determine that it accurately reflects the actual cost of providing
               services, and recommend the appropriate revisions to the City Council.
               Adequate public facilities and services should be provided for new
               development, either through a development agreement or payment of a "fair

                      share" of providing such facilities. In order to make reasonable provision for
                      new facilities, the City of Lafayette shall establish public facility impact fees in
                      cooperation with applicable districts. Impact fees may vary by location,
                      according to the cost of improvements needed in the vicinity and the
                      proportional share of the cost to be applied to the development.
                      Such fees will be established consistent with State law to implement the goals
                      and policies of the General Plan, and may include charges for drainage
                      improvements, traffic and roadway improvements and other capital
                      improvements such as parks, trails and public facilities.
Goal LU-20            Match the demand for public facilities and infrastructure generated by
                      new development with the capacity of existing facilities, capital
                      improvement programs and development mitigation programs.2
Policy LU-20.1        Traffic Service Standards: Consider the level of service (LOS) goals and
                      standards set forth in the Circulation Chapter when evaluating development
                      proposals.

              consult with EBMUD regarding the feasibility of providing recycled water for
              appropriate non-potable purposes per EBMUD’s policy 8.01.
              (Reso. 2009-021, 2009)
              EBMUD adopted a Water Supply Management Program in 1993. This
              program recognized that there may be supply limitations to the future
              expansion of EBMUD's service area. In the event of a threatened or actual
              water shortage, the District will give first priority to existing water customers
              within its existing service area.
              Several of the District's supply lines need to be rebuilt and seismically
              strengthened. The rehabilitation of EBMUD's delivery system is being
              addressed by the District's Capital Improvement Program.
              EBMUD has developed an extensive recycled water and water conservation
              program. The District recommends certain types of landscaping for new and
              existing development which require minimal water. It is up to local
              jurisdictions, however, to implement water conservation regulations. Refer to

HISTORIC RESOURCES; PUBLIC ART
Archeological, Architectural and Historic Resources
The first known inhabitants of the Lafayette area were the Costanoan or Ohlone Indians.
Numerous prehistoric archaeological sites have been identified along Lafayette's creeks, on
terraces adjacent to watercourses and on ridge tops. Prehistoric sites are capable of yielding a
variety of information about the first inhabitants of the area. Such sites may include locations of
cultural, social or economic importance and may also have spiritual significance to the ancestors
of these peoples or to living Native Americans.
The first European settlers were Franciscan priests, originating from Spain who established
missions in the area. The granting of a Mexican land grant for Rancho Acalanes took place in
1834, and the first settlements in Lafayette were built fourteen years later.
There are several recorded archaeological sites in the Lafayette Planning Area. There is a high
probability of additional, yet unrecorded sites located on undeveloped land. Identification and
protection of these resources is provided by the policies and programs below and by the
California Environmental Quality Act.
The City has designated several sites and buildings as historic landmarks. Changes to these
properties must be approved by the City to ensure that the historical features are not adversely
affected. The Lafayette Historical Society documented the history of these buildings and sites and
published a pictorial history entitled La Fayette: From Rancho to Suburb, which has contributed
to safeguarding the City's cultural heritage.
Six properties have been designated as historical landmarks:
   Lafayette Plaza, bordered by Moraga Road, Golden Gate Way, Plaza Way and Mt. Diablo
    Boulevard
   The Way Side Inn, on Golden Gate Way
   The former Pioneer Store on Plaza Way
   Town Hall Theater on the southeast corner of Moraga Road and School Street
   A portion of Lafayette United Methodist Church, on Moraga Road, known as the Old
    Lafayette Grammar School
   A stone plaque on Happy Valley Road marking the site of the first settlement in Lafayette

In addition, the Guide to Historical Lafayette lists another nine properties with significance in the
community4.
Goal LU-22                      Preserve archaeological and historic resources.
Policy LU-22.1                  Preserve Archaeological Resources: Protect archaeological resources.
                                Program LU-22.1.1: Require that areas found to contain significant historic or
                                prehistoric artifacts be examined by a qualified consulting archaeologist.
                                Program LU-22.1.2: Continue to refer projects to Sonoma State University's
                                Northwest Archaeological Resource Center.
                                Program LU-22.1.3: Seek funding for the restoration and preservation of
                                archaeological and historical resources.
                                The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires evaluation of any
                                archaeological resource on the site of a development project. Unique
                                resources, as defined by State law, should be protected, either by physical
                                measures or by locating development away from the site.
                                Program LU-22.1.4: The Community Development Department should work
                                with local colleges and universities to develop an archaeological sensitivity
                                map for Lafayette.
                                Program LU-22.1.5: All development applications within mapped
                                archaeological sensitivity areas shall require a records search to be conducted.
                                If that records search recommends a survey of the site, the applicant shall be
                                required to have a search done by a qualified professional archaeologist. In the
                                absence of this map, development applications within 200 feet of a stream shall
                                be required to have a records search and, if necessary, a field survey conducted.
                                Program LU-22.1.6: When a site has been identified as having value as an
                                archaeological resource, development shall be situated or designed to avoid
                                impact on archaeological resources. This may be accomplished in any of the
                                following ways.
                                      a. Siting improvements to completely avoid the archaeological site.

                      b. Incorporating the site into a park or dedicated open space, or by deeding
                          the site into a permanent conservation easement.
                      c. “Capping” the site (i.e. covering the site with a layer of undisturbed
                          soil) may be appropriate after the site has been thoroughly studied by a
                          professional archaeologist and a report written on the resources found
                          on the site.
                  In the event that the site cannot be feasibly developed by avoidance of the
                  resource, it can be developed if the site is completely studied by a professional
                  archaeologist and that archaeologist determines that the site is not unique. The
                  archaeologist will prepare a complete report on the site and its resources prior
                  to any development being allowed.
                  Program LU-22.1.7: In the event archaeological resources are uncovered on
                  any construction project in the City, all work must be halted and an evaluation
                  undertaken by a qualified archaeologist.
Policy LU-22.2    Historic Buildings, Sites and Districts: Identify, recognize and protect sites,
                  buildings, structures and districts with significant cultural, aesthetic and social
                  characteristics which are part of Lafayette's heritage.
                  Program LU-22.2.1: Update and continue to implement the Zoning Ordinance
                  requirements regarding buildings with historic and cultural significance.
                  Program LU-22.2.2: Establish incentives for preservation and restoration of
                  historic buildings and sites. Consider the following incentives: interest-free or
                  reduced interest loans for rehabilitation consistent with the original character of
                  the building; tax incentives for the preservation of historic structures, including
                  the use of Mills Act preservation contracts; reduced processing fees and awards
                  and grants for preservation and protection of historic buildings and those with
                  cultural significance; use of the State Historic Building Code where applicable.
Public Art
Art in public spaces, parks, and around buildings brings beauty, a sense of place and a human
quality to urban areas. Public sculptures can become landmarks treasured by the community.
Public art does not have to be large or monumental in size. Murals, fountains, and small
sculptures have been used successfully to soften and beautify urban spaces. Public art and
sculpture should feature local artists and thereby reflect the cultural life of the community.
Public art can be sponsored by the City or private donors. Developers can be encouraged to
include artwork with new buildings and expansions. Lafayette Plaza is a possible location for
permanent sculptures, as well as for temporary art exhibits. Changing public art periodically both
draws people Downtown and permits a wider variety of ideas and tastes to be exhibited.
Goal LU-23        Support Public Art

                                                                HOUSING ELEMENT
PURPOSE
The Housing Element is a statement of Lafayette’s vision regarding existing and future housing
needs. This chapter, the Housing Element, has been prepared to meet recent changes in the
City's population and housing needs and to incorporate the revised regional housing needs
allocation provided by the State Department of Housing and Community Development in
concert with the Association of Bay Area Governments.
The Housing Element consists of two major sections. Section I contains the goals, policies and
implementation programs. Section II contains an analysis of the housing needs of all economic
segments of the community. The goals and policies are based on the needs identified in
following sections.
The single most important goal of the Lafayette Housing Element is to achieve an adequate
supply of safe, decent housing for all residents of Lafayette. In order to achieve this goal, the
policies and programs of the Housing Element address several major issues:
    •   Maintaining and preserving the existing housing stock
    •   Retaining the character of Lafayette's residential neighborhoods
    •   Planning for the City's regional housing needs allocations
    •   Providing additional affordable housing, particularly for senior citizens and young families
The Housing Element addresses the requirements of California Government Code §65583. The
format of the Housing Element follows very specific State guidelines with respect to the
subjects covered and the data that is analyzed.
The City has a commitment to Lafayette residents to maintain the identity and quality of the
residential neighborhoods. The Housing Element articulates Lafayette's housing goals in
relation to the constraints to housing development and to the housing market. It expands upon
the goals of the General Plan which are to (1) preserve the hillside and ridgelines by allowing
only low density development in the hills and (2) foster a vibrant and successful downtown and
meet the city’s regional housing obligations by allowing higher density development in the
downtown close to transit and services.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                         V-1

The Element establishes policies to guide decision-makers and implement comprehensive
programs to meet community housing needs.
RELATIONSHIP OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT TO THE GENERAL PLAN
The Housing Element is one of seven required general plan elements and is an integral part of
the Lafayette General Plan. Since the majority of Lafayette's land use is in housing, the Housing
Element is a key component of the City's future plans. The policies and programs contained in
this chapter are based on an eight-year time frame.
State law provides direction on how cities can maintain the General Plan as a policy guide by
requiring the Planning Department to report annually to the City Council on "the status of the
plan and progress in its implementation" (Government Code Section 65400 (a)(2)(A). State law
(Section 65588 [b]) further provides that "the Housing Element shall be revised as appropriate,
but not less than every five years, to reflect the results of this periodic review". As required by
the State, the current planning period extends from January 1, 2014 through October 31, 2022.
Consistency of the Housing Element with the other elements of the City's General Plan is
essential to having a complete and legally adequate General Plan. This updated Housing
Element has been reviewed and found to be consistent with the other chapters of the City's
General Plan. It is anticipated that the majority of future residential growth will take place in
the Downtown and on a small number of vacant and underdeveloped lots scattered throughout
the city.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The public review process is key to a successful housing element update in that it helps to
identify the housing needs of a community, better understand a community’s concerns, and it
educates the public about the State requirements. To that end, the City exercised a range of
methods to obtain public participation for the Housing Element Update, as outlined below:
           Activity                                           Outreach
    Introductory Meetings  The Planning Commission and City Council were introduced to the 2014-2022
                           housing element update process and review options in March 2014.
    City Website           The City created a page on the website’s “Hot Topics” section devoted to the
                           Housing Element Update. The page is updated regularly with information and
                           exhibits.
    Community              Three public workshops have been held to date to educate the public about the
    Workshops              State’s requirements, help identify the community’s housing needs, and better
                           understand the community’s concerns. Approximately 50 people attended each
                           workshop. The City sent a press release to all locally distributed newspapers and
                           publications. Email announcements were sent to 300-400 homeowner groups,
                           major downtown property owners and businesses, Chamber, schools,
                           organizations, affordable housing groups, senior housing groups, special needs
                           groups, and other interested parties. Notices were mailed to property owners
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                             V-2

            Activity                                            Outreach
                          who are listed in the draft inventory.
                          The workshops covered the following topics:
                               1. What is a housing element and why is it required?
                               2. Which process should the City pursue for the update: streamlined
                                     review or the standard review?
                               3. What are the residential densities in the downtown?
                               4. How are the inventory sites chosen?
                               5. What are the pros and cons of adopting a density bonus ordinance?
                          In addition to these topics and during the second workshop, attendees were
                          given maps and were tasked with reviewing the draft inventory of housing sites
                          and providing alternatives, if needed, based on the State’s criteria. Each group
                          presented their ideas for changes to the inventory, which were collected and
                          used to help staff adjust the draft inventory of housing sites.
    City Manager’s Friday Current information about the Housing Element Update is included regularly in
    Message               the Message. This has a large email distribution, and it is posted every week as
                          the first item on the City’s homepage.
    Planning Commission   Feedback was solicited from the Planning Commission and the City Council on
    & City Council        the key aspects of the Housing Element on August 4 and August 11 respectively.
                          On September 15, 2014, after conducting a public hearing, the Planning
                          Commission recommended that the City Council submit the administrative draft
                          Housing Element to HCD for review and comment . On October 14, after
                          conducting a public hearing, the City Council directed staff to submit the
                          administrative draft Housing Element to HCD for review and comment .
    Commissions &         The Council Planning Subcommittee members (from the Planning Commission
    Committees            and City Council) report back to their respective commissions and Council on a
                          regular basis. In addition, the City emailed the Community Workshop flyer to
                          the Circulation Commission, Design Review Commission, Bicycle and Pedestrian
                          Advisory Committee, Planning Commission, and City Council
The feedback received from this public outreach influenced the drafting of the Housing
Element. The attendees of the community meetings provided general support for pursuing the
streamlined review process, adopting a local density bonus ordinance, and the housing sites
inventory. The public also encouraged programs to encourage the rehabilitation of existing
multi-family housing stock and legitimize un-permitted second units.
The draft Housing Element was also reviewed by the City Council and Planning Commission in a
study session in March and August of 2014. Public hearings on the administrative draft were
held by the Planning Commission and City Council in September and October of 2014.
Additionally, the City invited more than a dozen community based and special needs
organizations to attend the Community Workshops and public hearings, listed below:

Department of Housing and Community Development. Public hearings on the final draft
document will be held by the Planning Commission and City Council in January and February of
2014 for adoption. The adopted element will be submitted to the State by May 31, 2015.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                         V-4
SECTION I: HOUSING BACKGROUND
The information presented in the Housing Background section is intended to summarize the
following: demographic characteristics; employment trends; inventory of vacant residential
land; and the existing constraints to the construction of housing in Lafayette. The policies and
implementation programs of this chapter address housing needs identified by this section.
Information in the Housing Background section is based on the following sources: the U.S.
Census (1990, 2000 and 2010); various American Community Surveys; the Association of Bay
Area Governments (ABAG) Projections 2013 report and its 2013 Plan Bay Area; the California
Department of Finance; Contra Costa County; and the City's Planning Department.
CONTEXT: LAFAYETTE WITHIN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY
The City of Lafayette is located within the Urban County of Contra Costa, and is committed to
upholding the goals of its General Plan, which include:
1. Preserving and enhancing the character of Lafayette as a low-density semi-rural residential
    community, and
2. Facilitating and encouraging the development of diverse housing types and additional
    affordable housing units to accommodate diversity amongst Lafayette citizens in terms of
    age and socio-economic background and to meet regional housing needs.
The community values the semi-rural character of its hillside residential neighborhoods.
Community attitudes toward housing play a crucial role in determining the type of housing that
will be built in the City.
Although this Housing Element presents data principally focused on the City of Lafayette, it is
useful to understand the context in which Lafayette’s housing concerns exist. High housing
costs reduce economic opportunities, access to jobs and services, and the ability of lower-
income households to live in the communities and neighborhoods of their choice. The
affordability gap results in a concentration of lower-income households in older neighborhoods
that have higher levels of substandard housing and overcrowding. Some of the indicators of
housing need and the challenges facing the County are described below.
       Housing prices continue to rise faster than incomes. The latest tech boom has
        contributed to this rise. The Lafayette median home price in April 2014 was $1,110,000,
        up 11% from the year before. Countywide, it was $435,000, also up 5% from the year
        before.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                              V-5

       Few lower-income households can afford to purchase homes. Most households earning
        less than 50% of the area median income face difficulties in finding affordable rental
        housing, as well.
       Approximately 80,000 lower-income households in the County did not have adequate
        housing in 2010, based on calculations provided by HUD from the Census’ American
        Community Survey (2006-2010) statistics on overpayment and overcrowding.
       There are 10 lower income properties Countywide considered at risk of conversion to
        market rate in the next 10 years. These properties have 717 rent-assisted units and 879
        total low income units. Of the LIHTC (Tax Credit) properties in Contra Costa, 15 of them
        are post-year 15, leaving them more at risk. These properties have 757 total low income
        units and 964 total units, meaning that some units in these properties are not income-
        restricted.
       Nearly 7,000 rental housing vouchers are provided by the housing authorities of
        Pittsburg and Contra Costa County. The County Housing Authority reports over 4,300
        applicants on its waiting list for public housing and over 3,100 on the waiting list for
        rental housing vouchers.
       Over 7,000 beds in more than 400 residential care facilities are available for individuals
        with special needs, (such as frail elderly and persons with disabilities) who cannot live
        independently in conventional housing. However, this is significantly less than the
        population of frail elderly, disabled, and others who may need a supportive housing
        environment.
Due to the ongoing gap in the availability of affordable housing, the County has assigned a high
priority to new housing construction, homeownership assistance, and housing rehabilitation,
particularly for households earning less than 50% of the area median income. Despite the high
cost, the County has determined that it is essential to expand the supply of affordable housing
and supportive housing, because the affordability gap cannot be addressed solely through
existing housing.
SUMMARY OF DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS
The City of Lafayette was incorporated in 1968. The City's population has increased steadily
since the 1960's, with the greatest increase occurring between 1960 and 1970, largely due to
annexations along Reliez Valley Road and in the Springbrook area. Table 1 indicates that the
City's population decreased by 502 persons (-2.1%) between 1980 and 1990, as compared with
a 3,519-person increase (17.2%) between 1970 and 1980. By 2000, however, the population
had increased 407 people (1.7%), reversing the losses of the 1980s. The 2010 U.S. Census found
there were 23,893 residents of Lafayette, a decrease of 15 people (<0.01%) since 2000. Overall,
this indicates that population growth has been relatively flat since 1980.

Significant population growth is expected to continue for both the region and for Contra Costa
County. Over the forecast period 2010 - 2040, ABAG projections indicate that the population of
the nine-county Bay Area may increase by more than two million people. Contra Costa County's
population is projected to increase by 27.6% over this period to 1,338,400, making it one of the
fastest growing counties in the Bay Area. Although Lafayette's population is not expected to
increase significantly, demand for housing within the City will continue to be strong as the
growth in the County's population continues.

DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS
Household Size
In 2010, there were 9,223 households in Lafayette. Between 1970 and 1980 the average
household size in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area decreased from 2.90 persons to 2.51
persons. In Lafayette this figure was reduced in 2010 to 2.59 persons per household, the same
rate it was in 1970 (see Table 1). Average household size in Lafayette has been marginally
higher than for the region.
In Lafayette, household size decreased slightly between 1980 and 1990, remaining essentially
stable between 1990 and 2000. However, over time it is expected that household size will
remain stable with younger families adding new members or smaller households ("empty-
nesters") being replaced by families with children.
Like the population as a whole, the total number of households in the region and the County
are projected to continue to increase. ABAG projects a 15.4% increase in the number of
Lafayette households between 2010 and 2040.

Age Statistics
Changes are occurring in the age structure of Lafayette's population that reflect state and
national trends. The City's proportion of senior residents (over 65 years old) has increased, from
10% of the population in 1980 to 14.5% of the population in 2000, to 16.6% in 2010. Children
under 20 years old constituted 25% of the population in 1990 and increased to 27% in 2000. By
2010, the percentage of children had dropped by -7.1%, but still represented 26.8% of the
population.
Table 3 shows the age structure of Lafayette's population in 2010 compared with 2000. The
median age in Lafayette as of 2000 was 42.3 years of age, and in 2010 it had increased to 45.2
years. This is substantially higher than the nation as a whole for 2010 (37.2 years) and higher
than the median for Contra Costa County (38.5 years). The relatively small percentage (3.2%) of
residents between the ages of 20 and 24 years can be attributed in part to the scarcity of
affordable housing in Lafayette, as well as the fact that this age group may not be ready to start
a family – a prime reason why people are attracted to Lafayette. In addition, lifestyle and
educational choices can mean younger people move out of the area more than other people.
Census data from 2010 demonstrate that, like other parts of the region, the population is

RACE/ETHNICITY DATA
The non-white population of Lafayette represents a relatively small proportion of the total
population, but has grown, however, from 10.7% in 1990 to 19.4% of the total population in
2010, with the largest increase coming from persons of Asian/Pacific Islander origin,
representing 9% of the population (see Table 4).

In the future, it is likely that the majority of non-white population in Lafayette will continue to
be of Asian or Hispanic origin, as immigration to the San Francisco region continues. In addition,
Lafayette's minority population is significantly lower than the state-wide average, which
showed a 40.5% non-white population in 2000, and a 60.3% non-white population in 2010.

HOUSEHOLD INCOME
The estimated median household income for Lafayette was $134,871 in 2011 (the most recent
year for which data are available) compared with $79,135 for Contra Costa County (see Table
5). As shown in the table, in constant 2011 dollars, the median income has actually dropped in
Lafayette, though less than the County as a whole; at least some of this decline can be
attributed to the recession. Available data indicate the differences in income levels between
Lafayette and the County will continue, with incomes in Lafayette remaining substantially
higher.

The median household income observed in the City has important effects on housing demand.
The higher income households will be able to afford new housing built in the community. These
households will also be able to afford to renovate and repair many of the City’s existing older

single-family homes. It will continue to be necessary, however, to maintain incentives for the
construction of additional housing units affordable to lower-income households, given the rapid
increase in the cost of housing that has occurred throughout the Bay Area.
EMPLOYMENT PROJECTIONS 2000 TO 2040
In its Projections 2013, ABAG estimates that the total number of jobs in Lafayette will increase
by 25.1% between the year 2010 and the year 2040. The largest increase in projected new jobs
in the City is anticipated to be in the Heath, Education and Recreation Services sector (34.2%),
while Retail jobs will increase only by about 3%.

NOTE: PROJECTIONS APPLY TO CITY AND ITS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
A stronger increase in employment is projected by ABAG for Contra Costa County as a whole,
which is anticipated to have a 35.5% increase in employment between 2010 and 2040.
Although there may be variations among projected growth in employment between Lafayette
and the County, the significance of these projections is that they indicate that an important
structural change in the local economy is taking place. Future job creation is becoming
increasingly based on the growth of the service sectors, rather than on the growth of the
manufacturing industry.
The projected increase in employment will affect the balance between jobs and housing. At
present there are almost as many jobs as there are employed persons (0.98 jobs to every
employed resident), up from 0.84 in 2000. Still, some proportion of employed residents
commute to work outside the City. Increasing the number of jobs, particularly in the retail and
service sectors, may result in an increased demand for affordable housing.
HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
One measure of housing condition is the age of housing. As summarized in Table 7, the older
the unit, the greater it can be assumed to be in need of some level of rehabilitation. A general
rule in the housing industry is that structures older than 20 years begin to show signs of
deterioration and require renovation to maintain their quality. Unless properly maintained,
homes older than 50 years can pose health, safety and welfare problems for occupants.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                 V-10

Consistent with State law, Table 7 estimates the number of units in need of rehabilitation and
the number of units needing replacement. Although the exact number of Lafayette units in
need of rehab is not currently known, the State accepts estimates based on a formula that
assumes the older the unit, the more likely the rehab need. By applying an increasing
percentage to the housing stock in each age category, it is estimated that there are
approximately 839 units in need of some level of rehabilitation in Lafayette, representing 9.1%
of the housing stock. The range of rehabilitation needs can include anything from minor repairs
to major structural replacements. It is estimated that nearly all of the units in need of
rehabilitation can be repaired without replacement.

Census tract data reveals that older housing stock is located east of Pleasant Hill Road, east of
Moraga Road and south of Mt. Diablo Blvd., and certain areas north of Deer Hill Road.
According to Lafayette’s Code Enforcement Officer, the vast majority of housing is in good
condition and most of the complaints he processes are related to illegal vehicles, the
accumulation of junk and debris and lack of property upkeep and maintenance.
The Contra Costa County Property Conservation Department provides enforcement services for
Lafayette related to building and housing code issues. According to its records, the Department
issued notices to comply for one complaint related to expired permits with hazardous
conditions present in 2009; one notice to comply to provide pool safety and security measures
in 2010; one notice to comply for unsafe structural support within an apartment building in
2011and five notices to comply for an illegal second unit, substandard building conditions,
outdoor lighting without permits, residential work without permits, and improper storage of
recreational vehicle in 2012. Despite the age of the houses in these areas (fifty years or older)
most of the homes are well maintained. This is due to the high mean household income and
high mean home value that allows property owners to afford to renovate or repair their homes.
Property owners are also generally responsive when informed of code violations.

   Since Lafayette is a predominantly residential community, the existing housing stock defines
   the character of the City and its neighborhoods. There are several policies in the Housing
   Element, which continue to promote the maintenance, enhancement and protection of
   residential neighborhoods.
   ANNUAL CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING UNITS BY TYPE 1980 – 2013
   Fluctuations in the type of housing built reflect not only the relative amount of land zoned for
   different types of residential development in the City, but also changes in various economic
   factors such as tax codes and the real estate and financial markets. Table 8 indicates single- and

   As shown in the table above, the majority of new housing construction during the period 1980-
   2013 was single-family units. The rate of construction has declined since the 1980s, in large part
   due to the lack of larger tracts of land available for subdivision.
   HOUSING TYPES AND TENURE
   Tables 9 and 10 present information on housing types and tenure in Lafayette. Lafayette
   remains a predominantly single-family residential community, with a high rate of owner-
   occupied dwellings. According to the State Department of Finance (DOF) and U.S. Census data
   HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                       V-12

for 2010, it is estimated that 82.0% of the city’s total housing units are single-family and 75.2%
are owner-occupied.

Data from the 2010 Census and the California Department of Finance indicate that the vacancy
rate has risen since 2000. In 2000, the homeowner vacancy rate was 0.4% and the rental
vacancy rate was 1.9%. According to the Census and DOF, the homeowner vacancy rate in 2010
was 0.8% -- still quite low – and the rental vacancy rate was 5.7%. An overall vacancy rate of at
least 4% is generally acceptable to provide for normal turnover in housing units. Lafayette's
vacancy rate indicates a strong demand for all types of housing, particularly owner-occupied
units.
INCOME CATEGORIES
Every year, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, in conjunction with the
State of California, establish income categories based on the median income in each county.
Based on new requirements for the completion of the Housing Element, jurisdictions must now
report on the following categories of income:
                            Extremely Low Income: 0-30% of Median Family Income, or MFI
                                              Very Low Income: 30-50% MFI
                                                 Low Income: 50-80% MFI
                                             Moderate Income: 80-120% MFI
                                          Above Moderate Income: 120%+ MFI
Based on data from 2013, the following table illustrates the income categories for Contra Costa
County. The median income for a family of four is $93,500.

 As shown above, the number of households earning very low-incomes declined between 1990
 and 2000, but began rising by 2010. Additionally, the percentage share of median to moderate
 income and above has declined since 2000, to 82.2%. In 2010, it was estimated that of the 955
 households earning incomes below 50% of the median, 51% (490) were owner-occupied
 households, while the remaining 49% (465) were renter-occupied households.
 SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
 Special Housing Needs: Seniors
 A relatively large proportion (26.8%) of Lafayette's housing units are occupied by persons 65
 years of age or older. Table 13 below shows senior citizen occupancy of owner- and renter-
 occupied housing units.

There are 184 housing units and 17 memory care units set-aside exclusively for senior citizens
in Lafayette. Based on the total number of units occupied by seniors (2,085 units), the
dedicated units represent only a fraction of the demand senior citizens have for housing. This
demand is primarily met by single-family homes purchased many years ago.
In 2008, the City of Lafayette partnered with Eden Housing, a nonprofit developer, to create a
new independent living facility for extremely low-income and very low-income seniors. In
addition to financial assistance to newly constructed 46-unit development, the City has
provided several land-use benefits to the project, such as a density bonus, an increase to the
maximum allowable height and a reduction in the parking requirements. This project provides
a well-designed building on Mt. Diablo Boulevard in the Downtown area that includes a wide
variety of amenities for its residents.
In addition, the City approved a density bonus for a new mixed-use senior housing
development which is nearing completion. This was the first project approved under the Senior
Housing Zoning Overlay, which allowed for reduced parking standards for the housing
component. Through consolidation of six lots, the project provides 72 assisted living units for
seniors and a 17-bed memory care facility. In addition to housing, the development provides a
number of public and private amenities including ~6,000 sq. ft. of retail space along Mt. Diablo
Boulevard, a large public courtyard, a senior shuttle, and an on-site movie theater, salon,
fitness center, and dining facilities. The project also obtained a Silver Innovation award from
National Association of Home Builders in the 2013 Best of 50+ Housing Awards.
The State Department of Finance projects nearly a doubling in the number of seniors over age
65 in Contra Costa County between 2000 and 2020. Of the increase, 71% (almost 39,000
people) will be between the ages of 65 and 75 years. Lafayette is expected to experience a
similar increase; many of the City’s seniors will continue to live in their homes of long-standing.
However, others will be prepared to give up the maintenance and expense of their homes while
wishing to remain citizens of the community, while others will need to give up their homes for
financial or other reasons. Lastly, middle-aged Lafayette householders will face the need to
care for older parents and some will want them to live nearby. To address these conditions,
this chapter provides opportunities for additional housing for seniors of all income categories.
Three principal factors will affect the future number of senior housing and care facilities that
can be built:
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                               V-15

a) Senior housing typically is denser than general multifamily housing, since seniors tend to
    live alone in smaller units and because they frequently do not have the space requirements
    that younger families might have. In addition, senior housing often has substantially less
    parking demand than other kinds of housing. Recognizing this, the City established the
    Senior Housing Zoning Overlay in 2010 which encourages the construction of a variety of
    senior housing types and grants flexibility in parking and other development standards for
    senior housing projects.
b) There has been decreasing Federal and State funding to provide additional affordable
    housing for seniors. In addition, the federal tax reform enacted in 1986 provides for the
    establishment of State caps for private activity bonds which will result in major reductions
    in the volume of tax-exempt bonds issued to finance single and multi-family housing in
    California.
c) There are vacant bedrooms in the City; however, it is difficult to quantify accurately the
    number of such under-utilized housing units. The diminishing household size since the
    1960s combined with the large number of existing single-family homes indicates that there
    could be a significant source of additional housing for seniors dispersed throughout existing
    neighborhoods.
Programs to assist seniors who wish to continue living in their own homes not only provide
important psychological and social benefits, but also reduce the need to build additional
housing. Examples of such programs include low interest loans to qualifying seniors for
maintenance and repair of their homes and matching seniors with spare capacity in their homes
with other seniors looking for housing.
A group of seniors in Lafayette and nearby Orinda and Moraga are in the process of establishing
a virtual “senior village” for those residents who wish to remain in their own homes and
communities as they age. Lamorinda Village is a nonprofit organization which will serve as a
one-stop resource by providing transportation, health, legal, financial and other assistance to
its members. Enrollment is expected to begin in 2015.
Special Housing Needs: Disabled Persons
The number of disabled persons in a city has important planning and social implications and will
affect the demand for specialized handicapped access and transportation facilities, and certain
social services, in addition to specialized housing.
The US Census collects information on disabled people based on a number of factors, including
employment and type of disability. Just 5.8% of the noninstitutionalized population over the
age of five is disabled in the City of Lafayette, compared with 10.5% and 10.7% for the County
and State, respectively. Two percent of the employed population is disabled, whereas 8% of
the population that is not participating in the labor force is disabled.

 NOTE: PERCENTAGES MAY TOTAL MORE THAN 100% IF INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFY WITH MORE THAN ONE CATEGORY.
A “developmental disability” is a condition that originates before an individual reaches age 18;
continues, or can be expected to continue indefinitely; and constitutes a substantial
impairment in three or more areas of major life activity. Developmental disabilities include
mental retardation, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, autism, and disabling conditions closely related to
mental retardation or requiring treatment similar to that required by people with mental
retardation, but does not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in
nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment
where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an
institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because
developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an
appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community based
services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families
through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two
community-based facilities. The Regional Center of the East Bay (RCEB) is one of 21 regional
centers in the State of California that provides point of entry to services for people with
developmental disabilities. The center is a private, non-profit community agency that contracts

with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental
disabilities and their families.
The following information from the RCEB, charged by the State of California with the care of
people with developmental disabilities, defined as those with severe, life-long disabilities
attributable to mental and/or physical impairments provides a closer look at the disabled
population. While not broken down by individual jurisdiction, it does provide a snapshot of
persons needing access to services for people with developmental disabilities. One can surmise
from the information on persons with cognitive disabilities above that the likely number of
persons with development disabilities in the City of Lafayette is limited. According to the
American Community Survey (2009-2013), there are approximately 375 persons in Lafayette
described as having a cognitive disability.

There are a number of housing types appropriate for people living with a development
disability: rent subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, inclusionary
housing, Section 8 vouchers, special programs for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962
homes. The design of housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity to services and transit,
and the availability of group living opportunities represent some of the types of considerations
that are important in serving this need group. About 180 units are reserved for seniors and 15
units are reserved for disabled persons. Incorporating ‘barrier-free’ design in all, new
multifamily housing (as required by California and Federal Fair Housing laws) is especially
important to provide the widest range of choices for disabled residents. Special consideration
should also be given to the affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be living on
a fixed income.
Lafayette is home to two long-standing institutions that serve the needs of the developmentally
disabled. Las Trampas, Inc. supports adults with developmental disabilities to discover their
capabilities and to lead full lives in their home, at work, and in the community. Las Trampas
offers independent and supported living services and adult development programs. Futures
Explored, Inc. provides life skills and work-related training to adults with developmental
disabilities.
The affordability of housing for disabled people is an important concern in Contra Costa County,
and within the City of Lafayette. Considering that the 2013 monthly Supplemental Security

Income (SSI) benefit, which provides monthly disability income for those who meet Social
Security rules for disability and who have limited income and resources, is $710 per month for
an individual (down from $870 in 2008), the ability for a disabled person on SSI to find
affordable housing is extremely difficult, if not impossible. At this amount, the maximum rent a
disabled person on SSI could pay is just $213 per month (30% of the monthly income, according
to HUD rules).
In order to assist in the housing needs for persons with developmental disabilities, the City will
consider implementing programs to coordinate housing activities and outreach with the
Regional Center and its partners and Las Trampas and Futures Explored, encourage housing
providers to designate a portion of new affordable housing developments for persons with
disabilities, including persons with developmental disabilities, and pursue funding sources
designated for persons with special needs and disabilities.
Special Housing Needs: Single-Parent Households
According to the 2010 Census, Lafayette has a total of 924 family households with one head-of-
household, of which more than 70% are headed by a female with no husband present. The 924
single-parent households represent 13.6% of the 6,795 family households in Lafayette.
Although 2010 data are not available by tenure, the following table illustrates the breakdown of
these statistics for 2000.

Female-headed households are likely to have greater demand than two-parent households – or
male-headed households -- for childcare and other social services. There is an obvious need for
more affordable housing for this sector of the community. The waiting list for Section 8 housing
at the Contra Costa County Housing Authority (CCCHA) was over 4,000 persons in 2008, more
than 40% of whom represented female-headed households.
Special Housing Needs: Large Households

751 households in Lafayette with five persons or more, or about 8% of the total households in

The Census defines an overcrowded unit as one occupied by 1.01 persons or more per room
(excluding bathrooms and kitchens). Units with more than 1.5 persons per room are considered
severely overcrowded. Overcrowding increases health and safety concerns and stresses the
condition of the housing stock and infrastructure. Overcrowding is strongly related to
household size, particularly for large households and especially very large households and the
availability of suitably sized housing. Overcrowding impacts both owners and renters; however,
renters are generally more significantly impacted.
While family size and tenure are critical determinants in overcrowding, household income also
plays a strong role in the incidence of overcrowding. As a general rule, overcrowding levels tend
to decrease as income rises, especially for renters. The rate of overcrowding for very low-
income households is generally nearly three times greater than households over 95% of the
area median income. As with renters, owner households with higher incomes have lower rates
of overcrowding.
Households in Lafayette tend to be somewhat larger than in the San Francisco Bay Area as a
whole. While some large families may be subject to overcrowding, there is generally little
overcrowding in Lafayette. According to the American Community Survey (2011), which
replaces certain features of the Census, there are an estimated 61 households in Lafayette that
are considered overcrowded, representing 0.7% of all occupied households. Although data for
2011 are not broken down between owners and renters, it is likely that renter households are
more impacted by overcrowding than owners, based on findings from 2000. In contrast, the
same data suggest that overcrowding in the County as a whole is more common; about 4% of
all County households are overcrowded, of which about 20% are severely overcrowded.

Though 1.00 persons per room is a general measure of overcrowding, the actual level of
perceived overcrowding will vary according to household size and structure. Houses with fewer
rooms and non-related adult residents may seem more overcrowded, based on the 1.00-
person-per-room standard, than larger, family households. According to the 2011 American
Community Survey, most housing units (93%) in Lafayette have four or more rooms.
Consequently, the 1.00-person-per-room overcrowding standard may represent relatively less
perceived overcrowding in Lafayette than in other Bay Area communities.
In addition to overcrowding, large households also often have a cost burden, which means
spending more than 30% of their income for housing. Households that spend more than 50% of
their income are considered to have a severe cost burden. In Lafayette, the vast majority of
large households that pay too much for housing are lower-income owner households. Although
this is principally because there are very few large renter households, there are
disproportionately fewer large renter households than large owner-occupied households.
Special Needs: Homeless
Accurate information on the number of homeless persons in Lafayette is difficult to obtain as
people often move from place to place every night. Lafayette Police Department personnel
indicate that they occasionally encounter transients but they tend to be persons who have
arrived in Lafayette via public transportation and are not from Lafayette.
Project HOPE is a homeless outreach project to homeless encampments (locations where
homeless persons gather) and serves people experiencing homelessness and co-occurring
disorders (including mental health, substance abuse, and medical problems) throughout Contra
Costa County. During the period January 2009 to July 2014, there were 1,833 people who
contacted Project HOPE for services in the City of Lafayette. Major needs of the callers included
anxiety issues, bereavement services, psychiatric services, relationship issues, depression
issues, loneliness, child abuse, suicidal tendencies, and homeless services.
The Contra Costa Inter-jurisdictional Council on Homelessness (CCICH) is charged with providing
a forum for communication about the implementation of Contra Costa County’s Ten Year Plan
to End Homelessness and providing advice and input on the operations of homeless services,
program operations, and program development efforts in Contra Costa County. The CCICH
Executive Committee is an Advisory Board to the Contra Costa Board of Supervisors in issues
relating to homelessness.
CCICH has provided information for each jurisdiction in the County for use in their Housing
Elements relating to the analysis of the need for emergency shelter and estimate of the daily
average number of persons lacking permanent shelter. This information includes:
     Homeless population estimates
     Unmet need
     Data methodology
     Inventory of existing shelters, transitional housing and permanent supportive housing
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                              V-21

After considering the strengths and shortcomings of each source of data, the subcommittee
addressing these issues determined that the bi-annual Homeless Count results and outreach
data are the most accurate and useful sources of information. Additionally, as required by the
federal government in order to receive a variety of homeless funds, this Homeless Count is
conducted biannually. According to the 2011 Homeless Count, there were 9 homeless persons
identified within Lafayette who are unsheltered, as compared with 23 in 2009. In 2013, no
homeless persons were identified in the Homeless Count in Lafayette.
While this point-in-time data is useful, it does not give much information about the
circumstances in which these individuals found themselves to be homeless. As of this writing,
no further information – such as the number of persons who are single or in families, those
with mental health concerns or alcohol/drug addiction issues, etc. – is available.
The Ten-Year County Plan describes three different kinds of homeless people, each with their
own set of needs. Although this information addresses Countywide homeless concerns, it is
relevant for Lafayette in terms of what kind of programs and housing may be provided within
the City.
Chronically Homeless: In 2013 this category was estimated to include 1,200 people, about 30%
of the population that is homeless on any given night. They are severely disabled with a mental
health condition, physical illness or substance abuse problem, and they have been homeless for
a year or longer or have had at least four episodes of homelessness in the last three years. They
are the most visible segment of the homeless population and the focus of community
frustration due to their ongoing habitation of public places and their non-conforming behavior.
Though a small percentage of the overall yearly homeless population, chronically homeless
people use the majority of resources within the homeless service system and are costly to
mainstream systems because of frequent interactions with hospitals, mental health crisis
services, detox programs, and the criminal justice system. Because the services they receive
tend to be fragmented and accessed only in crisis, their high service usage does not translate
into long term gains in stability, but often reinforces their alienation and distrust of the service
system.
Discharged Into Homelessness: These are people who are released from public institutions
directly to the streets or shelters. These institutions include the foster care system, jails and
prisons, mental health programs, drug and alcohol programs, and hospitals. Too often these
systems do not engage in pre-release permanent housing planning to ensure that those
discharged have stable housing and are linked to necessary services to ensure their ongoing
stability and facilitate their transition back into the community. Individuals who have serious
disabilities and who are discharged without receiving appropriate assistance often become part
of the costly chronic homeless population.
Transitionally Homeless: Past studies have shown that almost 90% of those who experience
homelessness each year are experiencing a first or second episode of homelessness which

typically lasts less than one year. An estimated two-thirds of this sub-population lives in family
households. Typically, a job loss, illness or eviction causes them to lose their housing. Unable to
find other housing that is affordable and/or resolve their lack of income, they become
homeless.
The homeless count conducted on in January 2013 found 3,798 homeless persons in Contra
Costa County, 1,350 of which were living outdoors and the rest in shelters or transitional
housing, and utilizing soup kitchens and other programs serving the homeless. Of the people
found in programs, 858 were members of homeless families, 1,161 were single adults, 11 were
unaccompanied minors, and 201 were transition age youth (ages 18-24, a new federal
category). These overall statistics are drastically reduced from the 2005 homeless count, where
more than 7,000 total homeless people were found, and represent a significant drop from
2011. Countywide, the homeless count found the following sub categories of persons.
                Chronically Homeless Families- 68, of which 45 were sheltered
                Chronically Homeless Individuals- 1,092, of which 512 were sheltered

Some of the homeless population include people suffering from mental illness and other
chronic disabilities who have become an ongoing presence in our city centers, parks and open
spaces. Others are not so visible, but still in need of assistance — disadvantaged youth
discharged from the foster care system with nowhere to go; single mothers with children,
recently divorced or fleeing a situation of domestic violence; and low income single adults and
families without savings to help them weather an unexpected job loss, illness or eviction. In
addition, an estimated 23,000 households in Contra Costa County have extremely low incomes
and are at-risk of homelessness, paying an excessive portion of their income for rent. An
unexpected job loss, illness or eviction can put them in the streets since their high rents
preclude them from accumulating a savings cushion to protect themselves.
Special Housing Needs: Farmworkers
There are no farmworkers in Lafayette, and the city is located in a largely urbanized area of
Contra Costa County. Consequently, farm worker housing needs are not expected to be an issue
in Lafayette.

HOUSING COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY
The National Association of Homebuilders reports that California cities have the lowest
homeowner affordability rates in the country, defined as the percentage of homes affordable
to the median income family. Despite the high median incomes, especially in the Bay Area,
many cannot afford the cost to purchase a home. The Oakland Metropolitan Division, of which
Lafayette is a part, ranked 198th out of 222 metropolitan areas studied in the first quarter of
2013; San Francisco, not surprisingly, is the least affordable area in the State.

As shown earlier, overpayment for housing is a considerable problem for various special needs
groups, but impacts the general population as well. According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s
American Community Survey (ACS) five-year estimates (2006-2010), 1,760 households are
paying between 30% and 50% of household income on housing, and another 1,355 pay more
than 50% of household income. Together, this represents 36% of all households in Lafayette.
Both owners and renters at the lowest incomes pay more for housing, as a percentage of their
household income, than do their higher income counterparts.
In Lafayette, sales prices for single family detached and condominiums/ townhouses have
increased over the past several years. According to the Contra Costa Association of Realtors, in
2007, the median price of a single family detached home was $1,100,000. In 2013, the median
price had increased slightly to $1,151,250, an increase of 4.6%. The situation for condos and
townhouses was similar. In 2007, the median sales price was $594,000 and in 2013, it had
increased by 3.7% to $616,000. During the period between 2007 and 2013, the country was
deep in a recession, and housing prices dropped substantially, including in Lafayette.

professionals -- also provides statistics based on actual sales of housing by location. Although

The high cost of housing means that people wanting to own a home in Lafayette must have
significant incomes, even for the relatively less expensive condos. The following table shows
how much a household must earn annually in order to be able to afford the median priced
home in Lafayette in 2013.

The decreasing supply of affordable rental units is a countywide phenomenon; it can include
Ellis Act evictions (where an owner of a rental property decides to leave the rental business) to
owner move-in evictions. Until additional construction of rental units occurs, the combination
of strong demand and low vacancies will contribute to an increasingly severe shortage of rental
units and a decrease in their affordability.
The following table illustrates the affordable rents associated with each income category. In
the case of an extremely low-income household of two people (for example, a single parent
with a child), the annual income of $22,450 translates to a full time job paying $10.80 per hour.
In this scenario, the maximum rent they could afford would be about $561 per month – far
below average rents in the area, even for studios.

Through its Section 8 and other housing programs, HUD provides rental housing assistance to
low-income households. According to the Contra Costa County Housing Authority, 46
households in Lafayette currently receive Section 8 rental assistance, in the form of Housing
Choice Vouchers. Of these, 35 include one or more persons with a disability. Two properties --
Chateau Lafayette (66 units) and Town Center (15 units) -- are potentially at risk of conversion
in the next ten years. An analysis of the conversion risk can be found further in this Element.
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION
The Regional Housing Needs allocation process is a State mandate, devised to address the need
for and planning of housing across a range of affordability and in all communities throughout
the State. Each jurisdiction in the Bay Area (101 cities, 9 counties) is given a share of the
anticipated regional housing need. The Bay Area's regional housing need is allocated by the
California State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), and finalized
though negotiations with ABAG.
According to ABAG, the regional housing need is determined by estimating both the existing
need and the projected need for housing. Existing need is the amount of housing needed to
address existing overcrowding or low vacancy rates. Projected need relates to providing
housing for the growing population. Using slightly different methods, both the State, through
the State Department of Finance (DOF), and the region, via ABAG, estimate projected
household growth. Since these numbers may differ, the State and the region work closely
together to arrive at an agreed upon estimate of future population growth; therefore, housing
need through 2022.
On July 19, 2013, the ABAG Executive Board adopted the final Regional Housing Need Allocation
(RHNA) methodology for the period between 2014 and 2022. The RHNA methodology consists
of two major steps: determining a jurisdiction's total RHNA and identifying the share of the
jurisdiction's total RHNA in each income category. The following describes the components of
the adopted RHNA Methodology.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                              V-26
Sustainability Component
This component advances the goals of SB 375; this factor is based on the Jobs-Housing
Connection Strategy, which allocates new housing development into Priority Development
Areas (PDAs) and non-PDA areas. By concentrating new development in PDAs, the Strategy
helps protect the region’s natural resources by reducing development pressure on open space,
rural areas, and small towns. This allows the region to consume less energy, thus reducing
household costs and the emission of greenhouse gases. Following the land use distribution
specified in the Jobs-Housing Connection Strategy, 70% of the region’s housing need as
determined by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) will
be allocated based on growth in PDAs and the remaining 30% will be allocated based on growth
in non-PDA locations.
HCD determined that the housing need for the Bay Area region for 2014 to 2022 is 187,990
units. The sustainability framework of the PDAs is the basis for the Sustainable Communities
Strategy (SCS) and the inclusion of this framework in the RHNA methodology promotes
consistency between the two.
In July 19, 2012, the Jobs-Housing Connection Strategy was modified to include a feasible
growth concentration scenario that was applied to the 2014-2022 RHNA cycle. This new
distribution shifted approximately 3,500 units (1.5 percent of the total regional allocation) from
Oakland, Newark, San Jose, and the North Bay primarily to medium sized cities with high job
growth and transit access.
Fair Share Component
According to ABAG, this component achieves the requirement that all cities and counties in
California work to provide a fair share proportion of the region’s total and affordable housing
need. In particular, cities with strong transit networks, a high number of jobs, and that
permitted a low number of very low- and low-income units during the 1999-2006 RHNA cycle
received higher allocations. The Fair Share Component includes the factors listed below:
   Upper Housing Threshold: If growth projected by the Jobs-Housing Connection Strategy in a
    jurisdiction’s PDAs meets or exceeds 110 percent of the jurisdiction’s household formation
    growth, that jurisdiction is not assigned additional units. This ensures that cities with large
    PDAs are not overburdened. In addition, the total allocation to a jurisdiction cannot exceed
    150 percent of its 2007-2014 RHNA.
   Minimum Housing Floor: Jurisdictions are assigned a minimum of 40 percent of their
    household formation growth. Setting this minimum threshold ensures that each jurisdiction
    is planning for housing to accommodate at least a portion of the housing need generated by
    the population within that jurisdiction.
   Fair Share Factors: The following three factors were applied to a jurisdiction’s non- PDA
    growth:
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                               V-27

       Past RHNA Performance: Cities that permitted a high number of housing units for very
        low- and low-income households during the 1999-2006 RHNA cycle received a lower
        allocation.
       Employment: Jurisdictions with a higher number of existing jobs in non-PDA areas
        (based on 2010 data) received a higher allocation.
       Transit: Jurisdictions with higher transit frequency and coverage received a higher
        allocation.
Income Allocation
The income allocation method gives jurisdictions that have a relatively higher proportion of
households in a certain income category a smaller allocation of housing units in that same
category. For example, jurisdictions that already supply a large amount of affordable housing
receive lower affordable housing allocations. This also promotes the state objective for
reducing concentrations of poverty and increasing the mix of housing types among cities and
counties equitably. The income allocation requirement is designed to ensure that each
jurisdiction in the Bay Area plans for housing people of every income.
The income distribution of a jurisdiction’s housing need allocation is determined by the
difference between the regional proportion of households in an income category and the
jurisdiction’s proportion for that same category. Once determined, this difference is then
multiplied by 175 percent. The result becomes that jurisdiction’s “adjustment factor.” The
jurisdiction’s adjustment factor is added to the jurisdiction’s initial proportion of households in
each income category. The result is the total share of the jurisdiction’s housing unit allocation
for each income category.
Sphere of Influence Adjustments
Every city in the Bay Area has a Sphere of Influence (SOI) which can be either contiguous with
or go beyond the city’s boundary. The SOI is considered the probable future boundary of a city
and that city is responsible for planning within its SOI. The SOI boundary is designated by the
county’s Local Area Formation Commission (LAFCO). The LAFCO influences how government
responsibilities are divided among jurisdictions and service districts in these areas.
The method for allocating housing need for jurisdictions where there is projected growth within
the SOI varies by county. In Napa, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties, the
allocation of housing need generated by the unincorporated SOI is assigned to the cities. In
Alameda and Contra Costa counties, the allocation of housing need generated by the
unincorporated SOI is assigned to the county. In Marin County, 62.5% of the allocation of
housing need generated by the unincorporated SOI is assigned to the city and 37.5% is assigned
to the county.
The following table illustrates the housing allocation figures for the City of Lafayette for the
period 2014-2022.

SHELTER NEEDS
There are no emergency shelters or transitional housing facilities located in Lafayette; however,
there are several programs and agencies serving Lafayette and central Contra Costa County for
those in need. One of the major agencies is the Contra Costa Crisis Center-Homeless Services.
This agency conducts the intake and assessment of people to the county’s shelters. They also
provide other services such as food, job training and laundry facilities as well as providing
emergency lodging vouchers to at risk individuals and families. Shelter, Inc. is a non-profit
organization providing short-term transitional housing programs to homeless individuals and
families and information on emergency shelters, government assistance, emergency food
services, medical care, and rental assistance programs.
Despite programs to aid the homeless, the magnitude of this problem far exceeds the resources
of local government, particularly smaller cities. The City in general supports “Ending
Homelessness in Ten Years: A County-Wide Plan for the Communities of Contra Costa County”
(Ten Year Plan).
Through the Ten Year Plan, the County has adopted a “housing first” strategy, which works to
immediately house a homeless individual or family rather than force them through a sequence
of temporary shelter solutions. The Ten Year Plan further deemphasizes emergency shelters by
supporting “interim housing” as a preferred housing type. Interim housing is very short-term
and focuses on helping people access permanent housing as quickly as possible. Services
provided in interim housing include housing search assistance and case management to help
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                  V-29

address immediate needs and identify longer-term issues to be dealt with once in permanent
housing.
To determine the amount of unmet need for emergency shelter, transitional housing and
permanent supportive housing, researchers compared the results of the Homeless Provider
Survey to the data specific to the number of persons living on the streets: the January 2007
unsheltered homeless point-in-time count and Project HOPE outreach team data. Statewide
and national data were then considered regarding homeless people and their needs.
Researchers compared the difference between total homeless persons and housing inventory
to determine the unmet need. In the final analysis, the unmet need was divided between
emergency and permanent supportive housing, with the vast majority of the unmet need going
to permanent supportive housing, consistent with the Housing First strategy. Additionally,
there is no unmet need for transitional housing.
Consistent with the Ten Year Plan, the City will prioritize the use of its limited housing
development resources to support permanent housing affordable to those with extremely-low,
very-low and low incomes. The City, however, has complied with the Housing Element Law
regarding the identification of adequate sites to facilitate the development of emergency
shelters and transitional housing with programs, which identify an area suitable for this use.
In 2013, the City approved a Zoning Ordinance Amendment to allow emergency shelters as a
permitted use in the General Commercial District C-1 (Zoning Map symbol C-1). The C-1 Zoning
District was selected as an appropriate location for such a facility because:
    1. There are several underutilized sites within this district;
    2. This area is centrally located and near public transit; and
    3. All infrastructure, such as water, sewer, roads, and sidewalks, is in place.
An informal survey of a broad range of homeless shelters – from small shelters with fewer than
30 people to mass shelters for more than 200 people – indicates that the average square
footage per homeless shelter client is approximately 150 square feet (gross). For comparison
purposes, the City’s proposed senior housing overlay zoning ordinance calls for studios to be no
less than 450 square feet; to accommodate a shelter of up to 30 clients, any site needs to
roughly be able to accommodate ten studio apartments (150 SF X three clients = 450 SF; for 30
clients, multiply by ten). Considering that emergency shelters are arranged dormitory-style and
not as housing units, the space needed to create a 30-bed shelter is significantly less than for
traditional housing and as such, should easily be accommodated within the C-1 district.
The City included in its review of suitable locations for shelters ten discrete development sites,
totaling more than ten and a half acres, within the C-1 zone. All of these sites are within the
Redevelopment Area, and all are sites that are in the inventory of adequate sites for housing.
The average size of these sites is 1.05 acres (aggregated), with the largest at 1.50 acres and the
smallest at 0.60 acres. Within these aggregated sites, many individual sites are large enough to
accommodate a small emergency shelter. Further, some individual sites are in common
ownership and could also accommodate a shelter. This subset of sites – sites that do not need

lot consolidation in order to serve as a viable shelter location – includes nine sites, totaling 7.50
acres. The largest of these sites is 1.50 acres, the smallest is 0.4, and the average is 0.83 acres.
There are potentially other sites within the C-1 zone that could be used for this purpose, but
this Housing Element only includes sites that have already been reviewed for their suitability as
housing and/or mixed use development. Should any one of these sites be developed for a
shelter rather than for permanent housing, the City will identify a replacement site of like kind
consistent with the “no net loss” provisions of State Housing Element Law, as warranted.
Conversely, if any of these sites are developed for non-shelter uses, the City will identify
appropriate replacement sites. See the two related programs: Program H-2.4.3: RHNA
Monitoring Program and Program H-3.6.2: Emergency Shelter Capacity Monitoring Program.
Further, although the acres identified for the inventory overlap sites to accommodate
emergency shelters, the site inventory identifies the potential for over 700 units, and therefore
the City is confident there are sufficient sites to accommodate both the RHNA and emergency
shelters.
PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
Prior to the 2011 Housing Element, the City of Lafayette's Housing Element was last revised in
2002. The Regional housing Allocation for the last reporting period was:

The policies and implementing actions of the previous Housing Element concentrated on
preservation of existing single-family neighborhoods and encouragement of second units and
multi-family and senior citizen housing. See Appendix A for a complete review of the previous
Element's implementing actions.
The City has been moderately successful in achieving the goals established by the previous
Housing Element as illustrated in the table below:

The updated Housing Element builds on the foundation established by the previous Element,
but contains more specific implementation programs and quantified objectives. Priorities of the
Element include: (1) conservation and rehabilitation of existing homes, (2) encouragement of
second units, (3) encouragement of housing in the downtown and (4), programs to advertise,
implement and fund these activities. The Element also recognizes the need to provide stronger
incentives for the construction of additional affordable housing.
MEETING THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION
Table 33 shows vacant or underdeveloped land that could accommodate Lafayette’s regional
housing needs allocation. The figures shown in the table are based on a parcel-by-parcel
analysis of the number of dwelling units that could be constructed, taking into account the site
constraints specific to each parcel, the residential densities typically approved for similar
properties, and the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. The conclusion that can be drawn
from this table is that the City has sufficient vacant and underdeveloped land, zoned at
appropriate densities, to meet its regional housing need allocation
The list of vacant and underdeveloped land in Appendix B includes properties in the downtown
area that have the potential of being used for multifamily housing. These sites identified in this
inventory are spread along the entire length of Mt. Diablo Blvd. Development of these sites for
multifamily housing will not necessarily impact the streets in the Downtown Core that are most
heavily used. Residents from these multifamily developments have a variety of options to exit
the downtown and access the freeway, including Pleasant Hill Road to the east and Acalanes
Road to the west. The residential development would also generate less traffic than commercial
development.
While a number of the sites identified in the inventory allow commercial use, they also allow
housing. To remove one barrier to the production of housing, the City in 2012 amended its
Zoning Ordinance to allow housing as of right in the downtown zoning districts. Further,
additional programs have been included to encourage the development of housing over
commercial (or mixed use over commercial) in the Downtown. The inventory and methodology
provided in this chapter demonstrate that in recent years, there has been a trend towards

In addition, the City has consulted with local realtors and developers concerning the use of
commercially-zoned sites for residential development. They suggest that this trend should
continue in the coming years. This chapter’s goals, policies and programs include a variety of
incentives to assist developers in assembling land for housing, especially affordable housing.
Despite sufficient vacant and underdeveloped land there exist potentially significant constraints
to increased residential development, which are discussed in the Constraints to Housing
Development section. Table 32 represents the quantified goal of the City to approve 270 new
and rehabilitated housing units.

Table 33 summarizes the potential for residential development on vacant and underdeveloped
land in the community. A complete inventory of parcels can be found in Appendices B and C.
The analysis reflects real world constraints based on a site-specific analysis and is not simply the
total land area multiplied by maximum permitted density. For the purposes of this analysis
underdeveloped land is land which has a development intensity significantly less than what is
allowed under the City's land use regulations.

There is a reasonable potential that the sites found in Appendices B and C, and summarized in
Table 33, will be developed with multi-family housing, since:
•   The parcels are located in commercial and residential zoning districts which permit mixed
    uses and residential development at a density of up to 35 du/acre;
   These zoning districts now allow housing by right; General Commercial (C), General
    Commercial -1 (C-1), Retail Business (RB), and Special Retail Business (SRB).
•   There exists the potential of assembling underdeveloped parcels to facilitate application of
    development incentives contained in the Planned Unit Development (PUD) section of the
    Zoning Ordinance and adopted Specific Plans.
It will be market forces, however, that will have the strongest influence in determining the type,
density, and phasing of future multi-family housing development in Lafayette. Such factors as
interest rates and the vitality of the local and national economy are beyond the scope of local
government.

GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT
Annexation Standards
Although the City of Lafayette does not expect to annex land within the planning period, an
important land use regulation affecting development in Lafayette, as well as other cities in
Contra Costa County, is the policy adopted by the Contra Costa County Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCO) regarding annexation proposals.
The standards and procedures set forth in the LAFCO policy affect its review of requests for city
annexation of lands proposed for development. The application of these standards will affect
development of land outside existing City limits.
Currently, the Lafayette's Sphere of Influence does not extend substantially beyond the City
limits. It is not expected that the existing Sphere of Influence area will be altered to include
vacant lands that would yield many more developable lots.
Land Use Controls
The Lafayette Zoning Ordinance contained within the City's Municipal Code, sets forth land use
designations and development requirements for construction activity within the City. California
law requires that the Zoning Ordinance be consistent with the General Plan. The Lafayette
Zoning Ordinance will be amended to be consistent with the Housing Element following its
completion.
The Zoning Ordinance establishes two primary types of residential zoning: Single-Family
Residential (R-6, R-10, R-12, R-15, R-20, R-40, R-65, R-100, LR-10 and LR-5) and Multiple-Family
Residential (D-1, MRA, MRB, MRO, MRT, APO and MRP). Multi-family residential is also
permitted by right in the commercial zoning districts (C, C-1, SRB, RB).
The following tables illustrate the City’s development standards.

In 2012, the City adopted a Downtown Specific Plan which calls for the preparation of
Downtown Design Guidelines. The Guidelines have been completed were adopted in
September 2014. The development standards listed for the downtown zoning districts above
will be amended in 2014-15 to reflect the policies of the Downtown Specific Plan, the
Downtown Design Guidelines and the Housing Element.
The City anticipates that the majority of higher density, affordable units will be built in the
Downtown zoning districts C, C-1, SRB and RB. It is in these districts that services such as
grocery and drug stores, civic uses such as the library and post office and transit facilities such
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                              V-37

as BART are located. As can be seen from the table above, the building setback requirements in
these districts are modest. A density of 35 du/acre – the maximum permitted in Lafayette --
and a 35 foot height limit are allowed. There is no floor area ratio (“FAR”) requirement in these
districts.
Existing parcels in the multifamily zoning districts (MRA, MRB, MRO) are typically modest in
area and cannot accommodate many residential units. The minimum lot area requirement for
new lots (10,000 SF) was put in place to ensure that newly zoned multifamily parcels would be
large enough to accommodate projects of considerable size and density. This requirement
however does not apply to the development of multifamily projects on existing lots less than
10,000 SF in area and is therefore not a constraint. Additionally, in the MRA district, the City
allows for increases in floor area ratio (FAR) to a maximum of 0.40 on lots that are under 20,000
SF in area if it finds that the lot cannot be reasonably merged with an adjacent parcel. In the
MRO district, an FAR of 0.50 is allowed.
Parking Requirements
The City’s parking standards for multifamily projects are similar to the standards in neighboring
jurisdictions. The requirements are 1.2 spaces for a one bedroom unit, 1.5 spaces for a two
bedroom units and 2 spaces for a unit with three or more bedrooms. Although not cited
specifically in the code, the City has and will continue to allow for creative ways to
accommodate parking and has approved the installation of a hydraulic lift system that stacks
cars in an apartment complex.
In recent years, several proposed senior housing projects have illustrated the unique needs of
these types of developments – needs that make the strict application of certain residential
zoning controls problematic. Seniors tend to drive less than their younger counterparts, and
they typically do not need (or want) as much living space as is found in family housing types.
As a consequence, residential parking requirements may be too onerous for a senior
development, and the smaller unit sizes increase the density of a project such that it may
conflict with existing zoning requirements. In recognizing these unique needs, the City has
adopted a Senior Housing Overlay zone – with reduced parking standards and increased
density, among other things -- to allow senior housing developments that are truly reflective of
their resident populations.
The City is in the process of updating its parking code and developing a comprehensive parking
strategy for the downtown. Included in this strategy will be consideration of the use of car lifts,
tandem parking, parking for electric cars, bicycle parking, proximity of housing to transit, car-
sharing incentives, etc.

On- and Off-Site Improvement Requirements
The standards for on- and off-site improvements contained in the Subdivision Ordinance do not
constitute a constraint to housing development. They are no more restrictive than those
typically found in other Contra Costa County cities. Indeed, in some cases, less restrictive
standards exist in Lafayette, since sidewalks with full curb and gutters are not required for most
types of residential subdivisions. Sewer and water connection fees are established by the
Contra Costa Central Sanitary District and the East Bay Municipal Utilities District and are
therefore similar to other jurisdictions served by these districts in the County.
Analysis of Land Use Controls: Impacts on Recent Developments
As part of the development of the last Housing Element, the Planning Staff conducted an
analysis of the City's development standards to determine whether they constitute a constraint
to housing development. Two schematic housing plans that were submitted by prospective
developers of two of the sites in the housing inventory were studied. Both projects were
analyzed using current regulations and without granting exceptions to discern whether or not
the City’s regulations posed a constraint to the production of housing.
The analysis determined that while most development standards do not constrain the
development of housing and are typical standards for the zoning designation, some standards
can be perceived to be impediments to the efficient and timely development of housing.
Regulations for residential development (e.g. required setbacks, maximum lot coverage, height
limits, minimum lot sizes) are no more restrictive than those of surrounding jurisdictions. The
Zoning Ordinance and related land use regulations serve to promote, rather than constrain,
housing development. In addition to these zoning districts, the Zoning Ordinance incorporates
the Planned Unit Development concept. Lafayette’s PUD process permits housing
developments to be built with flexible setbacks, lot coverage and other regulations and permits
the construction of mixed-use developments. The proposed Woodbury condominium project
(56 units) and existing Town Center apartments (75 units) are examples of higher density
projects that have used the PUD process.
The two sites reviewed for potential constraints are Parcel #241-020-013, which is part of Site
4, and Site 15. The following tables analyze the impacts of the City’s development standards on
those two proposals.

Note that the realistic capacity for this parcel as shown in Appendix C is 33 units. As stated
elsewhere in this Element, although nothing in the inventory specifically prevents a site from
being developed closer to its calculated capacity, the City has intentionally adopted a
conservative stance to ensure that there is adequate capacity for the inventory without having
to move outside the Downtown to achieve its housing goals.

Note that the realistic capacity for this parcel as shown in Appendix C is 35 units. As stated
elsewhere in this Element, although nothing in the inventory specifically prevents a site from
being developed closer to its calculated capacity, the City has intentionally adopted a
conservative stance to ensure that there is adequate capacity for the inventory without having
to move outside the Downtown to achieve its housing goals.
Conclusions
In its last update to the Housing Element, the City has conducted an in-depth analysis of its land
use controls as applied to two recent projects in order to determine whether such controls
impact the development of housing in a negative way. This analysis reveals that several of the
City’s land-use controls may be constraints that should be mitigated:
1. Requiring a land use permit for housing is a constraint to the production of housing.
     Typically, land use permit applications take longer to process than applications for design
     review approval and involve higher processing fees. To remove this constraint, the Housing
     Element contains the following program:
         Program H-2.4.2: Multifamily Housing Development: Amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow the
         development of multifamily housing as of right in areas where such development now requires a
         discretionary land use permit. Continue to require design review to ensure that developments
         are compatible with surrounding uses.
Status in 2014: Housing is now allowed by right in the downtown zoning districts (C, C-1, SRB,
RB).
2. The setback requirement of 50 feet for third stories in the C-1 and MRO districts and the
     setback requirement of 20 feet for three story buildings in the C district is a constraint to
     the production of housing in Downtown Lafayette. Housing sites in the Downtown vary in
     size, width and depth; few are regular in shape, making it difficult to comply with the
     requirements. Imposing a uniform upper story setback requirement on irregularly-shaped
     sites render certain parcels ineligible to accommodate three story structures without
     variances. To remove this constraint, the Housing Element contains the following program:
         Program H-5.1.6: Downtown Specific Plan Implementation. Following the Downtown Specific
         Plan adoption, revise the zoning ordinance to address the following constraints on the
         development of housing:
             Upper story setback requirements in the C, C-1 and MRO districts
             Develop design guidelines that would allow the City to reduce or eliminate the third story
             setback requirements in the C, C-1 and MRO districts if appropriate findings such as
             compatibility with adjacent development, view and solar protection can be met. As an
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                   V-42

            alternative, develop a set of criteria for waiving the setback requirements for irregular lots in
            the Downtown.
Status in 2014: The adopted Downtown Design Guidelines recommend a more reasonable step
back program for upper stories which recognizes that the lots in the downtown have varying
depths. The Guidelines suggest a step back based on a percentage of lot depth, thereby
eliminating the “one-size-fits-all” regulation found in the zoning ordinance. Staff is currently
amending the zoning ordinance to reflect this change.
3. The current parking code is a constraint to the production of housing because it does not
    permit tandem spaces or other options to provide parking. To remove this constraint, the
    Housing Element contains the following program:
        Program H-5.1.6: Downtown Specific Plan Implementation. Following the Downtown Specific
        Plan adoption, revise the zoning ordinance to address the following constraints on the
        development of housing:
            Parking
            Develop and establish measures such as allowing tandem spaces, car lifts and other creative
            ways to accommodate required parking for developments.
Status in 2014: The City is in the process of updating its parking code and developing a
comprehensive parking strategy for the downtown. Included in this strategy will be
consideration of the use of car lifts, tandem parking, parking for electric cars, bicycle parking,
proximity of housing to transit, car-sharing incentives, etc.
Lafayette also has a number of tools to encourage the construction of higher density housing in
the Downtown; many of these, in conjunction with other actions to remove constraints, make it
easier for housing to be built. They include:
    1. The Downtown Specific Plan: The adopted Downtown Strategy and Specific Plan
        contains a number of goals to promote the development of housing in the Downtown.
        They include:
                a. Allow housing by right in the Downtown
                b. Review and update existing development standards to ensure that the distinct
                character of the Downtown residential neighborhoods is preserved, existing
                multifamily development is protected, and new multifamily development is
                encouraged.
                c. Review and update current parking codes
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                        V-43

                d. Encourage sustainable development and the location of housing close to
                transit and services
   2. Senior Housing Overlay District: The City Council approved the creation of a senior
       housing overlay district on October 12, 2010. The purpose of this overlay is to permit
       greater densities and lower parking requirements for senior housing projects in the
       Downtown. The development standards include an increase in the allowable density for
       senior residential units from 35 units per acre to 45 units per acre not including
       otherwise applicable density bonuses under state law. A market rate senior residential
       project would quality for a density bonus of 20% which would allow up to 54 units per
       acre on a site. In comparison, an affordable senior residential project could qualify for a
       density bonus of up to 35% and would yield a maximum of 61 units on an acre. Parking
       requirements were reduced to one space for each 5 residents for residential care
       facilities, .40 parking spaces per unit for assisted living facilities, and .5 spaces per unit
       studio and 1-bedroom units for extremely low, very low, and low income units.
   3. Density Bonus Regulations: The City adopted a density bonus ordinance in November,
       2014.
   4. Downtown Design Guidelines: The City Council adopted Downtown Design Guidelines
       on September 8, 2014. The purpose of the Guidelines is to maintain and enhance the
       City’s informal, small-town character. The Guidelines will be used by designers,
       developers, planners, hearing bodies, and the public to gain a better understanding of
       the community’s vision for downtown development and to evaluate the merits of a
       project. As such, they are a tool in making the process more predictable and providing a
       clearer idea to developers of what the community desires.
The City has a proven track record of approving higher density residential and mixed use
projects. The following table lists some of those projects.

The average density of the multifamily projects that are in zones that allow a maximum density
of 35 du/acre is more than 30 du/acre, demonstrating that the City’s regulations are not a
constraint on development.
Inclusionary Housing Program
Inclusionary zoning programs are sometimes perceived as adding to the cost of housing by
requiring the market-rate units to subsidize the affordable units. This is an area of much
dispute, both in the Bay Area and nationally. There are as many positive aspects of inclusionary
programs as there are negative aspects. Within the last several years, several studies have
been published that specifically address the issue of who pays for inclusionary zoning. Some of
these studies assert that the costs associated with inclusionary programs are passed on to the
market priced homes, while other studies assert that in fact the cost is not borne by the end
users at all.
In an article published in the Hastings School of Law Review in 2002 which provided one of the
first comprehensive reviews of inclusionary zoning and its cost implications for jurisdictions in
California, Barbara Kautz, former Director of Community Development for the City of Dan
Mateo and now a lawyer with Goldfarb and Lipman, noted that:
           Most cities that have conducted economic analyses have concluded that, in the long
           run, most of the costs are borne by landowners [rather than market rate renters or
           buyers.] Initially, before land prices have had time to adjust, either the market-rate
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                                           V-45

          buyers or the developer pays, depending on whether the market allows the developer
          to increase his prices. If the developer cannot raise the market price for the non-
          inclusionary units or lower his total costs, or some combination, his profits will decline….
          To put this another way, builders will pay less for land because inclusionary zoning
          lowers their profits.2
Kautz asserts that developers will sell at the highest level they are able to sell at, meaning they
will set prices according to what the market will bear. If a unit’s market value is $500,000, it
will be sold for $500,000. Developers would not “add” more to the price to pay for the
affordable units that are required; if they could sell it at $550,000, for example, they would
have sold it for that price in the first place. Furthermore, if the market value of a unit is
$500,000, a buyer would not pay $550,000. And, if all a buyer can afford is $500,000, then the
buyer will not spend $550,000. Ultimately, the price for a unit is dependent on what the
market will bear; it is not directly affected by the affordability requirement.
However, since Redevelopment Agencies have been eliminated, and recent litigation has
severely restricted a city’s ability to require inclusionary housing, the issue is now on the back
burner until further clarity can be obtained. Lafayette implemented inclusionary requirements
in the redevelopment area for over a decade, and the intention to expand the program citywide
has been put on hold.
Secondary Living Units
Title 6, Chapter 6-5, Article 3 of the Municipal Code sets forth regulations for secondary living
units in single-family residential zoning districts. These regulations allow one second-unit per
parcel on single-family residential lots provided that certain conditions are met. These include
that the second unit:
     •    does not have more than two bedrooms
     •    is between 250 sq. ft. and 1,250 sq. ft. if attached to the primary residence and a maximum of
          750 sq. ft. if detached
     •    complies with all applicable building codes
     •    conforms to existing zoning, fire and other health and safety codes
     •    is owner occupied or that the primary unit is owner occupied
The second unit ordinance was updated in 2003 to conform to California legislation (Chapter
1150, Statutes of 1990) amended Government Code §65852.1 and 65852.2 relating to second
units.

Design Review
Lafayette adopted its Residential Design Review Guidelines on July 30, 1990. The stated goals
of the design review process are to 1) minimize the visibility of structures and other
improvements and to protect views to the hills, 2) retain natural features of the land, and 3)
protect vulnerable habitat and native vegetation. The guidelines set forth criteria for site and
building design and landscaping, with emphasis on hillside and ridgeline areas. The guidelines
do not represent a significant constraint to housing production in Lafayette. (See Appendix C)
In 2000 and 2002, the Lafayette City Council approved amendments to the zoning ordinance
requiring design review of structures exceeding 6,000 in gross floor area and structures
exceeding 17 feet in height. The stated intent of these regulations is to minimize loss of light
and privacy to neighbors, to minimize the out-of-scale appearance of large structures, to
maintain the existing character of established residential neighborhoods, and to permit
reasonable expansion of existing structures.
To streamline the development review process, the City also amended the zoning ordinance to
grant the zoning administrator authority to act on a majority of design review applications or
refer them to the Design Review Commission.
In 2014, the City adopted Design Guidelines for the Downtown. The Guidelines support the
Downtown Specific Plan and the General Plan, and outline the City’s design objectives for
downtown development. The purpose of the Guidelines is to maintain and enhance the City’s
informal, small-town character. The Guidelines hold values of the town, which include high
quality design and construction and sensitivity to character and place.
Condominium Conversions
The conversion of apartment units to condominium units was a major regional problem
identified by the Association of Bay Area Governments in the late 1970's. In response, the
Lafayette City Council adopted a Condominium Conversion Ordinance in 1979 requiring an
evaluation of each potential conversion in the City. The Ordinance provided that the City should
deny a conversion if the evaluation revealed that the conversion would be incompatible with
the goals and policies of the General Plan.
In 1985, the City Council adopted amendments to the Ordinance (Chapter 32 of Title 6 of the
Municipal Code) to allow a maximum of 12 such conversions annually. The provisions also
provide for a review of this limitation in order to prevent adverse effects on the City's existing
rental stock. The ordinance sets forth a general policy that units appropriate for conversion
should be higher-quality units, the loss of which would have the least effect on low- and
moderate-income tenants. Thus, while these restrictions place limitations on conversion of
rental units to condominiums, they have the beneficial effect of preserving the diversity of the
City's housing stock.

Development Fees
Table 38 lists Lafayette’s permit, development, and impact fees and provides a comparison of
fees for other cities in Contra Costa County. Based on a survey of other cities, Lafayette’s fee
levels for developers are midway in the range of fees charged by neighboring cities. Total
estimated fees for construction of a 2,500 square foot single-family home are $63,739. It
should be noted that over half of this total is from development fees imposed by agencies
outside the City’s control.
The City requires payment of different fees as a condition of development approval. Fees are
tied to the City's actual costs of providing necessary services such as project review and plan
checking fees or are set to recover the cost of needed infrastructure. These fees are reviewed
and adjusted periodically; Lafayette’s fees were last adjusted in July 2008. Planning fees are a
small percentage of the total fees charged so even if the fees are increased, they would not
constitute a deterrent to development.

Since fees, particularly development impact fees, are set to recover the cost of needed
infrastructure so that new development can proceed while maintaining desired public service
levels, it can be concluded that the City’s existing fee levels are appropriate and do not
constitute an undue governmental constraint on housing production. At the same time, the
City recognizes that development impact fees represent a substantial cost, particularly for
affordable housing development; therefore, the City has utilized funds to defray development
impact fee costs for affordable housing projects, such as in the Town Center mixed-use project,
on a case-by-case basis.
Town Center
The Town Center project contains 75 residential units, 15 of which are subject to affordability
covenants. The City and Redevelopment Agency offered the following assistance to the
developers of the Town Center project:

Analysis of Costs: Multifamily Residential Versus Single-Family Residential
The following section analyzes the difference in costs to develop both single family and
multifamily housing.
Multifamily Assumptions:
New 50 unit MFR development, assuming it is an infill development and therefore does not
require CEQA/fees and that it is creating or replacing 20,000 sq. ft. of impervious surface
requiring storm water quality control and impervious surface fees. There is no tree removal.
Grading will be extensive because project includes underground parking.

Based on the information shown above, the per-unit cost of planning and development fees for
single-family housing is more than twice the cost for multifamily housing. Expressed as a
percentage of the total development cost per unit, the estimated fees are nearly the same
percentage for single-family and multifamily:

Building and Municipal Codes
Building codes and enforcement do not constrain housing development in Lafayette. As the City
of Lafayette does not maintain its own Building Department, the Contra Costa County Building
Inspection Department provides building inspection and building code enforcement services to
the City. New construction is required to meet the requirements of the California Building Code
(CBC).
The County Building Department inspects housing units when an owner seeks a building permit
for additional construction or when a specific complaint relating to the health and safety of the
building occupants is received. In conformance with the CBC, the County requires new
construction to meet all building codes in effect today, but does not typically require previous
work that was completed with the necessary permits to comply CBC with current standards.
In 2004, the City created a code enforcement position to monitor compliance with the zoning
ordinance and other sections of the Municipal Code. The City’s code enforcement officer meets
regularly with the County’s code enforcement division to coordinate tasks. A summary of code
enforcement activities in 2013 is listed in Table 45. The City attempts to strike a balance
between preventing blighted conditions and not setting the standard unnecessarily high. The
code enforcement officer also serves as an information officer, providing the homeowners with
copies of the City’s regulations and advising them of ways to bring their properties into
compliance.

Processing Time
Lafayette’s zoning code stipulates residential types permitted by right or with a land use permit
in each of its residential zoning districts. There are ten single-family zoning districts in which
single family residences are allowed by right (R6, R10, R12, R15, R20, R40, R65, R100, LR5,
LR10). Discretionary review by the City is required for new homes over 17 feet in height or over
6,000 square feet in area and for homes within the hillside overlay district. To accelerate review
and approval, the zoning code grants the City’s staff zoning administrator authority to act on all
applications expect those within the environmentally-sensitive restricted ridgeline area. The
zoning administrator may forward an application to the Design Review Commission or Planning
Commission if she/he feels that it is warranted.
Duplexes and townhouses are permitted by right in two low-density multifamily zoning districts
(D1, MRT). Higher density multi family is permitted by right in eight districts (MRA, MRB, MRO,
MRP, C, C-1, SRB, RB). Design review approval is required – either by the City’s Zoning
Administrator, Design Review Commission or Planning Commission.
The time taken to process development applications affects housing costs, since interest on
loans must continue to be paid. The longer it takes for the development to be approved, the
higher the costs will be. The time to process residential developments does not constitute a
constraint in Lafayette. The following are estimated processing times for residential
development.

This table illustrates that the cumulative impact of various City-imposed reviews generally do
not negatively impact the time it takes to move projects through the approval process. In the
case of the Eden Housing – a 46-unit all affordable senior project – the processing time was
significantly shorter than other housing projects, illustrating the City’s commitment to priority
processing for affordable housing developments.
To further reduce the time taken to process and review discretionary applications, the City has
implemented the following measures:
1.        Providing all application forms online
2.        Conducting pre-application meetings between City staff and the property
          owner/developer at no cost to the applicant to discuss and resolve any problems
          associated with a proposed development
3.        Scheduling informal study sessions with the Design Review Commission for a reduced
          fee prior to the filing of an application
4.        Scheduling pre-application joint meetings of the City Council, Planning Commission and
          Design Review Commission for major projects at no cost to the applicant
5.        Bottom-loading the approval process by allowing the zoning administrator to handle
          almost all discretionary applications
In 1990, the City adopted residential design guidelines for single family homes. The application
of these guidelines is recommended particularly for homes in the hillside areas. There is no
separate permit required for complying with these guidelines. The City recently adopted design
guidelines in the Downtown, which includes multifamily.

Infrastructure Constraints
Despite the buildout figures mentioned earlier, there exist potentially significant constraints to
increased housing development related to the adequacy of the City’s infrastructure. These
include:
   The potable water system is in need of immediate and significant repair and upgrading.
    Leaks have been identified on several main water distribution lines and several others show
    signs of deterioration. This problem is being actively assessed by the East Bay Municipal
    Utility District, which owns and operates the system.
   Several areas have aging storm drains that are fast approaching being in need of repair.
    Over the long run, it is estimated that there are $15 million in storm drain repairs and
    upgrades based on City’s Drainage Master Plan.
   Traffic congestion on arterials is a significant and worsening problem. Through-traffic during
    peak hours and during school pick-up and drop-off times are the predominant sources of
    traffic congestion.      Given Lafayette’s topography, roads cannot be widened to
    accommodate additional traffic.
   Based on the City’s Pavement Management System update 61 streets within Lafayette are
    in need of repair and it will cost the City approximately $10 million to repair them.
   The majority of future residential development will occur downtown, since the City is nearly
    built out and the majority of remaining vacant and underdeveloped parcels permitting
    higher-density residential uses are located there. The Downtown is ill equipped to handle a
    large increase in population since it has few amenities such as parks, trails, and other
    recreation facilities.
   Financial limitations are acute, since Lafayette is one of the few “no or low property tax”
    cities in California. There is no surplus in the City’s General Fund to pay for infrastructure
    upgrades.
   The impacts of increasing enrollment in an already strained educational system that
    receives insufficient funding needs to be analyzed.
   The existing hilly topography and layout of the City creates the need to study several safety
    issues such as seismic constraints and emergency evacuation plans.
   Much of the City lies within the high fire hazard zone. The City’s hilly terrain causes
    response times for the fire department to exceed minimum standards and makes the
    physical fighting of a wild fire more difficult.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                              V-55

   The City has the lowest per capita police staffing in Contra Costa County and steeply
    increasing costs for police. The City contracts with the County Sheriff’s Office for Police
    services.
   Currently, the annual cost for maintaining the landscape and street lighting within the Core
    Area Maintenance District is $408,000 of which only $218,000 is funded by revenues from
    the District. The cost difference of $180,000 is being funded from the City’s General
    Fund. Unless a new funding source is realized, the added maintenance cost of any
    additional landscape and/or street lighting, or inflationary cost increase, must be funded by
    the City.
In an effort to address these issues, the City has put forth a number of ballot measures seeking
to increase revenue, all of which needed two-third supermajority to pass (numbers in
parenthesis indicate the percent that supported the measure):
       1998: Police Parcel Tax (45%)
       2004: Road Repair Ad Valorem Tax (58%)
       2006: Police Parcel Tax (61%)
       2007: Road Repair Parcel Tax (63%)
       2011: Road and Drain Parcel Tax (57%)
None of these measures was successful. In addition, the City placed an assessment district
increase before downtown property owners in 2007 to fund downtown maintenance, but the
proposal was rejected. In spite of these setbacks, the City's infrastructure problems have
received attention in recent years.
•   Replace and reconstruct storm drains in coordination with street reconstruction projects
    (ongoing).
•   Undertake pavement management efforts including reconstruction of Mt. Diablo Boulevard
    and other streets located in the project area
•   Underground utilities and replace streetlights with vintage lamp fixtures in the core
    downtown area (ongoing).
•   Improve traffic, parking and pedestrian circulation in the core business district (ongoing).
•   Improve meeting places and provide gathering points and activity areas for Lafayette's
    senior citizens (the City has commissioned a senior needs assessment study).
•   Complete construction of a new library in the downtown in 2012.

•    Implement and update the City's new Downtown Street Improvement Master Plan, which
     includes planting new and replacing deficient street trees, improving and irrigating street
     islands, and improving pedestrian walkways (ongoing)
•    Procure land and provide convenient off-street parking lots in the downtown area according
     to the City's master parking improvement plan.
Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing
The City’s Zoning Code does not define transitional housing or supportive housing as housing
types that are any different from traditional residential dwellings. Consistent with the State
and federal law, the City treats transitional and supportive housing as a residential use subject
only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same
zone. Pursuant to Program H-5.1.5 of the 2007-2014 Housing Element, the City processed a
zoning text amendment in September of 2014, specifically defining transitional and supportive
housing in the Zoning Code, noting that these are treated as regular residential uses subject
only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same
zone.
Constraints on Housing for People with Disabilities
Both the Federal Fair Housing Act (FHA) and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act
(FEHA) impose an affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable accommodations
(i.e., modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations and
practices when such accommodations “may be necessary to afford” disabled persons “an equal
opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.” This directive was further enhanced by adoption of
Senate Bill 520 in 2002 which amended Housing Element law to require local governments to
analyze constraints upon the development and maintenance of housing for persons with
disabilities and to remove those constraints or provide reasonable accommodations for housing
designed for persons with disabilities.
“Reasonable accommodation” is defined as the act of making existing facilities used by
residents readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, through the removal
of constraints within the zoning, permit and processing procedures.                   Reasonable
accommodation was originally meant to provide accommodation for housing for people who
needed accommodation on a personal basis. However, the State has taken an expanded view
and now considers reasonable accommodation to include land use, development
improvements, and accessibility, as well as processing and administration. An accommodation
is deemed “reasonable” as long as it does not impose “undue financial and administrative
burdens” on the jurisdiction or require a “fundamental alteration in the nature” of its zoning
scheme. In other words, the City must create a process to allow disabled persons or developers

constraints they assert exist.
In response to Senate Bill 520 and amended Housing Element law, a program was added to the
Housing Element of the 2002 General Plan. Program H-3.3.2 states,
        Program H-3.3.2: Housing for Persons with Disabilities: Analyze and determine whether there are
        constraints on the development, maintenance and improvement of housing intended for persons
        with disabilities, consistent with Senate Bill 520 enacted on January 1, 2002. The analysis will
        include an evaluation of existing land use controls, permit and processing procedures and
        building codes. If any constraints are found in these areas, the City will initiate actions to address
        these constraints, including removing the constraints or providing reasonable accommodation
        for housing intended for persons with disabilities.
One of the tasks in the Planning Department 2005 Work Plan was to implement housing
program H-3.3.2. Reasonable accommodation and modification is a process for making
residential facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities through the
removal of constraints within land use, zoning, permit and processing procedures. There
appear to be no overt constraints in the City’s codes or permit and processing procedures. The
City adopted the latest California Building Standards Uniform Building Code which includes
provisions for accessibility and the zoning ordinance allows the establishment of group homes
for up to six persons by right in single-family zoning districts. However, the City’s codes, as well
as permit and processing procedures, do not facilitate housing for persons with disabilities. The
zoning ordinance contains occupancy standards that apply specifically to unrelated adults and
not to families. Residential uses on the ground floor in Lafayette’s mixed use districts are not
allowed and parking requirements do not take into consideration a reduction in parking for
special needs housing. Although a variance or land use permit may be granted to overcome
these limitations, procedures to process these permits require public hearings and payment of
fees between $1,750 and $3,800.
Upon review of the City’s codes and permit and processing procedures and review of guidance
from the Attorney General and the California Department of Housing and Community
Development, the City determined that a reasonable accommodation ordinance is an
appropriate way to implement Housing Element program H-3.3.2 and the provisions of the FHA
and FEHA.
Several cities, including Fremont, Long Beach, Berkeley, San Jose, Santa Rosa, and Woodland,
have adopted reasonable accommodation ordinances. Staff reviewed these ordinances and
drafted an ordinance that would provide reasonable accommodation procedures for requests
for housing designed for occupancy by persons with disabilities seeking relief from land use and
zoning regulations and reasonable modification in a policy, practice, or procedure while
balancing the City’s interest in sustaining and enhancing residential neighborhoods.
As illustrated in the ordinance adopted by the City Council in March 2006, reasonable
accommodation requests are to be reviewed by the Zoning Administrator. If the request is de
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                                V-58

minimus in nature, the Zoning Administrator may issue a reasonable accommodation permit.
Requests for reasonable accommodation may include yard encroachments for ramps and other
accessibility improvements, hardscape additions that result in noncompliance with required
landscaping or open space provisions, and reduced parking where the disability clearly limits
the number of persons operating vehicles. Prior to approving a reasonable accommodation
request, the Zoning Administrator must make findings related to special need, potential impact
on surrounding uses, and whether the requested modification would require a fundamental
alteration in the nature or effect of the city’s land use and zoning ordinances, programs or
policies.
Although a reasonable accommodation request could not include exemption from the
requirement for a land use permit if one was required, an applicant could request
accommodation in completing application forms or request an alternate time for a public
hearing. For example, a disabled person wanting to establish a group home for more than six
disabled persons must obtain use permit approval by the Planning Commission. If the applicant
cannot drive and their caregiver cannot drive after dark, the applicant cannot request
exemption from the land use permit process, but the applicant can request transportation to
the evening meeting or request that the meeting occur before it gets dark so the caregiver can
drive them.
Reasonable accommodation was originally meant to provide accommodation for housing for
people who needed accommodation on a personal basis. To address the new expanded view,
section 6-3401, Purpose, is revised as follows, “by providing reasonable accommodation in the
application of its land use and zoning regulations and reasonable modification in a policy,
practice, or procedure for housing designed for occupancy by qualified persons with disabilities
seeking fair access to housing.”
Conclusions
The City identified that prior requirements that multifamily housing obtain a use permit in the
Downtown area, the upper floor setback requirements in the C, C-1 and MRO districts and the
current parking code were constraints to housing development, especially housing that is
affordable. Accordingly, the prior Element contained the following programs to address these
constraints:
    Program H-2.4.2: Multifamily Housing Development: Amend the Zoning Ordinance to allow
    the development of multifamily housing as of right in areas where such development now
    requires a discretionary land use permit. Continue to require design review to ensure that
    developments are compatible with surrounding uses.
    Status in 2014: Housing is now allowed by right in the downtown zoning districts.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                           V-59

   Program H-5.1.5: Review and Revise the Zoning Ordinance. Review the Zoning Ordinance
   and consider revisions to the following governmental constraints or potential constraints on
   the development of housing:
       a) Consider the strict regulation of the conversion of existing multiple family residential
           units in the C, C-1, SRB, and RB Zoning Districts.
       b) Include definitions for the following. Ensure that zoning districts where these uses
           are allowed clearly identify such uses.
                    group homes
                    emergency shelters
                    residential care facilities
                    senior housing
                    foster care home
                    family care home
                    transitional housing
                    supportive housing
                    Single-Room Occupancy units
       c) Ensure that the definition of “family” is consistent with State and federal law.
       d) Add language to the Code that specifically indicates that transitional housing and
       supportive housing are residential uses subject only to those restrictions that apply to
       other residential uses of the same type in the same zone.
   Status in 2014: Conversion of housing to nonresidential use in the downtown requires a
   land use permit. The Zoning Code has been updated to include definitions for group homes,
   emergency shelters, residential care facilities, senior housing, foster care home, family care
   home, transitional housing, and supportive housing. The Code also imposes the same
   restrictions to transitional and supportive housing that apply to other residential uses of the
   same type in the same zone.
       Program H-5.1.6: Downtown Specific Plan Implementation. Following the Downtown
       Specific Plan adoption, revise the zoning ordinance to address the following constraints
       on the development of housing:
           Parking
           Develop and establish measures such as allowing tandem spaces, car lifts and other
           creative ways to accommodate required parking for developments.
           Upper story setback requirements in the C, C-1 and MRO districts
           Develop design guidelines that would allow the City to reduce or eliminate the third
           story setback requirements in the C, C-1 and MRO districts if appropriate findings
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                              V-60

             such as compatibility with adjacent development, view and solar protection can be
             met. As an alternative, develop a set of criteria for waiving the setback requirements
             for irregular lots in the Downtown.
In addition, the City identified that current residential development requirements – including
parking and density – were an impediment to the development of senior housing, especially
that which is affordable, since senior housing typically has smaller units and less parking needs.
Accordingly, the City Council approved the inclusion of the following program in the prior
Element:
Status in 2014: The City is in the process of updating the Parking Ordinance and Downtown
Zoning Districts consistent with the General Plan, Downtown Specific Plan, and Housing
Element. These are expected to be complete by June of 2015.
    Program H-3.2.1: Senior Housing Overlay: Consider creating a Senior Housing Overlay
    Zoning District. Include criteria that protect neighborhood character and assure good
    design, as well as flexible parking, setback and other requirements, where applicable.
Status in 2014: The City Council approved the Senior Housing Overlay Ordinance in 2010.
Because the development of individual, small infill lots is difficult, given topographical
challenges as well as development standards imposed by the City to ensure compatibility with
surrounding neighborhoods, the prior Housing Element previously included the following
program:
        Program H-2.8.6: Lot Consolidation and Redevelopment of Non-Vacant Sites: Where
        appropriate and available, provide assistance to developers of residential projects to
        redevelop non-vacant sites. The program may include incentives for lot consolidation for
        affordable housing purposes such as:
        1. Streamlined permitting process, including scheduling joint meetings with City Boards
        2. Priority processing of applications
        3. Financial assistance from the Redevelopment Agency to pay the processing fees for
             lot consolidations and/or purchase and consolidate small and odd-shaped lots
        4. Technical assistance to property owners and developers including providing assessor
             parcel data, posting the inventory on the City’s web site, offering tours of the
             Downtown to prospective developers and scheduling pre-application meetings free
             of charge to explain the City’s development standards and review process
        5. Fee deferrals to the Certificate of Occupancy phase of the project
        The development incentives contained within this section shall encourage the effective
        utilization and consolidation of parcels to encourage more viable development
        opportunities. The City will monitor the effectiveness of these incentives on an annual
        basis and revise as needed.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                V-61

Status in 2014: For larger projects involving lot consolidation and redevelopment of non-vacant
sites, the City holds joint pre-application meetings of the City Council, Planning Commission and
Design Review Commission to provide early input to developers. The inventory is posted on the
City’s web site; tours and preapplication meetings are held free of charge. For the Woodbury
project, the City Council deferred collection of impact fees to the Certificate of Occupancy
stage.
Finally, to ensure that there is always a supply of sites in the inventory to meet the City’s
regional housing needs inventory, the following program has been added:
    Program H-2.4.3: RHNA Monitoring Program: Maintain the residential sites inventory that
    can accommodate the City’s regional housing needs allocation of 361 units. Update the
    inventory annually to monitor the consumption of residential and mixed use properties. If
    sites in the inventory are developed for non-housing purposes, new sites will be added to the
    inventory to ensure the City’s ongoing compliance with the “no net loss” provisions of
    Housing Element Law. Post the Housing Element sites inventory on the City’s website as a
    tool for developers, and provide as a handout at the public counter.
    Status in 2014: The City monitors the site inventory on an annual basis to ensure ongoing
    compliance.

NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT
Nongovernmental constraints include a variety of factors that negatively impact "the
maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels, including the
availability of financing, the price of land, and the cost of construction" {65583(a)(5)}. Clearly,
the potential list of all constraints on the development could be quite long, and might include
information on national economic conditions and regional geology. However, the analysis in
this Housing Element will focus on nongovernmental constraints that significantly impact the
provision of housing in the community.
Financing Availability
The availability of financing can sometimes constrain the development or conservation of
housing. Until the end of 2008, home mortgage credit was readily available at attractive rates
throughout the U.S. The beneficial effects of lower mortgage interest rates on homeownership
affordability are profound. For example, with mortgage interest rates at 4%, and assuming a
20% down payment, a family with an annual income of $70,000 can qualify to purchase a
$450,000 home. As interest rates increase, however, the same income has declining purchasing
power: for example, at an interest rate of 6%, that household can qualify to purchase a
$375,000 home. Mortgage interest rates clearly have an influence on homebuyers, especially
at the lower incomes. Qualifying for a loan, moreover, is significantly more difficult than during
the years of subprime lending.
A related issue is the financing available for the construction of new housing development.
According to the Statewide Housing Plan, land developers purchase raw land, entitle and
subdivide it, and, sometimes, depending on the developer and market, install on-site services
(e.g., streets, sewers, drainage) and pay for off-site improvements. These activities are
generally carried out two to five years ahead of unit construction. The long lead times and high
costs associated with these activities create a considerable risk for the developer.
The State notes that the high levels of risk associated with land development make it difficult
for land developers to find investors and financing. As a result, potential land investors typically
require large premiums over and above other types of real estate investments. Lenders who
make land development loans impose lower loan-to-value-ratios, charge higher rates, and/or
require the loan to be a recourse loan. If other, lower-risk lending opportunities are available,
lenders may eschew land development loans altogether.
Construction loans for new housing are difficult to secure in the current market. In past years,
lenders would provide up to 80 percent of the cost of new construction (loan to value ratio). In
recent years, due to market conditions and government regulations, banks require larger
investments by the builder.
Due to Federal and state budget cuts, affordable housing developers have had a much harder
time securing funding. Since 2009, the Federal Government has cut programs such as
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                V-63
Community Development Block Grants, HOME, and HOPE VI funding by 27-50%, according to
ABAG. Traditionally, these programs have been a large source of affordable housing funds. In
addition to Federal cuts, the State dissolved Redevelopment agencies in 2012, leaving the City
of Lafayette and other jurisdictions in the County with a loss of millions in funds for affordable
housing. However, Low Income Housing Tax Credits still provide an important source of
funding, so it is important for jurisdictions to consider which sites are eligible for affordable
housing development.
The foreclosure crisis hit the Bay Area hard, some areas more than others. At the beginning of
2009, there were about 58 units in pre-foreclosure, foreclosure, or in auctions in the City of
Lafayette according to RealtyTrac out of a total 9,213 units, or 0.6%. As of the first quarter of
2014, there were 21 properties were in some stage of foreclosure (default, auction or bank
owned) while the number of homes listed for sale on RealtyTrac at that time was 19. Although
home affordability has been improving as a result of foreclosures on the market, building
permits, starts and sales continue to decline because prospective homebuyers either lack
access to credit or the confidence to buy.
Development Costs
Construction Cost
Escalating land prices and construction costs due to a high demand for housing are major
contributors to the increasing cost of housing in the Bay Area. A major impediment to the
production of more housing is the cost of construction, which involves two factors: the cost of
materials, and the cost of labor. However, the cost of construction varies with the type of new
housing and the way it is built. An affordable project constructed in Lafayette illustrates the
real-world implications of high construction costs. This 46-unit development cost about $22
million, which translates to about $264,000 per unit for construction costs alone. Soft costs
were an additional $130,000 per unit, and land costs were about $82,000 per unit. All told, the
per-unit development costs total about $475,000 per unit.
Cost of Land
The cost of land varies considerably between and within jurisdictions. Market factors,
especially the desirability of the location, play an important role in setting property values.
Recent projects in Lafayette translate into $100 to $150 per square foot.
Overall Construction Cost
All of these factors above serve to impact the overall cost to produce housing, including
affordable housing. Developer overhead and indirect costs, such as project management,
design, marketing and taxes, typically adds about 10% to 15% of total costs. Financing of the
construction project typically represents another 15% of the total costs. As noted in the
affordable housing project example above, the total cost per unit can run more than $475,000,
which equals more than $530 per square foot of building space.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                               V-64
ENERGY CONSERVATION, CLIMATE CHANGE, AND SUSTAINABILITY
The City encourages energy conservation in residential projects. The building orientation,
street layout, lot design, landscaping, and street tree configuration of all residential projects are
reviewed in order to maximize solar access and energy conservation. Residential structures
must meet the requirements of Title 24 relating to energy conservation features of the
California Building Code.
The City adopted its Environmental Strategy in November 2006 and amended it in 2011. Since
then, staff, the Environmental Strategy Task Force, and other citizen volunteers have been
implementing this sustainability policy for the community. Included in this effort has been the
discussion of green building guidelines. Most Bay Area cities have implemented or are in the
process of developing green building programs; however, the City intends to establish a
voluntary green building program that complements CalGreen, the State’s Green Building Code.
Having a consistent standard throughout the region will make green programs easier to accept
by the development and construction community.
The City adopted the following mission statement and guiding principles related to its
environmental efforts:
    “The City of Lafayette is committed to developing and implementing environmental policies
    and programs that will enable the City and its residents to meet their present needs without
    sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their needs.”
The City recognizes that to achieve its commitment it requires the effort of individual
community members and that it has an important role in educating its citizens and acting as a
model. In fulfilling its commitment, the City of Lafayette should be guided by the following
principles:
    1. The importance of environmental sustainability should be considered in City policy and
        decisions.
    2. The protection, preservation and restoration of the natural environment are high
        priorities of the City.
    3. Broad community cooperation among the City government, businesses, residents,
        community organizations, and schools and other service providers is essential to
        effective community governance.
    4. Community awareness, responsibility, participation and education are key elements of
        an environmentally sustainable community.
    5. Environmental quality, economic health and social equity are related.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                 V-65

     6. The City recognizes that it is part of a wider community and that local environmental
         issues cannot be separated from their broader context.
Initially utilizing a voluntary guideline program has a number of benefits. It provides a period of
time for public education and for staff to get familiar with green building techniques. It also
allows time to create a pool of qualified reviewers, either our staff with training or outside
certified consultants. Having this pool is one of the barriers cities faced moving forward with
mandatory programs; there are not enough people trained to check plans for compliance with
Build It Green or LEED standards. Depending on the effectiveness of a voluntary program and
any identified obstacles, the City could gradually phase-in mandatory green building
requirements.
In addition to the voluntary green building program, the City currently recognizes outstanding
efforts that contribute to a more sustainable community and help the City achieve its
environmental goals, the Environmental Task Force and City Council the annual Lafayette
Awards of Environmental Excellence, more commonly known as the Lafayette Green Awards.
Awards are chosen across five different categories: residents, local businesses, schools,
community organizations, and green building. The Lafayette Green Awards have been
presented annually since 2007.
ICLEI, Local Governments for Sustainability (of which Lafayette is a member), is an international
association of local governments as well as national and regional local government
organizations that have made a commitment to sustainable development. Over 1,000 cities,
towns, counties, and their associations worldwide comprise ICLEI's growing membership. ICLEI
works with these and hundreds of other local governments through international performance-
based, results-oriented campaigns and programs.
ICLEI is attempting to standardize the work being done by cities and counties to establish
greenhouse gas emission baselines and develop action plans for reducing these emissions. In
partnership with ICLEI, Pacific Gas & Electric, and the Association of Bay Area Governments, the
City prepared a 2005 inventory of municipal greenhouse gas emissions. An updated inventory
was conducted for 2010, which expanded to include community-wide emissions. The
greenhouse gas emissions inventories are intended to be utilized as a baseline for future
climate action planning projects, such as the City’s Environmental Action Plan.
This work has taken on more importance since the passage of AB32 with its goal to reduce the
state’s greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels by 2010 (11% reduction), 1990 levels by 2020
(25% reduction), and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. These reductions will be accomplished
through an enforceable state-wide cap on state-wide emissions that will be phased in starting
in 2012. To implement the cap, AB32 directs the California Air Resources Board to develop
appropriate regulations and establish a mandatory reporting system to track and monitor
emission levels. Additionally, AB32 requires that the Board use the following principles to
implement the cap:
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                               V-66

    Distribute benefits and costs equitably
    Ensure that there are no direct, indirect, or cumulative increases in air pollution in local
     communities
    Protect entities that have reduced their emissions through actions prior to this regulatory mandate
    Allow for coordination with other states and countries
The second and third bullets are relevant to cities. There is a sense that at some point – 5
years, 10 years from now – the State will impose some level of mandatory requirements on
cities to reduce emissions at the local level. This could be through a mandatory sustainability
element of general plans, adopted emission reduction actions plans, and/or green building
ordinances. The third bullet is important because the cities that have their general plan
elements, action plans, green building ordinances, or other emission reduction programs in
place before regulations take effect are in better positions.
In addition to AB32, Executive Order S-3-05, created a goal to reduce GHG emissions to 1990
level by 2020 and to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.
The City of Lafayette’s General Plan encourages growth and a new direction for the Downtown,
while preserving and enhancing the center of Lafayette as a place where residents, employees,
and visitors can congregate, take part in civic activities, and enjoy the ambiance of small town
life. To ensure a vibrant Downtown that is the community’s commercial, civic, and cultural
center, the City encourages a mix of uses, creating a pedestrian-oriented environment,
improving the appearance and function of the commercial areas, promoting multi-family
residential uses and mixed-use development, and preserving historic sites and structures. The
Downtown Specific Plan promotes sustainability through the development of downtown public
parking, transportation options, multifamily housing, retail and employment opportunities,
linked pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, and enhancement of creeks and parks.
Plans for the Downtown area promote creation of distinct, convenient, attractive, and safe
commercial areas that serve and complement the existing residential neighborhoods
throughout the rest of the city. Lafayette strives to establish the Downtown Core as the center
of commercial and cultural life, with a mix of retail, office, commercial, and residential uses to
meet all needs of the community and visitors. The City envisions a revitalized West End
Commercial Area with a mix of office and office-related service activities, including an emphasis
on restaurants, business services, office support activities, and housing. Plans to improve the
appearance and function of the East End Commercial Area involve consolidation and
redevelopment of under-performing properties, and creation of new employment that will help
restore the City’s jobs and housing balance.
As Downtown Lafayette continues to evolve, new retail, residential and commercial projects
are being introduced. Lafayette Mercantile, a 55,000 square foot mixed-use retail and office
building at the corner of Mount Diablo Boulevard and Lafayette Circle, was completed in early
2008. The Veteran’s Memorial Building, an award-winning 10,000 square foot flexible-use
facility, opened its doors in 2005. Eden Housing (Belle Terre), a 45-unit affordable senior

housing project was completed in late 2013. Marquis Lafayette, a 23-unit townhome project
located at Mount Diablo Boulevard and Pleasant Hill Road was completed in late 2013. Merrill
Gardens, a 72 unit senior housing project with a 17-bed memory care facility and ~6,000 sq. ft.
in retail space, is in construction and is expected to open in October of 2014. In addition,
Lafayette will continue to encourage the construction of higher density housing in its
downtown consistent with the goals of the General Plan. Recently-approved applications
include The Woodbury, a 56-unit condominium project, Town Center, a 69 unit residential
project, and Lafayette Park Terrace, an 18-unit condominium project.
Through the application of transit-oriented, mixed-use policies, Downtown Lafayette will
address regional growth issues, creating a more sustainable jobs/housing balance, encouraging
transit use, and improving livability. Downtown Lafayette will be vibrant, complete community
that will attract residents and visitors by its walkability, access to employment and educational
opportunities, as well as the natural beauty and recreational opportunities within a half mile of
the BART Station.
In order to fully realize its vision for Downtown, the City completed the Downtown Specific
Plan, a comprehensive vision and specific plan for housing and commerce that will guide the
direction of development in the Priority Development Area for the next 20 years. The City was
awarded a $150,000 Station Area Planning grant from the Metropolitan Transportation
Commission and Association of Bay Area Governments for the environmental review of the
plan. Since its adoption in 2012, the City has begun implementing its programs and policies,
including adopting Downtown Design Guidelines and updating the parking regulations, land use
definitions, zoning standards, and sign regulations.
In addition, in December 2007, the City was awarded a $75,000 climate protection planning
grant from the Bay Area Air Quality District. The purpose of the grant is to incorporate climate
protection modeling as part of the land use and circulation alternative analyses. The City is in
the process of developing its Environmental Action Plan which addresses climate protection.
As a companion effort to the Downtown Strategy, the Downtown also was designated a Priority
Development Area by the Association of Bay Area Governments. Priority Development Areas
(PDAs) are locally-identified, infill development opportunity areas within existing communities.
They are generally areas of at least 100 acres where there is local commitment to developing
more housing along with amenities and services to meet the day-to-day needs of residents in a
pedestrian-friendly environment served by transit. To be eligible to become a PDA, an area had
to be within an existing community, near existing or planned fixed transit or served by
comparable bus service, and planned for more housing.
A central aspect of this Priority Development Area is to utilize and enhance existing transit
infrastructure by improving local connections to the BART Station and County Connection bus
routes. The Walkways Master Plan provides Lafayette with a system of walkways for safe and
efficient pedestrian movement throughout the city, and connects residential areas with the
downtown, public transportation, schools, community amenities, parks, City and regional trail
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                             V-68
systems. The Bikeways Master Plan includes a citywide system of bike lanes, bike routes, bike
paths, bicycle parking and other facilities to allow for safe, efficient, and convenient bicycle
travel within Lafayette and connections to regional destinations.
Residents, employees, and visitors to the Downtown area can also take advantage of nearby
open spaces. These include Briones Regional Park, which is an easy walk or bicycle ride from
BART, and the Lafayette Reservoir, which offers paddleboats, playgrounds, miles of walking
paths, and 550-acres of unspoiled natural oak woodland. The Trails Master Plan will enhance
Lafayette’s existing network of over sixteen miles of community trails and will develop and
maintain new trail opportunities. Trails link Lafayette’s neighborhoods and serve as feeders to
regional trail networks and parks, such as the Lafayette-Moraga Trail, the Lafayette Reservoir,
Briones Regional Park and Las Trampas Regional Park.
Providing educational opportunities for all residents remains a priority of the City, both to
create and sustain long term demand for housing, and to serve as a point of pride in the
community. The Lafayette Library and Learning Center, at the corner of Mount Diablo
Boulevard and First Street, was completed in 2009 and has served as a place where all
generations can gather for enriched intellectual and cultural experiences. The Lafayette
Community Garden and Outdoor Learning Center, located near the Lafayette Reservoir, offers
community members educational workshops, as well as opportunities to grow their own food.
Both are within easy walking distance of downtown residents, and provide a multitude of
educational and cultural activities to the region.

INVENTORY OF HOUSING SITES METHODOLOGY
In order to accurately assess the capacity for housing development – especially multifamily
housing – in the City of Lafayette, staff conducted an extensive site-by-site review of parcels
located in the Downtown area, to ascertain current development trends and potential for
future development. A number of steps were taken to ensure that each identified site could
realistically be developed or redeveloped within the planning period:
1.       Review of adjacent land uses to assess compatibility with existing uses. Sites that are
         listed in the inventory are generally adjacent to existing residential uses, or in areas
         where residential uses should be encouraged.
2.       Analysis of adjacency of services. Distances to services (grocery and drug stores, BART,
         bus service) were calculated. Also analyzed was the availability of infrastructure. The
         City’s policy is to ensure that housing, especially multifamily affordable, has proximity to
         services in order to be competitive for affordable housing funding.
3.       Calculation of reasonable building footprint based on unusual or difficult topography.
         Each site was assessed for topographical constraints and opportunities wherein changes
         in topography could be used to add an additional storey without increasing the mass of
         development. Realistic capacities were reduced if sites possessed challenging terrain.
4.       Assessment of the parcel’s past history and current status. Staff researched the sites to
         determine whether active businesses had expiring leases, whether the site contained
         abandoned or dilapidated buildings, etc. Further, sites were reviewed to determine
         whether current uses were appropriate for redevelopment and/or relocation.
5.       Discussion of owner interest in selling or developing the parcels. The City has had
         extensive discussions about potential development with a wide variety of property
         owners of several sites. The inventory notes these discussions where applicable.
6.       Analysis of the feasibility of lot consolidation. While the Element generally requires lot
         consolidation in order to achieve large enough sites to support development, the City
         has an established track record of lot consolidation for a wide variety of projects.
         Lafayette’s downtown -- in which all services such as grocery and drug stores, civic and
         cultural facilities and the BART station are located -- is almost entirely built out. Recent
         examples of successful lot consolidation efforts include (1) the Lafayette Mercantile
         project in which five parcels under different ownership (including two former gas
         stations) were purchased by the developer for a mixed use project, (2) The Woodbury
         project in which an operating motel and a newly opened restaurant under separate
         ownership were purchased for a 56-unit condominium project and (3) the Merrill
         Gardens project in which the housing developer consolidated six parcels under two
         separate owners. These parcels when purchased contained successful businesses
         including a restaurant and a garden supply store.
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                  V-70

7.     Application of proposed Downtown Specific Plan requirements (which directs retail on
       the ground floor along Mt. Diablo frontage in the Downtown Core with housing above
       or behind). The inventory classifies development on sites that front Mt. Diablo Blvd. as
       mixed use (housing over commercial) and development on sites away from Mt. Diablo
       Blvd. as all-housing. The yield per site was calculated based on these designations, and
       therefore are less than were these sites devoted to all-housing.
8.     Age of structures. The majority of the structures on the identified sites were built
       between the 1930s and 1970. Many of them are in need of upgrades to meet current
       building codes. While some of the buildings on the identified sites house operating
       businesses, parcels with operating businesses have recently been acquired and
       consolidated for larger developments such as The Woodbury and Lafayette Mercantile.
       Buildings built prior to 1950 (>60 years old) are identified in Appendix C.
9.     Development trends. Of the nine major development applications or study sessions
       that the City considered in the Downtown between 2006 and 2013, seven (77%) were
       for multifamily residential projects (listed in Item 10, below) and only two for
       commercial projects – Lafayette Mercantile and the Branagh office building. This
       demonstrates that even though sites may allow commercial or residential, the majority
       have been developed as residential in recent years. Also during this period, land in the
       Downtown was purchased by residential developers SRM/Merrill Gardens, Eden
       Housing and The Woodbury. The City has therefore seen an increased demand for
       housing sites in the Downtown. We expect this trend to continue for the rest of the
       planning period for the following reasons:
       (a) Downtown revitalization. Efforts of the City and former Redevelopment Agency in
           the last decade have made Downtown Lafayette a desirable place in which to live.
           Today, in addition to the BART station, Downtown Lafayette has a state-of-the-art
           library and learning center which offers great amenities for children and seniors,
           several new family restaurants, four major grocery stores, and an improved
           pedestrian and bikeway system.
       (b) Lafayette’s excellent schools. One elementary school is located in the Downtown
           and the middle school is within walking distance.
       (c) City commitment to encourage housing in the Downtown. This is evidenced by the
           policies in this chapter, the increased densities that will be allowed through the
           senior housing overlay district, the City’s adopted density bonus guidelines and the
           requirement of the former Redevelopment Agency that each housing project set
           aside at least 15% of the units for households of very low, lower and moderate
           incomes.
       (d) Downtown Specific Plan. The draft Plan contains goals to promote the development
           of housing in the Downtown including:
HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                            V-71

             i.   Allow housing by right in the Downtown
             ii. Review and update existing development standards to ensure that the distinct
                  character of the Downtown residential neighborhoods is preserved, existing
                  multifamily development is protected, and new multifamily development is
                  encouraged.
             iii. Review and update current parking codes
             iv. Encourage sustainable development and the location of housing close to transit
                  and services
    (e) The availability of funds to assist affordable housing projects.
10.     Entitled projects/study sessions. There are sites that have already been entitled for
        housing projects and others for which study sessions have been held to review proposed
        multifamily projects. As noted in #9 above, these are sites that could have been
        developed either with commercial or with housing, yet were developed for housing.
        They include:

By including each of these factors, the inventory’s resulting capacity is conservative; for
example, a site may have a calculated capacity of 30 dwelling units but because of the site’s
topography or location on Mt. Diablo Blvd., its realistic capacity is only 15 units. Although
nothing in the inventory specifically prevents a site from being developed closer to its
calculated capacity, the City has intentionally adopted a conservative stance to ensure that
there is adequate capacity for the inventory, including housing that is affordable. It has been,
and continues to be, the City’s policy to focus housing, especially multifamily of all kinds, in the
Downtown to preserve hillsides and the outlying areas’ semi-rural character. Focusing housing
on the Downtown area further improves developers’ ability to be competitive for dwindling
housing resources at the State and federal level, since proximity to services continues to be a
significant criterion for funding applications of all types.
Additionally, only those sites larger than one acre were identified as potentially affordable sites,
since the State’s default density for multifamily and affordable in Lafayette is 20 units to the
acre. Given all of these factors, the overall realistic inventory of sites is calculated at 846 units,
of which more than half (437 units) can be counted as lower income. The following table
summarizes the inventory calculations:

PRESERVATION OF UNITS AT RISK OF CONVERSION TO MARKET RATE
There is one development in Lafayette that is potentially at risk of conversion to market rate
within the next ten years: Chateau Lafayette, with 66 Section 8 units (one manager unit). This
independent living development is owned and managed by the Lafayette Senior Housing
Association, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. In addition to Section 8, funding assistance was provided by
the State of California. Currently, the expiration date for HUD assistance is listed as 8/28/18.
Because this development is operated by a nonprofit, its risk for conversion to market rate is
low. In addition, 15 units at the Town Center development, which were financed by tax credits,
will expire in 2016; however, the affordability covenants in the development agreement do not
expire until 2031.
Cost Analysis of Preservation
Given the housing market in the Bay Area, recent significant increases in rental rates, and
owners foreclosed throughout the Bay Area looking for rental housing, conversion to market
rates is likely to be an attractive option for owners of at-risk properties. Since the Chateau
Lafayette project is considered low-risk because the owner is a nonprofit with an interest in
preserving its units’ affordability for its residents, the likelihood of conversion is minimal.
However, the Tax credit project’s future is much less certain.
The cost of producing an affordable unit to replace a lost unit is extremely high. The City
assisted in the development of a 46-unit independent senior project, which was undertaken by
Eden Housing. This project showed the cost to develop each unit at approximately $475,000.
Translated to Chateau Lafayette, the cost to replace the existing Section 8 property would be
more than $31 million. In contrast, the cost to preserve the development could be more on the
order of $100,000 per unit in subsidy, or $6.6 million overall. For the Town Center project, the
cost to replace the 15 units could be as high as $8 million, whereas the cost to preserve them
could be approximately $1.5 million.
Preservation of at risk units can be accomplished in several ways, including acquisition of the
property by qualified nonprofit housing corporations, local housing authorities, or other
organizations that are committed to long-term affordable housing. As part of the financing of
this type of acquisition, long-term regulatory restrictions are recorded against the property,
removing the risk of conversion.
Resources for Preservation
The City will actively work with HUD, the owner, and other interested parties to extend
affordability restrictions to preserve the affordability, utilizing state or federal programs for any
units that are at risk of conversion to market rate in the future. Priority of any City housing
resources will be given to preserve at risk units as needed. The following is a partial list of
qualified entities that can assist the City in preserving these units; they represent those
organizations located in, or operating in, Northern California.

              Program H-1.4.1: Condominium Conversions: Consider amendments to the
              existing condominium conversion regulations (Chapter 32 of Title 6 of the
              Municipal Code). Amendments that would be considered include exemption of
              limited equity residential cooperatives that provide long-term affordability for
              the units; requirement of relocation assistance by the proponent when units are
              converted; and requirement of first right of refusal by occupants. Where there
              are existing affordable units, require conversion projects to retain the same
              number of affordable units when they convert to ownership. Periodically review
              the provisions of the Condominium Conversion Ordinance to ensure that it
              adequately protects the existing rental housing stock. Conversions will require
              that 15% of the units be set aside for affordable housing.

              Program H-3.1.5: Establish an Inclusionary Housing Ordinance: Complete an
              Inclusionary Housing Ordinance to require developers of residential
              developments outside the Redevelopment Area to provide up to 10% of their
              units at rents or purchase prices affordable to very-low to moderate income
              households. Continue to enforce the 15% inclusionary requirement that is
              already in place within the Redevelopment Area. The ordinance will include the
              implementation of an in-lieu fee for certain housing developments. The funds
              collected will be used to facilitate the development of additional affordable
              housing units.
              As part of this program, the City will consider development of a list of incentives
              for providing mandated units. Preliminary discussions have included reduced
              finishes in BMR units, the payment of in-lieu fees rather than the building of
              units, customized analyses to determine in-lieu fees, etc. In addition, the City
              will review the potential constraints on the cost and supply of housing again, as
              the ordinance is finalized, to ensure that no undue impacts occur given the
              conditions of the housing market at that time.

              use in the General Commercial Zoning District 1 (Zoning Map symbol C-1),
              Require that the Uniform Housing Code (UHC) Space and Occupancy Standards
              be applied to shelters pursuant to Health and Safety Code §50807. Design
              Review approval shall also be required prior to issuance of a building permit.
              Any shelter shall be limited in size to 30 or fewer beds, consistent with the
              unmet needs shown in the bi-annual homeless count conducted by the County.
              In addition, any shelter developer must submit a management plan for the
              facility’s operation. The City commits to ensuring that shelters will be subjected
              to the same development standards that apply to other allowed uses within

              This use would be allowed by right and without a use permit in the C-1 Zoning
              District. Design review would apply to issues such as lighting, fencing, and
              building design where new construction is involved. Flexible parking requirements
              would apply to such facilities, which would allow reduced parking requirements

                                              Adopted in entirety by Resolution 2009-021 on May 11, 2009
SECTION I: INTRODUCTION
PURPOSE
Growth Management is a concept that allows for a rate of growth that can be supported by the
City's infrastructure and does not diminish the community's quality of life and identity. . The
function of the Growth Management Element is to define the geographical extent of urban
growth and manage the impacts of that growth by virtue of the Urban Limit Line. This element
of the General Plan establishes policies and standards for traffic levels of service and
performance standards for fire, police, parks, sanitary facilities, water and flood control that
provides a long-range method of matching the demand for public facilities generated by new
development with plans, capital improvements and development mitigation programs.
The goals, policies and programs in this section are consistent with the requirements of Contra
Costa’s Transportation Sales Tax Expenditure Plan (“Measure J”) approved by Contra Costa
County Voters in 2004 and with Government Code §65303.
BACKGROUND
The Measure J Growth Management Program, adopted by voters of Contra Costa County in
November 2004, requires each local jurisdiction to meet the following six requirements:
         Adopt a development mitigation program;
         Address Housing Options;

Measure J (2004) is a 25-year extension of the previous Measure C Contra Costa Transportation
Improvement and Growth Management Program approved by the voters in 1988.
Both programs include a ½ percent tax on transportation use and retail transactions intended to
address existing major regional transportation problems. The Growth Management component is

intended to assure that future residential business and commercial growth pays for the facilities
required to meet the demands resulting from that growth.
Compliance with the Growth Management Program is linked to receipt of Local Street
Maintenance and Improvement funds and Transportation for Livable Community funds from the
Transportation Authority. The Growth Management Program defined by the original Ordinance
88-01 continues in effect along with its linkage to Local Street maintenance and improvement
funds through March 31, 2009. Beginning on April 1, 2009, the Measure J Growth Management
Program requirements take effect.
Measure J eliminates the previous Measure C mandate for local performance standards and
level-of-service standards for non-regional routes. Lafayette elects to maintain these standards
as part of this Element. Measure J also adds the requirement for adoption of a voter-approved
Urban Limit Line.
INTENT
By updating this Element, Lafayette intends to establish a comprehensive, long-range program
that will match the demands for multi-modal transportation facilities and services generated by
new development with plans, capital improvement programs and development mitigation
programs. The Urban Limit Line is intended to promote compact urban development patterns
and limits the extension of infrastructure into areas where urban development is not planned.
RELATION TO OTHER ELEMENTS
Managing growth is integral to preserving all aspects of Lafayette’s unique character; therefore,
policies and programs appear throughout the Plan. Each area of Growth Management is
addressed in its respective General Plan chapter, e.g. the Circulation Chapter contains goals,
policies and programs dealing with traffic congestion and intersection levels of service; the
Safety Chapter addresses fire and police protection and emergency services; and the Land Use
Chapter sets forth goals, policies and programs on public facilities, schools and
telecommunications. By design, the Growth Management Chapter brings together topics covered
in other areas of the Plan. The goals, policies and programs needed to support the land uses
identified in this General Plan are restated in this chapter in order to provide a comprehensive
look at growth management in one location in the Plan.
ORGANIZATION OF ELEMENT
The Growth Management Element establishes goals and polices, and sets forth corresponding
implementation programs, in the following section. The goals, policies, and programs are
separated into three categories: Public Facilities and Capital Improvements, Demand for Public
Services and Performance Standards, and Other Performance Standards.
GROWTH MANAGEMENT CHAPTER                                                                   VIII-2

SECTION II: GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
INTRODUCTION
Growth Management is a concept that allows for a rate of growth that can be supported by the
City's infrastructure and does not diminish the community's quality of life and identity. This
vision is outlined in the goals and policies of the Circulation and Land Use Elements of the
Lafayette General Plan some of which are reproduced in this section.
Lafayette has several constraints to meeting adopted service standards. As Lafayette’s street
system provides access to and from other jurisdictions, the most significant constraint is the large
volumes of through-traffic on Lafayette’s streets, especially Mt. Diablo Boulevard, Moraga
Road, and Pleasant Hill Road north of Highway 24. Another significant constraint is that the City
provides a limited range of services. Lafayette depends on separate agencies for most of its
essential services including: potable water supply from the East Bay Municipal Utility District;
wastewater treatment from the Contra Costa Central Sanitary District; and fire protection from
the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District. The City contracts with the Contra Costa
County Sheriff for police services. The City maintains ongoing communication with provider
agencies for all services.
PUBLIC FACILITIES AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS
Adequate public facilities and services should be provided for new development, either through a
development agreement or payment of a "fair share" of providing such facilities. In order to
make reasonable provision for new facilities, the City of Lafayette shall establish public facility
impact fees in cooperation with applicable districts. Impact fees may vary by location, according
to the cost of improvements needed in the vicinity and the proportional share of the cost to be
applied to the development.
Such fees will be established consistent with State law to implement the goals and policies of the
General Plan, and may include charges for drainage improvements, traffic and roadway
improvements and other capital improvements such as parks, trails and public facilities.
Excepting transportation improvements, the City requires that the approval body make one of the
following findings before approving a development project: (1) performance standards will be
maintained following the project, (2) specific mitigations are required of the project developer to
ensure maintenance of adopted standards, or (3) capital projects planned by the City or special
district will result in maintenance of adopted standards. Such findings, mitigations, and capital
projects must be consistent with approved action plans.
Goal LU-19              Maintain the existing infrastructure essential to the public health and
                        safety of the community.
Policy LU-19.11 Capital Improvement Program: Maintain and update the five-year Capital
                        Improvement Program (CIP).
                        Program LU-19.1.1: Implement the five-year Capital Improvement Program.

                        Program LU-19.1.2: Conduct Planning Commission review of CIP annually to
                        ensure consistency with the General Plan.
                        Program LU-19.1.3: Continue the practice of including in the CIP a multi-year
                        budget for projects including specific pavement management projects, an
                        annual allowance for discretionary projects, and a fund for emergencies.
                        Program LU-19.1.4: Evaluate projects for the CIP using the following criteria:
                        compliance with the General Plan; potential threat to health and safety;
                        financial liability; protection of investment; cost of future maintenance; and
                        visual impacts on the surrounding area. Other criteria may be added as needed
                        to prioritize projects.
                        Program LU-19.1.5: Coordinate the timing of City capital improvement
                        projects and those of other agencies (e.g. CALTRANS, the East Bay Municipal
                        Utility District, the Central Contra Costa Sanitary District, and the Contra
                        Costa County Fire Protection District) to optimize resources and minimize the
                        impacts on residents.
                        Program: LU-19.1.6: Plan for adequate staff to implement the program.
Policy LU-20.13 Capital Improvement Program: Ensure that the Capital Improvement Program
                        identifies capital projects necessary to maintain levels of performance as well
                        as funding sources for all phases of intended projects.
Policy LU-19.2 Finance Capital Improvements: Provide public facilities to meet the needs
                        generated by new development within Lafayette through continued planning
                        and budgeting for public facilities and coordination with other agencies for
                        public services the City does not provide.
                        Program LU-19.2.1: Evaluate the operating and maintenance costs of
                        infrastructure improvements needed to support development.
                        Program LU-19.2.2: Provide information on development applications to other
                        service-providing agencies, to enable them to assess the appropriate fair share
                        impact fees. Request that the County require proof of payment of these fees
                        before issuing a building permit.
                        Program LU-19.2.3: Implement the City's pavement management program to
                        maintain Lafayette's roadways.
                        Program LU-19.2.4: Require new developments to pay their "fair share" of
                        capital improvements and the cost of public services to maintain adequate
                        levels of service. New development that creates incremental demand that
                        exceeds the capacity of existing infrastructure shall be considered only through
                        the development agreement process.
                        Program LU-19.2.52: Maintain development and mitigation fees at a level
                        adequate to finance infrastructure costs. Periodically review the City's fee
                        structure to determine that it accurately reflects the actual cost of providing

                         services, and recommend the appropriate revisions to the City Council.
DEMAND FOR PUBLIC SERVICES AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
Goal LU-20              Match the demand for public facilities and infrastructure generated by
                        new development with the capacity of existing facilities, capital
                        improvement programs and development mitigation programs.
Traffic Performance Standards
Policy LU-20.1 Traffic Service Standards: Consider the level of service (“LOS”) goals and
                         standards set forth in Policy C-1.2 of the Circulation Chapter when evaluating
                         development proposals.
                         Refer to the Circulation Chapter for additional policies and programs
                         regarding traffic LOS standards, goals, and mitigation programs.
                         For projects expected to generate between 10-50 net new peak-hour trips, the
                         Lamorinda Program Management Committee (“LPMC”) requires
                         supplemental notification of Lamorinda jurisdictions, SWAT jurisdictions and
                         other CCTA regional transportation planning committees as required in the
                         Lamorinda Action Plan Update. In addition, the CCTA requires that projects
                         estimated to generate over 100 peak-hour vehicle trips to conduct a traffic
                         impact study.
Policy C-1.2             Level of Service Standards and Goals: Establish the following level of service
                         (LOS) standards and goals. Transportation improvements must be consistent
                         with the community's strong desire to preserve Lafayette's unique identity and
                         quality of life.
                                        Level of Service Standards and Goals
                                                                        LOS             Standard V/C        HCM Goal Stopped

                        These intersections correspond to CCTA’s descriptions of “suburban” and “urban” intersections.
3    The level of service standard established by the Draft General Plan uses the CCTA methodology to calculate level of
     service standards. The HCM method is used to calculate level of service goals. Under the CCTA Growth Management Plan
     service level grades, such as LOS "A" or "B", are divided into high or low categories. A "High D". for example, means a
     higher volume to capacity ratio than does a "Low D". This definition has caused confusion since the Growth Management
     Plan definition states that a "high" letter grade means a worse level of service than does a "low" grade of the same letter. In
     order to clarify these definitions the LOS letter grades in the Draft General Plan are divided by categories defined as
     "Good" or "Poor". For example, a "Good D" in the Draft General Plan is equivalent to a "Low D" in the CCTA's Growth
     Management Plan.

GROWTH MANAGEMENT CHAPTER                                                                                                   VIII-5

              The standards shown above apply to all signalized intersections on non-
              regional routes. The City considers Level of Service standards to be met if (1)
              measurement of actual conditions at the intersection indicates equal or better
              operation, or (2) capital improvements in its five-year Capital Improvement
              Plan will result in operations equal to or better than the standard.
              If any signalized intersection along a non-regional route will not meet adopted
              standards, the City will first review the General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, and
              Capital Improvement Plan and consider amendments aimed at meeting the
              standard.
              When reporting to the CCTA, Lafayette will complete and submit the required
              Growth Management Program Compliance Checklist.
              The following is a discussion regarding the conditions, challenges, and
              solutions related to Lafayette’s regional and non-regional routes.
              Pleasant Hill Road Corridor. Pleasant Hill Road north of State Route 24
              carries the highest traffic volume of any Lafayette street. This street functions
              to connect Lafayette, the Lafayette BART station and State Route 24 with the
              cities of Walnut Creek, Pleasant Hill and Martinez. Designated as Lafayette’s
              only Route of Regional Significance, it is not subject to the adopted Level of
              Service Standards for non-regional routes. Instead, an Action Plan has been
              prepared that establishes Multi-Modal Transportation Service Objectives
              (MTSO’s).
              The majority of traffic on Lafayette’s arterial roadways like Moraga Road and
              Pleasant Hill Road has its origin and destination outside the City limits.
              Residents of Moraga, Pleasant Hill and other areas use Lafayette’s roadways
              to travel to and from Highway 24. As the population in neighboring
              communities continues to grow, so will automobile travel, congestion and
              delays. To address increasing demand, some jurisdictions have chosen to
              increase capacity. That alternative inevitably leads to competing goals within
              a jurisdiction and between jurisdictions as the community addresses the
              amount of increased demand capacity it is willing to develop. The CCTA has
              adopted a conflict resolution process for such disputes.
              An alternative to increasing roadway capacity to accommodate increased
              demand, is to reduce travel demand in a number of ways. To this end,
              Lafayette has adopted a Transportation Systems Management (TSM)
              Ordinance. The following related policies and programs appear in the
              Circulation Chapter.
Policy C-10.3 Multi-Modal Transportation Service Objectives (MTSO’s): Work toward
              achieving Lafayette-approved multi-modal transportation service objectives on
              roads such as Highway 24 and Lafayette’s portion of Pleasant Hill Road.
              Lafayette is committed to implementing specified local actions in a timely
              manner, consistent with the adopted Pleasant Hill Road Action Plan, a
              component of LPMC’s Lamorinda Action Plan. This Action Plan, as adopted
              by the City Council, has been included by the CCTA in the Countywide
GROWTH MANAGEMENT CHAPTER                                                                 VIII-6

                        Standards for non-regional routes. Instead, an Action Plan has been prepared
                        that establishes Multi-modal Traffic Service Objectives (MTSO’s).
                        The City of Lafayette uses the CCTA’s travel demand model for analysis of
                        General Plan amendments affecting land use or circulation and development
                        projects that generate more than the threshold number of peak hour trips in
                        order to determine the effects on the regional transportation system and
                        compliance with the MTSOs established in the Lamorinda Action Plan.
Policy C-7.1            Automobile Travel Demand: Seek to reduce vehicle trips by promoting
                        alternatives to the single-occupant automobile.
                        Program C-7.1.15: Continue to implement the City’s Transportation Systems

               when required by Sections 10910 through 10914 of the California Water Code
               and Section 15155 of the California Environmental Quality Act Guidelines.
GROWTH MANAGEMENT CHAPTER                                                                  VIII-9
               Program LU-20.7.6: Require that proposed developments located outside of
               EBMUD’s current service area contact the Contra Costa County Local Agency
               Formation Commission to apply for annexation. In addition, areas outside of
               EBMUD’s current annexed service area require approval by the U.S. Bureau of
               Reclamation prior to providing water service to any development.
               Program LU-20.7.7: Where a new main is necessary, require project sponsors
               to submit copies of all known information regarding soil and groundwater
               quality within or adjacent to the proposed project boundaries.              When
               contamination exists, require a specific written remediation plan establishing
               the methodology, planning, and design of all necessary systems for the
               removal, treatment, and disposal of contaminated soil and groundwater within
               a construction area for pipelines and services.
               Program LU-20.7.8: Make project sponsors aware of the water efficiency
               requirements of the EBMUD Water Service Regulations and local codes early
               in the design development process. Request that project applicants meet with
               EBMUD staff to discuss water efficient technology and best management
               practice applicable to their project.
               Program LU-20.7.9: Require project sponsors of new or redevelopment
               projects within the City, where a new main is required, to coordinate and
               consult with EBMUD regarding the feasibility of providing recycled water for
               appropriate non-potable purposes per EBMUD’s policy 8.01.
               EBMUD adopted a Water Supply Management Program in 1993. This
               program recognized that there may be supply limitations to the future
               expansion of EBMUD's service area. In the event of a threatened or actual
               water shortage, the District will give first priority to existing water customers
               within its existing service area.
               Several of the District's supply lines need to be rebuilt and seismically
               strengthened. The rehabilitation of EBMUD's delivery system is being
               addressed by the District's Capital Improvement Program.
               EBMUD has developed an extensive recycled water and water conservation
               program. The District recommends certain types of landscaping for new and
               existing development, which require minimal water. It is up to local
               jurisdictions, however, to implement water conservation regulations. Refer to
               the Open Space and Conservation Chapter for policies regarding water
               conservation.

                                             Adopted in entirety by Resolution 2002-56 on October 28, 2002
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Noise Section is to protect the health and welfare of the community by
promoting development which is compatible with established noise standards. This section has
been prepared in conformance with Government Code § 65302(f) and the guidelines adopted by
the State Office of Noise Control, pursuant to Health and Safety Code § 46050.1. Existing and
future noise problems in Lafayette and its Sphere of Influence are identified. Policies and
implementation programs are provided to reduce the community's exposure to excessive noise
levels. Accomplishing this task requires an evaluation of the noise from sources such as roads,
highways, BART, and from stationary sources such as schools and businesses.
The Noise Chapter contains the following sections:
   A map of projected future noise contours
   Standards for indoor and outdoor noise exposure
   Policies and implementation programs to mitigate the major noise problems where possible,
    both in the present and in the foreseeable future
NOISE CHARACTERISTICS
Noise is defined as unwanted sound. Airborne sound is a rapid fluctuation of air pressure above
and below atmospheric pressure. Sound levels are usually measured and expressed in decibels
(dB) with 0 dB corresponding roughly to the threshold of hearing. Decibels and other technical
terms are defined in Table 1.
Most of the sounds, which we hear in the environment, do not consist of a single frequency, but
rather a broad band of frequencies, with each frequency differing in sound level. The intensities
of each frequency add together to generate a sound. The method commonly used to quantify
environmental sounds consists of evaluating all of the frequencies of a sound in accordance with
a weighting that reflects the fact that human hearing is less sensitive at low frequencies and
extreme high frequencies than in the mid-range frequency. This method is called "A" weighting,
and the decibel level so measured is called the A-weighted sound level (dBA). In practice, the
level of a sound source is conveniently measured using a sound level meter that includes an
electrical filter corresponding to the A-weighting curve. Typical A-levels measured in the
environment and in industry are shown in Table 2 for different types of noise.
 NOISE CHAPTER                                                                                        VII-1

Although the A-weighted noise level may adequately indicate the level of environmental noise at
any instant in time, community noise levels vary continuously. Most environmental noise
includes a conglomeration of noise from distant sources which create a relatively steady
background noise, often called ambient noise in which no particular source is identifiable. To
describe the time-varying character of environmental noise, the statistical noise descriptors, L10,
L50, and L90, are commonly used. They are the A-weighted noise levels equaled or exceeded
during 10 percent, 50 percent, and 90 percent of a stated time period. A single number descriptor
called the Leq is now also widely used. The Leq is the average A-weighted noise level during a
stated period of time.

                                DEFINITION OF ACOUSTICAL TERMS
Term                           Definition
Decibel (dB)                   A unit describing the amplitude of sound, equal to 20 times the logarithm to
                               the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the reference
                               pressure, which is 20 micropascals (20 micronewtons per square meter).
Frequency (Hz)                 The number of complete pressure fluctuations per second above and below
                               the atmospheric pressure.
A-Weighed Sound Level (dBA)    The sound pressure level in decibels as measured on a sound level meter
                               using the A-weighing filter network. The A-weighing filter de-emphasizes
                               the very low and very high frequency components of the sound in a manner
                               similar to the frequency response of the human ear and correlates well with
                               subjective reactions to noise.
L01, L10, L50, L90             The A-weighted noise levels that are exceeded by 1%, 10%, 50% and 90% of
                               the time during the measurement period.
Equivalent Noise Level         The average A-weighted noise level during the measurement period.
(Leq)
Ldn                            The average A-weighted noise level during a 24-hour day, obtained after
                               addition of 10 decibels to levels measured in the night between 10:00 PM and
                               7:00 AM.
Lmax, Lmin                     The maximum and minimum A-weighted noise level during the measurement
                               period.
Ambient Noise Level            The composite of noise from all sources near and far. The normal or existing
                               level of environmental noise at a given location.
Intrusive                      That noise which intrudes over and above the existing ambient noise at a
                               given location. The relative intrusiveness of a sound depends upon its
                               amplitude, duration, frequency, and time of occurrence and tonal or
                               informational content as well as the prevailing ambient noise level.

NOISE CHAPTER                                                                                          VII-3

In determining the daily level of environmental noise, it is important to account for the difference
in response of people to daytime and nighttime noises. During the nighttime, exterior
background noises are generally lower than the daytime levels. However, most household noise
also decreases at night and exterior noise becomes very noticeable. Further, sensitivity to noise
increases when people sleep at night. To account for human sensitivity to nighttime noise levels,
a descriptor, the Ldn (day/night average sound level), was developed. The Ldn divides the 24-
hour day into the daytime of 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM and the nighttime of 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM.
The nighttime noise level is weighted 10 dB higher than the daytime noise level.
Human Response to Noise
The effects of noise on people can be categorized as follows:
     •  Subjective effects of annoyance, nuisance, dissatisfaction
     •  Interference with activities such as speech, sleep, learning
     •  Physiological effects such as fear response, hearing loss
The levels associated with environmental noise, in almost every case, produce effects only in the
first two categories. Workers in industrial plants can experience noise in the last category.
Unfortunately, there is as yet no completely satisfactory way to measure the subjective effects of
noise, or of the corresponding reactions of annoyance and dissatisfaction. This is primarily
because of the wide variation in individual thresholds of annoyance, and habituation to noise
over differing individual past experiences with noise. In general, the more a new noise exceeds
the previously existing ambient noise level, the less acceptable the new noise will be judged by
people.
The following relationships will be helpful in understanding the significance of increases in the
A-weighted noise level.
     •  In short-term laboratory experiments, a change of 1 dB can just be perceived. Longer-
        term exposure to a 1 dB change in environmental noise is perceivable.
     •  Outside of the laboratory, a 3 dB change is considered a noticeable difference.
     •  A change in level of 5 dB is very obvious, and a noticeable change in community
        response would be expected.
     •  A 10 dB change is subjectively heard as approximately a doubling in loudness, and
        would almost certainly cause an adverse change in community response.
In any typical noise environment about 10 percent of the population will object to any noise not
of their own making and 25 percent will not react or complain at all, regardless of the level of
noise being generated. Consequently, noise control measures are most beneficial to the
remaining 65 percent of the population who are neither ultra sensitive nor insensitive to noise.
Negative reaction to noise generally increases with the increase in difference between
background (or ambient) noise and the noise generated from a particular source such as traffic or
railroad operations. In most situations, noise control measures need to reduce noise by 5 to 10
dBA in order to effectively reduce complaints.
 NOISE CHAPTER                                                                                   VII-4

People generally have the ability to distinguish one sound from a background of sounds, such as
a telephone ringing over music. However, certain noise levels can render a sound inaudible. For
example, heavy trucks can interfere with a conversation. Face-to-face conversation usually can
proceed where the noise level is up to 66 dBA, group conversations up to 50 to 60 dBA, and
public meetings up to 45 or 55 dBA, without interruption.
Sleep interference is more difficult to quantify, although studies have shown that progressively
deeper levels of sleep require louder noise levels to cause a disturbance. The California Office of
Noise Control (ONC) recommends that individual events within sleeping areas should not
exceed 50 dBA in residential areas exposed to noise levels of 60 Ldn, or greater. Interior noise
standards of 45 Ldn will help protect against sleep interference.
Environmental noise, in almost every case, produces effects, which are subjective in nature or
involve interference with human activity. However, brief sounds at levels exceeding 70 dBA can
produce temporary physiological effects such as constriction of blood vessels, changes in
breathing and dilation of the pupils. Steady noises of 90 dBA have been shown to increase
muscle tension and adversely affect simple decision-making. Long-term exposure to levels
exceeding 70 dBA can cause hearing loss.
Noise and Land Use Compatibility Standards
The standards listed in Figure 1 should be used to evaluate the compatibility between land uses
and future noise in Lafayette. Figure 1 should be used in combination with Map VII-1: Noise
Contours to determine whether a proposed development or land use is located in an area
requiring special noise mitigating measures. A proposed development or land use located in an
area indicated by Map VII-1 as being within an acceptable level would not require any special
noise abatement measures. An office building proposed in an area with an exterior noise level
exceeding 65 dBA, however, would be required to have a combination of noise mitigating
features such as additional noise insulation, building setbacks, noise walls or other measures as
indicated by an acoustical study.

       Normally Acceptable
       Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are of
       normal, conventional construction, without any special insulation requirements.
       Conditionally Acceptable
       Specified land use may be permitted only after a detailed analysis of the noise reduction
       requirements and needed noise insulation features included in the design.
       Unacceptable
       New construction or development should generally not be undertaken because mitigation is
       usually not feasible to comply with noise element policies.
 NOISE CHAPTER                                                                                          VII-6
Explanation of Figure 1: Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise
A. Noise Source Characteristics
Figure 1 shows the ranges of exterior noise exposure which are considered to be acceptable,
conditionally acceptable, or unacceptable for the specified land use. Figure 1 is used to determine
whether or not the noise exposure requires mitigation in order to achieve a compatible noise
environment.
Where the noise exposure is acceptable for the intended land use, new development may occur
without requiring an evaluation of the noise environment.
Where the noise exposure would be conditionally acceptable a specified land use may be
permitted only after a detailed analysis is made of the noise reduction requirements and the
needed noise insulation features are included in the design. Such noise insulation features may
include measures to protect noise sensitive outdoor activity areas (e.g. at residences, schools or
parks) or may include building sound insulation treatments such as sound-rated windows to
protect interior spaces in residences, schools, hospitals or other buildings which are sensitive to
noise. Mitigation measures should be focused on reducing noise where it would have an adverse
effect for the specified land use, outdoors and/or indoors depending upon the land use.
For areas where the existing noise environment is unacceptable, new development should
generally not be undertaken because there may not be sufficient mitigations to bring the
development into compliance with the noise policies of this Chapter.
B. Suitable Interior Environments
One objective of locating residential units relative to a known noise source is to maintain a
suitable interior noise environment at no greater than 45 dB Ldn or Ldn. This requirement,
coupled with the measured or calculated noise reduction performance of all types of structures
under consideration, should govern the minimal acceptable distance to a noise source.
C. Acceptable Outdoor Environments
Another consideration, which in some communities is an overriding factor, is the desire for an
acceptable outdoor noise environment. When this is the case, more restrictive standards for land
use compatibility, typically below the maximum considered “normally acceptable” for that land
use category may be appropriate.
The following considerations should be taken into account when using the Noise and Land Use
Compatibility Standards:
    1. The standard for maximum outdoor noise levels in residential areas is a Ldn of 60 dB.
        This standard is applied where outdoor use is a major consideration, such as backyards in
        single-family housing developments and recreation areas in multifamily developments.
        This standard should not be applied to outdoor areas such as small decks and balconies
        typically associated with multifamily residential developments, which can have a higher
        standard of 65 Ldn.
 NOISE CHAPTER                                                                                  VII-7

  2. The maximum acceptable interior noise level in new residential development required by
      the State of California Noise Insulation Standards is an Ldn of 45. This standard
      continues to be applied to single family and all other residential development in
      Lafayette. In addition, the interior noise level for offices shall be Ldn 45 dB or less.
  3. These standards are not intended to be applied reciprocally. In other words, if an area is
      currently below the desired noise standard, an increase in noise up to the maximum
      should not necessarily be permitted. The impact of a proposed project on an existing land
      use should be evaluated in terms of the potential for adverse community response, based
      on existing community noise levels, regardless of the compatibility standards.
  4. The Noise and Land Use Compatibility Standards should be reviewed in relation to the
      specific source of noise. These standards are based on measurement systems, which
      average noise over a 24-hour period and do not take into account single-event noise
      sources. For example, aircraft noise normally consists of a higher single-noise event than
      vehicular traffic and has been linked to sleep interference and other significant problems,
      but occurs infrequently in Lafayette. Different noise sources yielding the same composite
      noise exposure do not necessarily create the same environment. Additional standards may
      be applied on a case-by-case basis where supported by acoustical analysis to mitigate the
      effects of single-event noise sources.
      Sensitive receptors are land uses, which are sensitive to noise such as hospitals,
      convalescent homes, schools, and libraries. Noise levels for these types of uses should not
      exceed those allowed in Figure 1. Map VII-1 Noise Contours indicates the projected
      environmental noise levels and the location of some noise sensitive uses in the City.
NOISE CHAPTER                                                                                  VII-8
THE EXISTING NOISE ENVIRONMENT
The major source of noise in Lafayette is vehicular traffic, including automobiles, trucks, buses,
and motorcycles. The level of vehicular noise generally varies with the volume of traffic, the
number of trucks or buses, the speed of traffic, and the distance from the roadway. Noise
generated by vehicular traffic in the City is greatest along State Route 24, which is the dominant
noise source in Lafayette. Local roadways including Moraga Road, First Street, Pleasant Hill
Road, and Mt. Diablo Boulevard are also significant sources of traffic noise.
Noise levels were measured at selected points throughout Lafayette in order to quantify the
existing noise environment. Day/night average noise levels range from a high of about 82 dBA
in rear yards of homes adjacent to State Route 24 down to about 49 dBA at locations on the
shielded or far side of ridges from the highway. The residual Ldn of 49 dBA results from regular
high altitude jet aircraft overflights.
Traffic noise levels throughout Lafayette were calculated using a noise contour program based
on Federal Highway Administration research document FHWA RD77-108. The California
Vehicle Noise Emission Levels (CALVENO) developed by Caltrans were used in the model.
The noise contour data are tabulated in Tables 16 and 17 in the Appendix of the Lafayette
General Plan Revision Environmental Impact Report. The calculated levels depend upon the
number of automobiles, medium trucks and heavy trucks, and the speed of the vehicles to
calculate the distance to noise contours. Implicit in this model is the assumption that the average
noise level during the noisiest hour approximates the 24-hour day/night average noise level. The
hourly data gathered during the long-term measurements indicate that along State Route 24 the
Ldn is approximately 2 dB higher than the noisiest hour Leq. This is due to high noise levels
during the early morning hours and late evening hours. Noise levels measured along local streets
indicate good correlation between the peak hour Leq and the Ldn. The results of the computer
modeling were adjusted to account for the results of the long-term measurements.
The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system runs in the median of State Route 24 through
Lafayette. The noise of the State Route 24 masks (obscures) the noise of BART at most
locations most of the time. BART trains are audible at residences located north and south of
State Route 24 in western Lafayette where freeway noise is partially shielded from these
residences. Noise levels measured in western Lafayette indicate that maximum noise levels due
to BART trains can reach about 80 dBA at the residences. BART noise is unique in character and
therefore identifiable in comparison to traffic noise. The contribution of BART to the 24-hour
average noise level is insignificant, however, due to the continuous noise levels generated by the
freeway.
There are no significant sources of industrial noise or stationary noise sources in the Lafayette
Planning Area.
The noise of high altitude jet aircraft is significant in Lafayette in areas where traffic noise is not
significant. Aircraft are heard regularly during the daytime. Maximum noise levels resulting
from jet aircraft overflights typically range from 50 to 60 dBA and can be as high as 65 to 70
dBA. The Ldn resulting from jet aircraft overflights is less than 50 dBA.
 NOISE CHAPTER                                                                                     VII-9
Goal N-1     Ensure that all new development is consistent with the standards for noise.
Policy N-1.1 General Noise Levels: The maximum allowable noise levels are established in
             this Chapter.
Policy N-1.2 Reduce Noise Impacts: Avoid or reduce noise impacts first through site planning
             and project design. Barriers and structural changes may be used as mitigation
             techniques only when planning and design prove insufficient.
             Program N-1.2.1: Use the City's Noise Ordinance in environmental review of all
             development proposals and incorporate project design measures to reduce noise to
             allowable limits. (Formerly S-11.2.10)
             Program N-1.2.2: Evaluate mitigation measures for projects that would cause a
             “substantial increase” in noise as defined by the following criteria or would
             generate unusual noise which could cause significant adverse community
             response:
             a)   cause the Ldn in existing residential areas to increase by 3 dB or more;
             b)   cause the Ldn in existing residential areas to increase by 2 dB or more if the
                  Ldn would exceed 70 dB; or
             c)   cause the Ldn resulting exclusively from project-generated traffic to exceed
                  an Ldn of 60 dBA at any existing residence.
             A 3 dB increase would result if traffic increased by 100% over existing levels. It is
             recognized that there are locations where the outdoor criteria of an Ldn of 55 dB
             cannot be reasonably and feasibly achieved. These situations will be evaluated on
             a case-by-case basis to determine the appropriate level of mitigation.
Policy N-1.3 Noise and Land Use Compatibility Standards: Ensure that all new noise sensitive
             development proposals be reviewed with respect to Figure 1: Noise and Land Use
             Compatibility Standards. Noise exposure shall be determined through actual on-
             site noise measurements.
Policy N-1.4 Residential and Noise Sensitive Land Use Standards: Require a standard of 40 -
             45 Ldn (depending on location) for indoor noise level for all new residential
             development including hotels and motels, and a standard of 55 Ldn for outdoor
             noise, except near the freeway. These limits shall be reduced by 5 dB for senior
             housing and residential care facilities.
             Program N-1.4.1: Use the standards in Policy N-1.2.2 to determine the need for
             noise studies and require new developments to provide noise attenuation features
             as a condition of approving new projects.
             Program N-1.4.2: Require an acoustical study for all new residential projects with
             a future Ldn noise exposure of 55 Ldn or greater. The study shall describe how
             the project will comply with the Noise and Land Use Compatibility Standards.
 NOISE CHAPTER                                                                             VII-10

             The studies shall also satisfy the requirements set forth in Title 24, part 2 of the
             California Government Code, Noise Insulation Standards, for multi-family
             attached dwellings, hotels, motels, etc. regulated by Title 24.
             Program N-1.4.3: Require that all new single-family residential development meet
             the standards set forth in California Title 24, in addition to multi-family
             residential development, hotels, motels, etc.
Policy N-1.5 Interior Noise Standards Applied to Remodel Projects: Interior noise standards
             shall be applied to residential remodel projects where the remodeling is valued at
             50% of the assessed value or greater.
             Program N-1.5.1: Review all building permit applications for compliance with the
             applicable interior noise standards and require, as necessary, the appropriate noise
             mitigating features.
Goal N-2     Work to reduce noise to acceptable levels where it now exceeds those
             standards.
Policy N-2.1 Reduce Outdoor Noise in Existing Residential Areas: Reduce outdoor noise in
             existing residential areas where economically and aesthetically feasible.
             Program N-2.1.1: Consider sound barrier walls, grading and landscaping, and
             change in traffic patterns as potential measures.
Policy N-2.2 Mitigate Noise Impacts: Mitigate noise impacts to the maximum feasible extent.
             Program N-2.2.1: Require acoustical studies and mitigation measures for new
             developments and roadway improvements which affect noise sensitive uses such
             as schools, hospitals, libraries and convalescent homes.
             Program N-2.2.2: Require acoustical studies of any project that would potentially
             generate non-transportation noise levels in a residential area such that noise levels
             would exceed the planning standards set forth in Program N-1.2.2.
             Program N-2.2.3: Work with Caltrans to ensure that adequate noise studies are
             prepared and alternative noise mitigation measures are considered when state and
             federal funds are available.
             Program N-2.2.4: Consider and carefully evaluate the noise impacts of all street,
             highway and other transportation projects.
             Program N-2.2.5: Continue to seek state and federal funding to construct noise
             barriers where impact of noise can be significantly reduced and the project would
             be in keeping with all the goals & policies of the General Plan
             Program N-2.2.6: Restrict truck traffic to designated routes.
             Program N-2.2.7: Recommend acoustical studies for all projects that would be
             exposed to noise levels in excess of those deemed normally acceptable, as defined
             in Figure 1.

                                             Adopted in entirety by Resolution 2002-56 on October 28, 2002

PURPOSE
The Safety Element, pursuant to Government Code § 65302(g), deals with the protection of the
community from unreasonable risks associated with the effects of earthquakes, landslides, slope
instability, subsidence, flood, fire and other geologic hazards. Maps identifying earthquake
hazards, unstable soil hazards, landslide hazards, and flood zones are included in this chapter.
The geology, topography, and soils of Lafayette pose numerous constraints on any future
development. This element guides land use planning and policy decisions in order to achieve an
acceptable level of public protection.
LANDSLIDES AND UNSTABLE SLOPES
Much of Lafayette is comprised of ridges with steep slopes. Grading and construction on steep,
unstable slopes can result in damage to improvements and risk to human health. Slope failure
and landsliding can be caused by a number of factors. Construction in areas with active
landslides can result in failure of buildings, roads, utility lines, and other improvements.
Improper construction on steep slopes or in areas with weak soils can create new landslides,
which could threaten lives and property. Many of the parcels with development potential in the
City occur in hilly areas with known landslides and slopes highly susceptible to landsliding.
A number of creeks in Lafayette have experienced significant downcutting of the streambed,
which has resulted in steep and frequently unstable slopes. During heavy rains or when stream
flows are high, these banks become saturated and may slide into the stream potentially damaging
property, damming of the stream channel, and sedimentation of the aquatic environment.
The following goals and policies address the hazards of constructing residences or other
improvements on unstable slopes.
Goal S-1        Minimize risks to Lafayette residents and property from landslides and other
                geologic hazards.
                Maps VI-1 and VI-2 show the liquefaction and landslide hazard in the City.
Policy S-1.1    Slope and Soil Stability. Consider slope and soil stability when reviewing future
                projects. Development proposals in areas with landslide hazards shall be
SAFETY CHAPTER                                                                                        VI-1

             reviewed by an engineering geologist to determine whether the proposed
             development is feasible, and to define the required construction standards and
             mitigation measures.
             Program S-1.1.1: Require submittal and review of a site-specific geotechnical
             report for proposed development in areas identified on Map VI-1 as “Liquefaction
             potential possibly present” or on Map VI-2 as “Area of known slides and ground
             highly susceptible to sliding.” Development shall be supervised and certified by a
             geotechnical engineer, and where necessary, by an engineering geologist.
             Program S-1.1.2: Require financial protection for public agencies and individuals
             as a condition of development approval where geological conditions indicate a
             potential for ongoing maintenance costs related to the geological conditions.
             The financial protection would ensure that developers will have the resources to
             carry out such maintenance on properties where geological analysis identifies a
             risk of high ongoing maintenance costs. This program would also serve to limit
             the City’s liability. Examples include bonds, liens, or other suitable security to
             ensure that landscaped slopes in areas with unstable soils are maintained to
             prevent hazardous soil movement. A soils report prepared by a qualified soils
             engineer would be required to establish standards for City protection.
             Program S-1.1.3: Require repair, stabilization, or avoidance of landslides, of areas
             of soil creep, and of possible debris flow as a condition of project approval.
             Program S-1.1.4: Require professional inspection of foundation and excavation,
             earthwork and other geotechnical aspects of site development during construction
             on those sites identified as being prone to moderate levels of slope instability.
Policy S-1.2 Density and Location of Buildings: Limit building in areas with significant risk
             potential. Intensity of development shall be minimal in areas of high risk.
             Consider potential seismic or geologic hazards when determining building density
             and in siting dwellings.
             Program S-1.2.1: Carefully review applications for development in hilly areas and
             along creekbanks.
             Program S-1.2.2: Seek to identify and map areas, which are deemed unbuildable
             due to risks of unstable soils.
Policy S-1.3 Roadways and Roadway Improvements: Prohibit new roadways or roadway
             modifications that would create unstable geological conditions. (An example
             would be cuts and fills in areas with unstable soils.)
Policy S-1.4 Creekbank Protection: Prohibit structures of any kind that might be impacted by
             creekbank slippage and erosion.
SAFETY CHAPTER                                                                                 VI-2

            Program S-1.4.1: Enforce the Creek Setback Ordinance, which requires setbacks
            from creeks proportional to the depth of the channel.

            creekbank protection.
SAFETY CHAPTER                                                                       VI-3
SEISMIC HAZARDS
Lafayette is located in one of the most seismically active areas of the nation. The western edge
of the continental plates runs along the California shoreline, and the resulting stresses have
produced a complex network of faults where most earthquake activity occurs. Major fault
systems in the region include the San Andreas, Franklin, Hayward, Calaveras, and Concord fault
zones. There have been a number of earthquakes in recent geologic time which have resulted in
damage in Lafayette.
While a number of faults have been mapped in Lafayette, none of these faults meet the requisite
criteria to be identified as active or potentially active – defined as having recorded earth
movement or displacement within the past 10,000 years. However, this does not mean that
future seismic activity along identified faults in Lafayette is impossible. Seismic activity along
these faults, either induced by a major earthquake on one of the large, active faults in the nearby
area or an independent movement along these local faults, could generate significant damage to
structures and result in injury to residents. Refer to Map VI-3: Earthquake Hazard.
Seismic Effects on Structures and Public Facilities
The land use pattern that has evolved in Lafayette has, in general, avoided high-risk areas. The
varying levels of seismic and geologic risk within the Lafayette Planning Area are illustrated by
Map VI-3 Earthquake Hazard.
A major earthquake would be expected to cause considerable damage to transportation systems.
Roads, bridges and highway overpass are susceptible to damage or failure in the event of a major
earthquake. Landslides would be intensified as a result of ground shaking, and could affect
portions of the roadway system located in landslide potential areas identified in Map VI-1:
Liquefaction Potential. Seismic damage could also occur to the treated water and sewage
pipelines, gas pipelines, and to telephone and power lines, which traverse the Planning Area.
Effective planning and preparation can significantly reduce the risks and harmful effects of
earthquakes and other natural disasters.
The Unreinforced Masonry Law passed by the State Legislature in 1986 (SB 547), requires all
cities and counties to identify potentially hazardous unreinforced masonry buildings. The County
carries out building inspection services for Lafayette and they have completed an inspection and
reinforcement program to mitigate hazards associated with the seismic effects on most structures.
The seismic status of structures by their seismic classification is summarized below:
          a) Emergency buildings (police and fire stations) have been constructed recently and
              have been built with earthquake damage mitigating features. There is no hospital
              located in Lafayette. The two convalescent homes in the City are of recent
              construction and are built to modern seismic standards designed to withstand low to
              medium earthquakes.
          b) Many of the high priority buildings (buildings occupied by the City, schools, and
              limited care facilities) are of recent construction. Many are steel or wood-frame
              buildings which are the least susceptible to earthquake damage.
SAFETY CHAPTER                                                                                 VI-4

         c) The majority of high-use buildings (commercial and office buildings, apartment
             buildings of 50 or more units and churches) are of recent construction and were
             designed to withstand low to medium intensity earthquakes.
         d) Duplexes and the majority of housing in Lafayette have been built with one- to two-
             story wood-frame construction, which has a high survivability in the event of an
             earthquake.
         e) There are six unreinforced masonry buildings Downtown on Mt. Diablo Boulevard.
         f) Bridges across Highway 24 could be vulnerable in the event of a major earthquake.
         g) The East Bay Municipal Utility District's (EBMUD) high pressure water lines run
             through the city and could break during a seismic event, causing flooding and
             landslides.
         h) There are two reservoirs in the City operated by EBMUD.
Goal S-2       Minimize risks to Lafayette residents and property from earthquakes.
Policy S-2.1   Seismic Hazards: New development, including subdivisions, new construction,
               and remodels or expansions of existing structures, shall minimize exposure to
               seismic hazards through site planning and building design.
               Program S-2.1.1: Comply with the provisions of the State Alquist-Priolo Act, as
               appropriate.
               The Alquist Priolo Act was adopted by the State legislature which established
               Special Studies Zones throughout California. Geologic investigations must be
               prepared prior to certain types of new development in these zones. There are, at
               present, no Special Studies Zones in the Lafayette Planning Area.
               Program S-2.1.2: Strengthen existing structures against seismic events to
               applicable nationally-recognized standards. Give priority to emergency buildings,
               schools, theaters, meeting halls, apartment complexes and major transportation
               facilities.
               There are no high priority buildings such as schools, theaters, or hospitals
               located on an active fault in Lafayette.
               Program S-2.1.3: Provide information to the public on ways to reinforce buildings
               to reduce damage from earthquakes and what to do in the event of an earthquake.
               Program S-2.1.4: Require, as conditions of approval, measures to mitigate
               potential seismic hazards for structures.
               Program S-2.1.5: Require geotechnical reports by a state registered geologist for
               development proposals on sites located in known or suspected seismically or
               geologically hazardous areas and for all critical structures.
SAFETY CHAPTER                                                                              VI-5
Policy S-2.2    Areas of Significant Risk Potential: Locate construction of high density residential
                and other critical, high-occupancy or essential services buildings outside high risk
                zones.
                Program S-2.2.1: Require that development in areas identified by Map VI-3:
                Earthquake Hazard be supervised and certified by a geotechnical engineer and,
                where necessary, by an engineering geologist.
                Program S-2.2.2: Establish setbacks from active or potentially active fault lines or
                traces for structures intended for human occupancy.
                Although there are no active fault lines or traces identified in the Planning Area,
                new information about faults may be discovered in the future. Under the Alquist-
                Priolo Act Special Studies Zone Act construction of new facilities within 50 feet of
                designated active faults is prohibited. (Designation of newly discovered faults
                under this Act may occur in the future.) Setback areas should be established
                where deemed necessary by geologists or soils engineers. Parking lots and
                landscaped areas are examples of uses that could be located in these setbacks.
FLOOD HAZARDS
Lafayette is drained by a series of creeks. Areas adjacent to these creeks are subject to flooding
during storms with intense or prolonged amounts of rainfall. The estimated extent of flooding
resulting from a 100-year storm (i.e., a storm that has a probability of occurring on the average
once every 100 years) is indicated by Map VI-4: Flood Zones. Except for the most northerly
portions of the City, all of Lafayette eventually drains to Las Trampas Creek, which runs east to
Walnut Creek and north to Suisun Bay. Potential flood hazards affecting existing development
are found along Las Trampas Creek, the EBMUD high-pressure water lines, and within the
inundation zones below Lafayette and Leland Reservoirs. These reservoirs are operated and
managed by the East Bay Municipal Utility District – a regional public water agency.
It is the Contra Costa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District's (CCCFCWCD)
responsibility under State law to develop a coordinated flood control program for the County and
to review development projects in Lafayette for their impact on flood risk. The City will
continue to work closely with the District to reduce flood risk. Refer to the Open Space and
Conservation Chapter for discussion of creek corridors.
Goal S-3        Reduce flood hazards.
Policy S-3.1    Reduce Flood Hazards: Reduce flood risk by maintaining effective flood drainage
                systems and regulating construction.
                Program S-3.1.1: Condition new development to maintain post development peak
                runoff rate and average volume similar to the predevelopment condition, to the
                maximum extent feasible. Consider use of alternative drainage systems that
                utilize on-site infiltration or slow runoff during peak periods. Where this is not
                feasible, the increase must be mitigated. Include clear and comprehensive
SAFETY CHAPTER                                                                                  VI-6

             mitigation measures as part of project approvals with financial and other measures
             to ensure their implementation.
             Program S-3.1.2: Require runoff rate/volume analysis and flow-duration analysis
             of projects where deemed necessary by City staff and/or required by provisions of
             the NPDES municipal stormwater permit...
             Program S-3.1.3: Require analysis of the cumulative effects of development upon
             runoff, discharge into natural watercourses, and increased volumes and velocities
             in watercourses and their impacts on downstream properties. Include clear and
             comprehensive mitigation measures as part of project approvals with financial and
             other measures to ensure their implementation.
             Program S-3.1.4: Maintain a file of inundation maps and drainage plans for
             existing and new water storage tanks in the City.
Policy S-3.2 Flood Protection Standard: In the review of flood control for proposed new
             development, establish as a standard the flood recurrence intervals used by the
             Contra Costa County Flood Control District (e.g. the 100-year flood event).
             (Reso. 2009-021, 2009)
             Program S-3.2.1: Utilize the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Flood
             Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) to reduce risk of flooding, to identify 100 Year Flood
             Events, to calculate flow rates within identified stream channels, and to review
             development proposals.
             Program S-3.2.2: Participate in the National Flood Insurance program.
Policy S-3.3 Storm Drainage System: Maintain unobstructed water flow in the storm drainage
             system.
             Program S-3.3.1: Enforce measures to minimize the volume and velocity of
             surface runoff, soil erosion, and sedimentation both during and after construction
             through implementation of the Grading Ordinance.
             Program S-3.3.2: Carry out annual inspection of the drainage systems in Lafayette.
             Program S-3.3.3: Require siltation/detention ponds to be incorporated into the
             design and construction of development projects, where deemed necessary.
             Refer to Program S-3.1.1 for other measures, including detention ponds, aimed at
             reducing peak runoff.
             Program S-3.3.4: All drainage or creek work done within the CCCFCWCD right-
             of-way must be done under permit from the District.
Policy S-3.4 Finance the Storm Drain System: Explore all available sources of funding to
             ensure that adequate funding exists to finance improvements to storm drainage
             facilities.
SAFETY CHAPTER                                                                             VI-7

                 Program S-3.4.1: Cooperate with the Contra Costa County Flood Control and
                 Water Conservation District and other jurisdictions to pursue all available sources
                 of funding to finance improvements to storm drainage facilities.
                 Program S-3.4.2: Enforce the Storm Drainage Impact Fee Ordinance requiring
                 development to cover the costs of drainage facilities needed as a result of new
                 development.
                 Program S-3.4.3: Periodically assess the need to establish improvement districts
                 and other financing mechanisms to fund necessary storm drainage and
                 watercourse improvements to minimize flood hazards and creek erosion.
Policy S-3.5     Building Location: Consider potential flood hazards when siting a building.
                 Intensity of development shall be the lowest in areas of high risk.
FIRE HAZARDS
The combination of vegetation, topography, climate and population density creates a significant
potential for fire hazards in Lafayette. There are two categories of fire hazards in the community
– wildland fires, which occur in open chaparral, grassland and forest areas, and urban fires that
damage buildings in urbanized areas.
Contra Costa County Fire Protection District provides fire protection in Lafayette. The District
maintains three stations in Lafayette. There is a new station planned on Pleasant Hill Road, just
outside of the city limits, which will provide additional protection to the Reliez Valley area.
Goal S-4         Minimize risks to Lafayette residents and property from fire hazards.
Policy S-4.1     Adequate Fire Protection: Enforce regulations and standards which contribute to
                 adequate fire protection.
                 Program S-4.1.1: Improve access and response time of emergency response
                 vehicles.
                 Program S-4.1.2: Ensure that new traffic signals include an EMTRC system which
                 allows emergency vehicles to change the signal.
                 Program S-4.1.3: Encourage the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District
                 including paramedic services to improve its response time for Lafayette,
                 particularly in the urban wild land fire interface zones. The location of fire
                 stations should strive for a five-minute response time. (Reso. 2009-021, 2009)
                 Program S-4.1.4 Restrict parking on narrow roads to allow access by emergency
                 vehicles and to facilitate evacuation.
                 Program S-4.1.5: Require development that includes private access roads or fire
                 roads to provide access rights and keys to all gates to the Contra Costa County
                 Fire Protection District.
SAFETY CHAPTER                                                                                  VI-8

                   Program S-4.1.6: Work with East Bay Municipal Utility District and the Contra
                   Costa County Fire Protection District to ensure that there exists sufficient water
                   flow in fire hydrants throughout Lafayette.
                   The current standard adopted by the City is a minimum of 1,000 gallons per
                   minute with 20 pounds per square inch residual pressure for residential areas.
                   The commercial areas shall conform to the fire flow requirements as set forth by
                   the California Fire Code.
Policy S-4.2       Reducing Fire Risk From Development: Take measures to reduce fire risks from
                   new and existing development as well as natural fire hazards.
                   Program S-4.2.1: Work with the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District to
                   evaluate development proposals, enforce the fire code, and improve fire
                   prevention measures and protection services.
                   Program S-4.2.2: Implement the City’s land use regulations for building materials
                   with emphasis on fire-retardant roofs and exterior vegetation control.
                   Program S-4.2.3: Encourage the East Bay Regional Parks District and the East
                   Bay Municipal Utilities District to undertake vegetation management programs to
                   reduce fire hazards on their properties.
                   Program S-4.2.4: Adopt and utilize the Fire Hazard Severity Scale for the
                   classification of fire hazards in wild land areas.1
                   Program S-4.2.5: Permit new development only where there is adequate fire flow
                   and adequate emergency vehicular access.
                   Program S-4.2.6: Establish buffer areas for buildings in high fire risk areas.
                   Buffers can include site planning techniques, vegetation management plans and
                   defensible space.
                   Defensible space refers to a buffer area around buildings which is cleared of
                   highly combustible vegetation and which is readily accessible by fire fighting
                   equipment.
                   Program S-4.2.7: Enforce the Fire Safety Ordinance requiring sprinkler systems
                   for new residential development more than 1.5 miles from a fire station, beyond
                   the 3-minute response time, and other applicable triggers. (Reso. 2009-021, 2009)
                   Program S-4.2.8: Require development proposals on sites beyond the five-minute
                   response time area or where insufficient fire flow exists to implement fire risk
                   reduction measures recommended by the City and the Contra Costa County Fire
                   Protection District.
                   Program S-4.2.9: For structures within or adjacent to hazardous areas, require a
                   greater degree of fire resistance in roof coverings and exterior building materials
1   This scale was developed by the U.S. Forest Service and the State Department of Forestry. It is useful for identifying areas
    with a high risk of wildfire due to flammable vegetation, rugged terrain and other factors.

                than what is specified in the UFC, as determined by the Chief Building Official
                and upon making of findings specified in Health and Safety Code §13143.4.
Policy S-4.3    Development and Mitigation Fees: Maintain development and mitigation fees at a
                level to adequately finance fire protection costs.
                Program S-4.3.1: Periodically assess fees for fire protection to ensure that existing
                and new development pay its fair share of the cost of fire protection facilities,
                personnel and maintenance.
Policy S-4.4    Mutual Aid Agreements: Participate in mutual aid agreements with the County
                and State fire fighting agencies.
Policy S-4.5    Vegetation Management Plan: Require development in a high fire risk area to
                have an approved vegetation management plan that includes native, drought-
                tolerant, and fire resistant species.
                Program S-4.5.1: All new development within mapped high fire hazard zones
                established by the Contra Costa County Fire District shall be required to develop
                and implement a Vegetation Management Plan. The Plan shall be part of the
                development application and approved by the Contra Costa County Fire District
                and the City. The Plan shall be developed by an arborist or vegetation
                management specialist. The City shall ensure that the actions recommended in the
                Plan are implemented in the future and should amend the Municipal Code to
                allow the City the right to conduct actions recommended in the Plan at the
                property owner’s expense, if those actions are not performed in a timely fashion
                by the property owner. The Contra Costa County Fire District shall have the right
                to review properties to judge whether actions recommended in the Vegetation
                Management Plan are being properly implemented in a timely fashion.
                Program S-4.5.2: Establish a high fire risk overlay zoning district in high fire risk
                areas where a Vegetation Management Plan is required.
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
There exist potential public safety hazards in the Lafayette Planning Area associated with the
storage and transportation of hazardous materials. A large quantity of hazardous materials are
transported on highways where the potential for accidental release of this material into the
environment presents a potentially significant public health risk.
The storage and transportation of hazardous materials is clearly a regional problem, and local
jurisdictions have only limited authority. The policies and programs in this section incorporate
and build on relevant portions of the State law and County regulations.
Radioactive materials are distinguished from other hazardous materials and specific Federal and
State regulations have been developed for these substances. The use and storage of radioactive
materials in Lafayette is limited to medical facilities, since there are no other primary users of
radioactive materials such as research laboratories, nuclear power plants or military facilities
SAFETY CHAPTER                                                                                  VI-10

located within the Planning Area. The principal potential danger to Lafayette residents from
these materials is related to the possibility of a truck accident where containers holding
radioactive materials would be ruptured on State Route 24.
Goal S-5      Reduce the hazards of the storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous
              materials.
Policy S-5.1  Storage of Hazardous Materials: Strictly enforce the regulations governing the
              storage of chemical, biological and other hazardous materials as set forth in
              California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 4.5.
Policy S-5.2  Transport of Hazardous Materials: Develop, in cooperation with the County and
              neighboring cities, regulations prohibiting through-transport by truck of hazardous
              materials on the local street systems and require that this activity be limited to
              State highways.
              Program S-5.2.1: Consider establishing and enforcing a Local Hazardous
              Material Route Plan, installing signage and publicizing routes for hazardous
              materials transport in the Lafayette Planning Area. Adopt an ordinance
              designating specific routes within the Planning Area for transport of hazardous
              materials.
Policy S-5.3  Transportation, Storage and Disposal Facilities: Provide measures to protect the
              public from the hazards associated with the Transportation, Storage and Disposal
              (“TSD”) of hazardous wastes.
              Program S-5.3.1: Refer land use and transportation decisions and other programs
              involving hazardous materials regulations to the appropriate agencies.
              Program S-5.3.2: Support the establishment of a household hazardous waste
              disposal program.
              Program S-5.3.3: Maintain the Hazardous Materials and Waste Ordinance.
              Program S-5.3.4: Require as a condition of City development project approvals,
              that the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District be notified of all hazardous
              substances that are transported, stored, treated or could be released accidentally
              into the environment.
              Program S-5.3.5: Support thorough environmental review for Hazardous Waste
              Transportation, Storage and Disposal (TSD) Facilities proposed in the Lafayette
              Planning Area and throughout Contra Costa County, since the potentially
              significant, widespread and long-term impacts on public health and safety of these
              facilities do not respect jurisdictional boundaries.
SAFETY CHAPTER                                                                               VI-11

ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD HAZARDS
The potential adverse health effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF's) from electric transmission
lines, substations and appliances have been documented in many studies2. The Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) concluded in a recent report, Evaluation of Potential Carcinogenicity
of Electromagnetic Fields, that there is a causal relationship between certain forms of cancer and
exposure to 60 Hz magnetic fields from power lines and perhaps other sources in the home.
There is no consensus in the scientific community, however, regarding the degree of risk
presented by EMF's. We do not know what levels of exposure to EMF's are safe. The approach
taken to this potential health hazard is one of prudent avoidance – establishing reasonable
regulation before electrical transmission lines are built and discouraging development from
encroaching in or near electrical transmission line right-of-ways. It is also necessary to obtain
updated information on EMF radiation levels of existing and proposed electrical transmission
facilities and relate those to the latest standards that are emerging from ongoing research.
Goal S-6           Minimize community exposure to electromagnetic fields.
Policy S-6.1       Consider EMF's in land use decisions: Consider information regarding EMF
                   radiation from existing and new electrical transmission lines and substations in
                   making land use decisions.
                   Program S-6.1.1: Request that PG&E provide information on renovations to
                   existing and construction of proposed new electrical transmission lines,
                   substations, and distribution lines. Request that information on the EMF radiation
                   levels for proposed new facilities be provided.
                   Program S-6.1.2: Require that all new electrical transmission projects have an
                   EMF mitigation plan as a part of the project’s environmental review pursuant to
                   CEQA.
                   Program S-6.1.3: Request from PG&E an inventory and full public disclosure of
                   existing electrical transmission lines and of existing and proposed electrical
                   transmission projects with the anticipated EMF levels in the Lafayette Planning
                   Area.
                   There are 60 kV, 130 kV and 240 kV transmission lines and substations within the
                   Lafayette Planning Area.
Policy S-6.2       Siting of Schools and other Sensitive Uses: Minimize and reduce EMF radiation
                   levels near sensitive uses such as schools, hospitals, and playgrounds in planning
                   for electrical transmission facilities repair and new construction.

    Chicago, Illinois.
SAFETY CHAPTER                                                                                                  VI-12

POLICE SERVICES
The Police Department provides for public safety through the protection of life and property and
preserving the peace. Lafayette contracts its police services from the County Sheriff's
Department.
Goal S-7      Maintain effective police services.
Policy S-7.1  Demand for Police Services: Review development proposals for their demand on
              police services and require mitigating measures, if necessary, to maintain the
              community's standard for police services. Levy police impact fees for capital
              facilities and equipment, if warranted.
Policy S-7.2  Interjurisdictional Cooperation: Work with the Contra Costa County Sheriff's
              Department and neighboring jurisdictions to improve police service in Lafayette.
Policy S-7.3  Response Time Standards: Strive to maintain a three-minute response time for all
              life-threatening calls and those involving criminal misconduct, and a seven-
              minute response time for the majority of non-emergency calls.
SAFETY CHAPTER                                                                             VI-13
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
It is not possible to eliminate the risks associated with geologic, seismic, fire and other hazards of
the natural and built environments. However, the City can help reduce those risks through
effective planning and preparation. An Emergency Operations Plan has been prepared to achieve
the goals of emergency preparedness and response: save lives, reduce injury, protect property and
restore essential services. The Plan provides for the distribution of vital resources (medical
supplies, food, water, shelter, equipment and services) and for the coordination of essential
services (City, County, State, federal, private and not-for-profit). The Plan has been prepared in
conformity with the State Emergency Management System (SEMS) and responsibility for its
implementation rests with the City Manager and Police Chief.
Goal S-8        Provide adequate response and support services in the event of a major
                emergency or natural disaster.
Policy S-8.1    Emergency Operations Plan: Periodically review the Emergency Operations Plan
                to assure that it meets current needs in the event of a major disaster.
                Program S-8.1.1: Conduct regular training programs for personnel involved in
                implementing the Emergency Operations Plan.
                Program S-8.1.2: Revise, as appropriate, the City's Emergency Operations Plan.
                Revise the plan to conform to the California Emergency Management System
                (SEMS).
                Program S-8.1.3: Maintain designated emergency evacuation routes in a passable
                condition at all times, as feasible.
Policy S-8.2    Cooperate with the County's Emergency Preparedness Plan: Cooperate with
                Contra Costa County's Emergency Preparedness Plan.
                Program S-8.2.1: Revise the City's Emergency Operations Plan to ensure that it
                complies with the County's Plan.
Policy S-8.3    Emergency Operations Center: Ensure that Lafayette has an adequate and well-
                equipped Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
                Program S-8.3.1: Identify specific facilities, such as City offices, schools, fire
                stations, police buildings, and lifelines such as telephone, electric, water, and
                sewer service critical to effective emergency and disaster response. Evaluate their
                abilities to operate efficiently immediately after a disaster. Designate alternative
                facilities for post-disaster assistance in the event that the primary facilities have
                become unusable.
Policy S-8.4    Public Education: Make information available to residents on methods to reduce
                the dangers from natural hazards, fire, and crime, and encourage neighborhood
                groups to become involved in prevention and emergency response programs.
SAFETY CHAPTER                                                                                   VI-14
Policy S-8.5 Evacuation Routes: Identify and publicize evacuation routes to be used in
             emergencies.
             Evacuation routes can be roadways or trails that allow for orderly removal of
             people and possessions from an endangered area. California law requires that
             each city discuss and map its emergency evacuation routes in the Safety Element
             of the General Plan.
             At this time, the City of Lafayette has not adopted an evacuation routes plan of
             streets and trails. A study of evacuation routes will need to recognize that the
             City’s streets are generally narrow and winding, yet provide emergency access
             (including evacuation) for Lafayette, Moraga and portions of Orinda and
             unincorporated Contra Costa County.
             Program S-8.5.1: Maintain an emergency evacuation routes system. Consider
             establishing evacuation route standards, such as road widths.
             Program S-8.5.2: Encourage the use of trails as evacuation routes in the
             Emergency Operations Plan.
             Program S-8.5.3: Maintain designated evacuation routes in a passable condition at
             all times, as feasible.
             Program S-8.5.4: Publicize the City’s evacuation routes and other aspects of its
             Emergency Operations Plan.
Goal S-9     Maintain an effective medical emergency response system.
Policy S-9.1 Emergency Medical Service: Work to improve emergency medical response
             service in Lafayette.
             Program S-9.1.1: Periodically monitor the response time for emergency medical
             response service in Lafayette and coordinate with providers to maintain adequate
             service.
SAFETY CHAPTER                                                                           VI-15
