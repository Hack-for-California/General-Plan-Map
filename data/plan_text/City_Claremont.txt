Southern California                Making a distinct impression are the tree lined
streets the friendly and inviting atmosphere of The Village the stately

foresight        and deliberation         of  our   founders          the   principled decision
making of our             leaders and the          intense interest and                vigilance that
residents apply          to  preserve what has been established                       As Claremont
continues to mature in its second                  100 years          we   look     to  continue           our

Defining Claremont Influences that
Continue to Shape Our Community
From the beginning      the   people of Claremont have recognized the
importance   of citizen  participatiof  in land  use planning as the best
method for proper    place making The community has been proactive
in guiding development by periodically coming together and setting
goals that help to define the public realm

Land Use Influences
Claremont had its beginnings               as a    railroad   town     with land speculation
as  the first real     business
In the real       estate   boom of the          I 880s    land developers found          a  spot
along the Santa Fe railway line with                     an outstanding        view   of Mount
Baldy and platted the City of Claremont in 1887                            The City s identity
became that of a college town when a small liberal arts college of the
New England style moved here from Pomona in 1888 With the move
of Pomona         College to Claremont eventually the City became                       home      to
The Claremont          Colleges seven institutions of higher learning
The     City   evolved    to  become      a  leader within the citrus industry           as  well
and later        as  a  desired residential community                  Much of Claremont s
urban form reflects the history of the community                         Many of the qualities
that define Claremont today               were     established during Claremont s early
history including the layout of residential districts and the walkable
intimate layout ofThe Village
The residents held their first Town Meeting in 1889                               This  was     the

 Claremont has always been                an   innovator in land         use  regulation The
 City   was    incorporated      in  1907 and quickly produced the first City Plan
 in 1909        In 1925      the   City   was     also   one   of the first in California        to
 establish     a  Planning Commission
 As in many cities early Claremont property owners placed restrictive
 covenants on where non Caucasians could live in the City                              Mexican
 Americans held many jobs in the                    citrus  industry and      at The   Colleges
 and     many of these           residents       were    forced    to    live  in  one   of   two
                        the East Barrio Arbol Verde and                     small  area  west    of

After World        War II      a   number of factors helped transform the
community      once    again     The    demand for housing combined with a
disease that killed off many of the citrus groves and the opening of the
San Bernardino Freeway Interstate 10 all contributed to the growth
of the City In 1944 a Postwar Planning Committee was created With
easy access to Los Angeles and beyond Claremont became an ideal
location   to  raise   a  family      The citrus groves          were    developed     into
housing tracts
Growth pressures in 1956 led the             City   to  adopt   its first  professionally
prepared    General Plan        led  by renowned city planner Simon Eisner
The   Plan    anticipated     the completion of the surrounding freeway
network and established four major northsouth routes through the
City    The General Plan also contained master plans for land use
streets    sewers      and   parks      and   was     followed      by   a   new    zoning
ordinance
Reflecting   the tremendous growth in the area              a  new   General Plan      was
drafted in     970 that called for       a city of 50 000 residents            Claremont
never   grew that     large   and    growth   had slowed         by   the time the     City
updated the General Plan          in  98     The    goals of the      98    Plan included
careful management and maintenance of existing streets                       preservation
of the hillsides and     a  Historic Preservation Element that established                 a
demolition      delay    policy     for   structures      identified     as    historically
important
Hillside Influences
Community       concern     about hillside development           began    to  build in the
  970s   as   more    and    more     housing    tracts were constructed            in the
foothills of surrounding communities In               975 the Claremont League of
Women Voters conducted             a two  year   study    of the issue which resulted
in a number of recommendations                how to control                         in the
                                           on
                                                                    development
local hillsides
                 to  the  public s    concern      the   City began the process of
 In response
developing    new    p licies governing hillside        development The first step
was   adoption of the         Natural Environment Element of the City s
General Plan in        977    which spelled out the City s general goals and
policies regarding hillside development It stated that development                        in
the hillsides is    acceptable provided        it is done with extreme care in             a
manner     that is   compatible with the       environment and keeps the              area
relatively safe from hazards such            as   fire flood      and erosion       These
policies  formed the framework for the later Hillside Ordinance
The    198     General Plan         also focused       on   development        within the
Claremont hillsides        leading to adoption         of a   Hillside Ordinance that
successfully balances the community s hillside open space preservation
and housing goals The innovative ordinance includes a program for
the transfer of development credits to balance open space preservation
goals with private property owner economic interests

Community Character Influences
The focus     on  community design and historic preservation is especially
important     in Claremont     The community has demonstrated a strong
desire to preserve its past while     planning for its future
Claremont is unique among foothill communities with its strong New
England     flavor      When     Pomona    College   was    being planned     the
decision was made to reflect the founders New           England heritage     The
result is a  community that has      a more  intimate feel than its neighbors
The residential character of the community         was   determined very early
in the   City s history      In 903 community leaders developed design
standards that required placing buildings back away from the street
with garages and other accessory buildings at the          rear of the property
These setbacks      are a common     feature in older residential  areas
By the I 920s Claremont began a process of upgrading its civic center
and fully integrating The Claremont Colleges into the urban fabric To
gain additional control over the aesthetic of new development the City
formed an Architectural Commission in 965                By 968 The Village
was beginning to show its age and The Village Planning Task Force
  as  created      The Task Force recommended retaining the intimate
character ofThe       Village at a time when urban renewal      was  the popular
trend This decision ensured that the pedestrian scale walkable central
business district that     we enjoy today could   remain     This vision for The
Village  was    reaffirmed in the 1987   Village Design  Plan
To protect the design and aesthetic qualities of all neighborhoods and
business districts in 991 the City enacted regulations that required all
new   structures to be    subject to a design review process
                                                                                             PAGE  2 6

Heritage Preservation Influences
The historic preservation        movement     in Claremont     really began     to take
hold in the mid l 970s           This community driven          initiative   has been
instrumental in      shaping Claremont s approach        to  managing     its valuable
cultural  resources
The Historic Claremont          Zoning   District was    established in 1970        and
the Arbol Verde       Zoning   District was   created in 1991      In 1979     Russian
Village  was    listed in the National   Register  as a historic   neighborhood
In 1977    a  historic  resource   survey was started with       a grant
from the State Office of Historic Preservation              Claremont
Heritage      a   non  profit organization     was  formed and has
been responsible for continually updating the          Register      The
Register    is   an  inventory of local sites of architectural or
historic merit       Since I 981 when the Register was adopted
formally by     the  City  over  1 000  structures   have been listed
To encourage reinvestment in historic properties that are
threatened by demolition or are surrounded by non historic
or  commercial       structures   the   City implemented      the Mills
Act in 2000

In response to the community s desire to maintain Claremont s long                        The Sumner House is     a fine example of one of
established land use patterns further hillside preservation objectives
                                                                                          Claremont s Victorian structures that has great

those qualities that define Claremont
Density and Intensity
When describing         areas   of Claremont     we   differentiate    one   area   from
another by the principal       use  whether it is homes      residential     shops and
restaurants       commercial      manufacturing     businesses      business    park    a
park or a school       or college   To describe the intensity of use         how much
development        exists on a property or could be built            and presumably
what the associated activity level is          land  use  planners    have    developed
quantitative measures called density and intensity
The   term    density typically applies to residential uses and refers to the
population and development capacity of residential land                     Density is
described in       terms   of  dwelling   units per acre of land         du    ac   and
population     per acre of land    pop   ac

For commercial          industrial      and other nonresidential         uses     intensity
describes the degree         to   which  a  property is   or can   be developed        The
measure     of intensity Claremont has adopted is the floor             area  ratio    The
floor  area  ratio    or   FAR       describes the relationship between the total
square    footage   of development         on a  lot and the     area of that lot      The
FAR is determined by            dividing the gross   floor  area   of all buildings    on a

Business Park Land Use             Designations
Two categories        provide    areas   for business       park development one
intended    to sustain   long established districts that support         light industrial
and commercial businesses             and the second        to   facilitate the    master
planning of     a large former     quarry property The key distinction is that
commercial      uses  within the Business Park category are limited to office
businesses      intended    largely  to  serve    a   local market with ancillary
supportive retail       uses    whereas     the   Mixture       of Commercial         and
Business       Park    category     allows   for     regional serving        commercial
businesses and employment           centers

Implications of Land Use Policy
Table 2 2 identifies the    planned  distribution of land  uses    Over time     as
properties   transition from      one  use  to  another   or   property    owners
rebuild   land  uses  and intensities will   gradually   shift to align   with the
intent of this Land Use Element         Table 2 2 summarizes the land           use
distribution average level       development anticipated and the resultant
residential and nonresidential levels of development that can be
expected from full implementation of land use policies established by
this General Plan      Given the almost built out character of Claremont
and the good condition of most          buildings significant redevelopment
activities may not occur over the life of this General Plan               Average
development densities and potential presented             in Table 2 2 reflect
primarily   established densities with limited opportunities for         recycling
to more intensified   development

                                    13     dwelling units represents the total of
all such categories The Hillside Residential            Overlay is factored in by
adding   the maximum      housing credits allowed within the cluster areas
Institutional  uses   such as Pilgrim Place are also included based upon
the number of residential units within each Institutional          use   Mixed Use
designations    also contribute to the total       Acres within each Mixed Use
category   are  divided into residential and commercial          uses   as  indicated
by the Residential Commercial Ratio assumption This ratio identifies
the portion of the Mixed Use area assumed to be residential

Estimated   Population
Estimated     Population     is  calculated      by multiplying      the   Projected
Dwelling   Units by   two  factors number of persons per household 2 70
and the occupancy rate 0 976            The number of persons per household
and the occupancy rate will change year to year but for projection
purposes the City has used year 2005 estimates from the California
Department of finance Demographic Unit for                 the City   of Claremont
College students from The Claremont Colleges               are also factored in by
incorporating the projected number of students             7 555   in year 2025     as
prOjected by staff from The Colleges

Estimated   Square Footage
Estimated      Square footage accounts for all building area of
n   nresidential   buildings meaning commercial business park and
institutional uses      The projection for nonresidential development is
calculated by multiplying the land use net acres for each land use
category by     an  assumed average by the floor area ratio or fAR see
pages 2 7    to  2 8 for a description of the FAR              The result is then
converted from      acres to square     feet2  This  yields the estimated square
feet    The numbers used in Table 2 2             are
                                                        presented as a thousand

Our     History of Appreciating Community Design
Good design has always been             an  integral component of the City           Well
planned     landscaping         architecture      design     of   public   spaces      site
planning and other elements that were important when Claremont was
founded influenced design throughout the twentieth century and
established the community design that represents Claremont today
Architecture is important in Claremont Many buildings built during the
first 50 years of the City s existence still stand today                   Architectural
styles  that reflect classic California         architecture        such   as  Victorian
Spanish      Colonial     Monterey          Colonial    Revival      Mission     Revival
Craftsman and Classical Revival                 are  all represented in Claremont
Landscaping       and    tree    planting     have    always      been   important for
Claremont     as  well     Thousands of large         mature     trees and   landscaped
parkways     are  the result of past actions and policies
Over the      years    Claremont        has    adopted      revised    and    continually
amended its       design    review     process    to   reflect current     values while
preserving past ideals          The  City   has adopted     specific design guidelines
for  some areas        for example the original              feel of The Village has
been    preserved by The Village Design Guidelines which call for
pedestrian scale designs attractive landscaping and on street parking
Guidelines for        northeast Claremont provide for an ambiance
reminiscent of the      City s agrarian period including streetscapes with
rock swales and      street   lights placed only at major intersections
Claremont s      design     review      process     policies     and   guidelines     also
reiterate  the community         s  tradition of restoring structures instead of
demolishing them           Examples include the renovation of Lang Art

Community Character Concepts
Places that evoke emotions                  places    that provide    spaces for incidental
events  or  activities       locations
                             and                 that tell stories   are the type of places
that C1aremonters value                 This is   placemaking        Placemaking    involves
recognizing the needs of pedestrians creating outdoor rooms for
events and catering to the experiences of users                      The components that
make    up    such     areas           in  Claremont       are   vibrant   activity   nodes

to
   creating and sustaining places that distinguish                 our  community
The following concepts include components that                          create   place   and
connections       Incorporating            elements such       as  gateways    landscaping
parks   paseos     plazas and other enhancements                    into public and private
development will help        maintain the             community s values of        a diverse
and interesting small        town

Activity Nodes
The vitality and vibrancy of a city     can  be felt at  activity nodes     Whether
these nodes    center  on   commercial    or  recreational   uses   they   are major
destinations    often   at  compact    areas    and   serve   as   the   hub of the
neighborhood        In Claremont compact          development       patterns and    a
commercial downtown          provide   many    opportunities for activity nodes
Mixed use projects and transit oriented development provide potential
for new activity nodes Activity nodes contain elements that strengthen
and communicate Claremont s community identity because they
accommodate        pedestrian           and    allow                           where  Activity        in The     Village

Focal Intersections
Intersections    can  become focal      centers   when they      are  enhanced by
public  art  paving   at crosswalks and landscaping           These intersections
serve   as  destinations     especially when     corner   buildings    are  used for
busy  commercial     uses    Special  surface treatments such        as  stamped  or
colored brick crosswalks give        preference   to
                                                     pedestrians     and encourage
walking      Abundant landscaping at intersections enhances aesthetic
quality and provides garden like space in an urban setting                     Trees
provide a streetscape that is visually pleasing and which provides a
comfortable    walking   environment
Nationally Registered    and  Significant  Historic  Buildings
Claremont     is  home     to   numerous    buildings listed     on    the  National

Claremont Club House and old                  stone   buildings scattered throughout
northern     Claremont             These      highly recognizable buildings are
important cultural resources to the community Policies for creating a
sense of place will continue to encourage efforts to renovate historic
buildings instead of demolishing them
Public Places     Places     to  Gather
Public   gathering places          can  include     plazas
squares     parks sidewalks and             paseos      and
areas   such   as    in front     of  City   Hall   or   the
Hughes      Community            Center     But     private
development       can     include public spaces as
well    with   arcades          fountains      and well
designed      paseos        The      City     encourages
developers      to     incorporate       public     plazas
within    the   most       intensely     active     places
Plazas    may    be provided by public and                or
private      sector        initiative      but      should
accommodate         public       use     Public     plazas
should be located        at  or near   the   same    grade
as  adjacent sidewalks and the dimensions
must   match their surroundings              Plazas should be defined          spaces that
enhance the     street    environment without harmful              interruptions    in retail Places to Gather
and    pedestrian        continuity      Public      plazas      should     accommodate
                                                                                              In front of City Hall and along the sidewalks in
comfortable human occupation and                 use   with   art and fountains      as  well
                                                                                              The Village are excellent example of ptaces
as seating and shade                                                                          where the  community can gather
The    Village     incorporates        many       such     features      and   as   foothill
Boulevard makes the transition             to  a new    mixed    use   pedestrian friendly
environment these         same     concepts will be applied
Parks and Schools
Parks      and      schools        are    traditionally       associated       with     local
neighborhoods         and     this pattern      is  appropriate       to  Claremont        A
desirable    balance       between      residential      land    use    and   open     space
resources    should be achieved           to   meet social and recreational needs
Each   neighborhood         should have convenient           access to a local park and
school preferably           within    or    directly adjacent to its boundaries
However some outlying neighborhoods are not currently well served in
this regard Parkland needs are discussed in Chapter 5
Creating Connections                Access and       Linkages
A city with vibrant activity nodes           cannot   be successful if these      areas   are
not   accessible     to   all   community members                In Claremont        streets
sidewalks     and trails allow automobile              bike and      pedestrian traffic to
connect        Major arterial roads provide regional linkages and
opportunities to beautify streetS through landscaping                        Local streets
support pedestrian            movement            Properly      located    and     designed
gateways identify the boundaries at which these connections meet AIl
these    elements        unite      various      places within Claremont while
distinguishing the City from its surroundings
                                                                                                                               PAGE          2 27

Preserving the small town feel           of Claremont involves preserving           a
pedestrian friendly environment           Claremonters value well landscaped
secure   clean and human scaled neighborhoods and business districts
that accommodate walking             It is important   to  provide linkages that
connect
           neighborhoods      to  schools     community centers parks and
commercial services
Landscaped Corridors
Landscaped       corridors improve the visual quality of the community s
major arterials with abundant landscaping and trees The design of
these  streets    should  serve  as a  physical  and visual    complement    to   the
community s        open   space   network      These    corridors   should     have
generous medians and         parkways      that support extensive landscaping
and  street trees     They should also accommodate distinctive gateways
at the City s boundaries
                                                                                       Landscaped Corridor
                                                                                        Foothill Boulevard is an excellent example of a
                                                                                       landscaped corridor in Claremont
Landscape corridors should include            continuous    sidewalks with wide
parkways       that  establish   a   physical and     psychological     separation
between     pedestrians    and autos      Benches and     pedestrian   scaled   light
fixtures should      also be    included     where   appropriate     to  create     a
comfortable       and  friendly atmosphere        Street    trees  should    be     of
appropriate height and stature for the scale and function of the            street
flowering     trees and shrubs may be included for color interest and to
augment the appearance of the         street
Neighborhood Pathways Linkages           and Connection Points
Many of Claremont s           neighborhoods are pedestrian oriented with
design features that encourage walking              Sidewalks bikeways and
other    connection       points    provide accessibility between parks
neighborhoods activity nodes and transit facilities These connection
points create an efficient pedestrian system and allow for a
person     to    sense    feel and visualize the community
environment
Gateways
Simply     gateways signify a transition from           one   area  to
another     The goal of gateway creation is              to   enhance

Three     types of gateways are established in Claremont Major
Gateways Secondary Gateways and Neighborhood Gateways Major
Gateways are larger entryways typically located on major streets near
freeway on and off ramps see figure 2 5 These gateways are
considered the primary entrances into the City of Claremont and are on
the City s most traveled streets             Secondary Gateways are smaller

Architecture
Claremont s charm and comfort is in its variety of architectural styles
that give each building distinction        Many buildings         are visually pleasing
create a sense of     belonging      and   are stimulating          New   buildings  and
renovations     should    continue     to  be   compatible        with the scale     and
massing of adjacent buildings and respect                 a  site s context within the
larger community
Building Design

Claremont s buildings           It is the intent of the City to protect the
character of its many neighborhoods              Neighborhood preservation           is a
key community goal           and the      City opposes new           development     that
detracts from the     neighborhoods        Claremont supports the preservation
of the existing housing stock and its architectural aesthetic
Additions should be        respectful of the architectural style of the main
portion of the      existing building Architectural treatments should be
extended to all     elevations of the buildings e g shutters multi paned
windows belt     courses    rock brick stone veneers etc

the community        provide opportunities for public exposure to the visual
arts acknowledge our local artistic community and inspire pride and
identity among community residents The City s Community Art
Program Ordinance requires that new development subject to
implementation thresholds incorporate pieces of art or pay in lieu fees
for future art works
Street Furniture
furnishing the public realm         with street furniture      can  provide   moments
of rest for pedestrians      and allow  room     for passive activities      Just as the
furniture in interior spaces of our homes and offices accommodate our
individual needs street furniture encourages more pedestrian activity
and   adds    to   the   vitality of places like The Village              and   foothill
Boulevard          Even mundane         features      like   refuse    containers    and
newspaper      racks   can   be  specially designed       to reflect our   identity  and

when planted with a diverse array of plants and flowers can serve to
direct traffic and beautify our neighborhoods Canopies of trees along
residential streets bring intimacy to public streets while providing shade
for pedestrians
Landscaping      within commercial       areas    and   parking lots can change       the
character      of   otherwise       bland     asphalt    dominated      environments

Trees and      landscaping       have been        a significant  part of Claremont since
its founding       The careful attention given           to trees  and landscaping    over
the years is evident today in the appearance of streetscapes along such
roadways      in Claremont           On foothill Boulevard          eucalyptus  trees   line

Claremont s      beginnings         The   City s backdrop     of the San    Gabriel
Mountains and recurring theme of the alluvial rocks known                 fondly  as
 Claremont Potatoes            are such examples     These native river rocks tell
a  history of the rivers that used to flow through the area These rocks
line  meandering pathways and medians and dress up surfaces of
drainage swales The rocks also serve as exterior finishes of buildings
walls   and columns            In Russian Village     houses   use  river rocks to
delineate entryways           front  yards    and  as  landscaping    and   building
material    Residents allover Claremont continue to            use native stones to
build walls and other outdoor features             Such features     are  especially
prominent    in  neighborhoods       in northeast Claremont

Heritage Preservation
Heritage preservation has            become    one    of the   defining features     of life in
Claremont         The City has       made available        a  number of programs that
facilitate    the    rehabilitation      and    reuse      of   historic   structures      and
environments           These programs include the              Register    of Structures of
Historic and Architectural Merit of the                   City of Claremont         State of
California historical registration programs                 the Mills Act the Historic
Building    Code and the National           Register     of Historic Places
Register of Structures of Historic and
Architectural Merit of the City of Claremont
In 1980       the City created the           Claremont       Register of Structures of
Historic and Architectural Merit of the                   City of Claremont the City
Register        Since then the       City Register      has been reviewed and revised
With several additions             Over 1 000 properties have been listed since
 1980
Anyone with          an    ownership      interest     in  a   property may        initiate   a
proposal     to  add his    or  her property     to  the  City Register      The   City may
also initiate the        process      No    owner     consent     is required    for   listing
Proposals       are brought before the Architectural Commission                  at  a  public
hearing       The Architectural Commission                uses   the criteria   adopted by
the City    Council      to  determine whether the property should be listed
Any    action   by the Commission         may be      appealed     to the  City Council
A property listed        on  the City   Register    is  subject   to  a mandatory 90 day
delay      and     listing     triggers    environmental          review     of   significant
modifications      to   the property       The intent of the demolition delay is to
allow the     City   time to     explore alternatives with the applicant such as
relocation     or adaptive      reuse   and possible mitigation to reduce possible
adverse impacts from demolition Master plans or other major projects
must take      into consideration any                        the

Mills Act
lr   1972    California State Sena       or James Mills introduced       a bill known
as    the Mills Act to grant property           tax  relief   to  owners   of  qualified
historic properties The Mills Act is a preservation tool created by the
California legislature to encourage the preservation and restoration of
historic properties          The act enables cities         to   enter into historical
property agreements with             owners   of   qualifying properties      that will
result in reductions       to  the  owner s   property     taxes     The agreements
provide      a  benefit   to   cities   in that  they    ensure
                                                                    preservation    and
guarantee authentic rehabilitations and            a high    level of maintenance of
cultural    resources   important    to  communities
Cities    are not mandated to approve historical property agreements and
citi es    have   considerable discretion in evaluating requests                       In

Celebrating and Preserving Our
Neighborhoods
Claremont     has  many   distinct neighborhoods that were developed
during  different periods of time each   neighborhood having a character
of its own  in terms of housing styles development patterns streetscape
design and building scale and mass Our business districts also reflect
periods of our history and The Claremont Colleges have carefully
planned their campuses to respect the past while providing modern
buildings that blend with the stately older buildings Residents celebrate
the uniqueness of their own neighborhoods and respect the desire of
others to maintain the qualities that distinguish their surroundings
In this General Plan    we  describe the distinguishing characteristics of
each Claremont neighborhood and business district identified      on
                                                                     figure

preserve and against which we will assess new      development proposals
pursuant to the goals and policies contained in this Element

Abilene Way is        one   of the smallest        neighborhoods        in
Claremont       A residential neighborhood               it is accessed
via  a   single     unpaved       road     from      Radcliffe      Drive
Adding    to the rustic character          of the     neighborhood is
the lack of curbs        or  gutters     and     the neighborhood s
proximity    to   Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden and
the Bernard Field Station           Each single family residence
was  developed      at  a  different time with          no

The    Arbol       Verde      neighborhood           is    an
important      piece     of  Claremont s          heritage
Like many         parts   of Southern          California
much of the residential          areas    of Claremont
were  once    under restrictive deed           covenants
Arbol      Verde       was      one      of      the     few
neighborhoods         where      Mexican Americans
could live in the area Part of           an  area     better known      as the Barrio the
neighborhood       was located at the        edge of the City and extended east of
the San Bernardino County boundary into Upland and Montclair The
area   flourished      from    the     1920s      up    until    1973   when    Claremont
Boulevard     was    constructed through the middle of the                   neighborhood
and Sacred Heart         Chapel     the heart of the community            was  demolished
to accommodate the         new   road
Arbol Verde is      a  single family     re   idential    neighborhood which includes
a  park The        area s   landscaping         is   lush     reflecting the age of the
development         The homes         are   predominately single story with some
variations     Homes     are  arrayed     at the   perimeter of several short blocks
There    are no    alleys    The primary residential streets              are  Brooks and

one  time residents could access the          portion of the neighborhood east of
the  County boundary          via Blanchard         Place but the completion of
Claremont       Boulevard        isolated     the     different      portions      of    the
neighborhood
Within Arbol Verde is       an  interesting historic development known as the
Intercultural Homes         Developed      in 1947 by the Intercultural Council
the   residential   area    was    a   radical     idea   to   create     an   integrated
intercultural living experience         in  a   time    of racial segregation            As
originally designed      the 12 hand built International            Style   homes     were
arrayed around a common             area     Since that time         the  common       area
has been divided among the residences

Located within the Claremont hillsides           along
Mountain Avenue            is  the   Claraboya High
Point    neighborhood              This     residential
neighborhood consists         of single family homes
and   townhomes           The    neighborhood       was
developed in the early I 960s with an
emphasis on providing residents outstanding
views of the Pomona Valley and beyond At one time                     a second phase
was  proposed      for additional residential units and       a
                                                                 golf course   on  what
is known   as Johnson       s Pasture
Access   to the     neighborhood      is restricted to Mountain Avenue              The
street pattern is    a  series of terraced setbacks with        single loaded   streets
The homes     are on     the downhill side and     help  facilitate the unobstructed
views    In the single family        area   the north south       streets     including
Mountain Avenue           San Andres Way          and San Angelo Drive               are

9pen space The homes are set close to the street edge with minimal
front yards and no sidewalks             The homes are generally single story
with attached garages

in the  High Point complex Similar to other parts of the Claraboya
neighborhood the buildings are terraced into the hillside Access is
provided by single loaded streets on the upslope with entryways and
garages along the street There are no setbacks or sidewalks Beyond
the entryways each residential unit has unobstructed views                     In 2003
 15 homes in the        Claraboya High      Point  neighborhood       were   destroyed
and others   damaged by the Grand           Prix fire
Neighborhood           V sion             The   key for the future        is  to   allow

Club     In 1980 and 1981      the residential units around the Club
were     built   The Claremont Club continues                 to  expand     its

The    non
            profit   status    of The      Colleges prohibits
them from using the state and federal                tax   credits
available for restoration of historic                  buildings
which sometimes discourages preservation work
because of the prohibitive costs of restoration and
maintenance         Fortunately The Colleges and the
City have worked together to ensure that the
highest standards of architectural integrity are
maintained Although this requires coordination
and collaboration the net result is an outstanding
collection of buildings that respect each other and

restrictions     require    infill    development        that    is
compatible     with   surrounding development                This
district   includes   Sycamore School Claremont s
oldest elementary school and Memorial Park the City s                      central park
The    neighborhood      streets     are  based    on   a

  ontrast to most of the residential         areas    within the     City    which tend   to
follow    a  post 1960s suburban roadway pattern of cul de sacs and
collectors     The district takes full advantage of its location near The
Claremont     Colleges    and The       Village     The    area   features high     quality
homes      of various architectural         styles    including Victorian          Spanish
Colonial     Revival   and     Craftsman         Not only does the             diversity of
architectural styles provide visual interest the variety of scale makes
for a very pleasant pedestrian experience as one travels along the tree
lined sidewalks      for  example       one can    find  a
                                                           large   house     on the  corner
and   a small   house  at  mid block All       new    additions     are   reviewed by the
Architectural      Commission         for   compatibility with          the    surrounding
development
The    land   use   is primarily single family residential                  However      the
neighborhood       contains     examples      of   multi  family     dwelling    units  that
were   builtprior to 1970 after which            time   multiple family housing         was
not   allowed      Another feature is the large number of guest houses
 second units       constructed before strict          regulations      for second units
were   first adopted   in 1985

One of the    City s largest    residential neighborhoods North Claremont
was    developed mostly       in the  1970s     primarily by    two    development
companies Armstrong           and Rosemount            In addition    some    of the
development     was   completed by     Lewis    Homes      The   result  is a single
family suburban subdivision of winding streets cul de sacs and larger
lots The one and two story Santa Fe and Ranch style homes are set
back from the street        and connected by       a  network of sidewalks and
trails      The     Thompson Creek Recreation Trail forms the
neighborhood     s  northern    edge The community is well served by a
number of public amenities including La Puerta Sports Park 1982
Jaeger Park 1978 Vail Park 1982                       and the private Western

Northeast Claremont         was   one area   of focus for the 1981 General
Plan     and   since    I 981    considerable      discussion    has    occurred
regarding the appropriate intensity and density of development for
this area In 1987 the City adopted a zoning designation of Rural
Claremont and        specific design guidelines       that apply   to  this  area
The guidelines encourage         use of local materials such      as  rock walls
citrus groves   and minimal lighting and call for maintaining mountain
vjstas    Rock swales    are  used instead of curbs and gutters
Northeast Claremont has           changed significantly     from when it      was
initially designated    Rural Claremont          Executive homes ranging in
size from modest to very       large and  in a  variety of architectural styles
now    dominate the    area      As the   area   has   developed    distinct sub
neighborhoods      were   created
Blaisdell Ranch
Blaisdell Ranch     was    subdivided prior    to 1987   as  ready  to build lots
For the    most    part the homes     were     individually built and vary in
architectural  style   The lots and home sizes tend          to be smaller than
others in Northeast Claremont            Central to the neighborhood is          a

One     of    the     earliest     large scale        suburban

Oakmont           At    the    heart    of    the    Oakmont
neighborhood       is   Oakmont        Elementary       School

Pooch Park      1996      Other  neighborhood        amenities
include    San     Antonio      High School and the
Claremont Adult School Although many of the single family ranch
style homes remain in their original configuration a trend that began in
the   1990s    has    resulted    in   several     second story     additions      The
Peppertree shopping         center   and   a
                                              high density residential project are
also located   at the edge of       this neighborhood Maintaining the overall
neighborhood character will be          a critical issue
The   street  pattern is characterized by           typical  suburban development
with cul de   sacs    and   connections      to  the surrounding neighborhoods
including Vista      Along the major streets the pedestrian experience is
enhanced by     a  narrow planter with trees that separates walkways from
the street   The other      streets   only feature     a sidewalk  directly along the
curb

                Indian Hill Boulevard
                and east of Mountain
                Avenue
Old Claremont        was   developed   as
the  City s   first major     residential
expansion            following        the
development         of    the    Historic
Claremont          District          Built
primarily between the           1920s   and   early     I 950s    the   neighborhood
features many structures that are listed on the            City s  Historic   Register
Consistent with          Claremont s historic grid            the   Old     Claremont
neighborhood       is compact     and connected       to   Historic Claremont and
The   Village     In  most  of Old Claremont      pedestrian      access   is provided
by  narrow    sidewalks       The homes      are  set   back from the street with
garages and accessory         buildings typically   accessed by alleyways           The
structures    are    primarily single story      with     many fine      examples of
                               construction and
contemporary post         war
                                                   design
Within Old Claremont is         a  small residential     area  known    as   University
Circle     This development        was   built between       1938 and      1951     The
homes feature minimal setbacks and lot            areas    that  are  less than 5 000
square feet        Most of the homes          within    University    Circle share      a
common      architectural language

their pilgrimage   of Christian faith and service to others
An outstanding example            of urban residential design             this intimate
community       of  small     cottages     and    attached       units    surrounds    a
community complex and gathering place                      The community is well
marked with ceremonial gateways             The street pattern departs from the
surrounding grid        winding    around      the    neighborhood framing the
community complex           at  the   center     and     providing for a pleasant
pedestrian experience          The residential units         were    built by different
builders   but the community conforms             to   a  basic   set  of architectural
standards that result in     a cohesive neighborhood

Towne      Ranch   was one     of the first subdivisions built in Claremont
following   World War II The        custom lot subdivision was developed by
long  time   property owner      Stuart    Towne His goal was to attract a
diverse population with      a mix   of   quality homes and reasonable prices

The physical design of the district             east   of Indian Hill Boulevard          was
established   by   the 1987      Village Design     Plan which stated that the           City
should enhance the            pedestrian     nature     of the district maintain the

to 40 feet and                                only one story        Most buildings have
                   many structures are
no  setback from the sidewalk             helping   to  contribute     to the well defined
and distinct outdoor         room     effect along the      streets       The addition of
street   furniture     and    sidewalk cafes        has    enhanced        the  pedestrian
experience
Several large commercial            structures    located   along     the railroad tracks
do  not  share the     same    high level of architectural integrity found within
the rest of The Village These buildings along First Street have much
larger mass than the surrounding buildings and the retail uses are
depressed slightly below grade and set back from the street
Several older homes within The Village have been built north of Bonita
Avenue along Harvard and Harrison Avenues                              The preservation
and or adaptive reuse of these homes is encouraged
                                               Development        within The Village is
                                               reviewed       by      the     Architectural

parts      As The      Village    has expanded         west   across
Indian Hill Boulevard opportunities have increased                   to
enhance      pedestrian        activity    within     and    beyond
Claremont s     core
Historically the      area west    of Indian Hill was the heart
of Claremont s citnls industry             Farmers would        bring
their goods     to
                    tlle packing      houses to be shipped by
rail to  destinations throughout the United States and
around the world
By the mid I 970s the         citrus  industry had moved         out   of Claremont
and the industrial        area   did   not attract    new   businesses         By the
early I 990s     the   City recognized       that The     Village    would have      to
grow if it   were    to  remain    economiqilly       competitive      in the  region
Constrained       on    the   east   by    The   Colleges       on    the   north by
residential   areas     and south by the railroad tracks the only way                to
meet    this need    was to     expand     across    Indian Hill Boulevard           In
January 200 I       the City Council       adopted    the  Village Expansion Specific
Plan with the      goal   to  encourage retail and commercial               uses that   were

In the fall of 1928         a group of people       Padua
Hills     Incorporated        interested in saving the
foothills bought about 2 200            acres   of land in
the Claremont Hillsides               They    decided to
subdivide         the      land    and     construct       a
community center and theatre for the area
They hoped that the residents would be a
mix of artists           writers   craftsmen       rich   or
poor        in   money         with    the    education
background          and     appreciation that would
enable       them      to   enjoy homes        at   Padua

A Plan for the
Foothill Boulevard Corridor
Background
Foothill Boulevard is   one  of the defining physical  features of Claremont
and  was  a historic transportation link   to the rest   of the United States
In 1926 the dusty road    was  designated part of Route 66 also known as
the  Mother Road      or the  Main Street of America         Route 66 passed
through    Claremont connecting Chicago to Santa Monica                   The
                                                                               Foothill Boulevard
highway   was  a key transportation   corridor  during  the  Great Depression
and Post War America         For many    newcomers    to  the West Route 66    looking west near the corner of Foothill
                   of dreams                                                   Boulevard and Indian Hill Boulevard
was  the highway
Throughout    the years the character and function of Foothill Boulevard
have   changed       Some     of the   major    changes include      the local
deactivation of the Route 66 moniker in 1984        In 2002 the extension of
the 210   Freeway significantly changed regional transit patterns No
longer  was   Foothill Boulevard a major congested pathway between

part of the development pattern with more retail and services business
targeting the surrounding residential neighborhoods There should be
places for people to gather including plazas and other distinct centers

Creating    such    an   environment is known as           placemaking        As Dan

and Executive         Director      of  Walkable       Communities       Inc    states
  Placemaking      is  the practice     of carefully designing       good places for
people        The outcome        is a center that       provides opportunities for
chance meetings and social interaction it provides a sense of safety and
security The area is designed and managed to reduce stress for
everyone Placemaking provides afeeling of identity and self worth
To achieve       the vision for Foothill Boulevard that the                community
  efined   as  part of the 2004 charrette process            the  City will prepare a
Specific Plan that incorporates the land use goals described in this
Chapter as well as the circulation enhancements defined in Chapter 4
Community Mobility The Specific Plan will also define enhancements
to the public realm and design guidelines for private development
Old School House
The Old School House              OSH        located at the northwest        corner  of
Foothill Boulevard and Indian Hill Boulevard                  was   the community s
high  school until    a    new   high   school    was  built in the late 1 960s The
old   school    building    was    retrofitted    in the   1960s and      became the
Griswold    s   Old School       House      a   retail  center     Subsequently an
 adjacent hotel and restaurant were built the entire complex was
economically prosperous and the center became a major gathering
 place for the cOrr munity
 Over time the OSH facilities declined economically and                physically  and
since    1990     the     City  has    attempted to work with owners for
 redevelopment of the properties Planning principles were adopted to
 provide guidelines for the location amount type and quality of new
 and  or  rehabilitated    development      on  the hotel and OSH properties
 In 2005     the properties       were    acquired by a new owner intent on
 revitalizing the properties through implementation of the Planning
 Principles A SpeCific Plan for the site will incorporate new uses
 including residential units and additional commercial development

Claremont had its beltinnings         as  a  railroad     town  when the Santa Fe
    lilroad   Company extended        its route    from San Bernardino       to Los
    ni
Angeles in the late 1800s With the railroad came the business of land
speculation In concert with SiUlta Fe s building of its depot in 1887 the
  Pacific Land and Improvement Company put up a few houses a land
office and a large hotel to attract visitors to purchase the newly plaited
properties        lore than 300 lots were             ht sold and resold on the

In these very early days of Claremont higher education also provided
the community s foundation                   By the I 880s Eastern settlers had
already established such instiIutions as Chaffey College Occidental
College and the University of La Verne in other communities and the
Congregationalists looked to found their own college in Claremont after
considering sites as far east as Riverside                  In October of 1887 the
Board of Trustees of Pomona College authorized plotting of the college
grounds and planning for the first college building on Piedmont Mesa
The idea for more than one college first came under discussion in the
 I 920s          In 1925 The Claremont Colleges                 The Colleges     were
organized with one of their goals being to found new colleges Since
then The Colleges have grown to become the major employer in the
community
Agriculture also played a prominent role in forming the local economy
While the citrus industry contributed significantly beginning in the early
 1900s its dominance began to wane in the 1950s                         At that time
agricultural          land      became     increasingly valuable      for   residential
subdivisions to house the executives working at major busine ses in
surrounding cities By the mid I 970s the local citrus industry had died

Village       a  number of times

centers in the area                As of 2004 retail trade businesses represented
just over 18 percent of businesses in Claremont
As the        City has grown commercial business has expanded beyond the
historical       Village area to include enterprises along toothill Boulevard
and      Indian Hill Boulevard and at the I 0 freeway Indian Hill

surrounding the historic College Heights Orange and Lemon

Association      packing house      Importantly properties around the 10
Freeway interchange at Indian Hill Boulevard support uses that serve
the region and contribute significantly to the local tax base In the late
 t 9905 automobile dealerships established a strong presence in the
area     and these businesses represented roughly 70 percent of retail
sales tax generated in the City in 2003           While this contribution is
welcome continued heavy reliance        on  auto sales revenues could prove
problematic whenever vehicle sales experience low points as they did
in the early 19905 This caused many auto sales dependent cities to cut
municipal budgets dramatically
Similarly Claremont industrial bale hal been limited to small scale
manufacturing businesses concentrated along the railroad lines west of
Indian    Hill   Boulevard     The   establishment of    the I eck Graduate
Institute of Applied Life Sciences within this business park     area  in 2000
is   hoped  to  provide a  catalyst for growth of small biotechnology and
related businesses

Economic Conditions and Trends
Given the up       down
                   and       nature   of the economy it is important to have
an  understanding of the baseline conditions that can affect decision
making relating to land use and economic development Many factors
in the  local economy will vary from             year to year       The  following
descriptions provide snapshots of economic trends in Claremont
relating to socio economic economic development and market
conditions that were taken prior to development of the General Plan
Socio Economic Conditions
Reviewing     socia economic         conditions     helps   describe   the   social
characteristics   of Claremont residents that           can   influence  the local
economy
         In 2000 the median household income in the City of Claremont
         was  56 0 percent higher than that of Los Angeles County              as  a
         whole
         About 57 0 percent of Claremont s resident labor force                was
         employed       in Management and Professional Occupations in
         2000    Sales and Office occupations represented about 22 1
         percent of the resident labor force
         The Citys       popuiation   was    well educated In 2000      about     4
                                                                                  52
         percent of the population in Claremont age 25 years and older
         had received      a Bachelor s degree or higher        compared to 24 9
         percent in the County Only about 7 6 percent of the adult
         population in Claremont had not achieved a high school
         diploma compared to 30           1 percent in Los Angeles    County
Economic     Development
Understanding the economic development conditions in Claremont can
assist City staff and decision makers in making choices that contribute
to the growth of the local economy Such decisions can affect the sales
tax base  or the number of employment opportunities
         The Claremont Colleges with five undergraduate colleges and
         two  graduate institutions       are a  major  source  of employment in
         the  City and the area           with about 3 500      faculty and staff
         Student enrollment is estimated           at 6 000  In addition   Rancho
         Santa Ana Botanic Garden and                 the Claremont School        of
         Theology     are  affiliated   ith The Claremont Colleges
         According to the California Employment Development
         Department employment in the City grew from 10 081 to
                                                                                         PAGE   5
CITY      Of      CLAREMONT                 GENERAL           PLAN
         12 397 or by 23 0 percent between 1992 to 2000 The
        Services category experienced the strongest growth during this
        time period increasing by 3 018 jobs or 76 7 percent
        In 2000 the City s employment base             was  comprised primarily
        of service jobs       at 56 1   percent of the total employment         or
        6 952 jobs About 58 9 percent of these service jobs were in the
        Educational Service category reflecting the strength of The
        Claremont Colleges and Claremont Unified School District                as
        major employers
        During     2003     the City s estimated taxable retail sales       were
          383 9     million     which     consisted   primarily   of  Auto    and
        Transportation Sales At an estimated 268 1 million the Auto
        and Transportation Sales category comprised almost 70 0
        percent of the total taxable retail sales
        The City s overall per capita taxable retail sales of 10 648 is
        lower than that for Montclair Ontario and Chino reflecting
        leakage of retail sales to other communities The leakage is
        particularly high in General Merchandise and Apparel retail
        sales Other categories that show leakage include Eating and
        Drinking Places Home Furnishings and Other Retail
Marltet Conditions and Trends
Analysis  of market conditions      provides   a  general picture of the strength
of the market   or  market 5egJnent which        can  range anywhere from real
estate  construction       activity   office   or   commercial space leasing
demands    or  other market segments
        According      to the Construction Industry Research Board from
         1990   to  2003     most   of the  non   residential building activity in
        Claremont         was    commercial        Industrial  building   activity
        comprised slightly       more    than 10 0 percent of the total activity
        on an     average annual basis Tatal commercial valuation             was
        reported     to   average      15 million annually       while industrial
        valuation    was   reported   at   175 227 annually
        The City has       an  estimated 540 000 square feet of retail space
        with    no  large anchor      stores Most of the retail centers are
        neighborhood centers          with less than     100 000 square feet of
        space that include a grocery store anchor smaller retail           shops
        and     service oriented     businesses      Claremont    has tended    to
        attract many      small locally owned businesses rather than major
         retail chains
         Redevelopment of SOme existing centers may be challenging
         because of parcel configurations and problems with multiple
         ownerships Claremont has limited vacant land available for
         new commercial development Although many of the centers

            are   visible at busy intersections   or on   major  streets  they need
            modernization Attraction of major retail tenants has been
            difficult due   to competition from neighboring communities
            With     existing and planned major retail centers in nearby
            Upland         Montclair      and     Ontario        analysis     shows
            underperformance in the City s General Merchandise and
            Apparel retail categories This indicates potential opportunities
            for revitalization of underutilized        retail centers   as  well  as
            expansion in The Village and        reuse   of the Old School House
            site
  OUf     Spending Habits
  One economic challenge           we  face  as a   community is keeping local
  dollars in the local       economy     As noted above       many Claremonters
  shop  outside the community for        everyday    household goods Attracting
  additional establishments will remain         a   challenge because of limited
  land regional competition and the community s desire               to preserve its
  small town character
  Our Resources for Securing                                           a
  Sustainable Local Economy
  Despite limited commercial and industrial development in Claremont
  the City has been very resourceful in capturing significant tax revenues
  that fund the many public services and programs residents enjoy from
  activities for youth to senior citizen programs to service and education
  assistance to families of limited economic         means    to  celebration of the
  arts and culture       These all contribute to Claremont s quality of life and
  our  goal  to   preserve these important features of our        City requires that
  we    continue      creative   and   forward thinking      management of       our
  economic      resources        An   important    resource    in   the  community
r
  continues      to   be   the   Claremont    Chamber      of   Commerce       which
  historically     has    provided    community       leadership    in  support    of
  educational     an d civic organizations and programs
  We    do   not     envision    Claremont   as  a    major large scale regional
  commercial      or  industrial magnet   we  do not have the land resources to
  support this level of development            We have had some success in
  encouraging and accommodating businesses that attract and cater to
  visitors support most local retail and service needs and provide
  opportunities for growth of emerging clean industries                    Two key
  complementary tools the City will continue to employ are economic
  development and redevelopment                  The City will also continue
                                                                                          PAGE   7
CITY         Of      CLAREMONT                GENERAL                               PLAN
collaborative partnerships with the Claremont Chamber of Commerce
to provide a strong link between the business community and the City
Economic            Development
The City s economic development objectives have focused                                   on  business
retention and attraction       funding of visitor promotion activities provided
by the Claremont Chamber of Commerce and providing assistance to
small businesses amid other activities
The   City   collects General Fund       revenue      from various taxes and fees
including sales tax         property   tax    utility   tax   developer fees                    motor
vehicle    license     fees   business    licenses       franchise                   fees   and  hotel
occupancy      tax     Sales  tax alone   accounts      for almost                    a quarter of the
total General Fund          The City  accrues     most of its sales tax from Auto
and Transportation Sales which             amount to       approximately 70 percent
of total taxable sales        Claremont is experiencing         leakage in retail sales
to surrounding       cities particularly in General Merchandise and Apparel
retail This is due to the City s lack of anchor              stores                  and the presence
of smaller retail shops compared to larger retail centers                               Retail centers
in Claremont need rehabilitation and suffer loss due to competition
from retailers in adjacent communities
Since the City values the intimate and small town ambiance economic
growth    in Claremont will aim to support             shopping and                     entertainment
businesses that preserve this unique character and atmosphere                                   Retail
centers    will    be   upgraded through redevelopment                               to  help capture
revenue    lost  to  surrounding cities
The City benefits from proximity to its many educational institutions
The presence of The Claremont Colleges and its students especially
those with skills in high technology industry will benefit economic
development by attracting innovative                             oritechnolentoegyd        businesses
Highly regarded educational institutions and                  a  pool of skilled labor
create an economic environment conducive to                     growth in technology
firms within the City
The City will continue to work closely with the Claremont Chamber of
Commerce        to   develop assistance programs to encourage cooperative
dialogue      between      City officials and merchants on business and
economic development issues and to attract businesses that will create
local jobs and generate revenue to support municipal functions The
City will also consider analyzing its business permits and approval
process to provide an efficient approval process

To help cities pay for municipal programs and public improvements
and to provide low and moderate income housing cities are allowed to
use  tax increments       a  financing tool that allows redevelopment agencies
                   the
to    capture            increase      in
                                             property tax revenues after the
redevelopment plan         is  adopted      With tax increment funds the Agency
can    finance     infrastructure improvement           projects   that  benefit   the
community without tapping into the general fund                   or  other sources
Through      its   redevelopment authority the Agency has successfully
created    a coordinated      plan for the expanded Village that has integrated
new housing with quality retail shops and other commercial businesses
that boost the tax base The Redevelopment Agency can also acquire
interest in real property within a redevelopment project area to be
spent on public or private uses to eHminate blight
Key goals of the Agency include the implementation of the Village
Expansion Specific              Plan     preparation of plans and initiation
implementation activities in the economic revitalization of the Foothill
Corridor enhancement of the Auto Center and Claremont Center retail
complex      economic revitalization of         unproductive   or  older commercial
and industrial       developments        in the   project   area  expansion of the
Village south of the railroad tracks and north of Arrow Highway
possible expansion of the redevelopment project                          area      and
development of the former gravel QUarry located at the southeast
corner    of Monte Vista and Base Line Road
In addition       to   commercial development             20  percent   or  more     of
redevelopment        income is used for        housing programs aimed at lower
income households Housing projects in which redevelopment income
has been used include the Claremont Senior Villas Apartments on
Indian Hill Boulevard Vista del Valle Apartments on San Jose Avenue
and a Habitat for Humanity project on Claremont Boulevard
Given      the     positive      results    Claremont      has   experienced     from
redevelopment the Agency will continue to fulfill its mission and work
to implement the goals and policies set forth           in this Element
Fiscal
The New England settlers who helped establish Claremont instilled in
their goVernment a moral code of fiscal responsibility This approach
to  local governance has guided the City well for             more   than 100  years
City   leaders recognize that the         budgeting process cannot be separated
from the City s vision            The budget is a financial plan for the City s
vision and all programs that          a  city undertakes      Sound investment and
budget management strategies allow the City to achieve its planning
goals for public safety community services and facilities open space
enhancement housing production and maintenance and overall Quality
of life in Claremont

CITY        Of       CLAREMONT                    GENERAL             PLAN
Claremont       prepares      a  budget      every     two    years     and   the  public
participates in the budgeting process                Budget decisions are based on
community needs long range goals and fiscal policies adopted by the
City Council        This balanced        long range approach to allocating City
resources    over     shorter time periods has allowed the City to maintain
reserves     to   sustain the community during periods of economic
uncertainty      Claremont will continue to exercise fiscal prudence

Context for Mobility
Creating Options
This chapter of the General Plan addresses circulation and mobility
Circulation refers  to  all travel modes and   routes  people  use  to move
within and beyond Claremont         the local street system   via  biking or
walking or using transit       J oving people and goods     within  the City
efficiently and effectively allows the community to function well
economically and socially          Mobility describes people s ability to
circulate from home to school work or shopping with ease and safety
Alternatives to the private car     transit biking and walking     can offer
choice and convenience         OUf plans for circulation and mobility are
centered upon providing options and make sustainable the use and
interaction of these options
The Community          obility Element recognizes that automobiles will
remain    as the leading mode of transportation for many Claremont
residents and visitors The goals and objectives for the Community

CLAREMONT                GENERAL             PLAN
We    owe  much of  our   early history   as a town to   the railroads The first
Claremont Depot       was    built in 1887      The Santa f      e Railroad   and
Southern Pacific Railroad provided freight and passenger connections
to points throughout the rapidly developing western United States and
to established east coast cities      Many of   our   early streets featured wide
medians that accommodated rail transit The Pacific Electric Railway
came to    Claremont in the early twentieth century providing easy high
speed    connections     to  other parts of Southern California              The
Claremont      Depot    now   the site of Metrolink and foothill          Transit
operations and the planned Metro Gold Line station is               an  important
legacy connecting Claremont s transportation past             to our present and
future
Like other Southern California cities        our destiny was also determined
by  construction of   highway and freeway networks to carJy cars across
the Los Angeles basin Arrow Highway foothill Boulevard and Base
Line Road were all established in the early twentieth century as
roadways connecting San Bernardino to Pasadena and Los Angeles
In 1954 the 10 freeway opened through Claremont with an access
point at Indian Hill Boulevard            In 2002 the 210 freeway opened
through the City with access points at Base Line Road Monte Vista
Avenue and Towne Avenue                  These roadways have shaped the
development of Claremont from their original planning in the 1930s
through today Initially these roadways were popular options allowing
Claremonters to reach distant destinations quickly and with ease
However as time has gone by and population growth throughout
Southern California increased we have become dependent on these
routes to get us to work and they have become increasingly congested
This congestion is likely to increase further with the extensive amount
of   new   development planned in the adjacent cities of Upland and
Montclair      Energy land and financial resources necessaty to expand
the system have become limited and future options are uncertain                 In
short we have discovered that this system is not sustainable and               we
seek future options    to  automobile travel   on  freeways
Claremonters      should have many options           to  get around the corner
around the region        or  around the nation         We will place increased
attention   on   providing   facilities  on our   streets    that encourage and
 enable bicycling and walking           We will consider options to provide
 internal shuttles within the City but     we will also need to provide parking
within walkinl distances of people         s destinations      We will work with
 surrounding jurisdictions and regional agencies to improve our transit
 connections within the City and to other locations both on buses and
 trains   We look forward to the extension of the Metro Gold Line to
 Claremont      We take pride in        our  Depot and will preserve it as a
                             well
 historical  treasure    as         as  part of   a functioning transportation
 center    We will provide better access between Claremont and area
 airports and work with other agencies and jurisdictions to take steps in
 development strategies to reduce the impacts of air traffic upon our
 neighborhoods

N  ost importantly    we  will enhance and  care for  our  system of  streets
recognizing their significant role  not just as travel  routes  but as places
that bring us together        Several of our roadways         including First
Street Indian Hill Boulevard and Sixth Street                provide unique
functions that must be maintained       Others including Arrow Highway
and Foothill Boulevard have great potential to be attractive and safer
routes    We will continue our proud tradition of providing lush street
trees and landscaped medians on major roadways to maintain the look
and feel of Claremont
                                                                               Claremont Depot
                                                                               Claremonts historic train station links our

OUf plans    set forth in this Element are  bold but necessary if   we are  to
build upon community traditions reclaim our streets as public places
and provide sustainable mobility options for all Claremonters
A Plan for Our Streets
Efficient  movement     within and through Claremont and the region will
be facilitated by developing and maintaining a well desiRflcd integrated
circulation network Easy and convenient access to bus and rail transit
and pedestrian and bicycle options within the City are essential to an
efficient network The various modes need to be coordinated so that
Claremont s mobility and the desiM of City streets accommodate           more
transit options than just   cars
Streets    are the backbone of Claremont s        circulation system      OUf
streets  lend identity to our  neighborhoods and have always served as a
determining force in the shape form and function of the City Streets
should be considered as places with many functions including moving
                                                                                                                PAGE         4

people and goods connecting neighborhoods                  and  as statements of
civic pride and beauty
Streets and hiMways        are  grouped   into classes   or systems according to
the character of the service they      are  intended   to provide This grouping
is  called functional classification          An integral part of functionally
classifying streets is recognizing that individual roads and streets do not
serve travel independent from the rest of the highway system             Rather
most travel involves movement through a network of roads so it is
nece    xlry to determine how this travel          can  be channeled within the
network in     a  logical and efficient     manner       Functional classification
defines the    nature  of this channelization process by defining the role
that a particular road or street should play in serving the flow of trips
within a highway network
 Functional classification can be applied in planning highway system
development determining the jurisdictional responsibility for particular
systems and in fiscal planning                Functional classification is also
 important in determining eligibility for federal funding
 Claremont s Street System
 Claremont s    street   system is differentiated by roadway
size    function   and capacity       The four basic types of
 roadways    in  Claremont     are  described   below     Figure 4 1
 presents    schematic     cross   sections    for  each    type of
 roadway that represent desirable standards              Deviations
 from these standards may         occur in  cases   where physical
 constraints   and   or    ht of way limitations are present
                           rig
 and where preservation of         neighborhood or community
 character dictates special treatment                Provision of
 bikeways and sidewalks may also affect the specific
 design of roadways          In addition the median width of
 major and secondaty arterials will vary according to the
 area being served      right of way constraints and turn lane
               requiremenL
                                                                                   Foothill Freeway

 Freeways are limited access high speed travelways included in the                 with the intention of relieving congestion on
 state and federal highway systems          Their purpose is to carry regional     surface streets in Claremont and   on the 10
 through traffic traffic passing through Claremont without stopping                Freeway
 Access to the regional highway system for Claremont residents and
 visitors is provided at interchan es              The I 0 Freeway and 210
 Freeway connect Claremont to regional destinations                  The design
 construction and operation of freeways are under the jurisdiction of
 the California Department of Transportation Caltrans

Arterial Streets
Arterial   streets     together with freeways form a network carrying long
distance     high speed traffic Arterial streets transport large volumes of
traffic from one part of the City to another and connect to the state
highway system The Arterial Street also moves traffic between cities
in locations where a freeway does not link the two                            Arterials are
designed      to  have the highest traffic carrying capacity in the Citys
roadway      system      with the   highest speeds and          limited interference with
traffic flow by driveways           Claremont     s arterials include Towne Avenue
Mountain Avenue             Indian   Hill   Boulevard        Mills Avenue        Claremont
Boulevard Monte Vista Avenue Padua Avenue Mt Baldy Road Base
Line Road        foothill Boulevard           Bonita Avenue           First Street Arrow

relinquishment of Base Line Road
Claremont        has     three    types    of   Arterial      streets    Major Arterials
Secondary Arterials               and    Rural      Secondary         Arteria  s       These
designations differ in capacity          to carry    traffic based     on  the size of right
of way and pavement width              Major Arterials       range from 72 to 88 feet in
width without         a   median and from           84    to  100 feet with       a  median
                                                                                               Foothill Boulevard
Secondary Arterials range from 40                    to   60 feet in width without           a
median and from 66            to 82 feet in width with        a  median      As  a matter   of A view of Foothill Boulevard looking east at
                                                                                               Indian Hill Boulevard
policy    medians       are   desired    on   all   Major and Secondary Arterials
where sufficient right of way exists              Rural Secondary Arterials are 28
feet in width         do   not   have    a  median        and    may    feature separated
pedestrian equestrian trails and etas                 I bike lanes within the        right of
way
r esidential driveway          access   and    on street     parking    are   generally   not
appropriate      on     Arterials      However        due    to   historical development
patterns     some     of Claremont      s  Arterial    streets    also provide              to
                                                                                        acces
homes       and    have residential driveways and curb                   parking       These
streets    including     Indian Hill Boulevard Mills Avenue               Arrow    Highway
Mountain Avenue              and    Padua     Avenue         pass    through established
residential neighborhoods              The City seeks            a  balance between the
arterial function of the        streets   and neighborhood protection               Methods
the City may employ include managing the arterial function of these
streets    and providing appropriate driveway access and bicycle and
pedestrian crossings
Collector Streets
Collector    streets    are  intended    to  serve as     intermediate      routes  handling
traffic between arterial        streets  and local     streets    Collectors   are  designed
primarily    to move traffic but also         provide     aCCess to    abutting properties
Collectors differ from arterials in that Collectors may pass through
residential neighborhoods to distribute trips from the arterials to
ultimate destinations            Conversely Collectors           also  collect  traffic from
                                                                                                                                PAGE        4 9
CLAREMONT                    GENERAL            PLAN
local streets in residential neighborhoods and channel it                 onto   the
arterials      Ideally Collector streets should form a network with no one
Collector extending so far that it functions as an arterial street Some
Collector streets include nadcliffe Drive Scripps Drive Sixth Street
Sumner Avenue and Villiams Avenue Collectors are typically 40 feet
wide within a broader right of way
Local Streets
Local streets provide direct          access   to  individual parcels The Local
street   is not   designed for through traffic        Rather Local streets should
move     traffic toward the      nearest  collector  street  Therefore speeds    on
Local     streets    are   relatively low     and    on street  parking is usually
permitted        Local   streets  in Claremont are twolane roadways without
medians
Some Local         streets   serve  industrial  areas    Because of the  nature   of
the traffic   on   these   streets  special consideration must be given to their
design beyond that given to other Local streets including load bearing
capacity paving widths and materials and turning radii
Vehicle Travel Lanes                                                                  Local Street
                                                                                      An example of a local street in Claremont
Claremont residents have identified that adding additional travellaneJ
to    roadways      to  carry   increased traffic volumes      is not a sustainable   Morgan Avenue
option       This    means     other modes of transportation rather than the
automobile        must    be encouraged and that many alternative options
 need to be available          to meet travel needs         for these reasons the
 number of vehicle travel lanes on all City arterials and collectors will be
 limited    to   no    more    than four    lanes    unless special circumstances
demonstrate that additional lanes within limited stretches              are needed
for merging congestion           or safety  reasons
Although      a need    for six lanes along certain segments of arterial streets
 may be demonstrated in the future based              on travel demand and traffic
volumes       such expansion of Claremont s arterials is problematic due           to
 a  lack of available right of way This is also inconsistent with other City
 policiesc supporting the       use  of bicycles rail bus transit and walking      as
 viable circulation options        as well  as  policies that sustain our streets as
 livable places Expansion of roadways beyond four lanes for purposeJ
 of providing bikeways pedestrian improvements                       and or transit
 amenities will continue to             be encouraged where right of way is
 available
 Level of SeIVice Standards
 Evaluating the ability of the circulation system to serve Claremont s
 residents and businesses requires establishing suitable performance
 criteria    Performance criteria have a policy component that establishes
 a   desired level of service          as  well   as  a  technical component that

specifies   how traffic      forecast data      can   be  used    to   measure    the
achievement of the criteria
Level of Service       LOS     describes the     efficiency and quality of traffic
operations and is generally measured at intersections Six categories
of LOS       the leller designations A to f are used to describe traffic
conditions with LOS A representing excellent conditions and LOS f
representing extreme          congestion        The    performance      criteria  for
evaluating the City street system are based on peak hour intersection
data as intersections typically represent the most critical locations of
bOlllenecks and congestion             Level of service is based on average
vehicle delay      Table 4 1 shows the average vehicle delay and the
corresponding      LOS       with   a    description    of corresponding       traffic

The City s desired performance standards for roadways                are based   on a
sliding scale by roadway type             These standards      are  summarized in

                Circulation System Performance Criteria
  Peak Hour Intersection Level of Service
  Major Arterial                         LOS E Minimum     acceptable operations
  Secondary   Arterial                   LOS D Minimum     acceptable operations
  Rural Secondary     Arterial           LOS D Minimum     acceptable operations

  Local Street                           LOS B Minimum acceptable operations
  Note    For   roadway segments         these standards  are
                                                               applied  to  mid block
  conditions    for   intersections   the LOS standard applicable to the largest
  intersecting street  is applied  If the intersection operates at a deficient level of
  service the existing level of service shall be maintained
  These minimum LOS objectives for the roadway system reflect the
  City s desire    to   maintain stable traffic flows      throughout Claremont
  recognizing that peak hour congestion may occur                   on  arterials     at
  locations near freeways or other locations with                    unusual     traffic
  characteristics due to regional traffic flow        When an acceptable level of
  service cannot be maintained with          a  proposed development mitigation
  measures     should be required to meet the City s standards                    Such
  measures     could include traffic signal improvements additional turning
  and    merging lanes and or changes to a development project
  Although individual projects often do not have a significant impact on
  overall City circulation the cumulative effects of several projects
  eventually impact City streets and result in the need for costly
  improvements      to   the system
  Master Plan of Roadways
r
  To                       where congestion historically has occurred and to
       adqress   areas
  accommodate long term traffic needs the City has developed a Master
   Plan 01 Roadways illustrated in Figure 4 2                   This Plan meets
  Claremont s     long term circulation needs and reflects City policies
  regarding sustainability Roadway improvements needed to achieve
  perlortnance criteria and avoid roadway and intersection impacts
  within the Planning Area are prioritized funded and completed using
  the City s Five Year Capital Improvement Plan process

 Special Roadway Conditions
The roadway classifications presented above            are meant to    establish
consistent standards for the      design    construction and maintenance of
City roadways However several of our City streets present unique
design characteristics serve special functions or are critical pathways
that must be enhanced and protected            Each has  a  unique history and
role in the formation of     our community and will continue to shape the
development patterns of Claremont          into the future  These streets and
their unique characteristics    are discussed below
Arrow   Highway
Arrow Highway is        a  four lane   major arterial roadway crossing the
central southem portion        of Claremont from       Pomona     to  Montclair
West of Indian       Hill Boulevard     Arrow Highway features        a   raised
landscaped median and forms a buffer between business park uses to
the north and single family residential areas to the south              East of
Indian Hill residential uses are located      on both sides of the street
Arrow Highway takes its          name    from what    was   supposed    to  be   a
  straight  arrow   route   to  Los Angeles from San Bernardino            Sixth
Street   was originally planned for this route but because of resident and
College opposition the highway was fe routed to the present Arrow
Highway alignment Within Claremont this roadway makes a
significant bend to the south after it enters the City from Montclair
The highway enters Claremont parallel to Green Street then bends
south between Mills Avenue and College Avenue to intersect with the
former Cucamonga Avenue alignment This bend was constructed in
the late I 940s early I 950s to eliminate asignificant jog within the route
at   Indian  Hill Boulevard      then Alexander Avenue             Considerable
confusion has surrounded the        eastern   extensions of this  roadway     into
San Bernardino County            Both Upland and Montclair have           Arrow
Highways       as  neither City wished     to give up the moniker since both
formed around these roadways            Upland   s Arrow Highway feeds into
Claremont s      Sixth Street     as   Arrow    Route    whereas Montclair s
Arrow Highway is continuous with Claremont s
Key objectives for Arrow Highway center upon making this roadway
safer ahd more pedestrian friendly Due to the regional nature of the
roadway and high traffic volumes prior to the opening of the 210
Freeway with these volumes projected to return to pre 21 0 Freeway
conditions by the year 2020         two lanes in each direction are needed
Installing a landscaped median east of Indian Hill is not possible given
the narrow right of way Residential driveways directly access the road
at   several locations which affects pedestrian safety               Pedestrian
improvements described in this element such as improved sidewalks
and crosswalks can help to alleviate safety concerns              The City will
continue to    study options and     i  plement strategies   to improve traffic

Base Une Road
Base Line Road is         a four lane   major arterial roadway spanning the
entire width of the     City just north of the 210 freeway        The roadway is
divided    and portions of Base Line Road            west  of Mountain Avenue
feature a raised landscaped median            Land   uses along Base Line Road
consist   largely of single family residences         although small office and
commercial centers        are located near   key  intersections  Many important
Claremont historical landmarks can be found along Base Line Road
Base Line Road began          as an  unpaved rural roadway running through
citrus groves         The roadway takes its name from the base line
established    as  a guide meridian for a survey of the Pomona Valley in
 1866  as   part of the Public Land Survey which divided much of the
western    United States into townships ranges and sections                 As the
citrus groves   were    developed   into residential  neighborhoods Base Line
Road became          a major arterial roadway          Since much of northern
Claremont and other foothill cities        were  planned under the assumption
that the 210 freeway would be built              no  additional major     east west
routes  were    created    at  the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains            for
many years      prior   to the opening of 210      freeway    in 2002    Base Line
Road served     as a   major   route for traffic commuting through Claremont
from San Bernardino to Los Angeles
Today Base       Line Road still functions     as a  parallel arterial route to the
210 Freeway        With the   freeway   in place properties fronting Base Line
Road can be considered for new uses including some expanded types
of home occupations As described in the Land Use Community
Design and Heritage Preservation Element the south side of Base
Line Road will develop as a corridor of mixed use development
multiple family housing professional offices and continued retail uses
Continued land use objectives for the north side of Base Line
emphasize preservation of existing single family homes and
neighborhoods Base Line Road will remain primarily an automobile
oriented street Infill sidewalk construction within the unincorporated
portions of Base Line Road will enhance the use of this roadway for
pedestrians and striped bike lanes will be maintained along both sides
of Base Line Road

 Claremont street in the future                The roadway lacks the signature
character offered by        most   Claremont streets namely a lush street tree
canopy and attractive landscaped medians In addition residents have
noted that Caltrans pavement maintenance along this roadway does
not meet     the City s standard for Claremont        streets
The City has initiated        a process to accept Caltrans relinquishment of
Base Line Road located within Claremont understanding that the City
will face significant     costs   in terms of maintenance        Caltrans will fund
resurfacing of the roadway          to  provide  a projected 20 years of pavement
life    Desired improvements             to Base Line Road following Caltrans
relinquishment include
            New raised landscaped median             east  of Mountain Avenue      to
            the City limit
            New  street   lights   infill and replace wooden poles with exposed

Bonita Avenue
Bonita Avenue       enters    Claremorit from Pomona         and runs  east through
Claremont Village        to  College Avenue         Bonita Avenue is the primary
street    providing  access    to  the Claremont        anor  and Mt San Antonio

Gardens retirement communities and has historically been the route of
choice for     bicyclists   traveling and commuting through Claremont
between Montclair Pomona and points beyond
The Citrus Regional Bikeway originally planned to be constructed in
the railroad right of way through Claremont has been moved to surface
streets   because the proposed           trail along the railroad right of way
conflicts with the future Metro Gold Line           The bikeway is    now  planned
 from west to east        to utilize Bonita Avenue and first Street for its
primary   route to   Claremont Boulevard           At the county line the bikeway
will connect to the Upland Montclair trail
Between the      western     City limit and Indian Hill Boulevard            Bonita
Avenue is    a four lane undivided Secondary Arterial           East of Indian Hill
Boulevard within the Village           Bonita Avenue       narrows  to  a  twolane
local street
The key objective for Bonita Avenue is                to  implement the planned
changes     to   Bonita    Avenue      associated with      the Citrus Regional
Bikeway     as  approved by the Traffic and Transportation Commission
The approved changes include           re striping from four travel lanes to two
travel lanes and adding a center dual turn lane two parking lanes and
two Class II bike lanes from the City limits to Indian Hill Boulevard
Other changes to Bonita Avenue will include adding a sidewalk on the
north side of the road between Berkeley and Grinnell Avenues and
replacing stop signs at Mountain Avenue Cambridge Avenue and
possibly Berkeley Avenue with traffic signals
First Street
 first Street  runs  from just west of Cornell Avenue in The Village east
to  Claremont Boulevard         West of Indian Hill Boulevard first Street is
a   two lane collector    roadway serving the         western   expansion of The
Village     Between Indian        Hill Boulevard and College Avenue            first
Street is    a  one    and twolane divided secondary arterial             providing
access    to   Metrolink and       foothill Transit facilities located at        the
Claremont Depot         East of College Avenue first Street transitions to         a
four lane secondary arterial         as   it   forms the southern edge of The
 Claremont      Colleges     With     the     implementation     of  the   changes
 associated with the Citrus Regional Bikeway this segment will further
 transition to a single travel lane in each direction incorporating the
 regional bikeway within the right of way
 In the early part of the twentieth century Pacific Electric Red Cars            ran
 down the center median of first Street            Today first Street provides     a
 bikeway   connection to the San Bernardino            County Regional Bikeway
 which begins at Huntington Drive just east of Claremont s boundary
The City looks to continue first Streets intercity transit tradition by
 connecting east into the cities of Montclair and Upland This would
 establish easier transit connections between the Depot and Montclair
Transit    Center     forging   a   new      roadway and bikeway that better
 connects Claremont to these cities and points            beyond In addition the

Foothill Boulevard
Foothill Boulevard is   an  east west   four lane major arterial that extends
the length of Claremont from Towne Avenue              to Montc Vista Avenue
Owned and operaled by Caltrans           for  many   years Foothill Boulevard
has served    as  a major intercity roadway      and will continue to do    so in
the future
In 1931     Foothill Boulevard     opened     to  much fanfare      This    state
highway    was an   antecedent of   a  series of  disjointed routes  connecting
the foothill cities  Claremont s foothill   route  called Mesa Avenue      at the
time    was  a  gravel road from the San Antonio Wash             on  the City s
eastern    boundary   to  Pasadena      on   the  west     In  1911    the  state
approved plans for     an east west   roadway     championed by the Foothill
Boulevard As ociation        a  lobbying RrOUP charged       with securing the
route   for the foothill cities    Foothill Boulevard became part of the
popular US Route 66 connecting Chicago to Los Angeles and was
the route used by many Americans relocating from the J idwest dust
bowl   to more   promising futures in California

one    street     to    the   other     as    the   two   streets   were   separated    by
approximately one block at Harrison                       In the early I 960s Millard
Sheets designed a bend that connected the two roadways This bend
in tandem with the opening of the I 0 freeway interchange at Indian Hill
 Boulevard in 1954 forced a change in circulation patterns directing
traffic away from College Avenue in favor of Indian Hill Boulevard for

Over the years Claremont s general plans have highlighted the role of
 Indian Hill Boulevard in the City s overall circulation plans and have

CLAREMONT                       GENERAL             PLAN
emphasized the need for such techniques as slowing and reducing
traffic along the roadway reducing traffic related noise levels in
surrounding neighborhoods making Indian Hill Boulevard a useful and
safe road for pedestrians and discouraging truck traffic                    However
these plans have also recognized that Indian Hill Boulevard along
certain stretches           is principally  a  residential street and that the bulk of
       south
       north        through traffic in Claremont should be directed to other
arterials      at  the City s edges such as Towne Avenue and Claremont
Boulevard Monte Vista Avenue
This Circulation Element advocates continuation of these objectives for
Indian Hill Boulevard              Medians should be provided along Indian Hill
Boulevard         at   all locations where right of way will allow         Pedestrian
improvements should continue                 to  be  provided within The Village and
along other stretches of Indian Hill Boulevard used heavily by
pedestrians Key intersections at San Jose Avenue Arrow Highway
and foothill Boulevard should be improved in tandem with new mixed
use development                Street trees form a major part of the signature
streetscape provided by Indian Hill Boulevard                         and should be
maintained and enhanced throughout the length ofthe roadway
Mountain Avenue
Mountain Avenue              runs  from the south boundary of the City at the 10
Freeway north             to  Arrow Highway and from Bonita A venue to the
Claraboya neighborhood                  The two sections of Mountain Avenue are
connected by          a  portion of Cambridge Avenue which runs from Arrow
Highway         to   Bonita Avenue South of Arrow Highway and north of
Base Line Road Mountajn Avenue is a two lane collector and north of
Bonita Avenue to Base Line Road it is a secondary arterial with two
lanes from Bonita Avenue to Harrison Avenue and four lanes from
Harrison Avenue to Base Line Road
In the I 880s Mountain Avenue                ran  from San Bernardino Road to San
Jose Avenue and in 1907 Mountain Avenue formed one of the westerly
boundaries of the City             An interchange with the I0 freeway        was part
of early freeway plans but was              never   built Mountain Avenue is known
as   the      street of schools         with   one   junior high and two elementary
schools located along the            roadwayS
Mountain Ave nue presents significant opportunities to accomplish City
objectives for both encouraging pedestrian activity and bicycle use and
establishing safe routes to schools                      Mountain Avenue between
Harrison Avenue and Base Line Road requires up to 12 seconds to
cross whereas seven seconds is a preferred standard                       With traffic
volumes below 8 000 vehicles               a  day only   two  lanes are needed on this
street

The approach       to  improving Mountain Avenue        s pedestrian function
         upon the intersection at foothill Boulevard and the stretches
centers
both  north and south of Foothill Boulevard near J ountain View
Elementary      School         The     skewed     Mountain    Avenue foothill
Boulevard intersection may possibly be reduced by eliminating non
essential lanes and adding on street parking on alternating sides of the
street    On  street    parking lanes    may    be added   to  the sections of
Mountain Avenue north and south of foothill Boulevard              Reduction of
the intersection skew may allow for          a morc   compact    more     efficient
intersection that will   provide greater comfort   to pedestrians
Other roadway enhancements that would                make 1 ountain Avenue
more  attractive functional and safe would be to add medians with turn
pockets Under this treatment        a tree canopy can be added     helping cool
the street and reduce energy costs for       adjacent property  owners

residents of high density apartment complexes on San Jose Avenue
west of Indian Mill Boulevard        Heavy traffic on this roadway combined
with frequent driveway accessibility affects residents ability         to use   San

Between     Indian    Hill   Boulevard   and   Mills Avenue      residents     have
expressed    concern     regarding speeding vehicles and commuter traffic
that use San Jose Avenue to access the 10 freeway                  The City has
completed several improvements              to  San   Jose Avenue including
restriping the roadway to single lanes adding bike lanes and parking
west of Indian Hill Boulevard installing a traffic signal at Lehigh Drive to
improve safety of children crosSing to Vista School and working with

Sixth Street
Sixth Street is           a  two lane      collector roadway running from Pilgrim
Place       on  the west into the city of Upland         on the east   As Sixth Street
enters      Upland the roadway becomes Arrow Route
In 1903 Sixth Street             was   voted acceptable by the Towne Meeting        as a
route for        the Ontario Road            a   proposed county road linking San
Bernardino to Los             Angeles     via  the San Gabriel Valley The Ontario
Road         or   as   it  was     later called    Arrow Route       was   built in San
Bernardino along this              route to   the Los Angeles County line         By the
time this road became                a  real possibility in Claremont in the I920s
residential       areas surrounding Sixth Street had been settled Pomona
College had constructed several buildings close to the street and
Pilgrim Place was planned at the western terminus of the roadway
Resident and college opposition to the use of the Sixth Street route for
this purpose was so strong that an alternate route had to be                           proposed
The highway           was subsequently re routed to the south along the present
day Arrow Highway alignment in Los Angeles County
Sixth Street bisects both Pomona College and Claremont McKenna
College and          is characterized      by heavy levels of college age pedestrian
traffic       Sixth Street is the only existing           or planned east west street
between Foothill Boulevard and First Street that provides a through
connection into Upland between Indian Hill Boulevard and Claremont
Boulevard Prior to the opening of the 210 Freeway Sixth Street was
an   important          heavily used        east west street    particularly during the
morning and evening peak hours Since the freeway opened in 2002
traffic volumes on Sixth Street have decreased however as freeway
volumes climb in the future this                 route  will again have heavier traffic
volumes
To maintain the City s policy of limiting Foothill Boulevard and Arrow
Highway to four travel lanes the additional capacity provided by Sixth
Street and Harrison Avenue must                       be maintained      The City will
maintain this         roadway       as a  Collector street and continue    to work with
The C lIeges and the City of Upland                  to maximize   pedestrian safety of
college students along and                  across   Sixth Street    between Harvard
Avenue and Claremont Boulevard
Towne Avenue
Towne Avenue              was    named and platted in Pomona approximately in
 1874        It extended north almost            as far as   Cucamonga    Avenue    now
Arrow Highway                It is named after RM Towne who helped found the
city of Pomona              In the 1960s after the 1 0 Freeway         was  constructed

T raffle     has   increased   considerably    since   the   opening of the 210
Freeway        in November 2002       Residents in the     area   have voiced their
concerns       about increased traffic volumes and speeds and the difficulties
the traffic creates for pedestrians To address these             concerns   the City
applied for and received funds from the           state s Safe Routes to School
grant program to make improvements to Towne Avenue Since 2004
improvements to Towne Avenue have included a new traffic signal at
Towne Avenue and Briarcroft Avenue relocation of                   a crosswalk and
pedestrian signal       at Towne Avenue and Scripps Avenue installation of
in fill  sidewalk and       seven  handicapped     ramps     on   the west side of
Towne Avenue upgrading of eight handicapped ramps at the east side
of T owne Avenue            pedestrian improvements at the eastbound 210
Freeway off ramp installation of raised medians and landscaping and
installation      of nine streetlights  on   the west side of Towne Avenue
between Briarcroft Road and 210 Freeway                  In addition   at the City s
request Caltrans implemented pedestrian and vehicular improvements
at the eastbound 21 0 Freeway off ramp
The key objectives for Towne Avenue             are  to make the street safe and
friendly     to  pedestrians and other users The new landscaped medians
and other medians have helped and the trees in the median will
provide a tree canopy The City will continue to study ways to improve
 the street

CLAREMONT                GENERAL          PLAN
A     Comprehensive Sustainable
Approach to Mobility
Claremont takes      an integrated and balanced multi modal approach to
transportation which will incorporate motor vehicles pedestrians
bicycles and other transportation modes including bus and rail
systems
Connecting Claremont to the Region
Claremont      has always been      a  crossroads       In  its   early history
Claremont     was   on a stagecoach  route   The City    was    a stopover on a
transcontinental railroad and a stop along the Pacific Electric rail
network       In the twentieth century Faothill Boulevard was part of
Route 66
Today    as  part of a large metropolitan  area   and of necessity Claremont
needs   to  integrate its  local street system with existing and planned
regional   and local systems        Regional transportation planning and
management requires cooperation and coordination among all the
affected jurisdictions such as local cities Los Angeles and San
Bernardino Counties        Caltrans   and the     Los Angeles Metropolitan
Transportation Authority Metro             Working together agencies can
address the physical infrastructure    needed to support regional demands
and   ensure   that convenient alternative transportation modes allow for
an  integrated approach     to addressing traffic problems
Caltrans facilities
Several Caltrans facilities traverse Claremont          The 10 Freeway an
east west    interstate   highway has an interchange at Indian Hill
Boulevard       The 210 Freeway another east west highway is built to
interstate   standards and will be designated         as   an   interstate once
Caltrans has completed the extension to the 21 a Freeway in San
Bernardino      The 210 Freeway has interchanges       at Towne Avenue and
 Base Line Road       Base Line Road is designated as State Route 30 and
Foothill BouJevard is designated as State Route 66 both are owned
and maintained       by Caltrans    The community has expressed clear
direction that Base Line Road and Foothill Boulevard             must look and
function like other Claremont streets
Congestion Management Plan
The Los Angeles County Congestion Management Plan                      CMP    is
administered      by Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority Metro         The CMP identifies and establishes         a system for
monitoring regjonal transportation facilities       This information is used
PAGE        4    26
                                                                    COMMUNITY         MOBILILTY ELEMENT
to   link    local      land   use   decisions   with   their  impacts  on   regional
transportation and            air  quality  and to develop partnerships among
transportation decision makers to find solutions that serve the region
Local jurisdictions such as Claremont are required to participate in the
CMP     to  receive their portion of state gas tax revenue
CMP facilities in Claremont include the                  10 and 210 freeways       in
addition     to  the intersections of Arrow Highway Indian Hill Boulevard
and foothill Boulevard Indian Hill Boulevard                The City will continue to
participate in the monitoring and improvement of these facilities in
conjunction with Metro as part of the CMP
San Bernardino County also has                a Congestion Management Plan but
there is    no   coordination of plans between the           two counties   The City
will continue        to  work with both counties     to  better address cross  county
impacts
Minimizing Local Congestion and Protecting Our
Neighborhoods
A well          ned
                desil     local roadway system is the foundation of Claremont s
multi modal circulation network                 Roadways provide primary travel
routes     for automobiles          but also form the backbone of Claremont s
transit     pedestrian        truck    and bicycle options       The primary local
roadway       concerns       in Claremont    are traffic congestion vehicle speeds
and neighborhood protection
Reducing Through Traffic
Historically regional commuters have chosen to use Claremont streets
as quick and easy routes to access points east and west of the City
Prior to construction of the I 0 and 21 0 Freeways routes such as
 foothill Boulevard Base Line Road and Arrow Highway provided
east west through connections                  Wjth the freeways providing two
regional routes Claremonters seek to transform these roadways into
more      local serving arierial routes           Key objectives of this strategy
include gaining local control of Base Line Road and exploring the
benefits of gaining control of foothill Boulevard installing medians and
compledng beautification projects on these roadways and pursuing the
special roadway treatments specified for each roadway in this element
 North south trending through traffic is also             a concern   as  commuters
seek quick options            to  transfer between the 210 freeway and the 10
 Freeway This trend is most noticeable on Towne Avenue and Monte
Vista Avenue the only two continuous links between the freeways
within Claremont               The City has completed median upgrades and
 beautification projects         on  each of these roadways and continued efforts
 will be made to attempt to slow           or properly control through traffic along
 these routes
                                                                                                PAGE 4 27
CLAREMONT                 GENERAL            PLAN
Neighborhood Traffic Calming
As traffic in the   City and region    increases and       through traffic tends       to
seek alternative      routes    these alternative      routes
                                                                may indirectly         or
directly impact local neighborhoods           This   occurs    when drivers divert
from congested arterial roadways to local and collector roads The City
is committed to the preservation of its residential neighborhoods and
has established policies which contribute        to the preservation efforts
One of the ways      to help control the  movement       of traffic through    an area
is by the  use  of traffic calming techniques       Claremont has implemented
a  traffic calming policy which directs traffic          to  routes   that minimize
adverse impacts in residential neighborhoods              The policy also calls for
a  balanced system of circulation           that incorporates       motor     vehicles
pedestrians bicycles      and other transportation modes
    number of examples of traffic calming techniques are employed
throughout the City         Some of the more notable examplcs are the
design of Indian Hill Boulevard between Harrison Avenue and foothill
Boulevard features installed       on south Mills Avenue median            treatments
on   Foothill Boulevard       and the    re  striping of    a  number of         streets
Landscaping      trees  sidewalks and bike lanes also help         to  calm traffic
Over the     years    the City has received       many     requests for additional
traffic enforcement controls         and   calming    in various     neighborhoods
To    ensure   that the    quality of life in Claremont s neighborhoods is
sustained and to               funding issues City staff and the City Council
                            addre
continue to implement the adopted traffic calming policy
One tool    to  caIrn traffic is to install medians within the                 of
                                                                               right way
Medians improve general roadway safety and provide                      an   aesthetic
benefit    For pedestrians medians provide           a safe haven as they cross
the  street    City policy requires resident approval for the installation of
medians This policy will need to be changed because it may result in
inconsistent median treatment along the major corridors which will
limit the potential benefits of the medians However before installation
of medians can be completed the City must make sure that any
unintended problems such as visibility or traffic movement have been
explored
The implementation of traffic calming           measures     can re    ult in varying
degrees of liability     exposure to the     City    Therefore       such   measures
must    incorporate engineering design features and practices that do                 not
result in  unacceptable liability   exposure for the     City
Transportation Demand Management
Transportation Demand             anag ement     or          is a general

the roadway system        TOM strategies        can  help address   a variety of
traffic  problems     and   provide     secondary     economic      social   and
environmental benefits      When all     are  considered TDM strategies       are
often the  most cost  effective way to     improve transportation     Examples
of TOM include
          BikelT ransit Integration
          Carpooling
          Pedestrian facility Improvements
          Transit Improvements
          Encouraging Walking and Cycling
          Parking ManMement and Pricing
          Bicycle Parking
          Alternative Work Schedules
To    implement these strategies and support regional air quality
objectives     the City has        adopted a Transportation Demand
Management Ordinance The City will continue to work with major
employers to implement TOM strategies
Transportation System Management
Nearly every jurisdiction in Southern California faces traffic congestion
problems that can no longer be resolved by unsustainable capacity
enhancements such as lane re striping or roadway widening                     An
alternative    sustainable strategy is implementation of Intelligent
Transportation Systems ITS which allow a city to control traffic
signals by using advancep computer technologies monitor traffic using
video monitoring and provide traveler information to motorists The
City will work to implement ITS systems at strategic locations to
improve traffic flows
Impact fees
New     development affects circulation within and through our City
Additional traffic generated by     new development incrementally impacts
our   transportation system and affects the quality of life of Claremont
residents
 In 1997 the City completed       a  traffic impact fee analysis to show the
relationship      between      projected       new     development       needed
transportation improvements and estimated              costs  of improvements
As a result the City amended the Land Use and Development Code to
establish the transportation impact fee         The purpose of impact fees is
to fund transportation improvements needed to reduce impacts caused
by  new   development within the City        The  costs  of improvements    to be
funded by the fee is fairly apportioned to        new  development    relative to
the benefits conferred to    new   d velopment     or the need created by    new
development The City will       continue to    use impact fees  to fund required
roadway improvements

Circulation within The Claremont               Colleges
The Claremont Colleges         are destination     points for people arriving in the
City Transportation        and circulation among and between the campuses
are   important considerations            The campuses        are   surrounded and
traversed by the public       street system and also have        a  series of private
internal streets     Lich campus accesse nearby public streets as well as
adjoining campuses The Colleges have concerns regarding traffic at
specific links and intersections These concerns involve a range of
circulation    modes from vehicles to bicycles service vehicles and
pedestrians Additionally connections to major access points such as
the 10 Freeway the 21 0 Freeway Metrolink and Metro Gold Line
must be clearly understood             and navigable         Striking a consistent
balance between City and college concerns has long been a tradition in
Claremont and will continue to be a key priority for transportation

Accommodating Pedestrians Bicyclists                                  and
Equestrians
Pedestrians and cyclists share          our   roadways with automobiles They
also share    our  trail system with equestrians        Bicycling and walking play
increasingly      significant    roles   as    sustainable    alternatives    to   the
automobile       The City continues      to  recognize this fact by providing and
maintaining facilities for these other modes of travel                 Claremonters
have expressed        a  strong desire     to  maintain   public   space for   use  by
pedestrians bicyclists and equestrians
If walking and bicycling        to  work offer transportation alternatives the
City  must   pay close attention      to other issues beyond basic walking and
                          New     mixed  use neighborhood centers are needed
bicycling   systems
surrounding     The   Village   and  Foothill   Boulevard for people to walk and
shop   where    they  feel  comfortable      People seek out places where other
people congregate         Vehicular   traffic  must be accommodated but should
not  be allowed    to dominate land      use  and transportation decisions
Pedestrians
Walkability access         and connections        are  essential   components of     a
circulation      system      that   easily     and    specifically   accommodates
 pedestrians       Valkability includes wide sidewalks safe street crossings
features that encourage cautious driving and a pleasant and safe
walking environment            Valkways well designed pedestrian crossings
 pathways      and   pedestrian short cuts allow people to get from one
 destination point to another with ease Dedicated pedestrian paths can
 provide access between residential and activity areas especially if
streets  do    not connect        Pedestrian     connections should      be provided
 primarily   to  and from      activity  centers    such  as  The Village     foothill

Pedestrian systems         must  easily  and   efficiently  connect   people to their
desired destinations within the City              To feel   secure    walkways and
other public spaces should be open to public view Pleasant and secure
places have many houses stores and public spaces where we can
know    our  surroundings
Pedestrian connections are generally in place throughout the City
especially in residential neighborhoods and the Village                         Some
pedestrian connections between residential areas schools                           and
employment centers are                ing and some areas within the northern

part of the City have no pedestrian facilities Off4street pedestrian
facilities for hiking and recreational uses are located throughout the
City most notably along the Thompson Creek Trail and within the
Wilderness Park           When considering        new   connections      the City will
strive to   ensure   that  any    asociated problems       are  not shifted from   one
location   to  another
Walkability Improvements and Pedestrian Amenities
C1aremonters support proactive integration of the pedestrian oriented
improvements and amenities within             our   circulation system     to improve
walkability         Primary additional locations for incorporating these
features include Arrow Highway Foothill Boulevard and Base Line
Road        However these principles should also be applied to other                    Sidewalks and Curb Cuts

All  streets   in urban   neighborhoods    in Claremont should have sidewalks

or   pathways       on   both    sides     In   addition     to   providing   a   basic
transportation      route   sidewalks and pathways offer the opportunity             to
create   appealing public      spaces that reflect community pride and invite
people    to  walk     In many cases improvements to existing sidewalks
rather than       new   sidewalks     are needed for salety purposes              Curb
ramps at intersections allow for easy           accessibility on or off sidewalks
for  someone       with limited mobility      and for strollers        The City will
continue     to construct    curb ramps wherever needed to accommodate
individuals with limited mobility         A furniture zone provides space for
landscaping hydrants transit stops             bike   racks    and benches     so  that
walkways remain unobstructed
Landscaping      and Street Trees
Appropriate and aesthetically pleasing landscaping welcomes users to
use walkways         and can provide a sense of calm as the user moves
through     the    space      Street and shade tree canopies ensure that
temperature relieving        shade    encourages use even during the hottest

Driveway   Access
Driveways like side streets expose pedestrians to turning vehicles
Nthough drivers need access to properties consolidating driveways
and keeping them as narrow a                 ible makes walkways more
                                           pos
practical      One   issue to  be  considered   is the number of sloped
driveways along a sidewalk and the impact on wheelchairs and
walkers     Numerous driveway curb      cuts can  be problematic for those
users   due  to automobile drivers  not  paying attention  to people   on  the
sidewalk    and where     no  parkway separating the sidewalk from the
street   exists  the  constant  slopes present problems for wheelchair
users
Medians and Tuming Pockets
One method for reducing the frequency of turning           movements      that
cross   pedestrian travel routes is to provide raised medians Medians
provide essential buffers bernreen opposing lanes of traffic and can
increa e vehicle carrying capacity of individual lanes by restricting

are provided     in the median at major turning points        Medians also
provide pedestrians with a place to wait for a crossing opportunity

Pedestrian   Linkages
 Linkages are alleys walkways corridors and shared use paths that
connect pedestrian facilities Linkages increase pedestrian convenience
by providing short cuts to destinations Linkages often provide travel
routes that are more appealing than walking next to traffic        Claremont

Crosswalks and  Markings
Properly designed marked and signed crossings lead          to higher levels
of motorist courtesy toward pedestrians Pursuant to the City s adopted
crosswalk policy the City supports the provision of marked crosswalks
at  protected    signalized or stop controlled intersections if their
presence minimizes     pedestrian auto conflicts     The City discourages
marked crosswalks at unprotected locations mid block or uncontrolled
intersections however the City has established criteria for areas near
elementary schools by which residents may petition for installation of a
marked crosswalk at an unprotected location if certain conditions are
met

Way finding Signs
Clear way finding signs direct traffic      to specific destination points and
reduce traffic   through neighborhoods and the college campuses These
signs will become even more important as planned development in
Upland and Montclair are constructed and the demand for east west
access   is increased
Bicycles
Bicycling    is an  increasingly popular form of      recreation    as
well   as  transportation       Claremonters should      be able    to
easily cycle to work or school using convenient routes
Allowing bicycles on buses and providing secure bicycle
parking facilities will further encourage bicycling and
promote the use of multiple transportation modes Cycling is

Bikeway Classes
Like roadways bikeways come in many forms Figure 4 3 deignates a
series of Class I Class II and Class III bicycle facilities throughout the
City     Class I facilities             are   located  on a   separate  protected path Class II
facilities  are a  marked bike lane                  on  the pavement    adjacent to traffic and
Class III facilities consist of posted riding areas
figure     4 4   provides schematic diagrams illustrating the width and
features of each type of bikeway These routes are located both on
street and off street to reduce bicycle conflicts with automobiles and
pedestrians while maintaining connectivity Continuing challenges for
bikeways in Claremont include improved crossings over the 210
Freeway improvements at intersections and improved cross town                                    Class II Bike Routes
connections and routes to schools

Citrus Regional     Bikeway
The Citrus Regional Bikeway is                       a  portion of a  larger regional bike trail
system designed to provide                        a continuous path for bicyclists traveling
and commuting between San Dimas and Rialto                                      The bikeway
originally planned      to be constructed in the railroad                 right of way through
 the cities of San Dimas La Verne Pomona                            and Claremont has been
 moved     to  surface  streets to               avoid conflicts with the planned extension
of the Gold Line        from San Dimas                     to Claremont the Citrus negional
 Bikeway will utilize Bonita Avenue                     as  the primary route In Claremont
 the bikeway route will utilize Bonita Avenue and First Street for its
 primary route and will consist of Class I II and III paths When
 completed in Claremont the bikeway will connect to the regional trail in
 San Bernardino at the Upland Montclair boundary Sections of the
 regional trail are already completed in Upland Rancho Cucamonga
 and Fontana with the ultimate goal of providing a continuous path to
 Rialto
 Equestrians
 Although not significant for transportation purposes equestrian trails
 provide a recreational resource within the City Claremont as a whole
 is not an                 orequestientreiadn       community but an Equestrian Overlay
 District in   a residential neighborhood north of Base Line Road provides
 for a t  ail In addition the City s equestrian trail system includes trails
 on  portions of Mills Avenue and Padua Avenue and incorporates use
 of  the Wilderness Park Trail and Thompson Creek Trail                                   These
 facilities  are shared by equestrians bicyclists and hikers

Trails
Trails   are  multi purpose pathways located along drainage channels
roadways      or within the Wilderness Park         Single purpose and multi
purpose trails enhance community mobility and provide opportunities
for recreation and exercise A well defined interconnected trail system
can   also reduce dependence     on the automobile for short local trips    for

Riding       the Rails
 Railroads historically have played     a strong role in shaping Claremont s
form     establishing  connections to   surrounding cities and regions and
establishing the City as a destination for residents and visitors
 Beginning with the Santa Fe Railroad the Ontario and San Antonio
 Heights trolley and Pacific Electric Red Cars and continuing today
with Metrolink Amtrak and the planned extension of the Metro Gold
 Line rail transit provides options for Claremonters who wish to travel
beyond the City New options for transit oriented development projects
 in areas         unding rail stations have been created and rail transit

Metrolink
Metrolink is a regional rail system that provides reliable transportation
and  mobility for the region and is the result of a multi agency effort
involving the counties of Los Angeles Orange Riverside and San
Bernardino
                                                                             Metrolink

                                                                             which Jinks the City of San Bernardino and
                                                                             Downtown Los    Angeles Union Station
The Metrolink    commuter     rail service to Claremont operates on the
Union Pacific Railroad    UPRR right of way located approximately 0 8
miles north of the     10 Vreeway paralleling Arrow Highway             The
system   operated by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority
 SCRRA      provides service to employment centers such as downtown
Los Angeles Burbank and Irvine          In Claremont Metrolink users can
catch the San Bernardino Line at the station at the Claremont Depot on
First Street Claremont residents identify Metrolink as a definitive
community     transportation    asset      Metrolink   trains  of  the  San
Bernardino Line operate daily including weekends
Metro Gold Line
The Metro Gold Line is    planned   for extension eastward from Pasadena
to Montclair with   a station at the Claremont    Depot The    24 mile Gold
Line extension will parallel the Metrolink track through Claremont
The location of the Gold Line station in The Village will be designed     to
provide access between the two systems             The suriace i etrolink
parking lot will likely be replaced with a parking structure to meet the
increased parking demands of dual J etrolink and Gold Line service
Claremonters have been active in the planning and implementation of

Grade    Crossings
The rail alignments shared by Metrolink and the Metro Gold Line                cross
four Claremont streets at         grade       Cambridge Avenue          Indian   Hill
Boulevard College Avenue and Claremont Boulevard Mills Avenue
At these locations crossing gates and bells are required The increased
frequency of operation of Metro Gold Line trains may lead to increased
noise levels and traffic     congestion    at  one  or more    of these locations
Given the proximity of the light rail station and projected traffic volumes
on Indian Hill Boulevard the City will work actively to allow for proper
traffic flow through the traffic signals and railroad gates that surround
the light rail station In addition the City will explore the feasibility of
establishing Quiet   zones   along the rail alignment
T IaIIsit Oriented     Development
To be   most effective   transit service requires     supportive land    use   In the
early   years of the twentieth century         rail transit dominated travel in
cities   including Claremont         By necessity        early development       was
clustered    near  rail transit options offered by the Ontario and San
Antonio Heights trolley and Pacific Electric Railway In contrast at the
start   of the    twenty first   century     the automobile      represented      the
dominant fonn of transportation and proximity               to transit became      an
afterthought in development rrustration with freeway congestion and a
desire to spend more time with families and in leisure activities has led
a new generation of residents to explore options to suburban living and
long   commutes       In the   context   of excellent Metrolink service          and
extension of the Metro Gold Line Claremonters have identified Transit
Oriented      Development        TOD             a   sustainable approach           to
development that provides increased housing options and achieves
reductions in vehicle travel
The City     can   ensure   good accessibility to rail transit by clustering
higher density residential development around the Claremont Depot In
addition    transit can become      more     effective  as  an  alternative   to  the
automobile if other services and amenities             are  incorporated into the
design of TOO projects Such uses may include childcare dry cleaning
parcel pick up and           off
                             drop   facilities and convenience stores             By
enabling transit     riders   to  accomplish multiple errands within their
commute       the City can help rail transit to become a viable and
convenient transportation option
As identified   on  the Land Use Policy J ap several sites adjacent to the
Claremont      Depot are designated J ixed Use and transit oriented
development     with   a residential focus is the preferred option for           new
 uses  south of the Claremont Depot adjacent           to the tracks   near  College
Avenue       The City will work toward realization of            a  transit oriented
                                                                                                 P AGE 4 41

development       at  this location    In addition    the   City will   continue to
investigate and consider other options        to promote TODs in Claremont
Using     fixed Rate Buses
Promoting the       use  of buses and similar     non  fixed route transit within
to  and from       Claremont is     a  sustainable practice that reduces the
number of vehicles       on  the road   and subsequently the      amount    of fossil
fuels consumed by commuters               By using transit we reduce traffic
congestion reduce the need for costly roadway improvement projects
improve air quality and ensure a healthier population                  Also many
Claremont residents cannot drive or choose not to drive including pre
teen and teenage youth seniors living in residential care facilities and
seniors Hving on their own            Claremont residents have consistently
supported initiatives to provide better public transportation
Bus Service
Public   bus service       in Claremont     is  provided by foothill Transit
Claremont     was     active in the formulation of foothill Transit in          1988
after the former Southern California Rapid Transit District                   RTD
announced service elimination in Claremont              as  well as   cuts and fare
increases that would impact the San Gabriel               Valley    In an effort to
provide better bus service to the San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys
while reducing costs and improving local control the Los Angeles
County Transportation Commission approved Foothill Transit s joint
powers authority application to assume control of 14 lines operated by
RTD     foothill Transit is     now one   of the most    successful bus operators
in the country       providing   many connections     throughout the valleys      to
the Metrolink system
An established network of foothill Transit           routes    provides access to
recreational     institutional   residential and commercial       uses throughout
Claremont and         connects us to other jurisdictions in the San Gabriel
Valley and Inland Empire All of the routes connect to Metrolink at the
Claremont Depot with many of these buses going directly to Montclair
Transit Center        Foothill Transit routinely updates its long range service
plans to respond to necessary changes to service levels and route
configurations In addition approximately 200 parking spaces will be
provided in The ViIlage s new parking structure for Foothill Transit
users
The ability   to  modify   bus routes  over time   will allow Claremont to have
improved access to airports better integration of transit within new
developments better transit options east into J ontclair and San
 Bernardino County and potentially the creation of privately owned
public transportation options to supplement the excellent services
provided by Foothill Transit Together these steps will ensure that
Claremont achieves the goal of becoming a place where a car is not
always required

Amtrak also provides bus service                   to   Claremont      stopping   at the
Claremont Depot       on   its  route  between Bakersfield        to Indio   Greyhound
provides     service   to    the City    at   its   station   located    on  Indian  Hill

Paratransit
Paratransit       describes         types       of     public
transportation        that       are     distinct       from
conventional fixed       route    bus transit including
flexibly scheduled and routed services such as
dial a rides       carpools            and        vanpools
Claremont s      paratransit      services    include     two
general public services offered for travel within
the City and a third service intended to provide
trips for senior and disabled residents for travel

Meeting Our Parking Needs
Parking typically      is considered    a  separate issue from vehicle
circulation    However       the presence of    on  street  parking has  a
direct effect  on  roadway capacity        In addition off street parking
deficiencies   can  cause   vehicles  to  recirculate  on a  public street
which also increases traffic volumes and congestion           by reducing
capacity for through traffic
The City s     Land Use and Development Code requires that
parking be provided for all uses on a site These requirements
for parking spaces are consistent with the standards of other
jurisdictions These regulations apply to all new developments
and may be applied to existing uses that are modified or
expanded The City will continue to enforce these provisions
At  some locations including areas surrounding the Claremont
Depot and The Village signs are used to direct motorists to
preferred parking locations Maintaining and expanding the use
of directionaJ sigJ1age is critical    to  ensuring that   areas set aside
for  parking are used to their full potential and that spill          over
parking does not impact surrounding neighborhoods
Adequate off street parking effective regulation of on street parking            Village Parking
and improved directional signage leading to parking locations are                Most on street parking in the Claremont Village
significant concerns throughout the City             However two locations in    is limited to two hours
particular     The Village and The Claremont Colleges             present unique
parking challenges
Parking     in The   Village
Parking    in The    Village presents a continuous challenge due to the
success   of The    Village On street parking in the retail portions ofThe
Village  is  heavily used       The City and I edevelopment Agency have
created severaJ off street parking lots within The Village to help
alleviate parking shortages and have added parking within the former
Pacific Electric lhilroad right of way along First Street At peak times
visitors experience difficulties finding parking in the most convenient
locations within The Village A new multi level piUking structure will

address parking        needs    for   Village expansion across Indian Hill
Boulevard and may         help relieve parking for other Village businesses in
the immediate vicinity
Parking needs in The Village must continue to be considered in
conjunction with continued Metrolink service initiation of Metro Gold
Line service and expanded retail and entertainment opportunities in
The Village
Parking near and at The Colleges
Areas located along the interfaces between The Colleges surrounding
neighborhoods and The Claremont Village also experience increased
parking demand       as   a result of overflow from campus parking lots           A
balance must be maintained between the desire to park close                  to the
institutional   recreational and residential     uses  at and  surrounding The
Colleges     and creating     an  environment    where   an   automobile is     not
required   to access   these  uses
On campus parking is by permit only and no overnight parking is
permitted off campus on City streets by residents or students Parking
requirements are determined for each campus per City requirements
but are permitted to be met in the aggregate for all campuses While
students must park on their own campus faculty and staff members
may park in any permitted area thus creating a                     f1oat
                                                                       of demand
among campuses driven largely by the parking supply                   Pricing and
enforcement of parking vary among the campuses and overflow
parking onto City streets js a concern
The Colleges     are  generally allowed some flexibility in meeting the City s
established parking requirements The City will continue to work with
The Colleges to review parking distribution and address parking issues
as they arise to minimize impacts on nearby residential neighborhoods
Also the City will work with The Colleges to develop a parking
management plan Such a plan may include alternatives for peripheral
parking with various incentive programs to reduce the need for parking
adjacent to all facilities It would need to include enforcement tools             to
help ensure parking does not spill into adjacent neighborhoods
Routes to Schools and Parks
Schools in Claremont         were    designed  with the assumption that most
students would walk          Many of Claremont s schools were also paired
with neighborhood parks          at the planning and design stage         Each of
these characteristics presents         opportunities to  encourage sustainable
pedestrian travel to Claremont s quality schools and parks
However       trends indicate that      many   parents will continue     to  prefer
using    their   cars   to  drop    off and   pick  up   children   from    school
Associated traffic results in unique congestion problems          on  local streets
                                                                                               PAGE 4 40

that  were not designed         to handle large        peak hour loading queues
Congestion and parking problems also occur during special purpose
and sports events     at schools
OUf community seeks both            to  recapture the sustainable practices of
walking and bicycling to and from schools and parks and to reduce
congestion in areas immediately surrounding these facilities The City
will work with the Claremont Unified School District to provide
accessible    pedestrian      routes    to  local    schools     from   surrounding
neighborhoods
Truck Routes
Claremont experiences moderate             amounts      of truck traffic associated
with local commercial and industrial          uses     Truck traffic may increase
moderately     over   time    to  support    new    businesses       Therefore our
circulation system needs       to continue to accommodate truck traffic
To minimize truck traffic impacts            on  residential neighborhoods and
other    noise sensitive     uses     the   City s    roadway      system   includes
designated truck routes as shown in Figure 4 5                      The truck  route
system provides access to all areas of the City and             is intended for both
local deliveries and through trucks
These routes      are    also situated     on  interregional     routes Of   provide
connectivity   to  them The City has signage along truck              routes leading
from the 10 freeway and the 21 0 freeway to reduce the                   amount    of
truck traffic that finds its way onto undesignated streets
Airports

Ontario International     Airport
Ontario International Airport is the hub of air transportation for         east
Los Angeles County and the Inland Empire           Once located   on  the edge
of the developing portions of Los Angeles the airport        now    sits at the
center of a  burgeoning urban   area  and is poised  to grow substantially in
coming years The proximity of these        services is beneficial to residents
and businesses in Claremont and the region
Claremont is affected by noise from Ontario air traffic during Santa
Ana wind conditions when flight patterns are adjusted and planes fly
directly over the City Planes also fly over southern parts of Claremont
along the 10 Freeway even without the presence of Santa Ana winds
In addition ground transportation to the airport travels along the 10
freeway
Cable Airport
Cable Airport is     a  privately owned      public  use airport located     in
northwest Upland The Claremont Colleges and some residents along
the City s eastern boundary are affected by noise from Cable Airport
operations   on an on going basis
Brackett Field
Brackett Field in La Verne is owned by the County of Los Angeles A
general  aviation  airport Brackett Field     is used exclusively by private
and business aircraft that do not provide        common   carrier passenger
service
Separating the flight paihs of small private and commuter planes from
the larger national and international passenger carriers is aconcern for
locations like Claremont where airports providing the various types of
service are in close proximity       The City will seek ways to improve
access for    Claremonters to Ontario International Airport and will
continue to work with neighboring jurisdictions to develop and support
regional aircraft controls and to monitor airport operations and flight
patterns to protect the quality of life of residents

The continued existence of natural      open space within the   CIty is crucial

Oty makes great efforts to conserve them wherever they occur taking
into consideration the rights of property owners and encourages first
the use and reuse of already changed lands The Oty is creative in its
exploration of all avenues leading to the long term preservation of all
natural areas throughout the Oty for the benefit of present and future
generations
Claremont values constructed open space as an easily accessible
resource for the entire community           Such open spaces are vital to the
continued wel being of the citizens of Claremont providing beauty and
opportunities for mental and physical recreation The City continues to
look for    spaces between       to  use as   constructed open space in every
sector  of the Oty and requires that        new   development make provision
for such open space        The Oty   acts to  ensure   physical open space links
through construction of paths greenways bikeways and drainage
corridors and to ensure visual access to open spaces by establishing
view corridors and controlling massing within the built environment
Claremont      is   an   innovative    leader   in   hillside   preservation     and
management        strategies    and   acts   to   preserve     the  hillsides from
development taking        into consideration the     rights of property     owners
so   that   the   hillsides   remain    a  resource      for  future generations
Claremont is in part defined by its irreplaceable natural           resources    and

Claremont residents value open space which is broadly defined as land
without buildings or few or no permanent improvements These spaces
can  range in size from   a  few square feet   to hundreds of acres Some         are
naIural habitats such    as   the Claremont Wilderness Park while others
consist of constructed    or   improved areas such       as parks school fields
plazas and parkways        Many open space areas         are publicly owned but
                                      land
open space can include private              that is used for private recreation
resource protection or similar purposes          Open space can be found in all
areas of the City from private yards in residential districts to courtyards
and landscaped gardens in non residential areas The designation of

to open spaces such 1 parks and groundwater recharge basins that
are   restricted to  uses   to   preserve natural    resources      allow for the

recreation activities such       a hiking and bird watching

also provides protection from natural hazards such               as  flooding and

Natural    resources     are  the materials and capacities
supplied by      nature     Claremont s wealth of natural
resources      is obvious       vast   open spaces           native

ridg elines       mineral     resources          and      geologic
formations          These     are    excellent     examples of
resources    supplied by     nature     The     common      thread
interwoven among these         resources     is open space       By
preserving       open    space      the    City    can     achieve
preservation         and    conservation          of    treasured
resources
Wildlife Communities and Habitat Protection
Preserving and protecting wildlife habitat equates to the preservation
and protection of wildlife species             The real diversity of vegetation
types and habitat in Claremont supports                  a  wide variety of animal
populations        Natural habitat     such    as   riparian   areas   provides food
cover    and shelter for birds mammals reptiles and insects                     Vildlife
corridors provide      areas   of undisturbed open space that allow regional
wildlife migration between natural habitats promoting proliferation of
indigenous species
One of the       most valuable features of natural habitats is their great
diversity   of  living organisms The diversity is the result of millions of
years of evolution        The interdependence of the organisms within                  an
ecosystem is      adversely affected by development              If we protect habitat
we   help  to   maintain   diversity    If  we   lose habitat    we are   likely to lose
species which could be of considerable help             to  people and   are necessary
for   a   healthy     ecosystem         Creating a balance between habitat

fire is   a natural part of Southern California s Mediterranean climate
Core samples from trees located in the San Gabriel Mountains indicate
that large fires occurred long before      man   arrived    on the continent Fire
is  a mechanism that recycles nutrients in dead vegetation and provides
the food necessary for future plant generations This climate is too dry
for bacterial action to significantly recycle nutrients as is common in the
humid Pacific Northwest The native chaparral vegetation has adapted
to this  cycle by  re sprouting from burned root         crowns or   requiring the
heat of a fire to break seed dormancy and         to initiate  growth
 Elimination of the potential for wildfire within the        chaparral  community
would require the total removal of all vegetation This is not feasible
 due to erosion and environmental and aesthetic concerns                        The
 objective  must  then be    to  minimize the impact of wildfire within the
                                                                  constraints
 limitations of environmental and regulatory
 In the hillsides where dense vegetation        creates   fire hazards for homes
 that may be built there our historic fire prevention practices have
 involved extensive clearing or fuel modification               Often the area of
fuel modification is underestimated          necessitating subsequent habitat
 damaging encroachment          into dedicated     open space to satisfy this
 requirement      Insurance carriers may require            an  even   greater fuel
 buffer zone than the local fire code mandates
The impact from wildfire and resulting erosion and mud flows into
 neighborhoods adjoining the Claremont Hills Wilderness Park can be
 significantly reduced but not eliminated It is then the responsibility of
 the adjoining community to take appropriate actions to reduce or
 eliminate   combustible surfaces and flammable vegetation                on   their
 property
 HumanlWildlife            Encounter
 Encroachment      of human development into natural wildlife               habitat
 invites increased conflicts between humans their pets             and wildlife   In
 these situations wildlife     may be harmed by urban features such              as
 spiked fencing automobiles secondary pesticide poisoning competition
 with and predation by free roaming domestic pets etc                  Often these
 conflicts may be avoided or reduced with appropriate planning and
 public education
 Native Nesting Birds
 Some native bird species may survive within native and nonnative
 urban landscape plantings which provide food shelter and nest sites
 Landscaping    may    in fact  provide the only     habitat available for native
 bird species within    an  urban environment         Impacts to native nesting
 birds from development projects        are  commonly overlooked during the

Streams and       Riparian Corridors
All of the   streams    in Claremont     are  classified by the United States
Geologic Survey      as   intermittent   meaning    water   does    not flow  year
round but    occurs  during periods of sufficient rainfall and       or snowmelt
generally from November to March Some of the streams originate
within the City limits while others originate at higher elevations of the
San Gabriel Mountains north of Claremont                Vatercourses in the San
Gabriel    River    Watershed that      originate   within    the   boundaries     of

Urban Runoff
Urban runoff consists of          water    that has drained from human made
non   porous surfaces in densely populated areas These surfaces consist
of roads freeways sidewalks roofed structures parking lots and
industrial     sites   among others Any form of precipitation and or
irrigation   can   scour these surfaces and wash away the materials on top
of and from which the surfaces are made Much urban terrain is non
porous      and     does    not   have    the   ability to filter or biodegrade
contaminants like         natural soils     are   capable of doing      Suspended
sediment is the primary pollutant in urban runoff                 Urban runoff can
also contain Quantities of oil grease pesticides from turf management
metals bacteria and viruses and toxic chemicals from automobiles
among others         As the water transports pollutants within the watershed
system it     pollutes rivers and streams which can contribute to pollution
of the   ocean even     though Claremont       is over  30 miles away
State and federal regulations work            to protect watershed and recharge
areas     In particular the State Regional Water Quality Control Board
mandates control          of urban runoff       to  eliminate   the percolation    of
pollutants from surface runoff into underground              water  supplies At the
local level cities      must   ensure   provision of vegetated swales        buffers
and     infiltration    areas    in   new     development projects        Additional
approaches include desi@l ing sidewalks roads and driveways utilizing
alternative materials      to  minimize impervious surfaces

 Hillside       Jervation became an important issue during the 1970s as an
              prC
increasing     number     of residential subdivisions were constructed in the
foothills of surrounding communities In 1977 the Claremont League of
  Vomen Voters completed a two year study of the issue which resulted
 in a  number of recommendatiohs             on   how  to manage development in
 the local hillsides
                                                                                                                        PAGE                 5  7
CITY        OF     CLAREMONT                 GENERAL               PLAN
In response     to   the public s    concern     the City began the process of
developing    new    policies governing hillside development The first step
was   adoption of the Natural Environment Element of the City s
General Plan in 1977 which articulated the City s general goals and
policies regarding hillside development The element stated that
development in the hillsides is acceptable provided it is performed with
extreme care in      a  manner compatible with the environment and that it
keeps the    area    relatively safe from hazards such as fire flood and
erosion
However      these    new   General Plan goals and policies could not be
implemented        until   several     additional     actions      were    completed
particularly the adoption           of  hillside   zoning     regulations     and   the
annexation of     a   porUon of the hillside      area   At the time     the hillsides
north of Claremont       were under     the jurisdiction of Los Angeles County
which had very lenient standards for hillside development
Crafting  the Hillside Ordinance
In keeping with Claremont s participatory style of addressing significant
community issues         a task force representing concerned organizations
City  commissions and the         City Council    was created     in 1979 to   develop
and evaluate various alternatives The group worked for over a year
eventually crafting a draft ordinance that was presented to the Planning
Commission and the public for review What followed                   was   a  series of
nine  public hearings      over seven months in 1980             Among those who
actively participated in the hearings were hillside landowners
developers the League of Women Voters and a number of local
residents The discussions were intense touching on the full range of
issues    related to hillside development                including environmental
protection property rights and community values
The ordinance      was    adopted by the City Council         on   January 13 1981
The    ordinance       provides the framework for               allowing residential
development      in the     hillsides within concentrated          areas   where    the
terrain  is flatter and easier to       develop      These     areas   are  MOwn     as
  cluster sites     Property     owners   with   development      credits  in the  non
cluster  areas    or steeper areas are allowed to transfer development
credits to the cluster    areas    In summary the ordinance          ensures   that
         The majority of        acres  of hillsides between Webb Canyon and
          the   San      Bernardino      County     line   will   be   preserved     as
          permanent open space
          Homes will not be dotted        across   the hillsides
          Large contiguous tracts of open space will be preserved
          Development will be focused in those areas best suited for it
          Owners of aU      parcels  receive   some    economic benefit from their
          properUes because the development credits              can  be transferred

Claremonl Wildlands Conservancy
The Claremont Wildlands Conservancy is             a non   profit organization
started in January 2000 with the mission of preserving natural open
space land in Claremont s foothills for future generations to enjoy
Since its establishment the Conservancy has been working with the
Trust for Public Land TPL and the City to pursue grants and other
resources to purchase hillside properties         This working relationship
has resulted in successful grant applications         to purchase additional
properties  to  be included in the hillside open space system

Groundwater Protection and           Recharge
Groundwater      resources   are   important to Claremont because of the
community s reliance       on  local groundwater for drinking       water      As
early  as the 18505     Claremont citrus growers and farmers used San
Antonio   Canyon and Thompson Creek runoff for irrigation They used
a system of streambeds and ditches as a method of channeling flood
waters and conserving annual flood waters          With the formation of the
Pomona Valley Protective Association PVPA in 1908 this group has
been able to capture billions of gallons of flood waters for the
replenishment of local groundwater basins for             use    every    day by
                         3
Claremont residents         The retention and protection of groundwater
resources in terms of volume            and quality    are  essential    to  both
Claremont                                for drinking           recreation    and

community sustainability
The City of Claremont overlies parts of five groundwater basins                the
 Upper Claremont Heights Lower Claremont Heights Live Oak
Canyon and Pomona Basins                  These groundwater basins are
designated on the basis of geolOgical and hydrolOgical conditions
 usually associated with the occurrence of alluvial or unconsolidated
deposits   These groundwater         basins   are also regulated for        water
supply

CITY       Of       CLAREMONT                 GENERAL           PLAN
Open   space allows the         recharging of groundwater basins The San
Antonio Spreading Grounds                  the Thompson Creek Spreading
Grounds and the Pedley Spreading Grounds allow rainwater and snow
runoff to recharge the Canyon Basin and the Upper Claremont Heights
Basins     Ensuring the groundwater basins provide adequate water to
Claremont residents will improve the management and sustainability of
groundwater      in the local   area
Penneable Surfaces for Groundwater           Recharge
Permeable surfaces           are areas   characterized by materials that allow
stormwater to infiltrate the        underlying soils     During the rainy  season
when water hits streets and parking lots it typically speeds on its way
via storm drainage facilities to the Pacific Ocean                  However if a
raindrop can fall upon a permeable surface it can help recharge
groundwater basins filter away potential pollutants and contribute to
enhanced habitat and urban landscaping
Septic Tanks
Septic systems are on site systems designed for safe disposal of
biological sanitary waste Septic tanks are feasible as long as they are
in  areas   where       housing    units  are  at  lower densities   are  properly
maintained        and     do   not   aggregate    nitrate  concentrations   in  the
groundwater           Although septic tanks         are  often suitable  for rural
environments        if they   are  not sited   designed   or maintained properly
they   can     pose     a   threat  to  the   environment     and human health
speCifically if clean groundwater supplie are contaminated                    As a
matter of policy the City requires all properties within the City limits to
connect to the City s sewer system because of nitrate issues within the
water basins        Properties within the sphere of influence and under the
jurisdiction   of  Los   Angeles County that use septic tanks are encouraged
to annex into the City and connect to the public sewer system
Open Space               for Public Health and               Safety
                        open space is admired for its scenic
Although natural                                                 beauty and  native
vegetation it also       can  buffer private property from     nature s destructive
forces
Protection from Natural Hazards
Claremont has been susceptible              to  many natural     hazards  over  the
years   including       wildland fires   earthquakes     mudslides   and  flooding  Open Space for Public Health and Safety
Other physical conditions in Claremont such as earthquake fault zones
liquefaction areas landslide areas and steeply sloped hillsides present
additional danger to the general community                  Open space can help
 mitigate this danger by prohibiting development within hazard               areas
The swath of homes located in Palmer                  Canyon    an unincorporated
area  in the    City s sphere of influence        were   largely destroyed by the
 2003 wildland fires that roared           across   the base of the San Gabriel

Open    space      within the urban sections of Claremont               serves    many
purposes        In addition    to  parks urban     open space     can   include public
plazas parkways tree lined streets and school fields all of which add to
the quality of life in Claremont neighborhoods Such open spaces within
the urban environment create a feeling of space                   Shade and foliage
create areas      for relaxation
Additionally       open spaces      in urban areas can       remedy     certain  urban
environmental issues           Such spaces       mitigate   stormwater      and  urban
runoff   create     permeable surfaces that allow precipitation to nourish
landscaping absorb air pollution reduce the urban heat island effect
and create urban habitat for regional fauna The reinvigoration of natural
ecosystems through an opportunistic use of open spaces can provide
economic       environmental and social benefits          to  Claremont residents
and fulfill  a balanced approach of sustainability
Private Open Space           in  Uman Areas
The City       of Claremont        has been     successful    in ensuring     that  its
residential commercial industrial and institutional neighborhoods have
remained green          As part of the      development review process private
property     owners are      required    to  provide open space areas on their
properties       In residential   areas   these are yards patios balconies and
active recreational       facilities   In    non residential  areas    these include
outdoor seating       areas  landscaped parkways courtyards and plazas
StreetTrees and          Community forest
The formation of        a street tree   planting program began in 1944 when
the Committee of One Hundred began               to organize for the beautification
of the City After collecting funds from residents they proposed to the
City Council a uniform tree planting program whereby committee
members would remove and replace poor trees with new trees and
water them for the first year if the City agreed to take over watering
duties the following year The City Council agreed The committee
eventually made recommendations for parkways and the requirement
of developers to pay for the planting of street trees                     lthough the

Parks    are a   large  part of Claremont s open spaces            Parks in Claremont
have always been valued by residents               as evidenced in 1946 when     more
than two thirds of Claremont                voters  approved the Memorial Park
project The concept of locating park facilities adjacent to local schools
occurred as a result of decisions made by the Postwar Planning
Committee          a  committee         that  started   in    1944  as  a   forum  for
encouraging good planning                t any of the recommendations from this
                                         1
committee have           influenced the design and character of Claremont
including the creation of a parkways and streets commission and a
park and recreational commission locating parks adjacent to schools
and the joint use of park and school facilities                 During the 1970s the
community s focus changed to parks maintenance rather than growth
Programs developed in the t 970s focused on creating healthy
neighborhood parks and accommodating more active recreational uses
such as sport courts and fields in parks rather than planning for passive
uses such as walking paths and seating areas

Surplus  Remnant    freeway Right   of Way
As  a result of the 210 Freeway construction by Caltrans           a  few surplus
remnant    pieces of land adjacent       to   the freeway right of     way    have
resulted   Both the cities of Claremont and La Verne          were led   to believe
that these parcels     were  either going    to be landscaped    or  lell  as open
space for the cities to  use  for park purposes following the completion of
the freeway       based   on   the  1999    Memorandum         of Understanding
between Caltrans and the individual        cities and   or on verbal  assurances
made by Caltrans staff during the construction process                 Claremont
has  designated    two  such  parcels  as   Parks Resource Conservation          as

Table 5 2 identifies the park acreage population and the ratio of park
acres per 1 000 residents        as  documented for 2005 and projected for
2025    The total park acreage does not include the Claremont Hills
Wilderness Park and Sycamore Canyon Park as these parks do not
provide organized recreational       space
At the national            professional park planners have

parkland acreage goal      or  standard for urban areas          As   a  rule of thumb
many cities throughout California         use   3 0 to 5 0   acres    of parkland per
1000   residents    as    a  benchmark for sufficient            park     space     The
Claremont City Council has adopted            a  standard of 4 0      acres   per 1 000
residents    This is the ratio the City           uses   for park dedication fees
requirements     As shown in Table 5 2            as  of 2005 Claremont did          not
meet this target The         City will   meet the      target goal ratio with the
construction of Padua Avenue Park and                proposed parks adjacent          to

Park  facility Needs
Providing sufficient parkland means more than setting aside adequate
acres    Equally important in parks planning is locating parks and
providing facilities that meet the needs of the population When taking
into account park location service area standards recommended by the
National Recreation and Parks Association                  NRPA        indicate that   a
park typically should cover a one quarter to one half mile service area
radius depending on the size of the park In general most residential
sections of the City except in the most northeasterly section ofthe City
are currentiy within one half mile of a park facility see figure 5 1
In Claremont the construction of sports fields has                not kept pace with
population growth and        the  popularity of organized youth sports The

Renewable      Energy    Use
Renewable         energy     sources    capture    energy from       on   going   natural
processes such as sunshine             wind flowing      water   biological   processes
and geothermal heat flows Neither nuclear power                   nor  fossil fuels such
as  coal      oil and natural gas are renewable                 Renewable forms of
energy      other than geothermal and tidal power ultimately come from
the sun Biomass for example is accumulated                   over a  period of months
as with    straw    or through     many years     as  with wood
These renewable energy              resources    may be used       directly or used to
create    other   more     convenient forms of energy         Examples of direct use
are   solar ovens geothermal heating and water wheels and windmills
Examples of indirect use which require energy harvesting are electricity
generation through wind turbines or photovoltaic cells or production of
fuels such as ethanol from biomass

Homeowners        can    take many actions to reduce water         use  such as using
water    conserving toilets and washers fixing leaks planting drought
tolerant     landscaping and simply avoiding over watering plants
Gardens and turf consume a high percentage of residential water
Landscaping with drought tolerant plants represents an effective
method of conserving water
The     City has adopted yard landscaping requirements limiting the
amount of turf in        new development and requiring the use of drought
tolerant plants Drought tolerant planting is also incorporated into City
landscape projects An approximate 1i0 percent decrease in outdoor
irrigation by the City residents and businesses would lower the
community s total daily water use by approximately 30 percent
Drought tolerant plants shrubs and trees are specially adapted to grow
well in regions that get little or infrequent amounts of rain These
plants require less water to live in Southern California s climate and
soil and tend     to  be  more   pest and disease resistant
Reclaimed        or   recycled     water     water    that  has   received    at  least
secondary      treatment      and basic disinfection at     a  domestic wastewater
treatment     facility    can  be used for landscape irrigation and industrial
use      Wastewater within Claremont s              corporate boundary flows via
regional trunk lines       to regional wastewater treatment facilities operated
by the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County located in Pomona
The Sanitation Districts do make this reclaimed water available for
nonpotable        uses      primarily     for    landscape    irrigation    However
Claremont s distance from the regional              wastewater treatment     facilities
and the lack of infrastructure such           as  dedicated pipelines and    a  supply
and storage network hinder Claremont s                 uses of this reclaimed    water
The City will need to continue         to  explore alternatives for how reclaimed
water    can  be used in the community
Solid Waste Generation and                Recycling
Throwing away          a gilt box  at home or a shipping box at the office adds
to   the   solid   waste     stream    with    one   final destination    the landfill
Although      one or    two boxes may        seem   insignificant imagine a region
with    over   10 million people and thousands of businesses constantly
throwing away recyclable materials Many landfills in Southern
California are quickly reaching capacity with new locations sought in
the desert and beyond Land is a valuable resource in Southern
California       Recycling of solid waste and diverting recyclable materials
from landfills help reduce the environmental costs associated with
expanding and siting         new  landfills
 Recycling is not entirely new to Claremont Since the first recycling
center    opened in 1972 with the help of the Lions Club and the City of
Claremont recycling efforts hav been a mainstream effort by residents

  Construction Recycling
  Construction and demolition materials account for almost 22 percent of
  the waste stream Many of these materials can be reused or recycled
  thus  prolonging          our  supply of natural      resources   and potentially saving
  money in the process              Common construction and demolition materials
  include lumber drywall metals masonry brick concrete etc                          carpet
  plastic pipe rocks dirt paper cardboard and green waste related to
  land development Of these metals are the most commonly recycled
  material while lumber makes up the majority of construction debris
  deposited in landfills
  Reuse and recycling of construction and demolition materials is                       one
  component of           a larger holistic practice of sustainable       or  green building
  construction The efficient               use  of  resources  is a  fundamental   tenet of
  green building             construction       This    means    reducing     reusing   and
  recycling       most     if not  all materials that remain after       a construction  or
  renovation project             Green building construction practices          can include
  salvaging dimensional lumber from the project using aggregates
  reclaimed from crushed concrete or grinding drywall scraps for use on
  site as a soil amendment                        Reuse of existing buildings through
  restoration or adaptive change of use reduces the need for new

  Mineral Resources
  The California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 SMARA
  requires that all           cites address in their       general plans the significant
  aggregate resources classified by the State Geologist and designated by
  the State Mining and Geology Board                          SMARA was enacted to
  promote conservation and protection of significant mineral deposits
  The law also ensures that significant aggregate resources are
r
          recogn
          zed        and considered before land            use  decisions   are  made that
  may compromis               the availability of these    resources
  The State Geologist classifies lands in California based on geological
  factors and without regard to eXisting land use and land ownership
   Because available aggregate                  construction    material is limited    four
  designations have been established for the classification of sand gravel
  and crushed rock            resources

The City recognizes the importance of the mineral resources in
Claremont The Oty further recognizes its responsibilities to balance
the value of these       resources          and consider their regional and statewide
importance whenever it considers                   a  project that would threaten their
ability to be extracted             As part of this General Plan therefore the Oty
incorporates by          reference          the state policy for conservation and

Most of the undeveloped land within the designated        areas of regional
significance is included in the extensive landholdings of the Pomona
Valley Protective Association PVPA and is used for watershed and
groundwater recharge Although this land has been designated as a
significant regional mineral resource this land is also important
ecologically  as  it contains  Riversidean Alluvial fan     Sage  Scrub    a
specialized habitat that has been largely lost in Southern California due
to urban development        The PVP A land also serves as a buffer to
separate Claremont residents from the extensive mining operations
located east of Claremont and the negative impacts of the mining
operations    including  noise   vibration  traffic dust    and  the visual
scarring of the environment
In  the City s    Land  Use   Plan   the   PVPA land     is  designated  as
ParkResource Conservation in recognition of the land s important
groundwater recharge function With this designation the land is
protected from incompatible development that would prevent access to
the aggregate deposits should it be demonstrated in the future that the
need to mine the deposits or benefits to the community outweigh the
adverse impacts that the mining would have on the community and the
environment      In the meantime where any development is approved
near   the PVP A land that might threaten the potential for mining that
land the City will require sufficient mitigation for that development to
address any land use incompatibilities that might arise between the
approved developments and       any mining of the PVP A that     might later
be permitted

Air Quality
The average adult inhales about 12 times             a   minute    or  takes  over   17
thousand breaths      a  day    When     we  breathe in       we  take in air that is
contaminated daily by        our activities   driving    cars   burning fossil fuels
and   manufacturing chemicals             Although       air  quality in Southern
California   has   improved      since   the   I 960s     even    with the    region  s
substantial    economic       expansion     and     population      growth     further

South Coast Air Basin
Claremont lies within the South Coast Air Basin                  a  geographic    area
that extends from the Pacific Ocean         to  the San Gabriel Mountains and
from the Ventura County boundary              east to    the San Bernardino and
San Jacinto Mountains The air basin is               a    non  attainment     area  for
federal and   state air  quality standards for     ozone    and  state standards    for
particulate   matter    less than    10 microns      in diameter        PM I 0    The
South Coast Air Quality Management District SCAQMD                       regulates air
quality improvement programs within the basin and works to improve
regional air Quality to achieve federal and state standards
The SCAQMD monitors the air quality in the basin through                   a  regional
network of air pollution monitoring stations           to  determine if the national
and  state  standards for air pollutants and emission limits of toxic air
contaminants     are  being achieved       One of these monitoring stations is
located   in   the   city   of  Glendora      approximately         six  miles   from
Claremont s boundary and another is located in the eastern end of
Upland in San Bernardino County approximately four miles from the
City The SCAQMD            is also responsible for controlling        emissions frum
stationary   sources    of air pollution     These     can   include anything from
large power    plants   and refineries to the     comer     gas station    Claremont

has continued to work with the        SCAQMD and in accordance with the
applicable Air Qualify Management Plan to improve the regional
transportation system and regional air quality
Sources of Air Pollution
Motor vehicles represent the major source of regional emiSSions
throughout the basin and within Claremont Land use patterns which
inefficiently distribute housing densities employment       centers and mass
transit facilities lead to excessive automobile usage        Vehicles idling in
heavy traffic congestion such as those crawling along the freeways
during peak hours of the day can contribute to excessive exhaust
Most pollution control strategies have aimed at reducing vehicle usage
and using cleaner burning fuels
Other    sources    of air pollution include     auto  repair businesses   dry
cleaners     and    businesses     that  regularly   use  chemical   solvents
Common      sources   of fine particulate matter or PM I O include road dust
construction     activity   grading and fireplaces       The Vulcan Mining
facility   Cable Airport      and the Ontario International Airport         all
located outside of Claremont              are   also regional  sources   of air
pollution
Claremont    s  local air quality conditions result largely from sources
outside the immediate        area as prevailing westerly breezes push air
pollution from the valleys     up against the mountains
Claremont benefits from being located        at the mouth of the San Antonio
Canyon       Clean cool air drains into Claremont each evening Also
Claremont participates in a number of efforts to improve air quality
within the region

 How We                   Identify and Guard
Against Hazards
The Pub6c Safety and Noise Element establishes policies to protect the
Claremont community from natural and human caused hazards and to
abate noise by identifying its      sources  and assessing alternative methods
of reducing    noise    impacts
Scope and Content of the Public Safety and Noise Element
This Element fulfills requirements for         two mandatory elements Safely
and Noise Since these two elements overlap with regard to mitigation
of hazards they       are  combined into one chapter
 Historically Claremont has placed an emphasis on planning and part
of this proactive approach to          ing a sustainable community involves

Seismic Hazards
Seismic hazards represent a concern in Oaremont given the Gty s
location at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains a seismically active
range and the fact that Ca6fornia sits at the edge of the Pacific Plate
Earthquakes       are  part of  our   lives   and  we  recOWUze that regional
seismic events     can  result in property damage deaths fIreS and other
secondary effects        The primary results from earthquakes are strong
ground shaking and surface fault rupture Secondary effects include
landslides slope deformation 6quefaction and ground subsidence
Ground shaking effects felt locally depend upon many factors most
notably the intensity of the event distance to the earthquake epicenter
the depth of the earthquake        and local soils conditions              ists
                                                                           Seismolot
use    a   10000000thmic magnitude scale to describe the intensity of
earthquakes However what impresses us most when an earthquake
occurs are its effects     What kind of damage correlates to for example
a 1i 4 magnitude earthquake         The Modified Mercal6 Scale presented
in Table 6 1 was developed to further public understanding of the
potential destructive effects of earthquakes of varying magnitudes
Although earthquakes have not resulted in catastrophic property
damage deaths or widespread injuries in Claremont the community
has sustained damage and disruption to the street system during recent
and historical seismic events               Early recorded earthquakes and
earthquake related incidents that have affected Claremont include the
 1812 Wrightwood Earthquake of 7 0 to 7 1i magnitude the IM8 San
Bernardino Earthquake of a 1i 1i to 6 1i magnitude and the 1899 Cajon
Pass Earthquake of1i 7 to 6 1i magnitude
During the twentieth century            many    earthquakes have shaken            up
Claremont        Notable   events   that affected wide       areas  of Southern
California include the       1933 Long Beach 1971            Sylmar and 1987
Whittier earthquakes       In 1992 Claremont       was shaken   by two events a
7 3 magnitude earthquake orillinating from the desert community of
Landers and a 6 4 magnitude in Big Bear The Northridlle tremor of
 1994 rattled windows and       nerves throughout the Qty         but Claremont
was    spared the widespread destruction experienced in the San
Fernando Valley In 1988 and 1990 earthquakes with a magnitude of
                                                                      7
1i 1i centered in Claremont caused minor structural damages              Historic
patterns     show    however     that    any  of  the  minor    or  major faults
traversing the region    are  capable    of causing significant disruption to   our
lives

Primary Action Earthquake Hazards
In CIaremonL the           two   types of fault impacts of     concern   are ground
shaking and fault rupture
Ground Shaking
F ault generated       ground shaking can result in extensive slructural
damage injury and death Five faults that may cause ground shaking
are the Sierra Madre Cucamonga                    San Jose Indian Hill and San
Antonio faults          In addition to ground shaking these faults have the
potential to cause groundwater movement and create groundwater
baniers
The Sierra Madre and the Cucamonga fault lines meet under the
northern part ofthe Qty              Although they are not expected to rupture for
several thousand years these faults have the potential to create
earthquakes with magnitudes of 7 2 for the Sierra Madre and 6 9 for
the Cucamonga with the additional threat of ground rupture                     More
information and study are needed to assess potential earthquake
activity and threats posed by the San Jose                   Indian  Hili and San
Antonio faults

fault  Rupture
Fault rupture is                a ground   movement that    occurs   during an  earthquake
Although impact                     is  6mited  these   ground     movements     can cause
structures to collapse make roads impassable due to offsets and sever
utility lines                 The chance of an earthquake eadjnglo sutface rupture
hazards is minimal                     but both   active  fautts and     potentially active
faults should not be discounted                   as  sources   of potential seismic harm
Although no Alquist Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone had been mapped in
Claremont as of 2OO1i studies continue to determine if the Cucamonga
and Sierra Madre faults traversillll Claremont should be zoned as
major fault lines
                ActSeconidoanry      Earthquake Hazards
Secondary      action               earthquake hazards include earthquake induced
landslides                6quefaction        subsidence     ground cracking ridgetop
spreading and fill slope deformation
Earthquake Induced                  Landslides
Earthquakes                   can  induce landslides  on  hillsides or  steep slopes   In  a
Iands6de sutface rocks and bedrocks                     can  fall onto the roads buildings
and utility lines below the slope causing damage to residents and
properties
The Seismic Hazard Map Figure 6 2 outlines the boundaries of areas
vulnerable     to             earthquake induced landslides and slope instabi1ity      The
map shows that the northwestern and eastern parts of Claremont are
sensitive to landslides following an earthquake The map also indicates
areas   requiring landslide considerations for future developments
Liquefaction
Uquefaction occurs when severe ground shaking leads to loss of shear
slrellllth of a soil                   Liquefaction areas are locations where a low
alluvium level and shallow groundwater contribute to high possibility of
soils losing cohesion during an earthquake                           Fortunately most of
Claremonts groundwater is at least 100 feet deep and the underlying
         sized soil particles reduce chances of 6quefaction The only two
         aIluvial
areas   of  6quefaetion concern are the Thompson Wash in the northern
portion of the Qty and properties along Indian Hill Boulevard between
Foothill Boulevard and Bonita Avenue

Subsidence
Subsidence      occurs      when    an  earthquake    causes   loose soil to depress or
consolidate causing the land surface to break                or sink Generally    areas
with younger alluvium             are more    susceptible    to subsidence     Hazarus

     Seismic
     Non           Landslides
Landslides that         occur   naturally are potential hazards in hillside areas
Lands6des        on    steep slopes can move rapidly damage property and
infrastructure interrupt uti6ty lines and restrict de6very of water gas
electricity and telecommunications                          Heavy rainfall removal of
vegetation        excavations        and     groundwater flows can also trigger
landslides       In Claremont properties north of Base Une Road have the
most     potential for slope instability
Many levels of landslide prevention and mitigation exist Some of the
structural methods include placing                   ineered
                                                     enl              buttresses along the
hillside to provide support to loose materials                            Another way 10
slrellllthen the soil is      to  ptace surface and subsurface drainale systems
to drain out        water   fmm the soil         Debris basins        at stratellic locations
can    capture loose materials and prevent landslides from obstructing
roads and destroying property
Except       in hillside areas most of the         Oty      is not affected   by     seismic
                                                                                     non
Iands6des               Past     landslides       in      Claremont        involved      minor
inconveniences such           as  frequent debris removal from catch basins and
roads
Collapsible and Expansive Soil Hazards
Collapsibte and expansive soils lay under Claremont s hillside                            areas
and most of the Oty             The expansive soil of the hillside             areas  contain
clay minerals in older alluvium and bedrock formation that are prone to
collapse during dry seasons The expansive soil in much of the urban
area is prone to expand during the wet season                            The collapse and
expansion of these soils can be enough to cause structural damage to
foundations           Door    slabs       and     concrete        Doors         Geotechnical
investigations         conducted       prior   to   development can identify such
hazards and standard engineering techniques are available to mitigate
potential hazards
flooding
Flooding has always been              an  issue in Claremont as storm runoff from
Mount Baldy rushes rapidly down the many canyons that outlet                                 onto
the    Claremont alluvial           plain       In    1938      a   tremendous Rood            hit
ClaremOnt damaging many properties and destroying most Oty
streets        Prior to construction of the San Antonio Darn major Roods
occurred in 1916 1921 1934 1938 1941 and 1943                              Sincecompletion
of the San Antonio Dam in 19ii6 the structure has served important
Rood control and water supply functions for Claremont                               Localized
Roodmg        is still an  issue   during heavy        rainfall   but the dam has halted
                                    14
most of the      severe    floods

CITY        OF       CLAREMONT               GENERAL              PLAN
flood hazards in Claremont           are  divided inlo three categories natural
flooding dam failure and debris flow
Natural flooding
Two types of flood classification         are  flash f oods and slow rise floods
During slow rise floods emergency personnel have ample lime to warn
the community but with flash floods there is 6tde lime for preparation
or  warning Although floods          in other areas     are  due to  water overflow
slow rise f oods in Southern California         are the result of heavy rainfall    or
a  combination of wet soil and lack of vegetation on the                 land
Most of the City has been developed                  on    a  foothill and along     a
downward      slope thus flooding hazards         are  llenerally low No property
within the City lies within a federally designated 1000year or liOOyear
flood   zone      With the construction of debris basins at the base of
Chicken Creek        most  areas   of Claremont     are   protected   from flood and
mudflows
Dam Inundation
Dam inundation        occurs  when structural damage to          a  dam results in   a
flood     Dam failure     can   occur  due to    an  earthquake      erosion    design
flaw   or  water    overflow during storms Failures or near failures of the
Baldwin Hills        Saint Francis and Van Norman dams in Southern
California   were the   result of geolOllic  or  seismic failures
The    western     edge of San Antonio Dam            is located in the northeast
comer     of Claremont within the Santa Ana River Watershed and
extends east into San Bernardino County The dam is                    a  ood control
                                                                         f
and water conservation project constructed and operated by the                      s
                                                                                    U
Army Corps of Engineers Construction of the dam began                         in April
 19ii2 and was completed in May of 19li6
Claremont would face the danger of dam inundation if dam failure
coincided with       a heavy rainfall      Since Ihe rivers      are   rarely fulL the
chance of both incidents happening at the same lime is unlikely
However if these two inddents did occur failure of the San Antonio
Dam could result in largescale f       ood inundation in threeflood          zones  as
shown in      gure
              F        63   Flllure 63 shows that the         area  southeast of MI
Baldy Road and Thompson Creek would be                        most   affected if dam
failure occurred       The inundation map shows the inundation area and
the depth of flood water in these areas            Additional inundation hazards
could   occur   if dams   were   to fail at Thompson       Creek Reservoir and at
two reservoirs in Uve Oak Canyon

Mud and Debris Flows
 Poor drainage and deep topsoil can cause mud and debris flows
 Debris nows contain a soaked mixture of natural concrete that sljde

The steep slopes along the San Gabriel Mountain foothills and the
seasonal Santa Ana winds makes rapid wildland fires a top public
safety      concern    in Claremont                Weather        topography      and vegetation
type all affect the intensity of fires California has extended droughts
which increase the number of days with low humidity and
consequently the amount of dried vegetation fuel Santa Ana winds
the hot very dry winds that intermittently blow across Southern
California in the fall           further increase the potential for ignition and
spread of fires In addition a significant portion of north Claremont
remains        undeveloped and                 consists of   rugged topography          with  highly
flammable native vegetation The major fire fuels are chaparral sage
and grasses These ve etation types typically have a very high oil
content that creates a severe fire potential The greatest potential of
high fire hazard within Claremont lies                     in the north      The risk of wildland
fires is compounded when isolated development                                occurs   in and    near
brush covered         areas   particularly hillsides and steep canyons                        Steep
rugged hillsides       and steep canyons allow fire to spread rapidly
To minimize potential fire danger future developments                             must    adhere    to
more strict fire safety development                         guidelines such       as   the Hillside

Human Caused Hazards
Securing public safety also includes protection from hazards we create
ourselves particularly the public safety risks posed by hazardous
materials      gang violence      or
                                       transportation related hazards such             as
aircraft crashes
Hazardous Materials
Hazardous materials         seem     insignificant   as   household products          but
when massive amounts of these products                amass      in landfills   they  can
pose    serious      environmental and       health     risks    to   the   community
Hazardous materials           include     waste   labeled     as    toxic    poisonous
                                                              24
corrosive      flammable      combustible      or   irritant         These     materials
require special methods of storage and treatment that                common      sewage
and drainage systems         are  not  capable of handling Improper disposal
harms     our      environment      and    people who work in the waste
                                Not    only is it illegal to discard hazardous
management industry
materials in the trash       or  to pour them into the storm drain or sewer
system    doing    so will contaminate the ground         water    and air
The     Los    Angeles County         Fire   Departments          Health     Hazardous
Materials Division identifies potential hazardous materials and protects
public health and environment throughout the County from hazardous
waste    pollution      The County enforces proper handling of hazardous
materials through inspections emergency response and site mitigation
The City also       ensures  proper     handling of hazardous         waste   through a
waste   collection program        This program is      an   extension ofthe       County
program       and    allows   Claremont     residents      to  properly      dispose    of
hazardous household and electronic waste according to the Los
Angeles County Waste Management Plan The program is paid by
County residents as a tax on waste disposed at County s landfills and
the sanitation district fee on property tax The City also collects used
motor oil for free when scheduled through the Community Services
Department and the County provides appointment based mobile units
that collect hazardous materials at locations throughout the County
The C9unty        reuses   most of the collected materials such            as   paint for
anti  graffiti programs motor oil as lubricants fuel and tar products for
asphalt             and other materials as cement Materials that cannot be
                  cover
recycled are handled separately for proper disposal These sustainable
practices keep the materials from entering the waste stream
Air Crash Hazards
Air crash incidents      are rare   but when they do        occur   the results   can  be
devastating        Such incidents     concern   residents of Claremont because
the City has three airports nearby that          serve    small private aircrafts      as

The variety of air services and flight paths require regional coordination
to prevent confusion in flight patterns and to maintain safety                      Potential
damages to aircrafts may also result in losof life and property along
its flight path         To avoid such outcomes the Federal Aviation
Administration        has   established     land             use    restrictions   to   areas

The    eastern    parts of Claremont are within the Safety Area 2 of the
Cable      Airport safety zones as identified in the Cable Airport

Police and        Emergency Services
Claremont    sets high standards for public safety and protection         The
City s Police Department coordinates with the Los Angeles County Fire
Department and the Red Cross to fulfill emergency services and safety
needs of residents The Claremont Police Department serves as the
primary responding agency to emergencies                 and provides law
enforcement services to residences and businesses The City contracts
with the County Fire Department for fire and paramedic response and
hazard mitigation     The Red Cross works with the City to manage and
operate shelters      The City educates the public regarding disaster
prevention and welcomes the help of community volunteers                 Public
awareness and education provide essential knowledge about how to
assess    and respond to emergency situations and increase the
community s ability to minimize undesired outcomes
Police Services
Until Claremont incorporated in 1907       the Los Angeles County Sheriff
provided law enforcement services The first City Marshal worked part
time enforcing the first speed limits and guarding the town at night
Over the years the Claremont Police force continued to develop with
additional members full facilities and better compensation The duty
of the police officers also continued to grow in terms of the area

Quickly dispatches appropriate emergency responses                       The Police
Department also utilizes reserve police officers who perform similar

Claremont Policy      Facility
The Police Station located         at li70 W Bonita Avenue no longer meets
the needs of the        Claremont Police Department               A Space Needs
Assessment Site Feasibility Study for the Police Station conducted in
2002 identified the facility      as   being at the end of its useful life The
station suffers from excessive overcrowding lack of key functional
space wear and tear due to age and round the clock usage inability to
address technological changes               and difficulty meeting regulatory
requirements         including    the    Americans        with    Disabilities   Act
CALOSHA and California Board of Corrections The study also
identified the current site of the Police Station as very challenging to
meet    the demands of a      new  police station if one    were to  be built on the
same     site    Any revitalized expanded           or new   Police Station     must
address all of its traditional roles yet accommodate the expanding
needs of Claremont             The need for      a   new  or  expanded improved
facility  is addressed in    Policy 6 9  1
Crime Prevention and Personal         Safety
Although the City s crime rate is not considered high in comparison to
rates in adjacent cities the Police Department promotes safety by
increasing awareness of child abuse domestic violence rape robbery
burglary gang violence check fraud and identity theft                           Crime
prevention also involves educating the public about vacation security
business and       neighborhood watch programs security when residents
are    home alone        information regarding Megan s Law and poison
accidents
Unbiased     Policing Policy
The Police Department has adopted                 an   Unbiased     Policing Policy
The Department is committed to unbiased                    policing to clarify the
circumstances in which officers can consider race ethnicity national
origin religion age gender gender identity or sexual orientation socio
economic status           and disability when making law enforcement
decisions      and  to reinforce procedures that        serve  to  assure   the public
that service and law enforcement           are provided   in an  equitable   way
Profiling    is defined as any    police initiated   action that relies  on  the race
ethnicity    or  national origin gender sexual orientation           gender identity
religion    socio economic status       or  disability rather than the behavior of

Gang Activities
Gangs are differentiated from other youth groups by their frequent and
intentional    involvement in illegal activities and a more developed
leadership    structure    Many street gang activities in Claremont come
from sources outside of the community There is a loosely knit
Claremont gang that dates back several generations This gang was
more concentrated in its         activities in the mid 1980s and early 90s
Since that time       a  significant number of the member families have
moved out of the      City and the gang has returned to being a loose knit
group with little if any criminal activity        or  contacts with the Police  In
addition to the activities of this gang the          City geographically  borders
two areas      of Pomona which typically have high incidents of gang
activity Gang activities from these have spilled into Oaremont
Prior to    the I 980s gangs in Los Angeles County were typically
neighborhood based meaning they claimed a particular area ohen a
neighborhood where a majority of the members lived and this was
considered their turf          The proliferation of drug sales especially
cocaine changed this model of thinking for the gangs and while they
still had  a home base of sorts law enforcement saw gangs entering the
drug trade in large numbers and expanding their areas of control or
sought after turf to include other communities outside of their own
including areas outside of the state This transitOlY nature impacts
communities like Claremont that typically do not have a large
concentration of gang members living in their community The violence
and criminal activity associated with these gang members travels with
them    as they  move   about and    venture    into other  areas to establish the
gang    or to engage in criminal activities        Often communities that      are
directly adjacent to or that have freeway access within their community
are impacted by gang related criminal activity to varying degrees               as
these gang members utilize the freeways to travel about
As part of its operational          plan     the Police   Department assigns      a
minimum       of  one   detective    as   its gang specialist This officer       is
responsible for disseminating intelligence on gang activity to
department personnel In addition to this detective department
personnel routinely attend gang training participate in gang related
enforcement effQrts in surrounding communities and are members of
various gang intelligence and training groups
To    discourage youth involvement with gangs the City will continue to
provide diverse after school programs for the City s youth and families
Such programs          will engage youth        in   volunteer  and   recreational
programs that      strengthen family      and social networks     Job placements
and internship programs will help           our  youth gain job skills and spark
positive interests     Joint tutoring programs with The Colleges and the
Claremont Unified School District will be geared to raise high school
graduation    rates

Noise
Excessive noise     can  disrupt  our   lives    From the continuous thrum of
cars   and trucks traveling the freeways           to   the unnerving whine of
gasoline powered leaf blowers         on an    otherwise quiet morning noise
can  interrupt our conversations ourthoughts and our leisure activities
Noise sensitivity varies depending         on the time of day its duration and
pitch    and  preferences of individuaJs          Despite this variability      most
residents agree that too much noise or the wrong type of noise irritates
LIS and can adversely affect our health
In Claremont transportation corridors           are  the major    source   of noise
The    I 0 freeway     the 21 0 freeway        and the Metrolink and planned
Gold Line train tracks all    traverse     the breadth of the City    west   to east

Noise Metrics
Evaluating noise is complex            The unit of measurement is an A
weighted sound pressure level or dB A which accounts for sound
pressure level as well as the pitch of sound and the way the average
human ear responds to the pressure and pitch Health considerations
associated with excessive noise exposure include hearing loss or
damage interference with oral communication and interference with
sleep At prolonged exposure at sound levels over 81i dB A a person
experiences hearing loss             At 60 dB A          noise impairs speech
intelligence and sound levels over 40 to 41i dB A can disturb sleep
To   account   for the fact that noise during night time hours can be more
 irksome    than    day time noise acousticians have developed noise
 metrics that   apply  a  weighed ambient     noise level average over      a  24
 hour period giving penalties       to noise that occurs during the 10 00 P M
 to  7 00 AM       period     These metrics are defined as either the
 Community Equivalent Noise Level CNEL or Day Night Level Ldn
 Noise contour maps similar to topographic maps that show steepness
 of terrain     can then be developed to identify noise level averages
 throughout the community
 Noise Conditions in 2005
 Figure 6 6 shows noise exposure contours             in the City of Claremont
 represented by Ldn for baseline year 2001i            These contours take into
 account the following noise sources
Traffic Noise
 Noise from the freeways crossing Claremont exceeds 65 Ldn which is
 generally considered a threshold noise level for residential use
 Freeways are under the state s jurisdiction and local jurisdictions

CITY        OF       CLAREMONT             GENERAL           PLAN
address noise abatement issues and made recommendations regarding
freeway noise impacts in Claremont                  Caltrans has refused to
implement any of these recommendations and noise from the freeway
continues to rise as the number of vehicles using the freeway increase
As a result noise from the freeway remains an important issue for
many residents in the community To achieve any relief from the noise
Claremont will need to continue       to press Caltrans and state and federal
legislators for    noise mitigation programs
10 Freeway
Although only       a small segment of the 10 Freeway crosses Claremont
noise surveys show        an Ldn level of 70 to 74 dB near the 10 freeway
impacting residential neighborhoods along the route           Noise emanating
from the 10 Freeway is due in part to the rough freeway surface and
                                               33
thus far remains unmitigated by CaJtrans
210   Freeway
Noise surveys undertaken in 2003 2004 showed             an  Ldn level of 67 to
72 dB    near     the 210   Freeway      Noise concerns and abatement are
similar   to   the I 0 freeway       At the time of freeway planning and
construction Claremont residents monitored Caltrans            efforts to ensure
that   freeway noise would not adversely impact the residential
neighborhoods flanking the route            However after the 21 0 freeway
opened and traffic volumes increased the sound levels exceeded those
predicted by planning models negatively affecting a very large section
of the City        Causes for the excessive noise includes poor choice in
paving material the grade changes at the east and west ends of the
City and lack of landscaping

Railway Noise
The Metrolink San Bernardino County Line                       operated by Southern
California Regional Rail Authority             SCRRA         stops    at  the Claremont
Station      The line operates        seven    days   a   week with trains running
between 4 00 A M        to  10 00 P      with the schedule varying          on   weekends
                                       M
and weekdays         The noise levels from the trains          are within    the required
sound    limits     but   the  whistle    and    warning bells        are    a   source of
annoyance

will travel from the Montclair Transit Center to Los Angeles Union                         Cable Airport
Station     Through Claremont            the Gold     Line will       run   along tracks

depending upon Gold Line schedules and train frequency                      some   form of
noise abatement may be needed                                                              Cable
Aircraft Noise
Nthough      not  as  significant  as  the other noise
sources      airplanes   and   helicopters    represent
a  third source     of transportation related noise
in   Claremont        The     proximity      of    Cable
Airport      Ontario International Airport           and
Brackett rield       and    law enforcement       patrol
helicopters all contribute        to aircraft noise in
our  skies

Cable Airport
Cable Airport located just beyond the Claremont city limit in Upland is
a privately owned and operated general aviation facility that allows
public  access                Measured noise      contours   associated with Cable Airport
operations shown in Figure 6 7 indicate that critical noise                     contours do
not  impact any residential neighborhoods in Claremont although the
eastern edge of Pitzer College is marginally impacted by aircraft noise
Problems arise                  more  from overflights during the day Any increase in
activity at Cable Airport could impact neighborhoods and The Colleges
along Claremont s                  eastern border

Ontario           rIntiotenalm       Airport
Ontario International Airport                     serves over seven million passengers
annually    and               its  capacity  is  increasing as Inland Empire air cargo
service and                   pas engers continue    to grow    The airport s proximity to
Claremont provides convenient                       access   for trips  both domestic and
international travel
Aircraft take offs from Ontario International Airport impact the local
environment since the establish ed                    flight path for aircraft departing the
airport follows the I 0 Freeway through the south part of Claremont
The noise impacts increase when pilots deviate from the established

flight path by turning early and flying north             over the central part of
Claremont
Over the     years    Claremont has worked with officials from the Los
Angeles World Airports LAWA which operates Ontario International
Airport to minimize the early                 turns
                                                  LAWA established a no early
turns notification program to increase pilot awareness regarding noise
intrusion over the City of Claremont The program instructs the pilots
that they are not to fly north over Claremont except when conditions
for traffic safety dictate alternative flight paths            This program has
helped reduce the number of early turns Reducing early turns requires
constant monitoring of the number of early turns and the on going
efforts of LAWA to continually remind pilots of the no early turns
policy
Brackett Field
Brackett Field also      a  general  aviation airport is owned     by Los Angeles
County and      services private and business aircraft         The airport located
in La Verne         serves around       2 liOO annual passengers         Although
Brackett field s noise contours do not impact Claremont flight paths
cross    over    the  City     and Claremont        residents   occasionally  voice
concerns over      associated noise
Helicopters
Helicopter noise can be more irritating than noise from other aircraft
because helicopters operate at low altitudes and produce more noise
Air surveillance and patrol are essential public safety services that often
involve helicopter operations and we tend to tolerate this occasional
noise     Helicopter operations also include news and traffic monitoring
helicopters However helicopter operations during late night hours can
be bothersome and the frequency of helicopter operations has
increased since the opening of the 21 0 freeway
Non Transportation Noise Sources
Noise    sources    are  not   limited to   planes   trains and automobiles       In
Claremont       activities  in   our  commercial and industrial       districts are
potential stationary       noise   sources      Because most business      are  low
scale    low   intensity    and conducted indoors with the exception of
vehicle sales noise      generally is limited to that associated with loading
dock operations frequent truck uses mechanical equipment and use of
outdoor paging systems             The City regulates construction activity to
prevent    disturbances    at  night and on weekends
Claremont       residents     value   their    quiet   residential neighborhoods
 However this quietness          can  be interrupted by noise generating from
property    maintenance      equipments such as lawnmowers or home repair
activities    Such activities conducted at early morning and late evening
hours    can  disturb sleep and affect quality of living         Implementation of
the City s noise regulations will help maintain optimal interior and
exterior noise levels within residential        areas
                                                                                               PAGE 6 46

Noise and Land Use                 Compatibility Guidelines
Integral    to  sustaining   our quality of life     is ensuring  we  live in an
environment       where    we   can   hear     ourselves think    enjoy  outdoor
activities free from excessive      or irritating noise and sleep soundly with
our   windows open          Students in our schools and at The Colleges
deserve and benefit from quiet places to study Our goals are twofold
 1 to plan land uses that avoid noise tand use conflicts to the greatest
extent   possible and    2  to mitigate  noise sources that impact our    quality
of life
Table 6 ii    sets forth the guidelines we use for planning new land uses
and the goals       we    seek to achieve for indoor and outdoor noise
environments          Of   particular importance are the standards for
residential land    uses  whereby an exterior noise level of 6ii Ldn 70 Ldn
for    higher density developments             is  considered    the maximum
acceptable level This 6ii Ldn standard also applies to schools
Noise    Impact Areas         Baseline Conditions

noise envirorunents consistent         with the City s guidelines       However
homes along the I 0 Freeway and the 210 Freeway                  are exposed   to
noise levels at    or above 6ii Ldn      Residential properties that back up to
Foothill Boulevard also lie within the 6ii to 70 Ldn contour               Other
noise sensitive    uses  exposed   to higher noise levels include

Noise Goals and Policies
The goals and policies regarding community noise aim          to  abate noise
and preserve high quality of life for Claremont residents       The City will
maintain a    peaceful environment by identifying noise impacts and
mitigating    noise   problems through acoustical treatments and
appropriate land use policies
Transportation Related Noise
                          represent the predominant                         in
Transportation    routes                                   noise   source
Claremont Sounds emitted from rail aircraft and automobiles can be
mitigated through sound barriers and a stricter adherence to noise level
requirements Since most transportation related noise problems are
regional or outside the City s jurisdiction the City will negotiate work
with responsible agencies to address noise concerns
Goal 611          Work     with other agencies to nurunuze the
                  impact       of      transportation related          noise
                  including noise associated with freeways rail
                  lines and airports

 Padua Hills Theatre    Complex
The Padua Hills Theatre Complex comprises historic structures whose
 distinctive Spanish Colonial architecture is a reminder of a special bond
 with Mexican Americans            The buildings listed   on  the National Register
 of Historic Places      were  built by Claremont residents in 1928 initially for
 performances by the Community Players                       At the dawn of the
 Depression the Community Players were no longer viable and by 1932
 the Theatre became a key venue for performances by the Mexican
 Players local Mexican American residents many of whom were
                                                                              7
 workers and descendants of workers at nearby citrus groves                       The
 Theatre     soon   developed     into  a cultural  center that celebrated Mexico
 and Mexican American heritage in Claremont                  The Mexican Players
 also attracted visiting teachers from Mexico who brought music and
                                                                                8
 dance from different states of Mexico and taught local performers The
 Theatre closed in 1974 and the City of Claremont acquired it from its
 majority    owner      Pomona College in December 1996             At the time the
 City purchased       the  adjacent   1 220  acres   which created the Claremont
 Wilderness Park

The    total property purchased from the Pomona Land and Water
Company      is just under twenty acres in size Development of the central
portion of the site    was    aided by the     help of Paul Paige of      the Pomona
Park Dcpartmenl in the 1920s and then later by Ralph Cornell in the
19405      Air Cornelrs work led          to revisions to the roads and walks in

Park Cemetery group         to  raise money to build      a permanent office and    to
replace the tool shed that       was  being used    at the time     This building was
never   constructed but it did raise the issue of suitable office space         on the
property        This problem       was   settled  on   March     12  t 989 when the
Wright Pierce Studio the fonner studio of the prominent local
photographer was moved from its original location on Bonita Avenue to
its current position in Oak Park Cemetery
 In 1978 due to lack of assets by the previous operators of Oak Park
Cemetery operation and management was taken over by the City The
non profit group called Oak Park Cemetery could no longer support the
 necessary operations to keep Oak Park up to the high standards
expected by the community thus sufficient public support ensured that
 the cemetery would be developed by the City and continue to operate in
the manner previously expected by the non profit organization

Community infrastructure provides the                   sometimes        invisible physical
support systems          that allow        us   to  enjoy    healthy      productive lives
Reliable water supply systems meet our needs for daily living and
provide for dependable fire suppression Community sewer lines unlike
septic systems allow urban wastewater to be conveyed to treatment
facilities to minimize pollution of groundwater resources Street lights
help make our neighborhoods walkable                              Electricity gas and

collection system       to  dispose of      or  provide for    reuse    of  waste  products
properly
These      benefits    will    only     continue     with   proper      maintenance     and
expansion of our infrastructure             We trust in the     City  to  provide  the most

Water
In the     early days of CI emont the water system was
characterized        by abundant groundwater and artesian
flows with springs           and    swamps          Water demand           in
Claremont      was    met   by local groundwater and well            water
supplies       This water supply made Claremont a prime
area    for growing citrus crops and for supporting housing
development and population growth                      However citrus
irrigation   soon    depleted     the  groundwater supply and dried
                               8
out  the artesian flows            Furthermore intense fertilization
of citrus groves and installation of septic tanks polluted
the local   water    supply
 Far sighted early developers in Claremont obtained                  water
rights   to deliv   r water      The first   to  tap into the San Antonio Creek        were
the  owners     of the Cucamonga and Palomares Ranchos who dug a ditch                      Pump House

developed land
San Antonio Canyon has a natural water trap where alluvium stores
rainwater and stream flow underground for future use                  All of northern
Claremont is covered with about 200 feet of alluvial material                  By the
early 1900s the local water district provided shallow streambeds to
spread divide and store water flow                In 1908 local water companies
purchased land and water rights in the San Antonio area and formed a
water    consolidation corporation called Pomona Valley Protective
Association         In 1929 the Southern California Water Company now
called Golden State Water            Company         a  local retail water provider
purchased the small local        water companies and         now  provides  water for
Claremont with       a  portion of the water pumped from local wells
The    local   water      basin   is  fully   adjudicated and managed           by    a
watermaster     who determines the          amount     of  water  that  can be safely
pumped     to  maintain      long term sustainable yield 01 the basin             The
watermaster      is   responsible for allocating the safe yield to the          water
providers and ensuring against         over   production
To  serve the growing population and decrease in local water supply                 the
Metropolitan Water District turned to Bay Delta a Norlhern Californian
water supplier         and the 242 mile long Colorado River Aqueduct in
      22
 1941     In 1950 the creation of the Pomona Valley Municipal Water
District PVMWD was approved by voters to obtain this imported
water supply           The PVMWD changed its name to Three Valleys
Municipal Water District Three Valleys and serves Pomona Walnut
and parts 01 the San Gabriel Valley

hydroelectric stations and 10 miles of distribution pipeline The facility
was funded by a bond and credit supported by Three Valleys Municipal
Water District the    City of La Verne and Golden State Water Company
This hydroelectric facility is perched      on higher ground and uses gravity
instead of pumps to deliver water           to local agencies          Hydroelectric

Water Supply Issues
In the past Claremont has dealt with            numerous     water   issues    These
problems included stabilization of water rates accountability for water
services rising groundwater lack of water supply in hillside areas and
infrastructure improvem nts In the early 2000s two circumstances led
the City of Claremont to investigate acquisition of the local water
system the Golden State Water Companis substantial increase in
water rates to    Claremont    users   and   a   failure of portions of the     water
system during    the 2003 Grand Prix Fire         In particular City leaders     were
concerned that Claremont       consumers were        paying water rates that     were
40 percent higher than the regional average fee
The City continues to explore the option          to  purchase the water utility to
provide    for  local   control    and    accountability to water rate and
stabilization and   to eliminate subsidies that make Claremonters pay for
the additional      osts  of supplying water in desert areas due to a
regionalization of   water  rates    Ensuring     water    quality and   maintenance

Water Quality
The     federal      Environmental       Protection      Agency      EPA      State
Department        of    Health    Services     and   California     Public  Utilities
Commission       are  the agencies responsible for establishing drinking water
quality standards To        ensure that drinking water is safe to drink EPA
sets federal regulations that limit the amounts of certain contaminants in
water   provided by public water systems
Drinking   water     including bottled   water
                                                 may   reasonably be expected      to
contain at least small amounts of some contaminants As water travels
over   the surface of the land         or   through   the layers in the ground
naturally occurring minerals and           in  some   cases   radioactive material
dissolve and      water   can pick up   substances   resulting from the presence
of animal    or   human activity The presence of contaminants does not
necessarily mean water may be a health risk Contaminants that may
be present in    source   water  include
          Contaminants        such  as  nitrate viruses     and coliform bacteria
          which      may    come     from     sewage     treatment    plants   over

          Radioactive contaminants which           can   be naturally occurring    or
          can   be the result ofoil and gas production and mining activities
Since 1991 California water utilities including the Golden State Water
Company have mailed           an  annual Water Quality Report to customers
Potable water      provided by    Golden State to Claremont has consistently
met federal and state standards

does       not   allow the         use   of septic tanks        in conjunction      with   new
development within its corporate boundaries and requires                       connection to
the City s         wao tewater collection system
To    ensure      proper      disposal of    wastewater      and   to  protect groundwater
resources        the      wastewater    collected within the City s corporate limits is
treated       and filtered         before it is returned to the environment via
spreading basins                  While   the     City operates the local         wastewater
collection system the sewage flows via regional trunk lines to regional
wastewater treatment facilities operated by the Sanitation Districts of
Los Angeles County located in Pomona The Sanitation Districts make
this reclaimed              water    available for nonpotable uses primarily for
landscape irrigation                Claremont s ability to         use  recycled    water    for
productive purpose is hindered by the lack of                      necessary   infrastructure
and its distance from regional treatment plants

Street lights and salety lights              at signalized intersections provide for
public safety by improving vision for pedestrians bicyclists and
motorists         reducing accidents and by discouraging crime and
vandalism Well lighted streets attract more business to commercial
areas and facilitate              nighttime circulation         Although street lighting
offers       numerous         benefits    construction      and maintenance         of such
improvements can be costly

Energy Utilities and Telecommunications
We rely upon energy utilities and telecommunications for carrying out
most of   our  day to day   activities Natural gas and electricity provide heat
and light and power         our  appliances     Through telephone lines fiber
optic cables and the      airwaves we connect with each other for business
for school and just to keep in touch with       our  friends and neighbors
Energy Utilities
Claremont      is   serviced  by Southern California Gas Company and
Southern California Edison Company for natural gas and electricity
respectively       Additionally hydroelectric generators at the Miramar
Water and Hydroelectric Facility provide power to operate the facility
                                                       29
and surplus power is sold at a wholesale rate
Telecommunications and            Computers
Telecommunications         is  the   communication        of information     over  a
distance     This    covers  many    media and technologies including radio
fiber optics television telephone data communication and computer
networking        The advancement of telecommunications has changed
dramatically with the      use  of the Internet wireless networking portable
computers       cell phones   global positioning systems GPS and other
technological       advancements          Increasingly      campuses       business
complexes hotels and coffee houses offer wireless connections In the
years to come technology will continue to advance and the nature of
telecommunications will continue to evolve
A majority of Ctaremont residents 77 percent in 2002 own computers
and have Internet access The quality of telecommunication services
varies   throughout the community and it is important that the City work
with service providers        to ensure quality service is available to all
residents and businesses            Claremont recognizes the efficiency and
benefits that telecommunication brings to the community                          and
encourages policies that promote access to a wide variety of technology
and telecommunications regardless of a person s income location or
education level The City supports the use of continually evolving

Some of the concerns expreJScd in the plan are the need for universal                    2
access to the Internet for all areas of the City additional cable channels               3
a   wider range of telecommunication choices technical performance
guarantees and the interconnection of schools and public buildings The
plan also raises concerns regarding preservation of aesthetics and fair
compensation for public rights of way while meeting telecommunication
needs
The City supports incentives that promote private service              to meet   the
City s goals regarding technology and telecommunications
The Aesthetics of        Energy Utility and Telecommunications
Infrastructure
In  general the utility systems to our homes businesses and institutions
consist of      aboveground overhead lines Nthough operationally safe
overhead utilities can detract from the aesthetic quality of the
streetscape Underground utility lines can minimize public safety issues
during storms rain and wind by preventing trees from interfering with
utility lines and reducing potential fire hazards
One funding        source for    undergrounding utilities is Rule 20A Utility
 Underground Funds which are rates collected from all those who pay
Southern California Edison energy bills within the City These funds
can be used for undergrounding of overhead utility lines in areas with an
unusually heavy clutter of overhead utility lines areas that are heavily
traveled      areas that are  either arterial  or major collector roads    or  areas
where undergrounding         can  enhance the civic recreational      or scenic  use
of the     area     The undergrounding of overhead utility wiring          on   Mills
Avenue        north of Foothill Boulevard and south of 210 Freeway was
 paid for by Rule 20A funds Padua Avenue north of Base Line was
funded by undergrounding fees paid by new development in northeast
                32
Claremont
The City recognizes the benefits          to  be achieved by requiring alt      new
 utilities  to  be placed underground and        to retrofit existing aboveground

The     City s Community        Services  Department      Sanitation   Division
manages the collection of waste in Claremont Curbside refuse collection
from residential and commercial districts began in 1955 with collection
of recyclable materials iiutiated in 1982      In November 2005        the City
began taking refuse to the transfer station located at the Claremont
Corporate Yard The transfer station is permitted to accept 100 tons of
refuse per day Through a contract with Grand Central Recycling
Transfer Station Inc the refuse is then transported from the corporate
yard to the Puente Hills Landfill in Whittier The transfer station
operation at the corporate yard reduces the number of staff hours
needed for delivery of refuse and saves on vehicle maintenance
expenses and fuel costs These savings may be applied to expanding
the City s recycling program
To         ce costs associated with waste collection and storage         and to
         red
comply with the state requirements to reduce landfill waste the City has
continuously looked for and implemented programs to minimize the
generation      of trash     In   2002   the California     Integrated Waste
Management Board C1WMB recognized that the City achieved a 55
percent diversion     rate which is well above the minimum requirement of
 50 percent     mandated    by state regulations     The success has been
attributed   to City programs that offer

CITY       OF      CLAREMONT              GENERAL             PLAN
Achieving OUf Vision
Claremont is committed        to  this vision of   a   diverse and sustainable
community that increases housing choice for all current and future
residents     This Housing Element outlines our approach to achieving
this vision by
          Matching housing supply with current and projected needs
          Facilitating and promoting a fair and balanced distribution           of
          housing choices throughout the City
          Assisting   in the provision of affordable housing through          new
          construction and   preservation
          Removing     or mitigating governmental and other        constraints to
          housing   investment
          Promoting fair and equal housing opportunities
Periodic Update of the Housing Element
The housing market in California       particularly   in Southern California is
extremely volatile       Market conditions     constraints     and opportunities
change rapidly necessitating periodic          reassessment of       our
                                                                          housing
  eeds and     strategies     Adjustments     to  implementing       actions  and
objectives   are   made   to ensure   we  move     toward   our   housing goals
Whereas      other elements      of the   Claremont      General    Plan   require
updating less frequently the Housing            Element is typically      updated
every five to  seven    years both to  satisfy  our  desire  to track  changes in
the community and to respond to requirements of state law                    This
                                                                                   Residential Neighborhood

Visioning
Citizens Committee for Claremont
Public   participation was a major component in the City s
comprehensive 2006 update of the General Plan and the Housing
Element in particular To increase involvement of the community the
                                                                                          PAGE 8 3
CITY        Of       CLAREMONT                   GENERAL             PLAN
City   Council actively sought           a   diverse group of applicants for the
Citizens Committee for Claremont                   The appointed members of this
committee       came     from    all  geographical areas of the City and the
unincorporated       areas   within the    City s sphere of influence Members of
the committee        were   representative of all       socioeconomic segments of
the community         The    City also appointed number of persons who are
                                                      a
active   locally   in advocating affordable housing issues to serve on this
committee
The Citizens Committee for Claremont                    CCC composed         of almost
 100 Claremont residents and other community representatives worked
together    to   craft the    Community         Vision for the Claremont General
Plan     The CCC met four times              on  May 1 July     29 and October 20 in
2004 and      on  May 4 2005         as a  large group   to  discuss  general  issues of
concern    and   to  present recommendations
Housing      and    Neighborhood Subcommittee
As part of the visioning process for the 2006 General Plan the City
formed the Housing and Neighborhood Subcommittee as part of the
CCc       The    Housing     and    Neighborhood Subcommittee charged with
developing     a  vision statement and        general policy direction on affordable
housing had as active members several affordable housing advocates
including representatives from the League of Women Voters and the
local  Housing      Coalition Committee          Other members included teachers
   chitects     realtors    college students        and  professors      The Housing
Subcommittee met three times in 2004 May 24 June 14 and June 28
to  formulate    a  housing vision
Visioneering
To outreach to        a  broader community          during   the 2006   update project
the   City used    an  innovative     approach     called visioneering       Claremont
residents had the opportunity            to  participate  in the   planning process   by
 becoming volunteer           facilitators      or   Visioneers        More    than   20
Visioneers representing          a   cross section    of Claremont     were   trained to
 solicit and document       public input     into the General Plan process       through
 aseries   offacilitated    workshops
 More than 250 people provided                 comments     through the visioneering
 exercises     One of the     workshops       was  targeted   to individuals who work
 with  Spanish speaking         families      As   a result   many of the comments
 collected through the Visioneering exercises             were   in Spanish
 Through     the visioneering process           the need for affordable      housing   to
 maintain the     community s diversity         was   identified  as a key  issue    The
 visioneers     particularly    emphasized        the  need to     address homes for
 seniors   accommodating housing             needs for the adult children of current
 residents and      providing housing for support workers who contribute to
 the economic health of the          City

 the meetings    were   posted   and emailed      to persons who had     expressed
 an  interest in the matter
 Members of the        public  attended all      meetings and were allowed to
 make    comments     on the issues discussed       by the task force The public
 included advocates of affordable housing and residents from different
 areas   of the  City    The   public    comments were       primarily focused on
 concerns     about appropriateness of         potential housing sites locating
 affordable housing next to freeways                 and the potential impacts
 affordable housing could have on local schools Information provided
 to the task force was also made available to the public In response to
 concerns about the potential concentration of low income housing in
 the southern half of the City the recommended sites included sites in
 other   areas  of the City     There     was  considerable discussion of      a site
 adjacent   to the 210 Freeway but the task force recommended that the
 site be included as a Tier I          site as  the  Redevelopment Agency        had
 already purchased the       site for the purpose of        building an  affordable
 housing project
The task force     developed    site selection criteria reviewed and evaluated
vacant    and underutilized land in the       City developed a list of potential
sites ranked the sites and provided direction to City staff on which of
the sites the City should pursue immediately for the development of an
affordable      housing     site         The     task    force    also   developed
recommendations        on  short term and      long  term  housing strategies    and
funding    alternatives    These recommendations           were presented to      the
City Council    in July 2008

Population Growth
T able 8 1 shows the historic       population growth     in Claremont from 1910
to 2008       Like mQst of Southern California Claremont grew                rapidly
between the       two  decades     following    World War II        1950 to    1970
gaining over 17 600 new residents or an increase of 279 percent
during these two decades Some of the growth was due to annexations
to the   City    Population growth began         to slow after   1980 indicative of
Claremont s progression from a developing community to                  one   that is
mostly built out During the first half of the 1990s almost              no  housing
growth    occurred due    to the regional economic recession           However     as
the economic climate       improved housing development           increased    As of
2008    more   than 37 000 residents called Claremont home
Table 8 2 shows the        population changes between 1990 and 2000 for
Claremont and its       neighbors As a mature and built out community

Household Characteristics
Household        Type and Size
Claremont is       a  family oriented community           Table 8 7 illustrates the
changes     in household     composition         eg  family    household  non  family
household      or  single household        in Claremont between 1990 and 2000
Among      the    11 281   households that resided in Claremont in 2000
almost 70 percent        were  families      Specifically   of all households in the
City   24 percent consisted of married couples with children                 and 31
percent    were     married   couples      without children       The proportion of
married    couples     both with and without children has decreased           slightly
since 1990
Non family       households which include single persons and other
unrelated households comprised almost 31 percent of all households
residing in Claremont in 2000 Single households comprised almost
one  quarter of all households in the         City an increase since 1990 These
household trends have resulted in              decreasing average household and
family    sizes    signifying  the     need    for smaller homes      in addition   to
housing appropriate for families with children
In comparison the county           as a    whole experienced increasing average
household size from 2 91           to   2 98   and increasing average family size
 from 3 58     to  3 61   during   the   same    period The City of Claremont s
trend of   decreasing     household and       family sizes is expected to continue
due    to   the    increasing    number        of single households non family
households and families with           no   children

offered by businesses and other employers in the City generally pay
lower salaries than the same jobs in the county see Table 8 6 earlier
the median household income in Claremont                    was     56 percent   higher  than

Overcrowding
Overcrowding        occurs     when     high housing     costs  lead households      to
double    up    or    live   in  smaller     units   to  meet   other basic     needs
Overcrowding        can    also  occur    when units of adequate size for large
households      are   not   available      Overcrowding     can   potentially  lead to
rapid   deterioration of the       City s  housing stock additional traffic and       a
shortage of on site        parking The        definitions of overcrowding used in
this Housing Element           are  based   on standards established by the U S
Department      of  Housing      and Urban     Development      see  textbox entitled
  Overcrowding Defined
The     changes     in   number and        percent     of overcrowded      households
between 1990 and 2000            are  presented    in Table 8 9    While the number
of overcrowded households in Claremont has increased in                  recent  years
overall   overcrowding has remained low compared                      to  the  county
About 4 5 percent of the total households in the                  City  in 2000    were
overcrowded compared             to 23 percent countywide

Even    with   the    increased       overcrowding       households      the    average
household     size   in   the    City   decreased     as     the   number    of senior
households    single   households and families without children increased
These trends combined indicate that while              some     households could     not
afford to
           procure    larger    homes     a large portion     of the existing housing
stock is occupied by increasingly smaller households This may signify
a mismatch in the     housing      stock with the community         s housing  needs
The   overcrowding issue        may be    approached      in  a number of ways       On
the  one  hand the City may offer alternative housing options                to  seniors
who     may     wish      to     downsize       from     single family     homes       to
townhomes condominiums               or senior apartments          On the other hand
the City may offer larger affordable rental units to relieve overcrowding
for renters
Cost Burden
When    a  household spends           more    than 30 percent of its income           on
housing   costs  it has less      disposable    income for other necessities such
as  health care    In the    event   of unexpected circumstances such as loss
of employment aI d health problems lower income households with a
burdensome housing cost are more likely to become homeless
Homeowners with         a housing     cost  burden have the       option of selling  the
homes and become         renters      Renters    on the other hand      are vulnerable
and subject                              in the
             to constant
                              changes            housing market
Table 8 11     shows the number and proportion of households with
housing   cost  burden by income range and              tenure
                                                                    Approximately     24
percent of   owner    households and 41           percent of     renter households in
Claremont    use  more     than 30 percent of their incomes to          cover housing
costs    Housing    cost   burdens     were   most   prevalent among households
earning less than 20 000 per year The City may address housing
cost burden by providing affordable homeownership and rental housing
opportunities

College Students
The Claremont       Colleges    include five undergraduate colleges and               two
graduate schools       on   nearby      campuses          In 2003 04       The Colleges
collectively enrolled approximately 7 205 students                  inclusive of 2 083
graduate   students       In addition       678 full time     faculty    members     were
employed by these         institutions        The presence of         college   students
faculty and staff contribute to the local economy and                   can  affect short
term    and or long term housing demands                         Most     undergraduate
students   at  The     Colleges      are    housed    on    campus       in  dormitories
However the majority of those graduate students who live in the local
 ommunity must seek housing off campus
Families   Living    in  Poverty
Families     particularly female headed            families     are   disproportionately
affected by poverty In Claremont eight percent of the residents and six
percent of the families were living in poverty in 2000                      However for
families with children        9 6 percent       were
                                                       living   in poverty       To assist
families   with    children     and      to   ensure     a   healthy      and    crime free
environment in which to raise children               the   City  monitors     the needs of
families and provides      a range    of services
Countywide      I 7 9 percent        of the    residents and          4 percent of the

Homeless
As   the  cost   of housing        in   Southern      California    continues     to  rise
homelessness has become             more     prevalent In Claremont the number
of chronic homeless those who             are  homeless more by choice and often
refuse shelter and service         is limited and varies       seasonally    from   two to
a  dozen  according    to the Claremont Police         Department

Another     category of homeless            different   from     the stereotype       of
               is more
  homeless                prevalent in Claremont Persons in this category
do not live  on   the  street They have alternative housing arrangements
They may live with relatives or friends in nearby hotels                  or  in other
transitory housing The Police Department cannot provide                   an  estimate
of the persons that fall into this category Their numbers              are  difficult to
quantify   as  they   are  invisible in the community           In September 2006
the Claremont Unified School District             reported     that there   were   437
children that fit into this homeless category                Not all these children
actually live   in Claremont or the area within Claremont s                 sphere    of

through initial crises Once resolved Human Services Department
staff works with the recipients to assist them in obtaining ongoing
financial support from other sources Families that are displaced from
their homes are referred to a number of shelters or temporary housing
services available in the local     area
These include
         Pomona Inland Valley Council of Churches                          Provides    a
         variety of services        including a shelter for       homeless families
         and     women       transitional   housing case         management        and
         educational services and classes
         House of Ruth            Provides supportive and residential services
         including      emergency       shelter    and     transitional   shelter     to
         battered women and their children
         Crossroads           Inc        Provides    supportive and residential
         services     including emergency shelter         for  women
The   City  has   provided yearly funding        to the above organizations In
2008    Pomona Inland        Valley Council of Churches received                 3 000
House of Ruth received          4 500 and Crossroads Inc received              1 500
During the   winter and inclement weather conditions homeless persons
may be   provided hotel vouchers         or transported      to a local shelter   such
as  the National Guard       Armory     in Pomona       If assistance is    requested
or an   individual     appears    to  be   mentally   ill    persons are     generally
referred to the Tri      City   Mental Health Center s Homeless Outreach
Services    The Los      Angeles County Department            of Mental Health also
accepts referrals

CITY       OF      CLAREMONT                   GENERAL             PLAN
In recognition of the increased number of homeless families with
children   the Department of Human Services created the Youth and
Family    Services Division in       January      2005   to   connect    families with
resources       However       the   shortage      of affordable       housing   in the
community remains          the  critical missing       link in the      continuum   of
resources
To further address the       problem of homelessness in the community in
2007 the   City Council approved a set aside fund of up to 60 000 from
the City s transient occupancy tax for a new Homeless Program The
Homeless Program will provide funding to agencies and individuals
that serve the homeless in the community
In 2008     the   City s Zoning Ordinance was amended to create an
Institutional zoning district Development standards for the Institutional
District permit emergency shelters and transitional housing by right in
the district Although no permit is required for a shelter or transitional
housing any new construction associated with such                      uses would be
subject to the development standards and architectural                 review process
that is  required of other development permitted in the district Special
standards adopted for homeless shelters and transitional housing
pertain to the on going management of such housing and do not
constrain    the   development of emergency shelters and transitional
housing        There     are   732    acres      within    the    district  of   which
approximately 200      acres are   undeveloped
farmworkers
The   City  of Claremont is mostly urbanized              little  farming operations
exist in the  City   Only   II Claremont residents held            Farming Forestry
and   Fishing     occupations according to the 2000 Census                      These
persons    are  most   likely employed in plant nurseries landscaping or
gardening companies          As such the        City has  no    need for farmworker
housing and affordable housing needs of those who held the Farming
Forestry and Fishing occupations would be accommodated under the
City s various affordable housing programs
Housing Characteristics and Trends
Housing Unit Growth and Type
Table 8 13 shows the changes in the City s housing stock by type of
housing between 1990 and 2008                 Housing growth        in Claremont has
been modest      over  the past decade         The 2000 Census recorded 11 577
housing    units in the     City   representing      an   increase of 6 9 percent
between 1990 and 2000           The     lsing

The majority of units in Claremont in January 2008                were     single family
homes comprising approximately 77 percent of all units Of these the
vast majority      91 percent were detached units                  Multi family units
comprised less than      one  quarter of all homes          However       new    housing
units built since 1990 have been      primarily multi      family   units

CITY        OF      CLAREMONT              GENERAL               PLAN
Vacancy rates      for both ownership and rental housing          were significantly
lower in Claremont than the county           as  a  whole in 2000        The City s
vacancy     rates of 2 2 percent for      rental   housing      and less than   one
percent for     ownership     housing indicate high demand for housing in
Claremont        The overall vacancy       rates   in both Claremont       and the
county declined between 1990 and 2000 indicating a more competitive
housing market in 2000 Since          2007 vacancy rates for        ownership   and
rental housing have increased
Housing Age
The age and condition of Claremont s            housing     stock is an important
indicator of potential rehabilitation needs         Commonly housing over 30
years    of age needs     some   form of major rehabilitation such        as a  new
roof foundation work          plumbing   etc   Due to    high    household income
and high housing values in Claremont                housing tends     to  be better
maintained than in many other communities with similar levels of older
housing stock        However despite having         large equity in their   homes
some      households       elderly  households     in   particular have      limited
 incomes and may       have difficulty maintaining their      homes
Claremont s housing stock is aging         The age of the City s housing stock
 as defined by the year the units were built is shown in Table 8 15 As of
 2008   approximately      62 percent of all  housing    units in Claremont were
 30 years or older built prior to 1970           Only about ten percent of the
 units in Claremont were built between 1990 and 2008 As of 2008 only
 an   estimated     20  to   40  housing  units   in the     City  are  in need    of
 substantial rehabilitation and less than five units are deteriorated and in
 need of replacement

dramatically      between      1990   and     2007     largely   due   to  expanding
employment opportunities and strong regional population growth The

2008 39 percent of the households in Los              Angeles County could afford
an   entry level home in the county            compared with 20 percent         in the
same     period  of 2007       Since 2007      home sale prices have fallen but
remain    high relative   to income levels

Housing Affordability
Affordability   is determined   by comparing the          cost of housing    to  the
income of local      households     If  costs                relative to   income
                                                are  high
housing problems such as overcrowding and cost burden are more
likely to occur In assessing housing affordability state and federal
housing programs use a standard affordable housing cost of no more
than 30 percent of the gross household income

For  planning   and   funding purposes HUD conducts annual household
surveys for    metropolitan areas across the country including Los
Angeles County These surveys are adjusted for differences in the size
of a family    HUD uses median family income MFI levels unique to
metropolitan     areas    to   determine    the    maximum        amount    that  a
household   can   pay for   housing   as well  as  eligibility for federal housing
assistance      The     State Department        of  Housing and Community
Development      HCD adds       a moderate income category to HUD income
categories for determining affordability levels relevant          to the California
housing  market Table 8 19 presents the maximum affordable housing
prices for renting and for owning      a home for different income levels and
household sizes
Affordability Assessment             Moderate Income Households
Moderate income        households    earn   81   to   120    percent of the    Los
Angeles County      MFI       Based  on   the maximum affordable prices in
Table 8 19 and the home sales data presented in Table 8 1 7 moderate
income households cannot afford a           single family home       or a  median
priced  condominium unit in Claremont            Moderate income households
can  afford  most    of the apartment and condominium rentals              but not
single family home     rentals in the community Table 8 18
Affordability     Assessment          Low      Very     Low      and   Extremely
Low Income Households
Low income households          earn between 51 and 80 percent of the Los
Angeles   County MFI         Very low income households earn between 31
and 50 percent    of the Los Angeles County MFI Extremely low income
households    earn  less than 30 percent of the Los Angeles County MFI
Extremely    low   very low       and low income households cannot afford
the median price of       ownership housing       in the   community either for

CITY        Of       CLAREMONT                GENERAL              PLAN
At Risk     Housing
Over the next 10 years between 2008 and 2018                  one   federally assisted
housing project       in Claremont      Access    Village   is at risk of converting
to market rate housing          This project has 23 units assisted with project
based Section 8 rental assistance            The Section 8 contracts       are  due  to
expire prior      to   2018     Access   Village   is a  housing development for
persons with disabilities         The project is owned and operated by a non
profit organization         with the mission of maintaining the units as
affordable      housing       Furthermore       HUD offers      funding priority    for
extending Section 8 assistance          to  housing for seniors and persons with
disabilities     Contracts     are  renewed by HUD on an annual basis The
City  will continue      to monitor the status of the at risk units         Should    a
Notice of Intent to opt out of the Section 8 program be filed the                  City
will  ensure     that   tenants    are  properly notified of their rights under
California law
Claremont Village Apartments is a tax credit project with a 55 year
affordability covenant This project also has a Section 8 contract that is
renewed by HUD          on an   annual basis
Preservation         Options
Preservation of the        at risk units  can  be achieved in several ways 1         by
facilitating   transfer of ownership of the units          or    purchase   of  similar
units by nonprofit organizations 2 by the purchase of affordability
covenant and 3 by providing rental assistance to tenants using funding
sources other than Section 8                   Refer to Appendix A for cost
comparison of these options
Access     Village is already owned by a non profit organization and
Claremont       Village Apartments is committed as affordable housing for
55 years Transfer of ownership and purchase of affordability covenant
as preservation options are not
                                          applicable to these projects Provision
of rental assistance using other                               is              to both
                                           funding   sources       applicable
projects
Replacement Option
If preservation options prove not              to be feasible      the City will also
encourage private         construction of new affordable        housing to replenish
the affordable      housing stock in the community
Administrative Resources for                 Preserving Affordable Housing
In the     fall and winter       of 2005     the City worked with Habitat for
Humanity         to    develop      housing    affordable    to    very   low income
households         In addition     a number of    experienced     affordable housing
developers      are  active in the   region

 Notes   Data presented in this table are based on special tabulations from sample Census data The number of households in each
 category usually deviates slightly from the 100 0      count due to the need to extrapolate sample data out to total households
 Interpretations of these data should focus on the proportion of households in need of assistance rather than on precise numbers
Housing Constraints
Governmental market infrastructure and environmental factors may
constrain the     provision of adequate and affordable housing                   These
constraints may result in        housing    that is not affordable      to lower and
moderate income households not readily available for households with
special   n  eds   or  may render certain types of residential construction
economically     infeaSible for   developers
In the provision of affordable housing private developers play a
significant role Nonprofit developers generally have access to a wider
range    of public funding to subsidize affordability than for profit
developers however the competition for such funding is usually tight
For profit developers may have the financial capacity to provide
affordable   housing    but are  generally not obligated       to do so
In   recent    years     recognizing that affordable housing cannot                  be
provided      by    the market local jurisdictions use a variety                      of
mechanisms         to   facilitate   and     encourage       the     development      of
affordable     housing         Effective    mechanisms        include    provision    of

Governmental Constraints
The intent of local government regulations is to protect               public health
and  safety    and to    ensure a      decent  quality of life for the community
However local       policies and regulations affect the price and availability
of housing    and   in particular the provision of affordable housing Land
use   controls     site   improvement requirements            fees and     exactions
permit processing procedures              and other factors      can  constrain   the
maintenance development and improvement of housing
State and federal        regulations also affect the availability of land for
housing    and the      cost  of producing housing          Regulations related to
environmental       protection       building   codes    and    other   topics have
significant often adverse impacts on housing cost and availability
Perhaps one of the greatest constraints to the production of housing
affordable   to lower income households is the chronic             shortage  of state
and federal financial assistance for such         housing
While constraints exist        at  other levels of government the City has little
or no   control   over   these    regulations and no ability to directly mitigate
their effects    on    housing        The City s efforts therefore emphasize
policies  and  regulations     that  can  be mitigated by the City

housing     Each of the standards is examined and its impact                 on   housing
within Claremont discussed

Residential      Density
The Claremont General Plan allows for base residential densities
ranging from less than         one   dwelling  unit per acre up to 22         dwelling
units per acre
A Residential 30      Overlay    allows  a  density   up to 30   dwelling    units per
acre    if  development is        restricted  to    low    and    very   low income
households
Residential    density  in the Hillside District varies    by average slope of the
lot   The Hillside District is combined with           a Slope Density Standard
denoted as SD 2 and         SD   3   These   Slope Density standards establish
development credits based on accessibility and location within the City
Lot Size and Area
Title 16 of the Claremont          Municipal    Code establishes minimum lot
areas   for single family residentially zoned properties          The minimum lot
area   varies from 7 500 square feet in the HC              7 500   and AV1 AV2
districts and    one   net    acre  in the RR     I  acre  District    Minimum lot
dimensions     range from 50 to 250 feet in width and            100 to 250 feet in
depth
Yards and Setbacks
front yard setback requirements range from 15 to 30 feet depending
on the zone district Side and rear yard setbacks range from five to 15
feet for non street side yards and 10 to 25 feet for side yards fronting a
street     These setback requirements           are    similar  to  those of many
neighboring     communities and         do not pose      a  constraint    to  housing
development
Lot Coverage
The   City imposes reasonable limits on building coverage                  Within the
multiple family zone districts RM structures and parking                may occupy
up to 60 percent of the      lot which would permit sufficient square footage
to facilitate  construction    of a range of variously sized apartment units
up to the maximum allowable             densities     Lot coverage requirements
within single   family districts   allow structures to occupy 20 to 40 percent
of the lot
Minimum Floor Area
Minimum floor      area  requirements are maintained within multiple family
and   some     single family residential zone districts            Within the RM
districts   a minimum of 450 square feet for studio and 600 square feet
for   one bedroom       units   is  required      These     minimum        floor  area
requirements      are  necessary to      maintain health     and   safety   standards
and do not constrain the         ability of projects to achieve the maximum
densities of these districts       Within the RS 8 000 to RS 20 000 districts
a minimum of      1 000 to 1 200    square feet is   required
                                                                                               PAGE 8 37
CITY        OF      CLAREMONT                 GENERAL               PLAN
Building Height
Land   use   regulations    establish  a height  limit of 25 feet for     two  stories in
all zone    districts except for the highest density district the Medium
Density Residential District          RM 2 000       and the Residential Density
Overlay District RDO 1         450      The RM 2 000 permits           structures  up to
35 feet in   height  for stories and the RDO         450
                                                     1       permits   structures   up to
45 feet   in height     for four stories     A  structure      constructed within the
height limits     of these     districts   can  achieve       the   maximum      density
permitted
Parking
Two off street parking spaces per unit           are    required for all single family
residential units        Parking   requirements within multiple         family  districts
vary  by  unit size and     density
           RM 4 000             Units with less than          720 square feet       must
           provide 1 5 covered spaces while units larger than 720                square
           feet must provide 2 5 covered spaces
           RM 3 000 and RM 2 000                  Units with less than 720 square
           feet must provide 1 5 covered spaces               while units   larger   than
           720 square feet     must   provide  2 25 covered spaces
Regardless of unit size or density 0 5 visitor parking                space per unit is
required of all projects within the RM district
For projects meeting the density bonus requirements the state parking
standards which        are lower than City standards will be used
Affordable       Housing
Developers of affordable housing           are entitled   to  a  density bonus and     or
equivalent     concessions or incentives under certain conditions                Senate
Bill 1818 which went into effect          January     I   2005    significantly reduces
the percentage        of affordable units that      a    developer must provide in
order to receive      a  density bonus and requires          up to three concessions
depending      upon the percentage of affordable units in the             development
Under the       new    law   the maximum density bonus               a   developer    can
receive is 35                when      project provides either 10 percent of the
                  percent           a
units   for    very  low income      households      20     percent    for  low income
households        or  40   percent    for moderate income           households       The
legislation also imposes        new    statewide   parking      standards and density
incentives for     developers that donate land for affordable housing                The
City s  density   bonus ordinance is consistent with state law

 Inclusionary Housing Policy
 Requirements and Options
 On July 25 2006 the City Council of the City of Claremont adopted the
 Inclusionary Housing Ordinance requiring the provision of affordable
             in all   residential    development       The ordinance offers two
 housing
 options for each type of housing

                                                                                             HOUSING  ELEMENT
            For Sale     Housing      I    15 percent of the units affordable to
            moderate income households               or  2    10 percent of the units
            affordable to low income households
            For Rent     Housing    I    10 percent of the units affordable         to  low
            income households and 5 percent of the units affordable to
            very low income       households        or   2    10 percent of the units
            affordable to very low income
Exemptions
Residential developments          of four      or fewer units and market rate units
produced       as a  density bonus     are   exempt from the      Inclusionary Housing
Ordinance
Alternatives
The Inclusionary Housing Ordinance offers a couple of alternatives for
fulfilling the requirements in special circumstances that meet strict
criteria      Residential developments with five or six units by right may
pay    a  fee in lieu of constructing the units             Developments      with    more
than     six units     may   request     to    pay an    in lieu fee    donate land of
equivalent value or        construct    inclusionary     units on site if the   following
findings are made
            The      developer would incur an unreasonable                     economic
            hardship in meeting the requirements and there are                no   feasible
            financial design and development methodologies                    to   provide
            the inclusionary units within the development
            The    developer     has    explored     and exhausted        all alternative
            possibilities including the reduction of development costs and
            participation in such programs as low income housing tax
            credits    below market       financing    from     government affordable
            housing      programs       tax exempt       bond     financing    or     other
            programs
Based      on  the  Inclusionary Housing         Fee Study the City established the
initial in lieu fees at      34 per square foot of          living area for ownership
units and       15 per square foot of       living area per rental units These fees
were     determined based      on  detailed     affordability gap analyses to ensure
reasonableness of the fee         Annually the City will evaluate the           in lieu fee
amounts to ensure         continued appropriateness
Incentives
To encourage          compliance    with the Inclusionary          Housing    Ordinance
the City offers the following incentives
            Density    bonus pursuant to State        Density    Bonus law
            One    or   more    density      bonus    incentives     pursuant    to   State
            Density     Bonus law        including regulatory        concessions       state
            parking    standards

          Marketing of for sale             inclusionary     units    through      the
          Redevelopment Agency
          Financial assistance if       excess    affordable units    are  provided
          and
          Reduction in overall inclusionary requirements if            an  increased
          number of lower income units is         provided
Conclusion
The City conducted       a market    feasibility study to evaluate the impact of
the Inclusionary Housing        Ordinance     on housing development         The pro
forma analyses conducted assumed no public funding would be
required The study concluded the following
          The ordinance        sets mInImum       project size   at five units    and
          allows five and six unit projects to pay an in lieu fee by right
          These provisions fall within the typical ranges of inclusionary
          housing policies throughout the State
          The       inclusionary       housing       requirement      for     for sale
          developments      is supported by     the pro forma analyses
          The inclusionary requirements for rental developments are
          supported by the pro forma analyses and when developers
          take   advantage     of the density bonus incentives the impact of
          the inclusionary requirement is virtually eliminated
Developers complying with the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance by
building affordable units in their projects will automatically be eligible
for density bonus and associated incentives                 Therefore the City s
Inclusionary Housing Ordinance would              not  serve to  constrain   housing
development in the City

 dwelling   unit   versus     group    quMters     but makes      no   reference     to
 unrelated individuals     living together       Therefore    this definition is not
 considered restrictive    or  constraining    to the development of housing for
 persons with disabilities

Pursuant to State law Claremont permits state licensed residential care
facilities serving six or fewer persons in all of its residential zoning
districts  by right State licensed       residential   care  facilities serving seven
or more     persons    are  conditionally permitted       in all residential districts
except HC and AV The procedural and substantive requirements for
residential care facilities are no more stringent than those for other
conditional    uses
The    City has not adopted a local requirement for proximity between
two
      special needs housing sites The requirements of Health and
Safety Code Section 1520 5 are enforced by the State Department of
Social Services Health and Human Services Agency                             The law
requires that residential facilities be separated by a minimum of 300
feet to avoid over concentration As of September 2008 the City has a
total of 21 residential care facilities including
           11   adult residential facilities ranging         in capacity from four
          persons to 70 persons
           1 group home for     a total capacity of 6 children teenagers

          8 private homes used to provide            care  for the    developmentally
          disabled
The City has      no  special zoning      or land   use  restrictions that    apply   to
care   facilities that  serve a   limited number of persons             and which the
State Health and       Safety   Code and the Welfare and Institutions Code
state shall   be permitted in all residential     zones   without    a conditional   use
permit
Building Codes
Building procedures       within the City    are  also required to conform       to  the
California Building      Code    as   adopted     in the    City s   Municipal   Code
Standards within the Code include provisions             to ensure     accessibility for
persons with disabilities         These standards          are  consistent    with the
Americans with Disabilities Act              No local amendments that would
constrain    accessibility or increase     the cost of   housing     for persons with
disabilities have been     adopted
Reasonable Accommodation Procedures
Reasonable       accommodation        refers    to  flexibility   in   standards and
policies   to accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities                   The
City s zoning       and   building codes as well as approach to code
enforcement allow for special provisions that meet the needs of
persons with disabilities without the need for variances                  Specifically
parking requirements are reduced for senior housing assisted living
facilities and congregate care facilities City staff is available to provide
assistance regarding the procedures for special accommodations under
the City s Municipal Code

Accessory      uses  such    as  wheelchair ramps are permitted within all
residential zones as incidental      structures related to the residence            Most
reasonable accommodation requests           to  increase    accessibility      of existing
properties   are  handled through the building permit process

the City s Building Official with the administrative authority to grant an
exception to regulations related to accessibility or adaptability when
such regulations create a hardship and equivalent provisions are
provided As part of the building permit application an applicant can
request reasonable accommodation The Building Official will act upon
the request No formal hearing process before any board is required
The City provides matetials at the public counter to inform residents of
this service
Site  Improvement Standards

Development Review and Permit Processing
Development       review and      permit processing          are    necessary steps        to
ensure  that residential construction          proceeds        in an   orderly     manner
However the time and         cost   of permit processing and review               can   be  a
constraint to   housing development       if they      place  an   undue burden on the
developer

                                                                                    HOUSING  ELEMENT
In Claremont the review process takes approximately six to eight
weeks for     a typical single family project and three      to four months for a
typical  multi family project
Pre Application         Application      Review
As  an  option the City offers      pre application  conference and preliminary
Planning Commission and or Architectural Commission reviews to
help identify and address potential issues A 30 day staff review of an
application for completeness and compliance with zoning and
development standards is required for all applications
Environmental Review
Individual   single family homes      are  exempt from environmental review
Other residential projects are subject to varying levels of environmental
clearance depending on potential impacts                 However the required
public hearing      can  be held   concurrently   with the land    or architectural
review   hearing
Land Use Review
City   staff   generally   reviews projects      permitted by right Projects
requiring    a  CUP General Plan Amendment Zone                 Change Variance
and    or Land Subdivision require a         public hearing and review by the
Planning     Commission These projects           except for CUP and Variance
also require    a  public hearing and    review  by the City Council
Architectural Review Process
The    City s design   review process is     applicable to all new development
in the  City    Like the CUP criteria      the design review criteria pertain to
performance        standards     not  uses      The   intent   is to  ensure   new
development       is properly designed      is a  positive addition to the City s
physical environment enhances Claremont s cultural heritage and has
given consideration to energy conservation The following criteria               are
used for all projects reviewed by the Architectural Commission                  per
Claremont Municipal Code Section 16 300 010
     I     The   proposed development is in conformity with the standards
           of this Code and other       applicable ordinances and regulations
           insofar as the location and appearance of the buildings and
           structures are involved
     2     The     proposed    site  is   physically suitable for the type of
           development being proposed             and the proposed project is
           consistent    with the integrity    and character of the district in
           which it is  to be located
     3     The     proposed development is compatible with existing
           development in the sUfr lUnding area in terms of scale height
           bulk materials cohesiveness and colors and the design of the
           project contributes to community appearances by avoiding
           both excessive variety and monotonous repetition
                                                                                            PAGE 8 49
CITY    Of      CLAREMONT                 GENERAL              PLAN
  4   The   proposed development s exterior design and appearance
      is   of   a   quality and character which is compatible with
      surrounding development unless the area is physically
      deteriorating or blighted and is not so at variance as to be
      materially detrimental to the appearance of the other
      development and cause the nature of the local environment to
      depreciate      in value
   5  The     proposed development           will be    compatible with future
      development planned for in the general                  area    especially in
      those instances where         buildings are    within or adjacent to land
      shown     on   the General Plan     as being   part of the Civic Center    or
      in   public    or   educational   use    or are    within  or    immediately
      adjacent      to   land   included    within any precise plan which
      indicates      building shape       size  or style     and the proposed
      development        will promote    a harmonious      transition in terms of
      scale and character if between              areas   of different land     use
      designations
   6  The site     plan and     the  design   of the   buildings parking areas
      signs landscaping         luminaires    and other site features      provide
      for   adequate        and   safe   vehicular     pedestrian and bicycle
      circulation and the visual        effect of the development from view
      of the      public   streets  will  not   be detrimental      to the   public
      interest health       safety  convenience    or  welfare
   7  The    proposed building        and site    development      is  designed  to
      provide       for    energy     conservation      through      the   use    of
      architectural features        landscaping      interior  design    and solar
      and wind orientation
   8   Landscaping plans        show that    adequate consideration has been
                               conservation
      given     to   water                     through the use of drought
      resistant    plants irrigation techniques or other means
   9  The      proposed development will not                unduly     impinge   on

Building Code and Enforcement
In 2001    the State of California consolidated its             building    codes into the
California   Building Standards Code which                 is contained in Title 24 of
the California Code of      Regulations In 2007 the City adopted the 2007
Edition of the California          Building Standards Code Local amendments
were    made to the      California Building Standards Code including the
requirement for             autom
                            ltic      fire sprinklers    While this requirement adds
to  the  cost  of housing        it  helps   prevent urban fires that may have far
more    costly impacts

Development Costs
Development     costs are  key factors    in determining housing affordability
Development     costs include the   price of land improvements labor and
construction
Land Costs
The majority of Claremont is built out While approximately 260 acres
of vacant properties can accommodate housing much of this land is
located in the Hillsides land     use    category which permits very limited
residential   development       due   to     terrain  and physical         hazards
Underutilized land offers additional land for        housing development          but
demolition    of  existing    improvements         may   add    to   the    cost   of
development
PAGE       8    M
                                                                                         HOUSING  ELEMENT
According   to recent
                         appraisals     the land value for multi family property
in Claremont      averages     between         16  to     20 per square         foot  or
  700 000 to   875 000 per     acre
Labor Costs
The California Labor Code            applies prevailing wage rates             to public
works projects of      a value   exceeding 1 000 defining public               works to
mean   construction      alteration    installation     demolition     or  repair work
performed    under contract and       paid   for in whole     or  in part out of  public
funds   For example public transfer of an asset for less than fair market
value such    as a  land write down would be construed to be                 paid for in
part  out  of   public    funds and       thus   would     trigger prevailing wage
requirements State law exempts affordable                 housing projects assisted
with only redevelopment housing set aside funds                  If other public funds
are involved prevailing wage       rates may      still be triggered
While the    cost   differential in prevailing and standard wages varies
based  on the skill level of the occupation prevailing wages tend to add
to the overall cost of development In the case of affordable housing
projects  prevailing     wage requirements could              effectively reduce the
number of affordable units that can be achieved with               public subsidies
Construction Costs
Construction factors such       as  type of construction custom             versus tract
development      materials     site conditions        finishing     details   amenities
square footage      and structural      configuration can increase the cost of
housing The       International Conference of Building Officials provides
estimates for  the average cost of labor and materials for typical Type V
wood frame      housing         Estimates are            based     on     good quality
construction     providing for materials and fixtures well above                     the
minimum     required by state and local building codes                    In 2008    the
average    per     square     foot    cost     for    good quality housing          was
approximately       95 for multi family      housing and 107 for single family
homes
Although construction costs          are a     significant portion of the overall

Housing Resources
Similar   to   most   communities across the         region Claremont faces a
variety of constraints      to  housing development and preservation but
also offers    a  range of  resources    and opportunities to meet the future
housing   needs

future    Housing Needs
Regional Housing Needs Assessment RHNA
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment RHNA is mandated by
State Housing Law as part of the periodic process of updating local
housing elements The RHNA quantifies the need for housing within
each jurisdiction during specific planning periods The current planning
period is January 1 2006 to June 30 2014 For the current planning
period the State Department of Housing and Community Development
approved a projected future need of 699 368 new housing units in the
six county Southern        California region encompassing the counties of
Los    Angeles       Orange Riverside San Bernardino Ventura and
Imperial        The Southern California Association of Governments
 SCAG is      responsible   for allocating   this future housing need   to the 193
jurisdictions within the region In this capacity SCAG determined each
jurisdiction s share of the forecasted growth
The RHNA is divided into the four income groups established by HCD
Pursuant       to   State   Housing     Element      law    a  jurisdiction   must
demonstrate in its Housing Element that it has               adequate residential
sites   at    appropriate      densities    and    development standards to
accommodate its RHNA
RHNA for Claremont
According     to the RHNA      prepared by     SCAG Claremont s share of the
fOLecasted              is 458 new   housing           These                  units
              growth                            units          new   housing
are  divided into five income categories as follows
          Extremely Low Income             30 percent MFI      58 units
          Very Low Income 31 50 percent MFI               59  units

Housing      Units Built     or  Under Cpnstruction Since 2006
Because the RHNA            was   developed using January I 2006 as the
baseline for the     growth projections housing units developed since that
 date can   be credited toward the RHNA             Table 8 26 summarizes the
housing    units constructed      since   January I 2006         As shown      341

        were   approved but have        not  yet been built        These units have
        been determined      to  be affordable given their small sizes of less
        than 700 square feet         Prevailing market rents for studios and
        small apartments of this size             are   affordable to low income
        households     see  Tables 8 18 and 8 19             One of these units is
        affordable at   no    rent based      on    information     provided by    the

Site     6    111 S        College     Avenue     The  City s  Affordable  Housing
Task Force identified            this 3 3  acre  site as  the top priority    for a
Redevelopment Agency sponsored                 affordable  housing development
The City s Redevelopment Agency has purchased                       4 acres of the
                                                                    2

negotiations for the Redevelopment Agency              to purchase the remaining
 9 acres The City has selected an experienced housing developer to
work with the City and the Redevelopment Agency to build an
affordable development on the site The property is zoned Mixed Use 2
which emphasizes residential uses with limited office commercial
development along College and First Street and other ground floor
areas     The property also has a Residential 30 Overlay designation
which allows a density of 30 units per acre by right for a development
that includes housing for low very low                and extremely low income
households        The     proposed project     includes 16  extremely   low income
units 43 very low income units and 16 low income units                 Construction
is expected to begin        in Spring   2010

Avenues          Pilgrim      Place   owns   this  8 acre site    The property is
already designated Institutional and is zone Institutional Residential
The current zoning permits residential density at 30 units per acre
 emergency shelters and transitional housing by right on the property
At 30 units per acre the site could accommodate 24 units
Site      8     southeast       comer      of Towne      Avenue and Foothill
 Boulevard        This 1 5 acre site has      a Mixed  Use designation that allows
 residential   uses  in addition to commercial office uses          The Mixed Use
 designation allows a density          of 15 units per acre   At 15 units per  acre
 the site could accommodate 22 units
 Site     14 se Line Road                  1000 feet east of Towne Avenue
 Site    14 has a designation of Residential 15 and is zoned Medium
 Density Residential 3000 which allows multiple family housing at 15
 units to   the   acre       The property also has Residential 30          Overlay
 designation     which increases the        permitted density to 30 units per acre

School      This site is owned by Golden State Water                 Company which
has  an  active well on the site          The site is      large enough to provide
several   acres     for    development       while   still    preserving the water
company    s ability   to  utilize the well   The property has        a designation of
Residential 6 and is zoned RS10000               With this zoning the property
could accommodate 19 units
Site    18 north of Base Line Road east side of Monte Vista
Avenue      Site     18 is owned by Pomona Valley Protection               Agency  and
is  currently    part of     a   larger parcel    used      for water conservation
purposes       The property currently has            a   designation     of Park and
Resource Conservation            and is zoned     Park Resource Conservation
The property will require          a different General Plan        designation   and  a
change of    zone     before it    can   be developed for residential         uses    If
developed    it is assumed that       only  a portion of Site       18 would be used
for affordable housing            The remaining portion would be used for
market   rate   housing        The   current zoning of the property does not
allow residential    uses
Availability of Infrastructure            and Services
All of the recommended sites          are  located within urbanized        areas of the
City   and   except for Site           7   the sites    are     located  along major

Housing     Sites With Potential for 30 Unit Per Acre
The City s Affordable       Housing Task Force recommended a Residential
30  Overlay be     established for potential housing sites              Residential 30
Overlay allows       a greater      density than is otherwise allowed by the
underlying designation for housing developments that are affordable for
low very low and extremely low income households                         If housing is
affordable for low        very low      and  extremely low income          households
the potential  density    is 30 units per acre   by right
Correlation of Sites with Income                Affordability
Table 8 31     correlates the sites inventory with              potential affordability
levels accounting for the increased density allowed with the Residential

 Residential 30 Overlay designation the maximum potential number of
new   units that   can   be accommodated        on  the inventory sites increases
to 764    The maximum number of               potential     units affordable to low

government assistance given the           highly  inflated market conditions         In
recognition of the significant market constraints the City s strategy for               descriptions of the City s affordable housing
addressing the housing needs of lower income households involves                        policies and programs
          Facilitating    the  development    of housing affordable to lower and
          moderate income households             on properties that permit       up to
          30 units per     acre
          Implementation of        an inclusionary housing policy that requires
          affordable        housing     be     incorporated       into     residential
          development throughout the City
          Assisting     in the   development of affordable housing through
          land     write downs      park    and   recreation    fee   reductions    or
          waivers or other forms of subsidies
          Working      with  experienced housing developers         to create   quality
          affordable housing
Affordable Housing Overlay
The   City  has established the Residential 30        Overlay category to allow a
greater residential density       than is otherwise     permitted in an underlying
land  use  district The maximum permitted density in the Residential 30
Overlay would be 30         units per  acre    The  permitted density of 30 units
per acre does not include the increased            density that could be allowed
through a density bonus This higher density would be                  considered the
base density for purposes of calculating a density bonus
A   development      would    qualify by right  for the increased base density of
30 units to the acre if it at least 50 percent of the units       are   affordable for
low     very      low     and    extremely     low income      households          To
accommodate the increased              density for     an  affordable    project   the
Residential 30 Overlay will allow greater building height              a mix  of three
and four stories         reduced setbacks       increased lot coverage         smaller
floor area   requirements less open space and            landscaping     and reduced
parking requirements from what            is otherwise    permitted required in an
underlying land use category                As a conditional of approval an
agreement shall be required between the developer and the City to
ensure the affordability of the units Such agreement shall be binding to
all future owners of the development and successors in interest
 Projects where      at  least 50 percent of the units are not affordable will
not  qualify   for the increased base       density of 30 units to acre but could
be entitled      to  a   density bonus and        or   equivalent    concessions     or

  City owned   sites purchased by Claremont Redevelopment Agency for affordable housing
  Site   7 is not included in Residential 30 Overlay Site     7 has Institutional designation which allows 30 units per acre
The City has determined              that 23 units per        acre   is  an   appropriate
density for calculating capacity        estimates of housing sites         as  this density
would strike       a   balance between market demand financial feasibility
and community vision            The    City is proposing this density for a project
on   Site     6 based      on an   analysis that demonstrated that this density
could achieve affordable housing development with the level of public
subsidies that      are   available for an   affordable    housing project       Based   on
this  analysis     it is reasonable to assume that the other Tier I sites can
support affordable          housing development          at the same        density   when
public subsidies       are  available
Affordable      housing at a similar density has been demonstrated in some
neighboring communities that have market conditions similar to
Claremont           The nearby City of Chino achieved affordable housing
through development agreements for lower income seniors and families
at  20 units per        acre  and 14 units per        acre   respectively        No public
subsidies                involved   in  these    projects        Another
               were                                                           neighboring
community the City of Rancho Cucamonga worked with Southern
California     Housing Development Corporation               to
                                                                develop     an  affordable
rental housing project for families at         a density of 1 7    units per acre
A density of 23 units per           acre   is also consistent with the          density   of
several   recently     built and  approved projects       in the  City     These include
the  recently built     units in the Claremont      Village Expansion area and the
new Claremont Graduate University student
                                                            housing and the housing

CITY       Of     CLAREMONT                  GENERAL              PLAN
also  approved    a  similar density     23 5 units per     acre   for  a project that
had  previously   been   proposed for     Site    6
As shown in Table 8 32         the Tier I recommended sites           are more     than
adequate   to accommodate the          City remaining RHNA target for 107

units 56 for extremely low income households and 51 very low income
households Under the         underlying zoning        the sites  can   accommodate
135 units with the allowed 30 units per          acre  the sites  can  accommodate
201 units for very low and extremely low income units and with                        an
assumed density of 23 units per           acre  the sites   can  accommodate 152
units
Site    7 has the     potential  to be     developed     with  non residential     uses
under the underlying zoning          If in the future Site      7 is developed with
non residential uses and       or non affordable units the City will continue
to have               sites available to accommodate the            City s remaining
          adequate
RHNA target with Sites              6 and        14     Sites     6 and      14   were

Redevelopment Agency sponsored               affordable housing        The  two    sites
have   a combined capacity of 111 units under their               underlying zoning
177  with the Residential 30      Overlay      an estimated capacity of 129 units
at the assumed     density of 23   units per acre
Development of Site 6 for affordable housing is a top priority of the
City The Redevelopment Agency has completed the purchase of the
site and selected an experienced housing developer to build housing on
this site      See Program 10              The proposed project includes 16
extremely low income         units   43 very low income units            and   16 low
income units     This would leave        a remaining RHNA target of 49 units
40 extremely low income units and 9 very low income units Site                        14

City no longer    has sufficient sites available to accommodate the              City s
remaining RHNA target the City is committed                    to  designate   one    or
more    additional sites to accommodate the City s remaining                   RHNA
target    See   Program     5
The   City s remaining target may          also be met     through implementation
of the  City s inclusionary housing        ordinance        The ordinance requires
the provision of affordable housing in all residential development
As part of the    City s inclusionary housing policy development              the   City
conducted     an   inclusionary housing study            to  test  the   feasibility of
different inclusionary housing options given                   Claremont s     market
conditions       The    study    concluded that         when    a   developer     takes
advantage    of the State density bonus provisions              10 to 15 percent of
low and very low income units can be                            in a rental

City   Owned Sites
The    most     critical component          of affordable      housing     in  Southern
California is often the land cost           In today s housing market affordable
housing development           is  only feasible if public local          state   and   or
federal               is   available to      subsidize the                      and the
           funding                                             development
density  is   reasonably high so that the subsidy required is attainable
Subsidies are often provided as direct gap financing for the
construction land write downs and or fee waivers                         Usually multi
layering of funding      sources    is required
Property owned by the City can be used to increase the affordability of
new housing for low very low and extremely low income households
This is because the City          can    write down     the land     which will reduce
the overall    costs  of the development          This    can  make development of
affordable    housing     feasible   even   at lower densities       For   example   the
six Habitat for      Humanity homes           were   constructed     on   land partially
purchased     with   Agency     funds    These units sold at affordable prices to
very low income households               were   constructed     at  a  density of eight
Jnits  per acre on a property zoned for ten units per acre                Currently  the
City  owns     and   or  the  City   Council   has   approved     the  purchase of   the
following   sites where     residential   uses  could  be  developed
           111 S      CoUege       Avenue       Site       6   This is   a  3 3 acre site

          Force    as a top    priority for a Redevelopment Agency sponsored
          affordable housing development The Agency has purchased
          the site for an affordable housing development The property

          units per     acre      The property has        a  Residential 30 Overlay
          designation       which increases the permitted density                on  the
          property    to 30 units per acre if units are affordable to low           very
          low    and   extremely     low income households

          Police       Station      Site        The      City  is  considering      the
          construction of      a new   facility for the Police    Department       The
          Police Station may be relocated to another site and the existing
          facility demolished If demolished the 19 acre site could be
          used for residential development               This site is  not   currently
          included in the list of available sites         as no   decision has been
          made     on a   replacement site for the police facility and funding
          sources    for  a new facility have not yet been determined              The
          property is     within the Village Expansion Specific Plan which
          will require an amendment prior             to redevelopment of the       site
          for residential uses

participation is encouraged              particularly because Claremont residents
have    a   passion for their community and bring thoughtful                   insightful
suggestions and opinions             to  meetings Throughout the City s history
difficult    community        issues       have    been resolved      through special
committees       or  at the ballot box
Claremont s        history of governing processes includes its legacy of
incorporating public participation                   In the late nineteenth century
Claremont residents practiced a pure form of democracy called The
Town Meeting decision making                       These meetings were common
practices     of  the   New     England      settlers   who comprised a substantial
proportion      of  the     Ot 5  first   population In Claremont town meetings
were     typically    held   twice      a  year or upon written applications by
property      owners       As    matter      of custom they often                ed and
                                                                               discus
resolved community issues in a Pomona College building The town
clerk advertised meetings by posting proclamations at the Post Office
the Urbanus       store the grammar school and Holmes Hall of Pomona
College        Town meetings served as an important forum on such
facilities as   a hotel fire department city hall and the water company
Claremont residents readily accepted the role of finding                   answers     to
community        concerns       Even before the State of California established
planning requirements Claremont formed committees on planning
issues     including water supply library streets and sidewalks hotel
                                                2
finance sanitation and cemetery                     In 1903 the City created Town
Regulations        0     Claremont         California   with the City s      first rules
concerning zoning         and   setbacks     of  buildings from  the street   Residents
also raised concerns regarding the architectural styles and physical

appearance of the town                     Community services or improvements
resulting from these          town      meetings     were  executed with the help of
donations from residents and businesses
In 1907       the majority of Claremont citizens voted for incorporation
under the        state s  general municipal law              During the debate      over
incorporation many opponents such as the owners of citrus ranches
along the Citys proposed boundary feared the threat of political
parties     cost   of   a city government and increased              tax  on  the citrus
groves       The majority of         voters   wanted    to gain funding from the City
for infrastructure         including        paved     roads   street   cleaning    water

OUf Local Government
Claremont is    a   general law city governed by a five member City Council
elected by the residents at large         As a general law city Claremont can
impose   taxes    for regulatory and      revenue    purposes      Tax   revenue    can
then be used       to  operate city programs and public services                 Unlike
unincorporated      areas  that rely  on  services    from   the county general law
cities have the     legislative authority    to create laws and ordinances that
regulate their growth in a manner suitable for the city
The City is administered by        a council manager form of government In

delivery Community representatives serve on commissions appointed
by the council on various issues and they have some decision making
authority and make recommendations to the City Council

government and how each part relates to other parts                 The policies and
decisions that affect Claremont residents            are  largely made by the City
Council    The city manager is responsible for operating and managing
the   departments and         appropriate      programs specified        by the City
Council The City Council acts          as  the Redevelopment Agency directors

being  and vitality The City is committed       to actively promoting policies
and   programs that     support individuals       of diverse ethnic      cultural

renowned for its civic traditions honoring the values of inclusiveness

equality fairness compassion hope and community engagement A
durable and vibrant community grounded in these values requires
diligent attention to the institutions programs and policies that form
the basis of City governance and management
To be successful           our  local government system must         continue  to
include all in the community and be fair and accountable not just to
 those who participate but to all persons regardless of their ethnic and
 religious identity cultural heritage socioeconomic status gender or
 political affiliations     Our government    structure and tradition     both in
 terms of how local government is         organized and   our commissions and
 committees         allow for participation at many levels     Our commitment
 to   enllaging the community and always asking them questions requires
 that  we  continue to
            Conduct open meetings where all        can voice their  opinions and
            concerns
            Maintain issues oriented commissions with         memberships that
            reflect the community s diversity
            Provide public notice of meetings employing methods that          can
            reach many
            Listen   to all community groups fairly politely and with equal
            attention
 Like all    of Southern California       Claremont will become increasingly
 diverse and the City will need to       use creative methods to   publicize and
 encourage       participation     of  residents   and   business    owners     of
 increasingly        varied     backgrounds      and    needs      To     engage
 underrepresented populations the City will identify barriers that keep
 them from equal participation and or representation Some of these
 hurdles may         include   inaccessible  methods    of notification   due   to
 language technology          or  economic barriers      The   consequences     of
  unequal participation       may    be  an  uneven   spread of    services  and
 facilities and the concentration of services in          areas  in response to
 participants
  Effectiveness of public participation also depends      on  City government s
  responsiveness and accountability            Inadequate responsiveness will
  discourage public participation Our citizens must recognize that they
  are part of a community and that decisions are made on behalf of the
  overall community good While council and commissions objectively
  listen to the public not everyone may be pleased with a decision The
  City s commitment is to conduct fair and objective hearings where all
 sides of an issue can be voiced and will be considered seriously
