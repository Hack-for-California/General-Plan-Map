(1995), 62 percent were single-family detached homes, 25
percent were multiple family units, 7 percent attached
single-family homes and another 5 percent mobile homes.
The city's housing stock ranges from the merchant
mansions built in the late 1800s in the "Old Town" area
near downtown, to the working class cottages of the early
1900s, to the traditional ranch style subdivisions of the
1950s and 60s, to the large custom homes of the 1990s.
Multi-family housing is found in different areas of the city,
with most concentrated along major streets such as Soscol
and Freeway Drive. Mobile home parks are also found
throughout the city as are a variety of residential care
facilities for the elderly.
Perhaps the strongest sentiment to arise from the extensive
public outreach program conducted during the General
Plan update process was the community’s desire to
conserve the character of existing neighborhoods.

                                         NEIGHBORHOOD TYPOLOGIES
 TYPE A                             Characterized by uniformity in platting patterns, street designs, building types, and
 Post War Tract Subdivisions        relationship of home to lot (i.e., uniform setbacks).
 TYPE B                             Characterized by platting patterns with large, regularly shaped lots and custom
 Estate Residential                 homes that vary in lot placement and structural and landscape design. The pattern
                                    of these areas was generally established through subdivision of large tracts of vacant
                                    land. Irregular lot configurations and curvilinear street systems are a result of
                                    topography and other natural constraints.
 TYPE C                             Characterized by homogeneous platting patterns of lots up to one-half acre along
 Period Tract Subdivisions          gridiron or curvilinear streets. Include some diversity of building types and
                                    maintenance levels since structures were developed over time.
 TYPE D                             Land divided over time through multiple land partition actions. Include a large
 Ranchettes                         number of irregularly shaped and/or sized lots, typically from one to five acres in
                                    size. Diversity in physical neighborhood character factors (e.g., varying architectural
                                    style and period). Often lack public improvements such as streetscaping and
                                    sidewalks.
 TYPE E                             Characterized by large, regularly-shaped lots that are most often developed with
 Deep Lot Subdivisions              post-1950 homes. Lot width to depth ratios typically exceed 1:3. Development
                                    patterns generally include regular individual lot setbacks and house sizes. Street
                                    patterns are usually gridiron and are often narrow.
 TYPE F                             Characterized by small lots laid out in a predominantly gridiron pattern; radial
 Traditional Neighborhoods          streets and alley may also be included in the street grid. These areas were typically
                                    platted before the 1930s, with “period” architecture. Uses include a mix of housing
                                    types.
 TYPE G                             Dominated by residential uses other than single-family detached homes; primarily
 Attached Unit Residential          attached unit residential structures that vary in scale from concentrations of
                                    duplexes and triplexes through areas dominated by apartment and
                                    condominium/townhome development. Irregular platting patterns and lot sizes,
                                    often with extensive public and private improvements.

The future circulation system is shown in Figure 3-1.
Improvements to the existing system are shown in Figure
3-2, and described in Table 3-1. These improvements are
designed to support development shown on the Land Use
Diagram.
Due to expected development and related traffic, these
improvements have been identified as potentially
necessary over the next 25 years in order to maintain the
level of service standards set out in this General Plan. Most
of these improvements are not needed immediately. But
the City will need to monitor the level of service in these
corridors, reserve right-of- way when feasible, and identify
funding sources for improvements to ensure that an
acceptable level of service is maintained.
Roadway Classification System
Roadways serve two functions that conflict from a design
standpoint: to provide mobility and to provide property
access.     High and constant speeds are desirable for
mobility, while low speeds are more desirable for property
access, particularly in residential areas.
The circulation system consists of a set of roadway
classifications that have been developed to guide Napa’s
long-range planning and programming (see Tables 3-2 and
3-3). Roadways are systematically classified based on the
linkages they provide and their function, both of which
reflect their importance to the land use pattern and the
traveler.

funding for needed road improvements statewide. This
shortfall has led to delays in state construction funding
for State Route 29 at Trancas Street/Redwood Road
interchange.
As gas tax funding sources have shrunk, less money has
been made available for street maintenance. Deferred
maintenance has begun to affect the entire circulation
system as pavement, sidewalks, and street lights continue
to age. Some deficiencies in Napa's existing circulation
system are the direct result of incomplete or
discontinuous arterial or collector streets and lack of
circulation network continuity.
This General Plan recognizes this fundamental conflict
between increased traffic and decreased financial and
public support for more and wider roads. This plan
accepts slightly greater congestion as the price of
allowing development at a reasonable cost. The LOS D
adopted as an acceptable standard in this plan recognizes
that through the day, almost every road will be relatively
uncongested (mid-level C or better); at peak times --
morning and evening commute times -- there may be
some congestion, but not the level of congestion regularly
experienced in most cities in the Bay Area today.
The City's commitment to preserving the Rural Urban
Limit means that all future development will occur in a
limited and defined area. Because Napa is largely
developed already, there are relatively few opportunities
to expand existing roads or create new collectors or
arterials to meet future traffic demand. Each new home
and each new business will generally lead to additional
automobiles on the streets of the city. These factors
combined -- the RUL, an inability to significantly expand
road capacity, and growth -- mean that congestion is
likely to increase over time.
Even with planned improvements, service at some
intersections will likely deteriorate below LOS D over the
25-year time frame of this plan. The improvements
required to maintain LOS D are not considered feasible
due to very high cost or the impacts of the improvements.
Accordingly, this plan establishes LOS E at peak times for
a few intersections, as listed in the following policies.

  Service
     A        Describes operations with very low delay ( i.e., less than 10.0 sec per vehicle). This occurs when progression is
              extremely favorable, and most vehicles arrive during the green phase. Most vehicles do not stop at all. Short
              cycle lengths may also contribute to low delay.
      B       Describes operations with delay in the range of 10.1 to 20.0 sec per vehicle. This generally occurs with good
              progression and/or short cycle lengths. More vehicles stop than for LOS A, causing higher levels of average
              delay.
     C        Describes operations with delay in the range of 20.1 to 35.0 sec per vehicle. These higher delays may result
              from fair progression and/or longer cycle lengths. Individual cycle failures may begin to appear at this level.
              The number of vehicles stopping is significant at this level, although many still pass through the intersection
              without stopping.
     D         Describes operations with delay in the range of 35.1 to 55.0 sec per vehicle. At level "D”, the influence of
              congestion becomes more noticeable. Long delays may result from some combination of unfavorable
              progression, long cycle lengths, or high v/c ratios. Many vehicles stop, and the proportion of vehicles not
              stopping declines. Individual cycle failures are noticeable.
      E       Describes operations with delay in the range of 55.1 to 80.0 sec per vehicle. This is considered to be the limit of
              acceptable delay. These high delay values generally indicate poor progression, long cycle lengths, and high
              v/c ratios. Individual cycle failures are frequent occurrences.
      F       Describes operations with delay in excess of 80.0 seconds per vehicle. This is considered to be unacceptable to
              most drivers. This condition often occurs with oversaturation, i.e., when arrival flow rates exceed the capacity
              of the intersection. It may also occur at high v/c ratios below 1.00 with many individual cycle failures. Poor
              progression and long cycle lengths may also be major contributing causes to such delay levels.

sector also has relatively low wages, but on a per-per-
acre basis has the greatest positive impact on the
City’s budget.
Based on the City’s Economic Strategic Plan, accepted
by the City Council in July 1999, this chapter seeks to
achieve a diverse blend of economic activity that
benefits local residents while serving markets and
visitors from around the world. The Economic
Strategic Plan was developed through an extensive
process with a working group of business and
community leaders, as well as public workshops with
the community, the Planning Commission and the
City Council.        The process was informed by
numerous interviews with community members, and
an in-depth analysis of the city’s economy and market
opportunities which may be found in the background
report. (See Economic Element document).
