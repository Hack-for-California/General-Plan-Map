Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
1.0     PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE GENERAL PLAN
The General Plan is the official, adopted policy statement for the City of Fowler regarding
the future character and quality of urban development within the planning area. The plan
is based on the concept that Fowler would like to remain a town in which residents can
have a sense of identity with and enjoy the community=s physical, social, and economic
assets, and can participate in decisions concerning growth and development.
California=s tradition of allowing local authority over land use decisions means that cities
have considerable flexibility in preparing their General Plans. However, though land use
policies are not mandated, the issues to be addressed in the Plan are prescribed by State
law. California Government Code Sections 65300 et seq. establish requirements for the
content of general plans, as well as for their adoption and subsequent amendment. Seven
general plan elements are required by State law and this document updates the Land Use
and Circulation elements.
The planning period for the General Plan is a 20-year horizon, extending to the year 2025.
Planning, however, is a continuous process that requires periodic re-evaluation and
revision to reflect new opportunities, conditions, and attitudes or the community. To be
effective, the plan must be reviewed on a regular basis and revised as necessary to maintain
its validity. Unless unanticipated changes occur, however, it is expected that the basic
objectives and policies for development will not require major alterations.
General Plan Concepts
The following concepts guide preparation of the plan:
    •   Establishing limits to urban growth that will maintain Fowler as a freestanding
        City surrounded by agricultural land. The City=s identity, history, and economy
        derive from it location in a rich agricultural region. Policies throughout the plan are
        intended to support Fowler=s small town atmosphere and continued agricultural
        industry while also providing for diversification of the City=s economic base.
        Approximately 940 acres of agriculture would remain in the SOI.
    •   Maintaining an economically and socially diverse population by promoting a
        greater variety of housing types citywide. Lack of affordable housing is a problem
        throughout California, not just in Fowler. City residents come from many different
        household structures and income groups, and the land use element calls for a more
        diverse housing stock to allow opportunities for all.

Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
    •   Providing commercial and industrial sites consistent with Fowler=s growth. With
        expected population growth, the City will be able to support a wider variety of retail
        stores and services, including some not available at present. Continued industrial
        and employment growth will be required to maintain a jobs/housing balance that
        offers many opportunities to City residents.
    •   Using Growth Management to implement general plan policies and quality of
        life objectives. Fowler is uniquely situated near the Fresno-Clovis metropolitan
        area and offers an alternative lifestyle to these major urban centers. At the same
        time, residential growth should be regulated to ensure ongoing availability of
        facilities and services, and that new residential development pays its fair share of
        the costs of development.
    •   Providing for a high quality of life for existing and future residents. The quality
        of life is related to sustainable clean air and water resources, the planting of trees,
        and the control of ambient noise. Other quality of life indicators include well-
        planned architecturally pleasing residential, commercial and industrial
        development; the availability of alternatives to the private automobile; sound
        schools; and parks and recreation services.
    •   Downtown Fowler. Fowler's downtown has its own unique character as a
        concentrated area of retail, service and office uses. Future development should
        enhance the vitality of the downtown as a focused commercial, office, banking and
        cultural center while maintaining a mix of commercial and residential uses.
        Specialty retail, office and banking uses should be limited in the downtown rather
        than in other areas of the community. A Specific Plan is recommended to guide
        development and apply design standards where desirable.
Population Growth
The City has grown at a slower rate than surrounding cities over the past decade and is
expected to maintain a 2-3% growth rate over the planning period. This would be
consistent with overall Fresno County growth. Policies in the Land Use Element are
intended to monitor population growth rates and allow the community to adjust the
approach to growth based on the availability of services and other quality of life issues. At
a 2% growth rate, the population of the City would increase from 4,100 in 2004 to
approximately 6,100 in 2025. At 3%, the population would increase to 7,200, or an average
annual increase of 180 residents per year.

2.0 GOALS OF THE GENERAL PLAN
This section presents the major goals for the City of Fowler which provide direction for
growth management and future development. Goals express what the community desires
and is capable of achieving over time. Policies and standards are action statements
intended to implement each objective. Achieving goals over time implies a broad range of
actions on several fronts, including:
    •   Fostering economic growth, diversification, and the provision of commercial
        services and employment opportunities.
    •   Providing social, educational and recreational opportunities to neighborhoods;
        providing sufficient access for police, fire and health services; and protecting
        neighborhoods from adverse effects of traffic, noise and crime;
    •   Preventing degradation of the natural and man-made environment and offsetting
        degradation which may already have occurred;
    •   Providing a choice of housing location for all persons, regardless of race, sex,
        cultural origin, marital status, or physical ability;
    •   Reducing land use conflicts while providing a balanced range of residential,
        commercial, industrial, and institutional uses; and
    •   Providing adequate streets, transportation facilities, and public services to
        accommodate existing and future populations.
The policies identify the role of the City as a catalyst, supporter, coordinator or responsible
party for action programs. A major premise is that while local government exists to provide
a variety of services, local government cannot be expected to provide solutions to all
problems. The private sector and a wide-range of community organizations are also
responsible for meeting certain needs of the community. County, State and Federal
governments also have an important role to play in local community development.
Goal 2-1:        Adopt a Sphere of Influence and phase annexation to provide for logical
                 and efficient growth and prevent the premature conversion of agricultural
                 land.

Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
Policies and Standards
1.      In cooperation with Fresno County and the Fresno Local Agency Formation
        Commission (LAFCO), adopt and maintain a Sphere of Influence consistent with
        State annexation laws and LAFCO policy which provides for adequate lands for
        growth over the 20-year planning time-frame.
2.      Coordinate planning of the unincorporated area within the Sphere of Influence with
        Fresno County and encourage the County to zone unincorporated areas within the
        Sphere for continued agricultural use.
3.      Future urbanization should be phased to encourage contiguous land use where
        possible. This includes concentration on the "in-filling" of vacant lands by-passed by
        development. Development greater than 1/4 mile from existing urban uses shall be
        discouraged.
4.      The premature conversion of producing agricultural lands is discouraged. Steps to
        reduce such conversion include phased growth, programmed extension of urban
        services, and use of Williamson Act Contracts where urbanization is not anticipated
        for at least 10 years.
5.      In locations where development may affect nearby agriculture, require that all
        recorded deeds for newly subdivided lots include a Right-to-Farm Notice.
6.      Extension of urban services without annexation is discouraged. When such
        extensions are made, they should be conditioned on an agreement to annex when it
        becomes feasible.
7.      Annex residential land to the City as determined by growth management policies
        and reject proposals for prezoning and annexation if they do not satisfy General
        Plan requirements relating to orderly and contiguous development and public
        services and facilities.
Goal 2-2:        Manage growth to improve the quality of life in the community.
Policies and Standards
1.      The desirable annual population and housing growth rate should not exceed the
        average of the planned growth rate through 2025 of 3% over any five-year period
        (50-60 units), and should not exceed 6% in any single year (80-90 units). Projects that
        may exceed these numbers should include provisions for phasing the project.
        Phasing may occur through conditions of approval, the use of a development
__________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
        agreement, or other mechanism.
2.      The City will seek to manage the rates of population and housing growth at levels
        which do not exceed the capacity of the city, SKF, and the Fowler Unified School
        District to provide the necessary levels of community and educational services and
        facilities required, consistent with other goals of the General Plan.
3.      School child generation is to be monitored in cooperation with the Fowler Unified
        School District. The City shall request annual reports from the district, along with
        projected enrollment by school, for discussion with district staff.
4.      In January of each year, the Community Development Director shall prepare a
        report to the Planning Commission and City Council detailing the total number of
        housing permits finalized in the previous year and those anticipated for the coming
        year. Based on the annual report, the City Council will determine the need to
        continue or modify the housing objectives, including but not limited to, placing
        restrictions on the number of annexations and building permits that may be issued
        in any year. The Community Development Director may also submit reports for
        shorter periods of time as the Director determines to be necessary in the event of a
        fast pace of residential building activity.
5.      Tentative subdivisions and/or use permits and site plan reviews for single family or
        multifamily use are to be processed in accordance with the following criteria:
        a)       Projects which are consistent with the general plan which are within the
                 existing city limits or seek to infill property.
        b)       Projects which are consistent with the general plan but which are not within
                 the city limits and require annexation.
        c)       Projects which are not consistent with the general plan and require general
                 plan amendment and annexation. Such projects shall not be accepted for
                 filing unless directed by the Planning Commission.
6.      The City will not generally consider the annexation of more than 40 acres for
        residential development in any single project and will consider the following factors
        prior to initiating annexation to LAFCO:
        1)       The amount of available infill property within the city limits;
        2)       The inventory of available subdivided lots within the city limits in relation to
                 overall housing objectives;
__________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
        3)       The potential impact on the Fowler Unified School District facilities and
                 services;
        4)       The availability and adequacy of City and SKF services to the proposed
                 annexation.
7.      Additional land for annexation could be considered if:
        1)       Additional land is needed to achieve overall growth objectives, including the
                 annexation of commercial or industrial land for economic development;
        2)       Additional land is needed to achieve housing objectives (i.e., senior housing,
                 housing relocation from within a redevelopment area, etc.)
Goal 2-3:        Provide urban services to meet the needs of the existing community and
                 planned growth.
Policies and Standards
1.      Ensure that land divisions and developments are approved only when a project's
        improvements, dedications, and fees fully cover incremental costs to the City and
        other agencies. Such improvements and infrastructure include parks, major streets,
        traffic signals, street lights, drainage systems, sewer, water, fire, police, schools, and
        other related facilities.
2.      Within one year of General Plan adoption, update master plans for sewer, water,
        and drainage improvements showing existing facilities and proposed
        improvements.
3.      Annually review the Capital Improvement Program in order to increase the capacity
        of needed public services in response to City growth, improve existing public
        facilities, and develop necessary new public facilities.
4.      Consider providing public cost-sharing of public services under certain
        circumstances to encourage desirable and innovative development within the city.
5.      Coordinate with the Fowler Unified School District in the location of new school
        facilities to ensure adequate facilities, circulation, access for students, and recreation
        opportunities.

6.      In cooperation with the Fresno County Fire Protection District, provide fire fighting
        equipment, facilities and manpower sufficient to assure quick response and
        adequate fire flow at all times.
7.      Provide adequate police manpower and facilities and review development
        proposals so as to reduce crime and impacts on police protection services.
8.      Support the Fresno County library system and the extension of library services.
9.      Use special districts as appropriate to provide broad neighborhood improvements
        such as drainage, open space, and other public works projects.
Goal 2-4:        Improve and enhance existing neighborhoods and development.
Policies and Standards
1.      Review the adequacy of zoning code enforcement procedures and expand the
        program where necessary .
2.      Continue to use redevelopment housing set-aside funds and other appropriate
        programs to rehabilitate existing neighborhoods and dwellings and to provide
        support for low and moderate income housing.
3.      Promote rehabilitation of commercial sites and investigate funding opportunities for
        rehabilitation/remodeling of small businesses.
4.      Pursue the undergrounding of utilities.
5.      Promote a city-wide street tree planting program. Landscaped areas should be
        located and designed to maintain views for traffic and pedestrian safety.
6.      As primary entrances to the City, Merced Street, Golden State Boulevard, Manning
        Avenue, and Adams Avenue should reflect higher standards of development. To
        promote these higher standards, a boulevard overlay district should be developed
        in the zoning ordinance to contain provisions for minimum building setbacks,
        landscaping, sidewalk pattern and street furniture, with distinctions made between
        upgrade of existing uses and new development. Proper orientation, design and

Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
        architectural features shall be regulated through the site plan review process.
7.      No new advertising structures shall be allowed within the city limits. The City will
        encourage Fresno County to maintain such controls in the unincorporated areas of
        the City's Sphere of Influence as well.
8.      The City, in partnership with other community organizations, shall create
        beautification programs encouraging voluntary participation from community
        residents. These may include: adopting a street and park landscaping plan; tree
        planting and landscaping in existing neighborhoods; and self-help
        housing/building renovation and repairs.
Goal 2-5:       New development is to reflect high levels of community design and image.
1.      Ensure that all development is attractive and of high quality design to enhance the
        image of the city.
2.      Require site plan review and architectural review for all multi-family, commercial,
        and industrial development, including provisions for building setbacks, lot
        coverage, parking, access and circulation, outdoor lighting, signage, and
        landscaping.
3.      Encourage innovative site planning and housing design for new residential
        development.

3.0 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Fowler is committed to securing a stable, dynamic, and strong economic base through
the strengthening and expansion of the City's economic resources. The strengths of
Fowler's economy arise from its people, business owners, schools, community
organizations and government facilities. The City intends to strengthen and expand
these resources in order to improve the standard of living, the environment for business
attraction and growth, and the employment and educational opportunities for its
residents.
Goal 3-1:        Establish and implement an overall strategy for the economic
                 development of Fowler.
Policies and Standards
1.      The City shall:
        a)       Maintain the downtown area as a community services, cultural, and office
                 center with specialty shops and office space.

                 problems with congestion.
2.      The City shall complete a targeting analysis to determine the types of businesses
        appropriate to Fowler in each identified commercial and industrial area. The target
        analysis should include evaluations of the following attraction strategies:
        a)       Focus on Fowler's central and regional location to attract distribution
                 oriented businesses serving surrounding communities.

3.      The City shall pursue a program of tax base expansion to include both industrial
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
        and market-area commercial uses. To this end, the City should:
        a)       Reserve sufficient space for industrial and commercial uses, recognizing
                 greater land requirements due to methods of operation and marketing
                 needs.
        b)       Provide an inventory of land with a variety of locations to avoid creating a
                 monopoly on the land market.
        c)       Develop policies and regulations to protect industrial and commercial
                 areas from incompatible uses.
4.      The City shall minimize the adverse environmental effects of industrial growth
        by recruiting industries which can reduce pollution impacts to acceptable levels;
        by locating industry in areas where growth will have the least impacts; and by
        requiring adequate buffering to protect adjacent land uses.
5.      The City shall use the redevelopment process as a tool to implement the General
        Plan and to revitalize the urban area. The primary purposes of redevelopment
        are to remove blighting influences; provide urban support services; and to
        rehabilitate and enhance residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional
        uses.
Goal 3-2.        Invest in necessary infrastructure and beautification to ensure success
                 of these strategies.
Policies and Standards
1.      The City shall establish incentive programs and seek resources for physical
        improvements of existing buildings, roads and other infrastructure, in particular
        the Merced Street corridor and the downtown area. These programs may
        include fast track development, deferral or waiver of fees, reimbursement of
        costs for improvements, and loans and grants for improvements.
2.      The City shall create a property database and contact program, including
        residential and commercial properties:
        a)       To identify the status of sites in critical commercial and industrial
_________________________________________________________________

                 existing business enterprises and new business opportunities.
Policies and Standards
1.      The City shall provide financial resources and leadership in stimulating business
        expansion. Specific goals should be stated regarding:
        a)       Annual community projects and events
        b)       Community marketing activities
        c)       Business recruitment
2.      The City shall review its business license fee policies and identify and resolve
        barriers to small business, home-based micro business owners and new
        entrepreneurs.
Goal 3-4:        Actively pursue the attraction of new commercial and industrial
                 businesses by implementing a community marketing program.
Policies and Standards
1.      The City shall actively work with the Five Cities Economic Development Joint
        Powers Authority, the California Office of Trade and Commerce, the Fresno
        County Economic Development Corporation, and others in order to focus
        collaboration on the development of a marketing plan, planning of industrial
        park space, and in reaching prospective businesses.
2.      The City shall develop a marking plan for reaching targeting businesses and
        industries. The marketing plan shall include targeting new business and
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
        industries as well as new or expanded consumer markets, and include specific
        promotional strategies for each.
3.      The City shall cooperate with other cities in the area in a unified effort to attract
        employment generating industry and commercial uses to the region.
Goal 3-5:        Establish a community-based organization for the planning and
                 implementation of economic development.
Policies and Standards
1.      City Staff. The City shall designate one key staff person to be the primary contact
        person for all economic development activities.
2.      Advisory Economic Development Committee. The City shall form an advisory
        economic development committee to be made up of residents, business owners
        and members of institutions within the community. The purpose of the
        committee will be to stimulate and evaluate the progress of economic
        development activities proposed in this plan.
3.      Land Owner Contact Program. The City shall establish a process to work with
        land owners and business owners and encourage their participation in
        implementing economic development goals and policies.

4.0     LAND USE ELEMENT
The Land Use Element is a guide to orderly development of the community and designates
the general distribution of land for housing, business, public buildings and grounds, and
other categories of public and private land use. The element also establishes standards of
population density and building intensity. The Land Use Map is shown on Figure 4-1.
4.1     Land Use and Public Facility Issues
Policies and Standards
1.      The community can expect a building rate of approximately 40% apartments in the
        coming years. The General Plan should designate new land for multi-family use
        while providing policy guidance on new multi-family location.
2.      There will be continued demand for shopping centers to meet total market area
        pressures and to satisfy new marketing trends. The downtown cannot satisfy these
        immediate needs, especially in terms of neighborhood/community shopping
        centers and service commercial uses. The downtown should continue to be the
        financial and cultural center of the City.
3.      Existing vacant land within the city limits lying generally between Highway 99 and
        Golden State Boulevard shall be planned for major new industrial, commercial,
        mixed-use, and public facility uses.
4.      An additional issue is the preservation of prime agricultural lands and the
        prevention of the premature conversion of such lands to urban uses. Even with
        diversification, agriculture will continue to an important component of the economy
        of Fowler and Fresno County.
5.      Fowler's downtown provides an opportunity for a variety of services, retail uses,
        offices, and limited housing. The unique character of the downtown provides a
        setting that lends itself to the development of an on-going improvement program.

4.2     General Plan and Zoning Consistency
Policies and Standards
1.      Land use density standards and compatibility with zoning shall be as shown in
        Table 5-1. Other zone districts may be determined to be consistent if a proposed use
        or density is allowed subject to approval of a Conditional Use Permit.
2.      The overall maximum density of the Plan Designation shall not be exceeded, except
        when a project is eligible for increased density as part of a Planned Unit
        Development or when a project meets the requirements of State Density Bonus Law.
        a)       Through the Conditional Use Permit process, residential density of part of a
                 site may exceed the maximum allowed if the entire project site density
                 conforms with the General Plan/Zoning Consistency Table.
3.      When a plan amendment is required, the amendment and consistent rezoning
        application shall be processed concurrently. For a plan amendment and/or rezoning
        request, the City Council may require submittal of a conceptual site plan or tentative
        tract map based on the need to protect adjacent land uses from impacts of the
        proposed use.
4.      The City shall update the Zoning Ordinance as appropriate to implement policies
        and proposals of the general plan.
5.      Where new residential development is proposed adjoining existing residential
        development of a lower zoning density, the developer shall be required to provide
        an architectural transition through the tentative tract map, site plan review, or
        Conditional Use Permit process. The transition may include such provisions as
        common lots sizes, building setbacks, landscaping, and masonry wall requirements
        to benefit existing and future residents. Adjacent to a planned major street (collector
        or arterial), back-on treatment, a solid masonry wall at least six feet in height, and
        landscaping adjacent to the roadway shall constitute an adequate transition for
        purposes of this section.

4.3     Residential Land Use
Policies and Standards
1.      Four residential categories are proposed that range in density from a maximum of
        three units per acre up to 21.8 units per acre. These categories are intended to
        identify areas which are acceptable for housing; clarify the overall type of housing to
        be developed within each category; and allow for a mixture of housing types, lot
        sizes and affordability.
        Each residential category includes a unit per acre minimum and maximum density
        specified in a range of units per gross acre. Units per gross acre is used because it is
        easier to understand and convey. Types of housing include single family units,
        multiple family units including duplexes and apartments, and mobile homes.
        a)       Low Density: 0 - 3.6 units per gross acre. This category is characterized by
                 larger lots for single family residential development. Minimum lot size
                 would be 10,000 square feet with lot sizes ranging from 10,000 to 12,000
                 square feet and larger. It is not envisioned that lots greater than one acre in
                 size would be appropriate within the City limits. The most compatible zone
                 districts are R-1-10 and R-1-12.
        b)       Medium Low Density: 3.7 - 5.5 units per gross acre. Housing is this density
                 range is typical of recent subdivisions built in Central Valley communities.
                 The intent of this classification is to provide locations for construction of
                 single-family homes with a minimum lot size of 7,000 square feet ranging to
                 10,000 square feet. Because housing at this density reaches the largest
                 residential market, it is expected to account for about half of all housing
                 added during the next twenty years. The most compatible zone district is R-
                 1-7.
        c)       Medium Density: 5.6 - 13.5 units per gross acre. This category recognizes that
                 small lot single family and low density multifamily units will make up an
                 increasing percentage of the City's housing stock. Lots as small as 5,000
                 square feet would be permitted. Mobile home parks and apartments within
                 this density range will meet the needs of many households without the
                 financial means or the desire to be homeowners. The most compatible zone
                 districts are R-1-5, R-1-6, R-1-7, R-2-A, and R-MP.
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
        d)       High Density: 13.6 - 21.8 units per gross acre. The High Density land use
                 category provides for the highest residential densities permitted in the City.
                 It is intended that this category utilize innovative site planning, provide
                 on-site recreation, and be located near major community facilities, business
                 centers and streets of at least collector capacity. Greater density for senior's
                 housing only may be achieved subject to a Conditional Use Permit. The most
                 compatible zone districts are R-2, R-3-A, and R-3.
2.      The maximum density indicated defines the number of units per gross acre that
        residential development can achieve within a given area. Residential development
        need not provide the minimum number of units per gross acre indicated to be found
        consistent with the General Plan. The minimum density figure, however, is intended
        to encourage the location of certain product types and densities consistent with
        adjacent land uses, access, public services, and environmental concerns.
3.      A planned unit development ordinance shall be developed which considers
        increased density at the discretion of the City. Granting of additional density (not to
        exceed 25%) will depend on the developer's demonstration of the quality of design
        in such areas as access, circulation, building placement, parking, provision of open
        space, and architectural design and compatibility with the surrounding area. A
        Conditional Use Permit and site plan review shall be required to insure the
        consistency of a proposed planned unit development with these principles.
4.      Planned unit developments may include any combination of single family and
        multifamily dwellings. Planned unit developments larger than 20 acres in size may
        also include related office and commercial uses.
5.      Mobile home parks may be consistent within areas designated Medium Density
        Residential and must consist of a unified, master planned development with a
        minimum site area of five acres, excluding public streets, and subject to provisions
        of the Fowler Zoning Ordinance.
6.      Manufactured and modular housing developments as alternative housing
        opportunities shall be permitted subject to existing ordinances.
7.      Residential uses at standards consistent with the R-2 zone district shall be permitted
        by Conditional Use Permit in the Community Commercial designation as part of a
        mixed-use concept.
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
8.      Multi-family residential development of 12 or more units per acre shall either have
        direct access to a major street or to a local street which does not pass through a
        single family area prior to intersecting a major street.
9.      Development standards for the interface between multi-family residential and
        single-family residential shall be as follows:
        a)       Outdoor recreational areas, game courts, pools, and solid waste collection
                 areas on multi-family properties shall be oriented away from adjacent
                 properties planned for single family residential.
        b)       Multi-family parking areas, garages, other structures, and access drives shall
                 be separated from adjacent properties planned for single family residential
                 with a landscaped setback containing deciduous and evergreen trees. A 10-
                 foot minimum transition is preferred but may be reduced depending on site
                 conditions. The transition may include such provisions as building setbacks,
                 landscaping and masonry wall requirements to benefit future residents.
        c)       Exterior area lighting for multi-family residential parking, carports, garages,
                 access drives, and outdoor recreation areas, shall be shielded to prevent line
                 of sight visibility of the light source from abutting property planned for
                 single-family residential.
        d)       Multi-family buildings greater than 20 feet in height shall be prohibited
                 within 25 feet of abutting property planned for single-family residential.
10.     Where new residential development is proposed adjoining existing commercial or
        industrial development, the residential developer shall be required to provide an
        architectural transition, including such provisions as building setbacks, landscaping
        and masonry wall requirements to benefit future residents.
11.     All utilities shall be underground and each residential unit or multifamily project
        shall be equipped for remote electronic utility meter reading.
12.     The developer shall provide front yard landscaping in all single family residential
        projects prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
13.     Varied front yard setbacks should be used within single family residential projects,
        wherever possible, to provide visual interest to the street scene. Buildings should be
        arranged in a staggered and variable setback fashion to provide visual interest and
        to avoid a repetitive appearance.
14.     Mechanical equipment should be ground mounted and screened from view by walls
        or fences similar in design to the building architecture or by plant material.
15.     Multifamily structures should be clustered to provide for maximum open space,
        when possible. Long, unbroken building facades are discouraged. Building massing
        that incorporates a combination of one-story and two-story elements with varied
        floor setbacks is encouraged.
16.     All residential projects shall provide usable open space within the boundaries of the
        development. This open space shall be in addition to any development fees paid for
        neighborhood or community park space.
        a)       Within multifamily projects, including mobile home parks, a minimum of
                 10% of the project site shall be developed with usable open space which
                 could include swimming pools, green space, landscaping, and
                 recreation/meeting rooms.
        b)       Within single family projects, either attached or detached, a minimum of 5%
                 of the project site shall be developed with usable open space which could
                 include common recreation areas, mini-parks, common green
                 belts/recreation trails, and landscaping. Such open space shall be maintained
                 by assessment district, landscape/lighting district, homeowners' association,
                 or other appropriate maintenance entity.
17.     In order to enhance the quality of development, all single family residential projects
        should be encouraged to provide such amenities as automatic garage door openers,
        trash compactors, built-in security systems, and outdoor electrical outlets.
4.4     Commercial Land Use
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
Policies and Standards
1.      Establish the following commercial land use designations:
        a)       Neighborhood Commercial. The neighborhood commercial designation
                 provides for a 10-acre or smaller cluster of commercial uses in the C-1 district
                 serving convenience and commercial needs, but also offering general
                 merchandise, variety, and specialty items. The neighborhood commercial
                 center is intended to serve the smaller market area surrounding the site.
        b)       Community Commercial. The community commercial designation provides
                 an activity center oriented towards the downtown as permitted in the C-2
                 district. The designation is also appropriate outside the downtown in
                 primary commercial districts where a range of retail, financial, governmental,
                 and entertainment activities occur. Community Commercial land use areas
                 outside the downtown should be developed as unified commercial centers,
                 except where the existing development pattern or parcelization makes it
                 impractical. Mixed use residential uses are also encouraged in Community
                 Commercial locations by Conditional Use Permit where appropriate.
        c)       General Commercial. This designation provides for commercial areas with a
                 wide range of retail and service activities along major traffic corridors as
                 permitted in the C-3 district. Highway commercial uses as permitted in the
                 C-H district are permitted at the interchange of major streets with Highway
                 99 and Golden State Boulevard and are intended to provide for
                 visitor-serving uses, including restaurants, lodging, and gasoline.
        d)       Office Commercial. This designation provides for office development as
                 permitted in the C-1 and C-2 zone districts. Commercial uses contemplated
                 as part of this category include business support services and support
                 restaurant and medical services.
2.      Locate new Neighborhood Commercial uses along major traffic ways in
        consolidated centers that utilize common access and parking for commercial uses,
        discourage the introduction of strip commercial uses, and require adequate
        pedestrian links to residential areas.
3.      Reserve the Community Commercial designation for the downtown and major
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
        community shopping areas in order to attract and accommodate growth which
        includes not only commercial uses, but financial, office, governmental, and limited
        residential development as well.
4.      Apply the General Commercial designation along arterial streets to provide
        commercial support for nearby communities, highway travelers, and industrial
        areas. General commercial includes freestanding uses which do not fit well in
        unified centers, as well as service and highway commercial uses.
5.      Provide Office designations which allow construction of new unified office centers,
        the redevelopment of existing areas to office use, and the conversion of older homes
        to offices along major streets. Homes converted to offices should be a logical
        extension of existing or planned office/commercial use, and the lot should be of
        adequate size for parking and circulation.
6.      The City will adopt provisions to improve commercial site planning standards to
        enhance appearance and preserve the integrity of nearby residential areas. Design
        standards should relate to architectural design in keeping with the surrounding
        neighborhood, signage, and landscaping.
7.      Ensure that all commercial uses contribute to the resolution of traffic and parking
        impacts created by additional traffic demands generated by those businesses.
8.      Encourage the upgrading, beautifying and revitalization of existing strip
        commercial areas and shopping centers.
9.      A minimum of 10% of the surface area of all commercial developments shall be
        landscaped. Trees shall be planted within the parking lot such that a minimum of
        50% of the parking lot is shaded by tree canopies when fully grown.
4.5     Downtown Fowler
The downtown commercial core follows Merced Street and extends one to two blocks north
and south of Merced Street between Golden State Boulevard and 4th Streets. While the City
has created retail opportunities elsewhere, the downtown still provides a viable retail
environment. For the downtown to regain its vitality, however, it may be necessary that
the City adopt policies to ensure a level playing field.
It is not practical for the downtown to house major retailers, but it is possible for the
downtown to continue in its role as a provider of professional offices, residential uses,
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
churches, and specialty retail functions, including restaurants, banks, and cultural facilities.
 Downtown Fowler is vital to the City's long-term economic and social well-being. While
downtown economic development is important, the area's identity and image as the heart
of Fowler is equally significant.
Policies
1.      Future development should enhance the vitality of the downtown as a focused
        commercial, office, banking and cultural center of the community while maintaining
        a mix of commercial and residential uses. Office, cultural facilities, and banking
        uses should be limited to the downtown rather than in other areas of the
        community. A Specific Plan is recommended to guide development and apply
        design standards where desirable.
2.      The City shall use the redevelopment process as a tool to implement the General
        Plan and to revitalize the urban area. The primary purposes of redevelopment are to
        remove blighting influences; provide urban support services; and to rehabilitate and
        enhance existing uses. In particular, a facade improvement program should be
        developed and off-street parking provided.
3.      The City shall establish incentive programs and seek resources for physical
        improvements of existing buildings, roads, and other infrastructure. The City shall
        also encourage private investment in the downtown through formation of such
        groups as a Business Owners Association or Downtown Improvement Group.
4.      The Community Commercial designation is applied to the downtown. Commercial
        uses should be typical of a city=s core area, including apparel stores, restaurants,
        specialty shops, entertainment uses, bookstores, travel agencies, bed and breakfasts,
        financial institutions, and other similar uses serving a community-wide market and
        the daytime downtown employment population.
5.      The City shall implement a streetscape revitalization program to improve upon the
        existing streetscape. This program also aims to enhance 5th, 6th, and 7th Streets north
        and south of Merced. Recommended improvements include streetscape furnishings
        such as upgraded light fixtures, benches, and trash receptacles; revitalization of
        downtown buildings and facades; wall murals and other public art; seasonal
        decorations, and continued use of banners that advertise community events.
4.6     Industrial Land Use
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
Policies and Standards
1.      Establish the following industrial land use designations:
        a)       Light Industrial. This category establishes light industrial areas where uses
                 such as fabricating, assembly, research and development, electronics, low
                 intensity warehousing and other such similar industrial uses are appropriate.
                 All work, materials, and equipment storage is generally conducted indoors.
                 Special landscaping, enclosures and other site development standards are
                 appropriate. Industrial park development is intended on larger parcels to
                 create distinct districts of industrial, office, and support uses. The M-1 and
                 M-P districts are most consistent with this designation.
        b)       Heavy Industrial. The heavy industrial category allows those uses which
                 require exposed or unenclosed processing and storage of uncovered
                 materials or equipment. The designation provides for manufacturing,
                 fabrication, processing, assembling, wholesale and storage uses, trucking
                 terminals, and quasi-public and utility services structures and facilities. The
                 M-2 designation in most consistent with this designation.
2.      Make public facilities available to planned industrial sites in accordance with the
        city-wide set of capital improvement priorities.
3.      Ensure that industrial development creates no significant off-site impacts
        concerning access and circulation, noise, dust, odors, visual features, and hazardous
        materials that cannot be adequately mitigated.
4.      Major streets which pass through industrial areas and serve as entrances to the City
        shall receive special design treatment to reduce aesthetic impacts and traffic
        concerns. Measures for industrially zoned parcels shall be as follows:
        a)       The minimum building setback from the right-of-way line shall be 40 feet.
        b)       There shall be a minimum 10-foot landscaped area adjacent to the
                 right-of-way.
        c)       Efforts should be made to consolidate driveways along common property
                 boundaries, where possible.

        cafeterias, child care and business support services that reduce the need for vehicle
        trips.
6.      Appropriate truck routes shall be designated serving the industrial areas which
        promote direct access and are functionally adequate.
7.      Industrial land in close proximity to residential areas shall be planned for light
        industry.
8.      Development standards between industrial properties and residential uses shall be
        as follows:
        a)       On properties planned for industry, a landscaped setback 20 feet wide
                 containing deciduous and evergreen trees shall be planted and maintained
                 along the property line with abutting property planned for residential uses
                 and along abutting local streets.
        b)       Roof-mounted and detached mechanical equipment shall be acoustically
                 baffled to prevent equipment noise from exceeding 55 dBA measured at the
                 nearest residential property line.
        c)       Exterior area lighting for industrial buildings, parking areas, garages, access
                 drives, and loading areas, shall be low profile, hooded, and directed away
                 from abutting property planned for residential use.
9.      The City shall request that Fresno County refer all proposals for industrial
        development located within the City=s Sphere of Influence to the City for
        annexation. In cases where annexation is not feasible, the City may request that the
        County attach conditions of approval to such applications to insure that the
        development will conform to City standards, will agree to annex when feasible, and
        will not be detrimental to future urban development.
4.7     Open Space, Public, and Institutional Land Use
Policies and Standards
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
1.      Establish the following public facility land uses:
        a)       Agriculture. This designation provides sites for permanent agriculture, as
                 well as areas reserved for long-term urbanization.
        b)       Parks and Open Space. This designation determines areas of permanent open
                 spaces, parks and/or areas precluded from major development.
        c)       Public Facilities. This designation indicates areas owned and maintained by
                 public or institutional agencies such as facilities owned by the city, schools,
                 hospitals, and other facilities.

        processed as conditional uses.
8.      Consider seismic and public safety concerns in the environmental review process.
9.      Ensure that disaster planning for the City of Fowler includes policies appropriate to
        problems associated with hazardous wastes.
Public and Institutional Land Use
10.     Develop park space based on a standard of 3.0 acres/1,000 residents (2.0 acres for
        neighborhood parks and 1.0 acre for community parks).
11.     The recreation needs of all age groups shall be considered.
12.     Recreation sites shall be central and accessible to the population served.
13.     Established development priorities are:

                 new annexations.
        2.       Improve existing neighborhood parks.
        3.       Develop a new 15 to 30-acre community park and special recreation facilities.
        4.       These priorities will guide preparation of the parks portion of the City's
                 annual capital improvement program. The precise scheduling of park
                 projects will be influenced by financial conditions that change from year to
                 year.
14.     Cooperative park development programs shall be encouraged on a cost-sharing
        basis. Joint -power agreements between the City, the Fowler Unified School District,
        Fresno County, and other agencies may be developed to provide for the acquisition
        and/or development and operation of parks. Specifically, the City shall develop
        joint-use facilities, where feasible, with the Fowler Unified School District and
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
        continue to use school sites for City recreation programs.
15.     Locations for future park sites are schematic and may be located on any suitable
        lands in the general vicinity. The underlying designation for park sites shall be
        Medium Density Residential with consistent zoning as R-1-6.

        require the subdivider to dedicate the park area and prepare plans for its phased
        development.
17.     The City shall cooperate with the Fowler Unified School District in the location of
        new schools. Locations for future school sites are schematic and may be located on
        any suitable lands in the general vicinity. The underlying designation for school
        sites shall be Medium Density Residential with consistent zoning as R-1-6.
18.     If a subdivision, site plan, general plan amendment, or rezoning is proposed on land
        designated for potential park or school use, prior to entitlement, permits or other
        approvals, the City Council shall determine the feasibility of accelerating public
        acquisition of the property. If the City Council determines that acquisition of the
        property will not occur within one year, the processing of the development plan
        may proceed.

        Department to house personnel and equipment in the downtown area.
21.     The City shall work to provide a relocated corporation yard with adequate room for
        expansion.
5.0     Circulation Element
The purpose of the Circulation Element is to provide for a safe, convenient and efficient
transportation system. The Circulation Element has been designed to accommodate
anticipated transportation needs based on the land use element. In compliance with state
law, all city and county general plans must contain a circulation element that designates
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
future road improvements and extensions, addresses non-motorized transportation
alternatives, and identifies funding options. The intent of the Element is to:
C       identify transportation needs and issues within the City, as well as regional
        relationships that affect the transportation system;
C       consider alternatives other than the single-occupant vehicle as essential in providing
        services and access to facilities; and
C       establish policies that coordinate regional transportation planning circulation
        system with General Plan and area plan land use maps and provide direction for
        future decision-making.
The transportation system within the Fowler planning area includes State Route (SR) 99 as
well as numerous City and County routes. The public transit system includes public transit
services, and within the County it includes common bus carriers, AMTRAK and other local
agency transit and paratransit services. In addition, the County transportation system
includes general aviation facilities, air passenger facilities, freight rail service, bicycle
facilities.
5.1      Regional Transportation Planning
Fresno County Regional Transportation Plan. The Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) is a
multi-modal, long-range planning document prepared by the Council of Fresno County
Governments (Fresno COG). The RTP includes programs and policies for congestion
management, transit, bicycles and pedestrians, roadways, freight, and finances for Fresno
County. The RTP is prepared every three years and contains a listing of projects believed to
be financially feasible within the 25-year planning time frame. Federally funded projects
must be consistent with and reflected in the RTP.
San Joaquin Valley Air Quality Management Plan. The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution
Control District (SJVAPCD) has prepared the Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) and
various other regulations to reduce air emissions.
Fresno County Intelligent Transportation System Strategic Plan. The Fresno County ITS
Strategic Plan contains goals and policies to improve mobility and enhance safety within
the region. Nine core ITS components include Freeway Management; Transit Management;
Incident Management; Electronic Fare Payment; Electronic Toll Collection; Railroad Grade
Crossings; Emergency Management Services; and Regional Multimodal Traveler
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
Information. The Plan can also be used to assist the City with application for federal or
State funding for specific types of ITS projects.
Measure “C”. Measure AC@ is the half-percent sales tax for transportation passed by Fresno
County in 1986 and managed by the Fresno County Transportation Authority (FCTA). The
Measure provides funding for transportation projects (highway, transit, and ridesharing)
over 20-years. Measure C funds are used by Fowler to repair streets and improve the
existing and planned transportation system. The Measure C program will sunset in
2006/07. The extension of Measure C by the voters will be a significant factor in the
availability of future funding for the City.
5.2     Existing Transportation Conditions
Street and Highway System. Functional classification is the process by which streets and
highways are grouped into classes according to the type of service they provide. Streets
and highways are classified according to their primary function and consist of five basic
classifications:
C       State Highways
C       Expressways
C       Arterials
C       Collectors
C       Local Streets
Public/Mass Transportation System. The private automobile is the dominant mode of
travel within the City. As the population grows, City roads will become increasingly
congested. As a result, it is important to encourage public transit systems and increased
use of alternative modes of transportation, including bicycles and walking. The public
transit system alternatives for the City include fixed route public transit systems, common
bus carriers, and other local agency transit and paratransit services.
_________________________________________________________________

Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
The Fresno County Rural Transit Agency (FCRTA) was formed through a joint-powers
agreement between Fresno County and the incorporated cities within its service area.
FCRTA operates fixed-route services that link communities with each other and with the
Fresno-Clovis Metropolitan Area. FCRTA=s fixed routes connect all the cities and
unincorporated communities in Fresno County, including the City of Fowler. FCRTA
vehicles are wheelchair accessible and all full size buses include bike racks. FCRTA
supports a number of specialized transportation programs, including shared-ride car and
vanpool services, social service dial-a-ride, and specialized services for seniors and persons
with disabilities.
Paratransit services are transportation services such as car pooling, van pooling, taxi
service, and dial-a-ride programs. The City supports reliable and efficient paratransit
service by encouraging development of service systems that satisfy the transit needs of the
elderly and physically disabled.
AMTRAK. The only AMTRAK station located in Fresno County is in the City of Fresno
providing AMTRAK service to points north including San Francisco and Sacramento and
to points south including Bakersfield and Los Angeles.
High Speed Rail Authority. The High-Speed Rail Authority (HSRA) has determined that
high-speed rail is technically, environmentally and economically feasible once constructed,
and would be operationally self-sufficient. The Authority=s purpose is to fund and
construct the high-speed rail system throughout California. The HSRA recently identified
the SR 99 corridor as the preferred corridor for high-speed rail services with a station in
Downtown Fresno and in Visalia adjacent to SR 99.
Aviation. Fresno Yosemite International Airport (FYI) is Fresno County=s primary
passenger airport facility and the largest and busiest airport in the San Joaquin Valley.
Public-use general aviation airports located near Fowler include Fresno Chandler
Downtown Airport, Reedley Municipal Airport, and the Selma Aerodrome.
Bikeways and Pedestrian Facilities
Investment in bikeways provides an inexpensive environment-friendly transportation
opportunity. Bicycling is considered an effective alternative mode of transportation that
can help to improve air quality and reduce the number of vehicles traveling along existing
highways, especially within the cities and unincorporated communities. However, the
numbers of cyclists is small in comparison to the amount of auto traffic.
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, signals, lighting, and benches, among other items.
With such facilities, people are more likely to walk rather take a vehicle. Pedestrian
facilities near schools and recreational facilities enhance the safety of those who choose to
walk.
Truck Routes and Air Cargo
As industrial and economic growth occurs in the City, industrial-related truck traffic will
continue to increase. It is anticipated that the region=s truck volumes will increase by 40%
to the year 2025. Designated truck routes may be used for trucks in excess of the weight
designated in the City Ordinance for movement through the City. Truck movements for
local deliveries may use the most direct route to the particular delivery location, including
local streets.
Air cargo is the fastest growing method of transporting goods in and out of the Central
Valley and is expected to continue to increase at a faster rate than passenger air service.
The Fresno Yosemite International Airport is the major cargo-handling airport in the
Central Valley.
The Union Pacific Railroad provides freight service in Fowler, connecting the City with
major markets in northern and southern California. It is likely that the predominant mode
for freight movements in the County will continue to be by truck in the foreseeable future.
This is certainly the trend expected for raw agricultural commodities moving to packing
and processing facilities such as those produced in Fowler.
5.3     Transportation Management
Transportation Demand Management. Transportation demand management (TDM)
strategies reduce dependence on the single-occupant vehicle, increase the ability of the
existing transportation system to carry more people, and enhance mobility along congested
corridors. Examples of these strategies include telecommuting, flexible work hours, and
electronic commerce that enable people to work and shop from home. According to Fresno
COG, vanpools will become more prevalent for short-to-medium range commute trips, and
will supplement the traditional long-distance usage. Park-n-ride facilities and carpooling
will also continue to be a significant link between highway and transit modes.
Goods Movement. The ability of Fowler and Fresno County to compete domestically and
internationally on an economic basis requires an efficient and cost-effective method for
distributing and receiving products. The City of Fowler provides a key link in this system
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
within its proximity to SR 99.
5.4    Circulation Issues
1.     The current street system functions adequately but does contain some areas of
       concern such as the need to widen segments of several streets and the need to
       improve Merced Street between Highway 99 and the downtown.
2.     Major streets in the City are of varying rights-of-way and consistent standards have
       been difficult to apply. While most future roadways need be no more than two travel
       lanes to accommodate expected traffic to 2025, wider rights-of-way may be needed
       for traffic beyond the planning period to safely handle increased truck traffic, or to
       allow restricted turn movements into developed areas or at intersections.
3.     Fowler's truck route system requires continued monitoring to reflect new growth
       areas. Such marked routes are advisory to the trucking industry and can also be
       enforced by local government.
4.     The need for improvement of the Merced Street/SR 99 Interchange to accommodate
       growth and development through to the year 2025.
5.     The need for a possible grade separation of Manning Avenue at the Union Pacific rail
       line. The need for the grade separation should be considered as traffic volumes
       along Manning increase over time.
1.      The Cities of Fowler, Selma, and Kingsburg, Caltrans and Fresno County are
        coordinating development of a specific plan to address land use and access issues
        along Golden State Boulevard between American Avenue north of Fowler to the
        Fresno/Tulare County Line in Kingsburg. Potential new commercial development
        in the vicinity of the Merced and Golden State intersection will be of special concern
        to the City during preparation of the Specific Plan.
7.     Potential safety issues associated will need to be addressed over time to insure that
       pedestrian access to schools is provided with a high degree of safety.
5.5    Goals, Policies and Standards
The intent of the Circulation Element is to establish a comprehensive multi-modal
transportation system that is efficient, environmentally and financially sound, and
coordinated with the Land Use Element.
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
Goal 5-1:        Design and implement a multi-modal transportation system that will serve
                 projected future travel demand, minimize congestion, and address future
                 growth in the City.
Policies and Standards:
1.     Utilize existing infrastructure and utilities to the maximum extent practical and
       provide for the logical, timely, and economically efficient extension of infrastructure
       and services.
2.     Cooperate with local, regional, State and federal agencies to establish an efficient
       transportation system.
Goal 5-2:        Provide a well-planned, designed, constructed and maintained street and
                 highway system that facilitates the movement of vehicles and provides
                 safe and convenient access to surrounding developments.
Policies and Standards:
1.     Designate streets according to the following functional classifications:
       a)        Freeways carry regional traffic through the community with access only at
                 interchanges with major streets.
       b)        Expressways connect regional destinations on the non-freeway system and
                 generally pass through several jurisdictions. Traffic carrying capacity is
                 maintained through access control at 2 mile intervals.
       c)        Arterials serve as the principal network for cross-town traffic flow. They
                 connect areas of major traffic generation within the urban area and connect
                 with important county roads and state highways. They also provide for the
                 distribution and collection of through traffic to and from collector and local
                 streets.
       d)        Collectors provide for traffic movement between arterial and local streets,
                 traffic movement within and between neighborhoods and major activity
                 centers, and limited direct access to abutting properties.
_________________________________________________________________
Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
       e)        Local streets provide direct access to abutting properties and for localized
                 traffic movements within residential, commercial and industrial areas.
2.     Apply consistent standards for new development based on traffic carrying capacity
       and classification.
       a)        Expressways shall be developed with a minimum right-of-way of 100 feet, to
                 include four to six travel lanes and access restricted to 2 -mile intervals.
       b)        Arterials shall be developed with a minimum right-of-way of 80 feet, to
                 include four travel lanes, parking, and a center median (either raised or
                 painted).
       c)        Collectors are designed to have a 72 to 80-foot right-of-way width that allows
                 four lanes undivided with parking, or two lanes with a two-way continuous
                 left turn center lane.
        d)       Local streets shall have a minimum 60-foot right-of-way with two travel
                 lanes and parking. Local streets may be reduced in width when it can be
                 demonstrated that projected traffic flows can be accommodated. Local
                 public streets should not be reduced to less than 32 feet between curbs.
3.     Designated streets and recommended rights-of-way are:
       a) Freeway                                                             Right-of-way

4.     Standards for new street development can be altered or refined where it can be
       demonstrated that projected traffic flows can be accommodated. Alternative
       standards for major streets include 1) an 84-foot arterial without a raised median
       island; and 2) a 72-foot collector to contain two travel lanes and a continuous dual
       left-turn lane.
6.     Encourage a Level of Service (LOS) "C" throughout the local circulation network,
       with an LOS "D" along SR 99. An exception to the local road standard is that LOS
       “D” may be allowed at intersections of major streets, at SR 99 interchanges, and
       along street segments where additional improvements are not feasible.
7.     Make intersection improvements to the existing major street system selectively
       through traffic engineering solutions rather than major structural improvements.
       This could include signalization, intersection channelization, use of directional signs,
       and diversion of traffic onto under-utilized streets.
8.     Require residential developments along arterials to back-on to such streets (with
       ornamental fencing, landscaping and waiver of access), or provide frontage roads
       with limited points of access to the street. “Open ended cul-de-sacs” to major streets
       are also encouraged for pedestrian access.
9.     Discourage direct access to collector streets from residential areas except where
       physical circumstances do not allow other design solutions.
10.    Develop street patterns for interior streets within new subdivisions to protect
_________________________________________________________________

Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
       neighborhoods from the intrusion of through traffic.
11.    Driveway access to major activity centers, including multifamily development,
       should be located no closer than 200 feet to the intersection of a collector or arterial
       street.
12.    The distance between commercial driveways on arterial streets should be not less
       than 400 feet. Where practical and desirable, commercial driveways should be
       located on adjacent collector streets rather than on arterial streets.
13.    Existing points of ingress and egress shall be consolidated whenever possible.
       Driveway consolidation for new development shall be encouraged through access
       agreements along arterials.
14.    Ingress and egress to shopping centers should minimize left-turn movements into
       and out of parking or loading areas.
15.    The City reserves the right to reduce the ultimate right-of-way for arterials and
       collectors to avoid disrupting existing development by constructing a travelway that
       generally meets the street classification standards.
16.    Adjacent parking areas for large commercial and industrial developments should be
       designed to allow interconnection and flow of traffic between these facilities. Access
       easements and agreements should be obtained during the development process.
17.    Traffic signals should be placed at no closer than ¼-mile intervals on arterials and
       collectors unless conditions warrant additional signalization to improve traffic flow.
18.    Require private developers to be primarily responsible for the improvement of
       streets and highways to developing commercial, industrial, and residential areas.
       These may include road construction or widening, installation of turning lanes and
       traffic signals, and the improvement of any drainage facility or other auxiliary facility
       necessary for the safe and efficient movement of traffic or the protection of road
       facilities.
19.    Require private and public land developments to provide all on-site and off-site
       facility improvements necessary to mitigate any development-generated circulation
       impacts. The City may require applicants to provide traffic impact studies prepared
       by qualified professionals to identify the impacts of a development and necessary
       mitigation measures.

20.    Require dedication of necessary rights-of-way as part of the land division and land
       use review processes.
21.    Consider the use of traffic calming techniques in the design of new local streets
       where such techniques will improve safety and manage traffic flow.
22.    Provide a street network with quick and efficient routes for emergency vehicles,
       meeting necessary street widths, turn around radius, and other factors as determined
       by the City Engineer in consultation with the Fire Department and other emergency
       service providers.
23.    Restrict on-street parking to reduce traffic congestion and improve safety in
       appropriate locations.

 Goal 5-4:       Provide safe and convenient pedestrian access between residential
                 neighborhoods, parks, open space, and schools that service those
                 neighborhoods.
Policies and Standards:
       Provide a safe walking environment for pedestrians.
        a)       Subdivision layouts should include safe and pleasant designs which promote
                 pedestrian access to arterials and collectors and consider the location of
                 community services, such as schools, parks and neighborhood shopping
                 activity centers in the accessibility of their design for all persons.
        b)       Require the installation of sidewalks as an integral part of all street
                 construction where appropriate.
       c)        Require street lighting within the rights-of-way of all public streets.
       d)        Include pedestrian signal indicators as an integral part of the installation of
                 traffic signals.
2.     Maximize visibility and access for pedestrians and encourage the removal of barriers
       (walls, easements, and fences) for safe and convenient movement of pedestrians.
       Special emphasis should be placed on the needs of disabled persons considering
       ADA regulations.
3.     Plan for pedestrian access consistent with road design standards while designing
       street and road projects. Provisions for pedestrian paths or sidewalks and timing of
       traffic signals to allow safe pedestrian street crossing shall be included.
4.     Collaborate with the Fowler Unified School District to ensure that school children
       have adequate transportation routes available, such as a local pedestrian or bike
       paths, or local bus service.
5.     Encourage safe pedestrian walkways within commercial, office, industrial,
       residential, and recreational developments that comply with the Americans with
       Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.

6.     Coordinate with transit operators to ensure that pedestrian facilities are provided
       along and/or near transit routes, whenever feasible. New land developments may
       be required to provide pedestrian facilities due to existing or future planned transit
       routes even if demand for a pedestrian facility is not otherwise warranted.
7.     Review all existing roadways without pedestrian facilities when they are considered
       for improvements (whether maintenance or upgrade) to determine if new pedestrian
       facilities are warranted. New roadways should also be assessed for pedestrian
       facilities.
Goal 5-5:        Ensure the provision of adequate off-street parking for all land uses.
Policies and Standards:
1.     Require all new development to provide adequate off-street parking based on
       expected parking needs.
2.     Provide adequate loading areas within off-street parking areas for all commercial
       and manufacturing land uses.
3.     Anticipate parking needs at proposed and expected activity centers, particularly
       downtown.
Goal 5-6: Provide landscaping to improve the aesthetics of transportation system routes.
Policies and Standards:
1.     Encourage Caltrans to install and maintain landscaping and other mitigation
       elements along SR 99 especially adjacent to residential or other noise sensitive uses.
2.     Encourage the use of drought-tolerant native plants and the use of recycled water for
       roadway landscaping.
3.     Require parking areas of all commercial and industrial land uses that abut residential
       areas to be buffered and shielded by adequate landscaping.

Goal 5-7:        Provide access (driveways, local streets, and private roads) to the City's
                 street and highway system to reduce conflicts that can result from
                 pedestrian traffic and motorized traffic.
Policies and Standards:
1.     Limit access points and intersections of streets and highways based on the road’s
       General Plan classification and function. Access points must be located a sufficient
       distance away from major intersections to allow for safe, efficient operation.
2.     Require that the automobile and truck access of commercial and industrial land uses
       abutting residential parcels be located at the maximum practical distance from the
       nearest residential parcels to minimize noise impacts.
Goal 5-8:        Provide a transportation system that is integrated with adjacent
                 jurisdictions.
Policies and Standards:
1.     Continue to support Golden State Boulevard as a secondary route connecting the
       Kingsburg-Selma-Fowler corridor.
2.     Cooperate with adjacent communities and Fresno County to improve the principal
       gateways to Fowler (Golden State Boulevard, Manning, Adams, and Fowler) to
       facilitate the movement of traffic into and out of the City.
3.     Coordinate local transportation planning with preparation of the Fresno County
       Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) to ensure eligibility for state and federal funding.
        The RTP and the Fresno County Short- and Long-Range Transit Plans are
       incorporated by reference in the Circulation Element.
4.      Encourage the active participation of Caltrans in the design of highway capital
       improvement projects.
5.      Collaborate with Fresno County to integrate right-of-way and improvement
        standards for roads that cross jurisdictional boundaries. For development outside
        the City’s boundaries, but within the Sphere of Influence, City and County staff will
        cooperate and agree on reasonable design standards and negotiate logical
        transitions from City to County Standards.
_________________________________________________________________

Fowler General Plan
Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
        In general, for such development under County jurisdiction but within the Sphere of
        Influence, City Standards should apply if annexation would logically occur in the
        short to intermediate range. Where annexation seems doubtful in the long-term,
        County Standards should apply.
Goal 5-9:        Ensure that the future transportation system is financially supported and
                 can be adequately maintained.
Policies and Standards:
1.     Distribute the costs of transportation system improvements equitably among those
       who will benefit.
2.     Use annexations, development agreements, revenue sharing agreements, tax
       allocation agreements and the CEQA process as tools to ensure that new
       development pays a fair share of costs to provide local and regional transportation
       improvements and to mitigate cumulative traffic impacts.
3.     Prepare a Capital Improvement Program (CIP) that establishes improvement
       priorities and scheduling for transportation project construction over a period of 5 to
       7 years that will be reviewed and updated annually.
4.     Participate in the establishment of regional traffic mitigation fees and/or benefit
       districts to be assessed on new development. The fees shall cover a reasonable share
       of the costs of providing local and subregional transportation improvements needed
       for serving new development.
5.     Seek all available means to finance improvements, including State and Federal
       grants, to ensure that a non-motorized system is implemented.
Goal 5-10:       Encourage the use of public/mass transportation services to reduce reliance
                 on the automobile.
Policies and Standards:
1.     Encourage transit alternatives to meet the basic transportation needs of the young,
       the elderly, the disabled, and people without access to an automobile.

Land Use, Economic Development and Circulation Elements
                 transit modes would connect.
       b)        Encourage and provide for ride sharing, park and ride, and other similar
                 energy saving and air emission reduction programs.
2.     Planning and development of arterial and collector streets shall include design
       features where appropriate that can be used as future public transit stops.
3.     Support the expansion and improvement of transit systems and ride sharing
       programs to reduce the production of automobile emissions.
4.     Support the use of alternate fuel vehicles and fueling stations for City and County
       vehicles and public transit vehicles.
5.     Support transit operators’ programs to increase transit usage.
6.     Support all operator efforts to maximize revenue sources for short and long range
       transit needs that utilize all funding mechanisms available including federal grants,
       state enabling legislation, and farebox revenue. This can be accomplished through
       Fresno COG and the Fresno County Rural Transit Agency (FCRTA) through the
       development of the Short and Long Range Transit Plans.
7.     Support programs developed by transit agencies/operators to provide paratransit
       service.
8.     Incorporate the potential for public transit service in the design of major trip
       attractors (i.e. community centers and employment centers).
9.     Support continued improvements to AMTRAK rail passenger service within Fresno
       County and throughout the San Joaquin Valley.
Goal 5-11:       Provide efficient goods movement through proposed rail facilities, the
                 designation of truck routes and the provision of grade separations to
                 reduce rail/roadway conflicts.
Policies and Standards:
1.     Encourage the efficient movement of goods and people by rail through a shift of a
       portion of the goods previously moved by trucks onto the rail freight system.
2.     Implement street and highway projects to provide convenient and economical goods

       movement in areas with large concentrations of truck traffic.
3.     Identify street and highway improvement and maintenance projects that will
       improve goods movement and implement projects that are economically feasible.
Goal 5-12:       Provide facilities for non-motorized modes of transportation that enhance
                 the livability and character of the City.
Policies and Standards:
1.     Use the following definitions in designating a bikeways plan:
       a)        Bike Path (Class I). A pathway for the exclusive use of bicycles separated
                 from motor vehicle facilities by space or a barrier, identified by signing and
                 pavement markings.
       b)        Bike Lane (Class II). A signed, striped lane on a roadway for use by bicycles,
                 usually located on the edge of the pavement or between the parking lane and
                 the first motor vehicle lane.
       c)        Bike Route (Class III). A recommended route for bicycles that is signed but
                 not striped.
       d)        Bikeway. All facilities that provide for bicycles. The planned bikeway system
                 is shown on Figure 5-3.
2.     Give priority to bikeways that will serve the highest concentration of cyclists and
       destination areas of highest demand.
3.     Provide bikeways in proximity to major traffic generators such as commercial
       centers, schools, recreational areas, and major public facilities.
4.     Develop a visually clear, simple, and consistent bicycle system with standard signs
       and markings, as designated by the State of California Traffic Control Devices
       Committee and the State Bikeway Committee.
5.     Support installation of bike parking at public and private places of assembly such as
       parks, schools, office buildings, churches, and retail commercial developments.

6.      Amend the zoning ordinance to include provisions for bicycle parking facilities in
        off-street parking requirements.
7.      Develop a comprehensive bikeway system as an incentive for increased bicycle use.
        Give priority to bike routes that link local routes with planned regional facilities.
8.     Provide non-motorized alternatives for commuter travel as well as recreational
       opportunities.
9.      Develop a multi-purpose recreational bikeway network and support facilities.
10.     Provide separate rights-of-way for non-motorized facilities whenever economically
        and physically feasible.
11.     Develop bikeways in compliance with standards in the Caltrans Highway Design
        Manual or other appropriate standards.
Goal 5-13:       Design, construct, and operate the transportation system in a manner that
                 maintains a high level of environmental quality.
Policies and Standards:
1.      Control dust and mitigate other environmental impacts during all stages of roadway
        construction.
2.      Protect City residents from transportation generated noise. Increased setbacks,
        walls, landscaped berms, other sound-absorbing barriers, or a combination thereof
        shall be provided along major roadways where appropriate in order to protect
        adjacent noise-sensitive land uses from traffic-generated noise impacts.
        Additionally, noise generators such as commercial or industrial activities shall use
        these techniques to mitigate exterior noise levels .
3.      Review and monitor proposals for expansion of pipelines for the transport of
        suitable products and materials, and require mitigation of environmental impacts.
        In particular, require mitigation of the potential for hazardous chemical or gas

4.      Encourage the use of non-polluting vehicles for both public and private uses.
5.      Include noise mitigation measures in the design of new roadway projects.
Goal 5-14:      Support the use of Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies
                 to reduce dependence on the single-occupant vehicle, increase the ability
                 of the existing transportation system to carry more people, and enhance
                 mobility along congested corridors.
Policies and Standards:
1.      New development shall consider Transportation System Management and
        Transportation Demand Management as strategies for the mitigation of traffic and
        parking congestion. Public transit, traffic management, ride sharing and parking
        management are to be used to the greatest extent practical to implement
        transportation management strategies.
2.      Coordinate with Caltrans, Fresno COG, transit agencies and other responsible
        agencies to identify the need for additional park-n-ride facilities along major
        commuter travel corridors.
Goal 5-15:       Utilize Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to improve the safety and
                 performance of the surface transportation system using new technology in
                 detection, communication, computing, and traffic control.
Policies and Standards:
1.      Encourage the integration of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) consistent
        with the principles and recommendations referenced in the Fresno County ITS
        Strategic Plan as the transportation system is implemented.
