INTRODUCTION
                                                                                         1
OVERVIEW
The Newark General Plan is a comprehensive statement of the goals, policies, and
actions that will guide future growth and conservation in the city. It provides a vision
for Newark’s future and a strategy for achieving that vision. The Plan is intended to
help Newark respond to changes in technology, transportation, demographics, the
environment, and the economy during the coming decades. It strives to preserve the
things that matter the most to Newark residents while proactively shaping the city’s
future.
The General Plan is long-range, looking 20 to 25 years forward. However, it also
includes the provisions necessary to guide short- and mid-term decisions. It is a
legally binding document that provides the foundation for zoning, development
review, the capital improvements program, housing programs, and other City
activities. The Plan is flexible enough to respond to new trends and unexpected
changes, but specific enough to provide residents, businesses, and civic leaders with
guidance for how individual properties should be used and managed in the future.
The Plan contains Newark’s official policies on land use, transportation, housing,
natural resources, parks, environmental hazards, economic development, public
health, and community services. It also addresses Newark’s relationship to the rest of
the Bay Area. While the Plan’s focus is local, it addresses an array of issues that
extend beyond City boundaries.
The General Plan derives its authority from Section 65302 of the California
Government Code. The Government Code identifies the mandatory elements of the
Plan and indicates how these elements are to be prepared in a way that meets the
specific needs of each city and county in the state. The Plan’s content is further
directed by guidelines prepared by the California Office of Planning and Research.
Once adopted, the General Plan will be used by the Planning Commission and City
Council to evaluate proposed land use changes and local budget decisions. It will be
                                                                                           I-1

I N T R O D U C T I O N
                                  used by City staff to evaluate development proposals and structure the delivery of
                                  local services. It can be used by private citizens to make investment decisions and to
                                  understand the City’s plans for different areas.
                                  FORMAT OF THE GENERAL PLAN
                                  The General Plan consists of officially adopted maps and accompanying text. The text
                                  is organized to satisfy the requirements of state planning law, but has been tailored
                                  to address issues and opportunities unique to Newark. Chapters 1 and 2 of the Plan
                                  provide an introduction and set the context for the chapters that follow. Chapters 3
                                  through 10 correspond to the state-mandated General Plan Elements and a number
                                  of optional elements as follows:
                                  Newark General Plan                                   State-Mandated Element
                                  Chapter 3: Land Use                                   Land Use
                                  Chapter 4: Transportation                             Circulation
                                  Chapter 5: Housing                                    Housing
                                  Chapter 6: Economic Development                       --
                                  Chapter 7: Conservation & Sustainability              Conservation
                                  Chapter 8: Parks, Recreation, & Open Space            Open Space
                                  Chapter 9: Environmental Hazards                      Safety, Noise
                                  Chapter 10: Health & Wellness                         --
                                  Chapter 11: Community Services & Facilities           --
                                  Chapter 5 is included only to provide a bridge to a separate document known as the
                                  Newark Housing Element. The Housing Element is part of the General Plan but
                                  stands on its own since it is subject to statutory requirements beyond those applying
                                  to the other elements. These requirements include review and certification by the
                                  State of California, and updates on a fixed schedule set by the state legislature. At the
                                  time the General Plan was adopted in 2013, the City’s Housing Element covered the
                                  period 2007-2014. In late 2014, it is expected that the City will adopt an updated
                                  Housing Element covering the period 2015-2022. The Housing Element will continue
                                  to be a separately bound document, structured to meet state requirements while
                                  ensuring consistency with the other Plan Elements
I-2

                                                                                    N E W A R K G E N E R A L P L A N
                                                                                                I N T R O D U C T I O N
Chapters 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 of the General Plan correspond to mandatory elements.
The scope of two of these elements has been expanded to address issues of local
concern. First, the state-mandated Open Space Element also addresses Parks and
Recreation. Second, the state-mandated Conservation Element also addresses
Sustainability. Additionally, the state-mandated Safety Element and Noise Element
have been combined into a single chapter titled “Environmental Hazards.”
Chapters 6, 10, and 11 of the General Plan are considered optional elements, since
they are not explicitly required by state law. These elements address economic
development, public health, and community services and facilities. They have been
included because of the importance of these issues to the future of Newark, and
their integral relationship to the topics addressed elsewhere in the Plan. Once
adopted, the optional elements carry the same legal weight as the mandated
elements.
                                                                                                                     I-3

I N T R O D U C T I O N
                                  The General Plan is supplemented by other City plans, including Specific Plans for
                                  subareas of the city and systems plans addressing particular topics such as bicycle
                                  and pedestrian circulation and climate change. The Specific Plans include the
                                  Dumbarton Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) Specific Plan and the Area 3 and 4
                                                   1
                                  Specific Plan. These documents have been formally adopted by the City of Newark,
                                  but they are not part of the General Plan per se. Each Specific Plan is internally
                                  consistent with the General Plan, and is cross-referenced as appropriate in this
                                  document.
                                  Previous iterations of the Newark General Plan included area plans for Old Town
                                  Newark and the Four Corners area; these plans are now more than 20 years old and
                                  are referenced here for historic purposes only. They are no longer considered part of
                                  the adopted General Plan. As appropriate, policy and program recommendations
                                  from these two area plans have been integrated into this General Plan.
                                  Starting with the Land Use Element, each chapter of the General Plan has a similar
                                  structure. Each chapter begins with an introduction and purpose statement.
                                  Background data on existing conditions, projected future conditions, and related
                                  issues is provided. Maps and tables are used to supplement the narrative text. The
                                  goals, policies, and actions are then presented. These statements are intended to
                                  guide the City’s actions during the life of the Plan. In cases where additional details
                                  are needed to clarify the intent of policies or actions, descriptions are provided
                                  beneath the statement.
                                  The goals, policies, and actions are the fundamental basis of the Plan and are further
                                  defined below:
                                          A goal is a general, overall and ultimate purpose, aim or end toward which
                                           the City will direct its efforts.
                                          A policy expresses the City’s commitment and intent on a topic area related
                                           to the goal. It is worded to guide day-to-day decisions and provide general
                                           direction to City staff and officials.
                                            1
                                              The “Area 3 and 4 Specific Plan” reflects a naming convention established by prior General
                                  Plans in which major development opportunity sites were assigned numbers. The City is moving away
                                  from that convention in this General Plan in favor of place-based names. Area 3 and 4 is referred to as
                                  the Southwest Newark Residential and Recreational Project throughout this document; this name may
                                  be replaced as plans for the area are refined. Most of what was formerly called “Area 2” is located
                                  within the Dumbarton TOD Specific Plan Area.

                                                                                                     I N T R O D U C T I O N
       An action is a specific program to be carried out in response to an adopted
        policy. It can be assigned to a specific City department or agency and usually
        has an associated timeline and cost. Actions include standard operating
        procedures which are implemented on an ongoing basis.
In addition, the following words are used throughout the General Plan to indicate
whether a particular provision is mandatory, advisory, or permitted:
       “Must”, “shall,” or “will” identify provisions which are mandatory. Verbs such
        as “require” reflect similar obligatory directives.
       “Should” identifies a provision that is advisory. Verbs such as “encourage” and
        “support” are also advisory. Stated directives using these words should be
        followed unless there are compelling, countervailing considerations. More
        flexibility is intended in the application of such policies than those which are
        mandatory.
       “May” indicates a permissive provision. This indicates a course of action is
        permitted, but not required. Considerable discretion can be used when
        applying such policies to specific issues.
By and large, policies and actions are not repeated in multiple elements. Thus, to
find all the policies relevant to a particular subject, the user may need to refer to
several parts of the Plan. Cross-references are included in italicized font below some
policies and actions to assist in this process. While all General Plan policies are
internally consistent, there may be instances where policies appear to provide
competing direction; in such instances, detailed policies which reference a particular
place, topic or feature take precedence over more general policies.
The General Plan includes numerous references to the “city” and the “City.” When
lower case is used, the reference is to the geographic area within Newark, or various
characteristics of the community. When upper case is used, the reference is to the
government of the City of Newark, including actions to be taken by City departments
or officials.
GENERAL PLAN PROCESS
The Newark General Plan was initially drafted in the early 1960s, during the first
decade after incorporation. A major update occurred in 1968, establishing a land use
                                                                                                                          I-5

                                  plan for the year 1985. New elements, including Open Space, Conservation, Safety,
                                  and Noise, were adopted during the early 1970s.
                                  Almost a quarter century after the 1968 Plan, Newark adopted a new General Plan in
                                  1992. That Plan guided the city’s development through the 1990s and 2000s, and
                                  laid the groundwork for the most recent General Plan effort. The 1992 Plan included
                                  10 chapters and a series of technical appendices. It included a Land Use Map and
                                  other maps and policies that complied with California planning law at the time of
                                  adoption.
                                  The basic vision established by the 1992 Plan continues to guide this General Plan.
                                  This vision seeks to sustain Newark as a high quality community with attractive
                                  neighborhoods, great shopping, diverse workplaces, excellent public services and
                                  parks, and a healthy natural environment. Many of the areas identified for
                                  development by the 1992 Plan continue to be identified for development today—this
                                  General Plan provides greater detail on the types of uses and the issues to be
                                  addressed as such development takes place.
                                  The effort leading to the adoption of a new General Plan in 2013 was referred to as a
                                  General Plan “Tune Up” rather than a major revision. This is because the values
                                  represented by the 1992 Plan remained valid and appropriate at the time of Plan
                                  adoption. By 2011, however, the 1992 Plan’s data and maps were becoming dated
                                  and the absence of a discussion of recent planning efforts was becoming more
                                  apparent. The 1992 Plan did not reference regional planning initiatives and legislative
                                  changes, nor did it address emerging issues such as climate change and
                                  sustainability. The intent of the “Tune-Up” was to update baseline data and
                                  projections, refresh the narrative text which describes planning issues, and move the
                                  planning horizon forward by 20 to 25 years.
                                  An innovative partnership between the City of Newark and California Polytechnic
                                  (Cal Poly) State University of San Luis Obispo, California was established in 2011 to
                                  undertake the first phase of the project. Under the direction of senior faculty, a team
                                  of second-year graduate students in the City and Regional Planning Department
                                  prepared a complete inventory of baseline conditions and planning issues in the city.
                                  Original data was collected through field work, literature searches, and internet
                                  research, and a complete set of digital maps was prepared. Briefing papers were
                                  prepared by the Cal Poly students for 12 topic areas.

                                                                                                     I N T R O D U C T I O N
The Cal Poly students also organized and facilitated community outreach events,
including three public workshops in late 2011 and early 2012. Participants in the
workshops discussed Newark’s strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities, and also
identified desired improvements. Participants also considered alternative scenarios
for Newark’s future and provided feedback that was instrumental in developing
General Plan policies.
In September 2012, the City retained the consulting team of The Planning Center |
DC&E, Barry Miller Consulting, and Hexagon Transportation Consultants, Inc. to
complete the General Plan “Tune-Up,” including an Environmental Impact Report.
Supplemental data was collected and analyzed, and modeling was conducted to
evaluate future traffic, noise, and air quality conditions. A complete audit of all city
planning policies was conducted, including those in the existing General Plan and
those in more recently adopted and pending plans. This was used to develop an
updated set of draft goals, policies, and actions. A revised Land Use Map also was
developed, along with revised land use categories.
Three joint study sessions with the Newark City Council and Planning Commission
were held between March and May 2013. Additional public input was solicited at
these sessions, and feedback from the Council members and Commissioners was
used to revise the policy and action language. The revised Plan was also vetted with
City staff in various departments during this time.
The Plan was drafted between April and July 2013 and was released for public
review in August 2013. Additional public hearings were held before the Planning
Commission and City Council in the Fall of 2013, and the document was adopted at
the conclusion of that process on December 12, 2013.
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
Adoption of a general plan constitutes a “project” under the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA). If any aspect of the general plan, either individually or
cumulatively, leads to a significant effect on the environment, the community must
prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) (Title 14, California Administrative
Code, Section 15080). As with all EIRs, the public has the opportunity to review and
comment on the environmental document.
                                                                                                                          I-7

I N T R O D U C T I O N
                                  In accordance with these requirements, an environmental impact report (EIR) was
                                  prepared for the Newark General Plan “Tune Up” in 2013. The EIR explored the
                                  impacts of changes to Land Use Map as well as the impacts of new and edited Plan
                                  policies. Potential impacts were assessed not only in the context of the City of
                                  Newark, but also in a regional context which considered the cumulative impacts of
                                  development in the Bay Area over the next 20 years. Specific mitigation measures
                                  were identified through the environmental evaluation. As appropriate, these
                                  measures have been incorporated into this Plan as policies and actions, enabling the
                                  Plan to be largely “self-mitigating.”
                                  More detailed environmental review will be required as individual projects are
                                  proposed, even if these projects are consistent with the General Plan. However, the
                                  required extent and level of detail of environmental review may be lessened as a
                                  result of the General Plan EIR. Future projects that are consistent with the Land Use
                                  Map and other aspects of the Plan can “tier off” the Plan’s EIR—their environmental
                                  review can focus on specific project-level impacts such as traffic and noise.
                                  The General Plan EIR includes descriptions of the environmental setting, potential
                                  impacts, and mitigation measures for each topic area. Pursuant to state law, the Draft
                                  EIR was circulated to various state, regional, and local agencies, as well as the
                                  community at large. Following public review, responses were prepared for
                                  comments received and the EIR was edited accordingly. The environmental
                                  document was considered and approved prior to adoption of the General Plan.
                                  ADMINISTRATION OF THE GENERAL PLAN
                                  The Newark General Plan is a dynamic document and is not intended to remain
                                  unchanged through its horizon. State law provides for up to four general plan
                                  amendments each year. Such amendments can be made at any time and may
                                  include more than one change at a time.
                                  State law further provides that many public actions may only be taken after a finding
                                  that the action is consistent with an adopted general plan. This includes a
                                  requirement for consistency between the local capital improvement program and the
                                  general plan, and a requirement that property acquisition and disposal actions are
                                  consistent with the general plan. Decisions about future development also must be
                                  consistent with the general plan. The general plan also provides the framework for
                                  the local zoning ordinance, subdivision regulations, and site development standards.

A number of actions in the Newark General Plan provide specific direction for how
these implementing ordinances should be revised to better achieve the Plan’s goals.
Although this plan looks more than 20 years into the future, the City should not
necessarily wait until the end of the planning period before updating the Plan. Most
communities update their general plans about once every 10 years and conduct
other amendments as needed. Keeping the Plan updated makes it more relevant
and effective, and more useful as a decision-making tool.

INTRODUCTION
This chapter provides the context for the Newark General Plan. It includes an
overview of Newark’s location and history, and a profile of the city’s demographics,
physical characteristics, and economy. It also includes population, housing, and
employment forecasts. The Framework chapter establishes the major objectives of
the General Plan and defines the vision for the city’s future.
NEWARK AND THE REGION
Newark is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, the fourth largest metropolitan area
in the United States and home to over 7.1 million residents in 2010. The city is
located at the junction of two Bay Area sub-regions. It is part of the East Bay, which
includes Alameda and Contra Costa Counties. It is also part of the South Bay and
Silicon Valley, which extends south to San Jose along both sides of San Francisco
Bay.
Newark’s location at the confluence of these two areas has influenced its growth and
development and will continue to shape its future. Like other cities on the East Bay
Plain, the city evolved from an agricultural community to a suburban community
with a substantial manufacturing base during the mid-1900s. Like other cities in the
Silicon Valley, Newark’s economy has diversified during the last three decades, with a
shift from traditional industry to technology, communications, logistics, and other
emerging sectors of the national and global economies.
Figure PF-1 shows Newark’s location. Along with Fremont and Union City, Newark is
considered to be part of the “Tri-Cities” area. The city is located 35 miles southeast of
San Francisco, 25 miles south of Oakland, and 20 miles north of San Jose. It is
surrounded by the city of Fremont on all sides. Interstate 880 (I-880) forms the city’s
northeastern boundary while State Route 84 (SR 84) forms its northwestern
boundary. On the southwest, the City abuts the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay
National Wildlife Refuge.

Since its incorporation in 1955, Newark has developed a reputation as an ideal place
to work, play, and live a quality lifestyle. The city offers the amenities of a smaller
community within the context of a large and cosmopolitan region. It is a short
commute to Northern Santa Clara County job centers and across the Dumbarton
Bridge to Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Stanford University, but also stands on its own
as a major employment center with several million square feet of office and
industrial space. Newark is home to one of the largest regional shopping malls in the
Bay Area, and has numerous smaller shopping centers and restaurants. It provides
diverse housing choices, with median prices well below the communities on the
west side of the Dumbarton Bridge. The city has an excellent park system and is
close to numerous outdoor recreational areas. Its climate is moderated by its
proximity to the Bay, with a 65 to 70 degree mean temperature.
HISTORY
Newark was initially settled by Native Americans, including the Ohlone Indians.
Ancient shell mounds in the area suggest a Native American presence as far back as
4,000 BC. The Ohlone people lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering in an area
extending from the coastal Bay Area to the lower Salinas Valley. The Ohlone popula-
tion declined significantly following the arrival of European missionaries and settlers
in the late 1700s. Mission San Jose was established in 1796, 6 miles to the east.
In 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain. Alta California became a
province of Mexico, with Monterey (California) as the capital. The missions were
abolished between 1834 and 1836, and the indigenous population continued to
decline. Lands around Mission San Jose were gradually parceled out as ranchos to
private landowners, and the mission itself was sold to private interests. The Mexican
period came to an end in 1846, as American efforts to acquire California accelerated
and ultimately led to war. Gold was discovered in California soon after, leading to
the first great increase in the Bay Area’s population.
By the time California became a state in 1850, landings had already been established
on the shore of San Francisco Bay in the Newark vicinity. In 1853, Mayhews Landing
included warehouses for wheat, hay, and coal. By 1856, the nearby Mayhew Ranch
included 1,500 acres of farmland. The ranch was eventually acquired by the Perrin
brothers, who drew up plans for a town site near what is now the intersection of
Thornton and Jarvis Avenues. Following several sales of the property to different
owners and an unsuccessful land reclamation effort, the town site was moved to
coincide with a bend on the newly constructed South Pacific Coast Railroad. Its
                                                                                                                       PF-3

                                  owner named the city 'Newark' after the castle "Newark" in Port Glasgow, Scotland.
                                  In 1876, the railroad and dairy were purchased by a San Francisco capitalist, Alfred
                                  Davis, and a Comstock millionaire, Jim Fair. A railroad station, roundhouse, and
                                  railroad shop were erected in the area near Thornton Avenue and Sycamore Street.
                                  The railroad was extended south to Santa Cruz and north to Alameda, where it
                                  connected to the San Francisco ferry. Service began in March 1878. Completion of
                                  the railroad sparked additional development, including a railroad car-building firm, a
                                  foundry that manufactured Wedgewood stoves, and salt production facilities. By
                                  1880, Newark had a population of 200 people.
                                  Newark remained a small agricultural and manufacturing center through the late
                                  1800s and early 1900s. The settlement was part of Washington Township, an
                                  unincorporated area covering most of southwest Alameda County. In 1953, a group
                                  representing the chambers of commerce of Centerville, Irvington, Mission San Jose,
                                  Niles, Warm Springs, and Newark commissioned a study to incorporate all six
                                  communities into one city. However, participants from other communities asserted
                                  that Newark would be the industrial center of the newly formed city, and that its
                                  vacant land would receive industrial zoning. The Newark Chamber rejected this push
                                  and initiated its own incorporation drive, resulting in the creation of the City of
                                  Newark in 1955. The remaining five cities incorporated as Fremont in 1956.
                                  The city grew rapidly in the years following incorporation. The population was 6,033
                                  in 1955. It grew to 9,911 in 1960 and to 27,157 by 1970. The Nimitz Freeway was
                                  opened to traffic in 1958, placing Newark within commute distance of the Bay Area’s
                                  major job centers. New housing tracts such as Lido Faire, Mowry West, Blossom
                                  Park, Newark Manor, Parkwood, Los Ranchitos, and the Lake were developed during
                                  this time period, and new schools and parks were built to keep pace with growth.
                                  Larger industries also began to move in, including Peterbilt truck manufacturing,
                                  which became the largest employer in the city by the late 1960s. The Civic Center
                                  complex was opened in 1966.
                                  Growth continued at a slower pace through the 1970s and 1980s. NewPark Mall
                                  opened in 1980, and much of the remaining vacant land in the city was developed
                                  during these two decades. A proposal to build a freeway on the west side of the city
                                  was considered during these years. The Shoreline Freeway (Route 61) would have
                                  extended north to Oakland and south to San Jose. However, the project was
                                  ultimately removed from state and regional transportation plans due its potential
                                  environmental impacts.

As noted in Chart F-1, Newark’s population was 42,573 at the time of the 2010
Census. More recent reports from the California Department of Finance estimated
the city’s population to be 43,342 as of January 1, 2013. The City’s population has
been relatively stable for the last 15 years, with an average annual growth rate of less
than 1 percent. In 2013, Newark’s population included about 43,197 persons in
households and 145 persons in group quarters. The average number of persons per
household was 3.33, which was the second highest among the 14 cities in Alameda
County.
Newark’s population has become older and more ethnically diverse over the last two
decades. Between 1990 and 2010, the number of residents over 65 increased from
5.3 percent of the city’s population to 10.6 percent. At the same time, the percentage
of youth (residents under 18) decreased from 28.4 percent to 25.4 percent. In 1990,
                                                                                                                                   PF-5

                                  57.7 percent of the city’s residents were non-Hispanic Whites. By 2010, Newark had
                                  become one of the most diverse cities in the Bay Area, with 27.5 percent non-
                                  Hispanic White residents, 26.8 percent Asian residents, 35.2 percent Hispanic
                                  residents, 4.5 percent African-American residents, and 5.9 percent other or multi-
                                  racial residents. The most recent available Census data indicated that approximately
                                  54 percent of the city’s residents indicated they spoke a language other than English
                                  at home, and 21 percent indicated they spoke English “less than very well.”
                                  In 2010, the median income in the city was $81,777. This was slightly below the
                                  countywide average of $87,012, but represented an increase of about 18 percent
                                  over the previous decade. About 79 percent of the city’s 13,007 households were
                                  families, which was substantially higher than the countywide average of 64 percent.
                                  Approximately 26 percent of the city’s households consisted of married couples with
                                  children living at home.
                                  According to recent data from the Department of Finance, Newark had 13,416
                                  housing units in 2013. About 71 percent of these units were single-family homes, 10
                                  percent were townhomes, 4 percent were 2- to 4-plexes, and 15 percent were in
                                  multi-family buildings. The vacancy rate was 3.3 percent, which was substantially
                                  below the countywide average of 6.4 percent. According to Trulia.com, the median
                                  home sales price in the city in Spring 2013 was $461,500, an increase of over
                                  40 percent in just one year. However, median home prices have not yet returned to
                                  their previous peak of $627,000 in 2006. Roughly 72 percent of the housing units in
                                  Newark are owner-occupied and 28 percent are renter-occupied.

                                  E MPLOYMENT
                                  The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) reports that Newark had
                                  approximately 17,870 jobs in 2010. According to the 2007 US Economic Census, the
                                  largest sectors of the city’s economy were retail trade (21 percent), manufacturing
                                  (21 percent), accommodation and food services (11 percent), professional, scientific
                                  and technical services (11 percent), and wholesale trade (10 percent). Public sector
                                  jobs, including those relating to schools, utilities, and municipal services, represented
                                  15 to 20 percent of the city’s employment base.

ABAG data indicates that the number of jobs in the city declined slightly between
2000 and 2010. However, the city has been recovering from these losses during
recent years as the Bay Area emerges from the recession. Newark has become the
location of choice for several high-profile corporate tenants in recent years, including
Logitech, Membrane Technology and Research, Belectric USA, Theranos, Stemcells,
Inc., and Risk Management Solutions. Newark is also a major regional retail center
within Alameda County and a major hospitality center, with over 1,700 hotel rooms.
The US Census indicates there are approximately 21,000 employed residents living
in Newark, a number that slightly exceeds the number of jobs in the city. Balancing
job and housing growth has been an important goal since Newark’s incorporation.
This is not only important for Newark’s fiscal stability, it also creates the opportunity
for residents to live and work in the same community, which in turn reduces
congestion, time loss associated with commuting, fuel expenses, and air pollution.
This General Plan expresses the City’s continued commitment to attracting a diverse
range of housing, along with jobs that are responsive to the skills of the local
workforce.

L AND U SE
The total area of the City of Newark is 14 square miles. Roughly one-third of this area
consists of salt harvesting, refining, and production facilities. Salt harvesting, refining,
and production have been important economic activities in Newark since the
community was settled and will continue to be a major community asset in the
future. About 20 percent of Newark’s area consists of residential uses, 10 percent
consists of office and industrial uses and just over 4 percent is developed with
commercial uses. Streets and transportation features represent about 13 percent of
the city’s area. The remaining area consists of parks, open space, public land uses,
and vacant land.
Newark has directed much of its commercial and industrial growth to locations that
are well served by the freeways but at the edge of the city’s residential
neighborhoods. This has allowed the city to capture the tax benefits of commercial
development and provide convenient services to residents while at the same time
minimizing the impacts of traffic and noise on its neighborhoods. The primary retail
areas are adjacent to the freeway interchanges at Mowry Avenue and Newark
                                                                                                                            PF-7

                                  Boulevard. These areas meet the needs of a relatively large market area that extends
                                  beyond Newark. The largest industrial areas are west of Cherry Street and along
                                  Central Avenue. Newer “technology park” areas have been developed along Jarvis
                                  Avenue and Stevenson Boulevard.
                                  The City’s major development opportunities are located on the western edge of the
                                  city near Willow Street and Enterprise Drive, and southwest of Cherry Street between
                                  Mowry and Stevenson Avenues. There are also substantial infill development
                                  opportunities in Old Town Newark, in the NewPark Mall vicinity, and on vacant sites
                                  in the city’s business parks and industrial districts. While development opportunities
                                  exist across the city, Newark’s residential neighborhoods are mostly built out. The
                                  priority in these areas is to maintain neighborhood quality as infill development
                                  takes place nearby.

                                  T RANSPORTATION
                                  Newark is served by two major freeways and a network of arterial, collector, and
                                  local streets. I-880 has interchanges at Thornton and Mowry Avenues and Stevenson
                                  Boulevard. It is one of the busiest freeways in the Bay Area, carrying approximately
                                  200,000 vehicles a day in the Newark area. SR 84 has interchanges at Thornton
                                  Avenue and Newark Boulevard. It carries about 60,000 vehicles a day and connects
                                  Newark to the Peninsula via the Dumbarton Bridge. Forecasts prepared by the
                                  Alameda County Transportation Commission indicate that daily freeway volumes are
                                  expected to increase by 26 percent between 2005 and 2035. Newark’s challenge will
                                  be to manage higher volumes on its arterials as vehicles divert off the freeway
                                  seeking alternate routes to their destinations.
                                  Bus service is provided to Newark by AC Transit. Most of the routes provide feeder
                                  service to the BART stations at Fremont and Union City, located several miles
                                  northeast of the city limits. Although Newark does not have a BART station, many
                                  residents rely on BART for travel to Oakland, San Francisco, and other points around
                                  the Bay. A BART extension to Northern Santa Clara County is under construction, and
                                  will provide additional transit access to the South Bay. Newark residents may also
                                  access Dumbarton Express buses that cross the Dumbarton Bridge, and Valley
                                  Transportation Authority buses that stop at the Fremont BART station. Other
                                  passenger rail services in the vicinity include Amtrak’s Capitol Corridor and the

Altamont Commuter Express, both of which stop in Centerville about 1 mile east of
the city.
Most of Newark was developed between 1955 and 1975, an era when auto
convenience and speed was the top transportation priority. Today, transportation
planning in the city is influenced by other factors, including environmental quality,
public health, and a desire to meet the needs of all travelers and not only those who
drive. The City has endorsed the concept of “complete streets,” in which roads are
planned to accommodate multiple modes of travel, including pedestrians, bicyclists,
and transit users as well as cars and trucks. The safety of all travelers will remain a
top priority as this shift takes place.

information on transportation and mobility in the city.
E NVIRONMENT
Newark is located on the East Bay Plain, a relatively flat area that drains west to San
Francisco Bay. Elevation in the city ranges from 37 feet above mean sea level to
5 feet below sea level. The Bay and its associated wetlands and sloughs are the
dominant natural feature of the area.
Upland areas of Newark were used for agriculture, including field crops and dairies,
                      th              th
for much of the 19 and early 20 Centuries. These areas are now urbanized, with
non-native vegetation and flood control channels handling storm drainage. Views
from various locations in the city encompass Mission Peak, Coyote Hills, and hills in
the South and East Bay and on the Peninsula, contributing to Newark’s sense of
place.
Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, the first urban wildlife
refuge in the United States, is located adjacent to the western edge of Newark,
primarily within the City of Fremont. The wetland ecosystem of the Refuge extends
around the southern perimeter of the Bay, and is an important habitat area for
migratory birds and several threatened and endangered species. The Refuge
contributes to the open space quality of the area and provides a unique natural
resource for the region. Cargill Salt has the perpetual right to utilize salt “evaporator”
ponds within the Refuge (and outside the City limits) for its solar salt production
system.

                                  Like other communities in the Bay Area, Newark is working to improve and sustain
                                  environmental quality. Automobile and truck traffic are the major sources of air
                                  pollution and are also a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and noise
                                  pollution. Water pollution is caused by runoff from urban areas, and point sources
                                  such as industry and wastewater plants. The Conservation and Sustainability Element
                                  of the General Plan includes policies and actions to reduce pollution and protection
                                  natural resources in the city.
                                  Newark is also prone to natural hazards. The city is located 3 miles west of the
                                  Hayward Fault and 9 miles east of the San Andreas Fault. Its building codes and land
                                  use policies ensure that the public is protected from earthquake-related hazards. The
                                  city is also is traversed by flood control channels. Although flood risks are low, the
                                  City must plan for sea level rise and other risks associated with a changing climate. A
                                  number of agencies also regulate the handling, transport, and disposal of hazardous
                                  materials in the city. The Environmental Hazards Element of the General Plan may be
                                  consulted for additional information on these subjects.

                                  The City of Newark provides municipal services to residents and businesses,
                                  including recreation, senior services, child care, public works, and law enforcement.
                                  Other agencies also provide services, either directly or through agreements with the
                                  City. Newark Unified School District operates a high school, a middle school, eight
                                  elementary schools, and several alternative schools. Ohlone College operates a state-
                                  of-the-art community college campus on Cherry Street. Newark’s Public Library is
                                  part of the Alameda County Library System and is located within the Civic Center
                                  complex next to City Hall. The Alameda County Fire Department operates three fire
                                  stations in Newark and provides fire and emergency medical services to residents.
                                  Newark is also served by special districts and utility companies. Alameda County
                                  Water District provides water services, while Union Sanitary District provides sewage
                                  collection and wastewater treatment. The Alameda County Flood Control and Water
                                  Conservation District manages the major flood control facilities in the city, including
                                  channels and levees. Solid waste collection and recycling are provided by Allied
                                  Waste. Gas and electricity are delivered by Pacific Gas and Electric, an investor-
                                  owned private utility. There are also telecommunication companies providing cable,

FORECASTS
Long-range housing and employment forecasts for Newark have been developed by
the ABAG. For each city in the Bay Area, ABAG’s forecasts consider planned and
approved development, local growth policies, the vacant land supply, infrastructure
constraints, economic conditions, and other factors that influence the rate and
location of growth. The most recent ABAG projections were developed as part of the
regional Sustainability Communities Strategy mandated by SB 375 (Plan Bay Area).
The current ABAG forecasts for Newark indicate that the city had approximately
13,410 units of housing in 2010. According to ABAG, the number of housing units is
projected to grow by 27 percent between 2010 and 2040, to 17,090 units. Changes
made through this General Plan will increase the city’s residential capacity, and may
result in a faster rate of growth between now and 2040. The analysis prepared for
the General Plan presumed a 46 percent increase in housing units by 2035, which
would result in a citywide population of roughly 60,000.
The ABAG forecasts further indicate that Newark had approximately 17,870 jobs in
2010. According to ABAG, employment is projected to grow at about the same rate
as housing over the next 30 years, increasing by 29 percent to about 23,100 jobs in
2040. A slightly faster rate of growth was used for the General Plan evaluation,
resulting in 22,600 jobs by 2035 (and 23,400 jobs by 2040). While Newark could
potentially capture an even larger share of the region’s jobs, it is important to keep in
mind that surrounding communities also are planning for larger numbers of jobs
than the regional forecasts. Future plans for the NewPark Mall vicinity, Pacific
Research Center, and other employment areas in Newark will be closely monitored
to determine the need for new forecasts for Newark that reflect higher employment
capture rates.
MAJOR COMMUNITY GOALS
`Newark residents value the community’s small size, safety, diversity, mild climate,
shopping and dining choices, affordability, reliable services, convenient location,

                                  recreational choices, and involved citizenry. Participants in the General Plan process
                                  articulated a desire for more retail choices, higher wage jobs, better health and
                                  medical services, additional senior and executive housing options, more public safety
                                  resources, continued investment in schools and educational quality, and more
                                  reliable public transportation. Participants also expressed a desire to create a stronger
                                  “center” within the city—a walkable, gathering place with a variety of restaurants,
                                  shops, and services and a distinct sense of place. The General Plan includes policies
                                  and actions in pursuit of these objectives.
                                  The vision for Newark’s future articulated through the General Plan process is to:
                                         Maintain a strong sense of shared community among residents and protect
                                          the quality of life.
                                         Guide the timing and location of development to protect sensitive natural
                                          environments.
                                         Concentrate commercial and industrial land uses along the edges of the city
                                          to capitalize on freeway access and buffer more sensitive land uses.
                                         Focus future growth in key areas of opportunity for development and
                                          redevelopment while preserving the character of existing residential
                                          neighborhoods.

                                          Area’s Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS), and provide a wide range of
                                          housing opportunities for all housing types and income levels.
                                         Provide new, higher density housing options that address the needs of senior
                                          citizens and cater to the preferences of younger generations, while
                                          maintaining the single-family residential neighborhoods that Newark residents
                                          value.
                                         Continue to provide adequate and varied recreational opportunities.

        modes of travel.
       Facilitate cleanup of hazardous contamination sites in the City.
       Embrace Newark’s bayfront location.
As vacant land is developed and existing uses are redeveloped, care must be taken
to ensure that change is compatible with the desired high quality and established
character of the city. Care must also be exercised to ensure that new development
does not result in undue financial burdens on the City. In particular, new
development will be expected to pay its fair share for public services and facilities,
and to take steps to ensure that it is a good neighbor to the uses around it.
Growth and change will be balanced with the need to provide open space,
recreation lands, and the public facilities necessary to maintain the quality of life in
the city. The quality of property design and maintenance will continue to be a
priority, with an emphasis on enhancing the aesthetics of Newark’s residential
neighborhoods. Historic and cultural resources will continue to be protected.
Continued efforts also will be made to improve the city’s circulation system and
minimize the impacts of freeway traffic on local streets.
SUMMARY OF MAJOR LAND USE PROPOSALS
In developing the framework for the General Plan, land use decisions were analyzed
based on conditions in all parts of the city, with a focus on four areas with the most
significant potential for change. The following statements provide an overview of the
major General Plan proposals. All of these proposals are discussed in greater detail
in the Land Use Element of the Plan. Because the city is surrounded by other
jurisdictions, no addition to the incorporated limits of Newark is anticipated during
the planning period.
D UMBARTON TOD
The Dumbarton TOD area covers about 200 acres on the west side of Newark. The
policy direction provided by the General Plan is supplemented by a Specific Plan for
the area adopted in 2011. The Dumbarton TOD includes the site of a proposed
                                                                                                                      PF-13

                                  transit station along the planned Dumbarton Rail between Union City and the
                                  Peninsula. To leverage the public investment in transit, the Plan calls for up to 2,500
                                  residential units, a new park system, and a neighborhood center with shopping,
                                  services, and office uses. The neighborhood will be organized along a grid of
                                  pedestrian-oriented streets, connected to established residential areas to the east.
                                  S OUTHWEST N EWARK R ESIDENTIAL AND R ECREATIONAL P ROJECT
                                  The Southwest Newark Residential and Recreational Project covers 636 acres in the
                                  area bounded by Mowry Avenue on the west, Stevenson Boulevard on the east,
                                  Cherry Street on the north, and Mowry Slough on the south. The 1992 General Plan
                                  referred to the area east of the Union Pacific Railroad as Area 3, and the area west of
                                  the railroad as Area 4. A Specific Plan for Areas 3 and 4 was adopted in 2010. The
                                  Plan calls for up to 1,260 housing units, a major recreational facility such as a golf
                                  course, and a new school and neighborhood park. It is expected that a substantial
                                  portion of this area will be retained as open space.

                                  Old Town is the historic center of Newark. It includes a commercial district along
                                  Thornton Avenue and a residential area with a variety of housing types and densities.
                                  Old Town has been the subject of planning studies for more than 40 years, each
                                  with the common goal of strengthening this area as a walkable “town center.” This
                                  continues to be the vision moving forward, with a focus on the Thornton Avenue
                                  corridor. The area presents opportunities for historic preservation, infill development,
                                  cultural facilities, and new mixed-use development combining ground floor retail
                                  uses and upper story residential uses.

                                  Greater NewPark refers to the 125-acre area including NewPark Mall and the
                                  commercial uses on its perimeter. The City initiated a visioning process for the Mall
                                  vicinity in 2012 and will continue to work with property owners to explore
                                  alternatives for making this a more vibrant regional retail center in the future.
                                  Options for complementing the retail center with mixed-use development, additional
                                  retail and office uses, and new pedestrian-oriented streets and public spaces, are
                                  explored in this General Plan.

While the four areas above represent the most substantial development
opportunities in the City, other parts of Newark also provide opportunities for future
growth. Key opportunity areas addressed by the General Plan include:
      Newark Civic Center. The Civic Center on Newark Boulevard is now almost a
       half-century old and does not fully meet municipal service needs. The General
       Plan raises the possibility of a new City Hall and Library in this area, built
       through a public/private partnership that also includes higher density
       residential and cultural uses.
      Cedar Boulevard Corridor between Mowry Avenue and Central Avenue.
       This is an area of older commercial and industrial uses, including motels, auto
       body shops, and heavy equipment service lots. A transition to medium density
       residential uses is envisioned over the next 20 years.
      Mayhews Landing Road and Newark Boulevard. This intersection is
       gradually transitioning from commercial to residential uses, with a recently
       developed single-family subdivision and several vacant or underutilized
       former commercial sites now designated for housing.
      Newark Unified School District (NUSD) Facilities. A number of sites owned
       by NUSD may transition to new uses during the coming decades, including
       the former Ruschin Elementary School.
      Ohlone College. Only a portion of Ohlone College’s Newark campus has
       been developed. Additional opportunities exist on the southern portion of the
       college property.
      Industrial Sites. The city has several vacant industrially zoned sites, including
       prime parcels for technology-related development in Pacific Research Center
       and Stevenson Point Technology Park, and other parcels in the light and
       general industrial districts.
                                                                                                                      PF-15

OVERVIEW
The Land Use Element sets the direction for Newark’s future growth and
development. The Element includes the General Plan Land Use Map, which defines
the major categories of land use in Newark along with standards for the allowable
density or intensity of development in each category. It includes the City’s policies for
residential, commercial, industrial, resource production, public, and open space land
uses. These policies provide direction on how Newark will maintain successful
neighborhoods, create a stronger sense of place and civic identity, and make its
shopping areas and workplaces more dynamic and vibrant in the future. They guide
the development of the City’s major vacant sites, and ensure that such development
enhances the quality of life in the city.
Land Use is one of the mandatory elements of the General Plan. By state law, the
element must “designate the proposed general distribution and general location
and extent of the uses of land for housing, business, industry, open space, including
agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty,
education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities,
and other categories of public and private uses of land” (Government Code
65302(a)). State law further requires that the element “include a statement of the
standards of population density and building intensity recommended for the
various districts and other territory covered by the plan.” In many respects, Land
Use is the broadest General Plan element. It provides the foundation which
underpins all other elements.
The Element is organized into five sections:
      Land Use Context provides an overview of existing land uses in Newark, and
       describes the physical form of the city.
      Land Use Plan presents the General Plan Map, including definitions of land
       use categories as required by state law.

                                         where major land use changes are anticipated during the timeframe of the
                                         General Plan. The narrative describes the vision for each area and establishes
                                         parameters for future development.
                                        Design and Preservation provides the context for the land use compatibility,
                                         community design and historic preservation policies that appear later in the
                                         Element.
                                        Goals, Policies and Actions includes the City’s official statements of public
                                         policy on land use topics, including growth and development, land use
                                         compatibility, community standards, community design and identity, and
                                         historic preservation. This section also includes location-specific goals, policies,
                                         and actions for the Focus Areas.

                                  I NTRODUCTION
                                  Newark’s current land use pattern took shape during the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. Prior
                                  to 1950, the city’s footprint consisted of a commercial district along Thornton Avenue
                                  near Sycamore Street, industries along the railroad and near the marsh, and a
                                  residential area extending along a grid of streets around the Thornton Avenue
                                  commercial district. When the city incorporated in 1955, its population was just over
                                  6,000. Completion of the Nimitz Freeway in 1958 sparked a development boom and
                                  led to an increase in population from 7,200 to 21,250 in just seven years. Almost
                                  3,700 housing units were added during the 1960s and 4,200 more units were added
                                  in the 1970s. Hundreds of acres of neighborhoods were developed during this time
                                  period, along with schools, parks, and community facilities. Much of the industrial
                                  area was also developed during this era.
                                  The city’s growth options since the 1970s have been more limited. Development in
                                  the 1980s and 90s primarily occurred on sites that had been bypassed by
                                  development during earlier eras. The 1980s saw development of NewPark Mall and
                                  the shopping centers on its perimeter, as well as some of the city’s multi-family
                                  residential and small lot single-family neighborhoods. Industrial and technology
                                  parks were also developed during the 1980s and 90s. Newark experienced very little
                                  residential development between 2002 and 2013, in part due to regional economic
                                  conditions and in part because of diminishing land supply. There was substantial

employment growth in the first half of this time-period, especially in the technology
and service sectors.
Today, Newark’s development frontiers include vacant land on the city’s western
fringe, along Willow Street south of Thornton Avenue, and on the southwestern
fringe, between Mowry and Stevenson west of Cherry Street. There are also
opportunities to intensify already built-up areas through infill development and the
reuse of underutilized property. The regional emphasis on sustainable growth may
reshape the existing land use pattern in parts of the city that were originally
developed around the automobile. This could lead to more walkable, mixed-use
commercial districts, without changing the character of nearby single-family
neighborhoods.
D ISTRIBUTION OF E XISTING L AND U SES
Newark covers 9,000 acres or about 14 square miles. Table LU-1 indicates the
acreage in major land use categories within this area. The inventory is based on
multiple sources, including a study by Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 2011, GIS
measurements, and approved specific plans for undeveloped portions of the city.
As of 2011, approximately 1,800 acres (20.0%) of Newark’s total area was in
residential use. About 375 acres (4.2%) was in commercial use and 930 acres
(10.3%) was in industrial or office-flex use. Another 270 acres (3.0%) was in public
or institutional use and 1,130 acres (12.6%) consisted of roads and other rights of
way. The sum of these areas is roughly 4,500 acres, or 50 percent of the land area of
the City.
The remaining 50 percent of Newark’s land area consists of undeveloped or non-
urbanized land. Of this total, approximately 960 acres is vacant and designated for
development. The remaining 3,535 acres includes “conservation” open space (280
acres), agriculture (70 acres), public parkland and other “improved” open space
(160 acres), and approximately 3,025 acres of land used for salt harvesting, refining,
and production. Salt harvesting, refining, and production represents approximately
one-third of Newark’s land area. It is the largest single land use in the city in terms of
its geographic extent.

                                  Newark’s residential areas are generally located in the northern part of the city.
                                  Cherry Street forms a well-defined edge between residential and industrial uses in
                                  the eastern part of Newark. The edge is less well defined in the western part of the
                                  city, with residential uses abutting open space north of Thornton Avenue and
                                  industrial areas along Wells Avenue. Between Thornton Avenue and Newark
                                  Boulevard, Jarvis Avenue provides a clear separation between residential and
                                  office/technology uses at Pacific Research Center.
                                  The City’s residential neighborhoods include a variety of housing types and densities.
                                  Single-family neighborhoods predominate, with over 75 percent of the city’s
                                  residential area developed at densities ranging from 4 to 8 units per acre. Many
                                  neighborhoods are characterized by one-story ranch style homes on lots of 5,000 to
                                  8,000 square feet. These homes typically have two-car garages and consistent front,
                                  rear and side setbacks. Newer neighborhoods tend to include smaller lots and two-

story homes, often with contemporary California architectural styles. The City’s
neighborhoods are typically centered around neighborhood schools and parks.
Multi-family housing includes duplexes and triplexes, small apartment buildings,
townhome developments, and larger garden apartment and condominium
complexes. These tend to be located in and around Old Town Newark, in the
Murieta area southeast of NewPark Mall, along Thornton Avenue, near Jarvis Avenue
and Haley Street, and in the area near Newark and Cedar Boulevards. Building
heights are typically two and three stories. Many of the larger apartment, townhome,
and condominium complexes include on-site amenities such as pools, clubhouses,
and park-like areas between buildings.
The city’s commercial areas are generally located along major arterial streets and
close to the freeways. The largest commercial area in located around NewPark Mall.
This area includes the Mall itself, plus free-standing commercial uses, auto
dealerships, hotels, and shopping centers on the perimeter. Another cluster of
commercial uses is located at the “Four Corners” of Jarvis and Newark Boulevards,
where several large shopping centers are located. Additionally, Thornton Avenue
forms a commercial spine between Old Town Newark and the I-880 interchange. Its
frontage has been developed with several shopping centers, offices, service
businesses, churches, fraternal organizations, and individual commercial uses. Other
commercial nodes include Mayhews Landing Road and Newark Boulevard and
Central Avenue north of Cedar Boulevard. With the exception of Old Town Newark,
most of the city’s commercial areas have been designed for auto convenience, with
surface parking lots serving each use.
Industrial areas include technology parks with amenities such as landscaping, public
art, and modern architecture, and more traditional areas for manufacturing,
production, distribution, and repair. Notable industrial uses include Cargill Salt
processing facilities, Full Bloom Baking Company, Matheson Tri-Gas, the World Pac
auto parts distribution center, corporate offices for Logitech, and the Evergreen Oil
Refinery. The primary industrial areas include the area west of Cherry Street south of
Central Avenue and the area along Central Avenue between Willow and Cherry.
Other industrial areas include the west side of Thornton near Willow, and the area
north of Cedar and Central. In addition to supporting manufacturing and distribution
uses, Newark’s industrial areas also support activities such as auto repair, building
supplies, printers, and other commercial services.
                                                                                                                    LU-5

                                  Public and institutional uses typically correspond to schools, churches, fire stations,
                                  and municipal facilities. These uses are scattered across the city, typically within
                                  residential neighborhoods. A majority of the acreage is associated with school
                                  campuses, including the Newark campus of Ohlone College.
                                  As noted above, the undeveloped and non-urbanized areas in Newark are principally
                                  located in the southern and western parts of the city. The Cargill salt harvesting,
                                  refining, and production facilities constitute a majority of this area. However, the City
                                  also includes approximately 960 acres of land that is vacant and designated for
                                  development. Most of this land is clustered in two areas. About 630 acres is located
                                  west of Cherry Street between Mowry and Stevenson. This area has historically been
                                  referred to as Areas 3 and 4, and its development is guided by a Specific Plan
                                  discussed later in this chapter. About 230 acres is located around the Willow and
                                  Thornton intersection. This is the Dumbarton Transit Oriented Development Specific
                                  Plan area (referred to as Area 2 in previous General Plans for Newark). There are
                                  also several vacant tracts within the Pacific Research Center, in other industrial parks,
                                  and in the NewPark Mall vicinity.
                                  In summary, Newark’s land use pattern reflects its origins as a railroad town and
                                                                                                          th
                                  industrial center, its rapid development as a suburb in the mid-20 Century, and its
                                  evolution into a more balanced city where new employment and shopping centers
                                  complement residential neighborhoods. The stage is set for the city’s continued
                                  growth. The next two decades are expected to see development of the remaining
                                  large vacant areas on the city’s west and southwest sides and continued infill and
                                  revitalization of areas developed during the last century. As this development takes
                                  place, the priority will be on ensuring the continued quality of the city’s existing
                                  neighborhoods, and leveraging new development to provide amenities, services, and
                                  qualities that are missing in Newark today.

                                  In most cases, the Map presumes a continuation of the existing land use pattern. For
                                  example, the City’s developed single-family residential areas have been designated
                                  “Low Density Residential” on the Map. Most of Newark’s commercial and industrial
                                  areas have likewise been designated to reflect what is on the ground today, although
                                  opportunities to diversify and intensify existing uses have been provided in the
                                  NewPark area and in Old Town Newark. The Map identifies the Cargill salt
                                  harvesting, refining, and production facilities for continued use as such. It also
                                  identifies existing and future parks and recreation areas within the city.
                                  The areas of greatest expected future land use change are in Southwest Newark and
                                  on the western edge of the city. This is consistent with existing City policy, as both of
                                  these areas have been planned for development for over 20 years. The southwestern
                                  area, which is currently mostly vacant, continues to be planned for a combination of
                                  residential and recreational uses. The western edge around Willow and Thornton
                                  was the subject of a General Plan Amendment in 2011 to facilitate future transit-
                                  oriented development (TOD) around the future Dumbarton Rail station.
                                  Development in these two areas is guided not only by broad General Plan policies,
                                  but by more prescriptive standards established in Specific Plans for each area.
                                  The Land Use Map is intended to be a regulatory tool. Future land use decisions
                                  must be consistent with the designations on the Map, as well as the definitions and
                                  standards in this section. While the Map generally aligns with individual parcels of
                                  land, it is not as prescriptive or specific as a zoning map. As the name implies, the
                                  Map is intended to be “general” and the spatial extent of each designation is
                                  approximate. The City’s Zoning Map is more detailed than the General Plan Map and
                                  is intended to be parcel specific. Zoning designations include more precise
                                  development standards which are consistent with the broad guidelines established
                                  here for the corresponding General Plan categories.
                                  There are 16 categories depicted on the General Plan Map. As noted earlier in this
                                  chapter, State law requires a standard of density or intensity for each land use
                                  category. For residential uses, density is expressed by the number of units per net
                                  acre of land. Net acreage excludes land used for streets, parks and public open
                                  spaces, conservation easements, utility rights-of-way, flood control channels, and
                                  similar public improvements. It includes driveways, parking areas and private streets
                                  in multi-family developments, and common or private open space areas. Residential
                                  density can also be expressed in terms of population per acre. To calculate persons

                                                                                                               L A N D U S E
per acre, the number of units should be multiplied by 3.27, which was the average
number of persons per household in Newark at the time of the 2010 Census.
For commercial and industrial uses, intensity is expressed through floor area ratios
(FARs). FAR is the ratio of building area to lot area on a given parcel of land. For
example, a 5,000-square-foot building on a 10,000-square-foot parcel would have an
FAR of 0.5. The measurement of floor area typically does not include non-habitable
spaces such as parking garages, carports, mechanical rooms, and unfinished
basements. FAR is used in the General Plan to describe intensity, but is not intended
as a regulatory limit for individual parcels. Other zoning standards, including setbacks
(the minimum distance between a building and the front, side, and rear property
lines), landscape requirements, height limits, and parking requirements, are typically
used to determine the allowable building area. Buildings are also subject to design
review, which in some cases may preclude the maximum FAR from being achieved.
Each category is depicted in a different color on the General Plan Land Use Map.
There may be multiple zoning districts within each category. This allows finer grained
distinctions to be made within each area regarding the specific mix of uses and
densities or intensities of development allowed. For example, the “Low Density Resi-
dential” category includes the R-6000, R-7000, R-8000, and R-10000 zoning districts,
indicating areas subject to a minimum lot size requirement of 6,000, 7,000, 8,000,
and 10,000 square feet respectively. Parcels are not automatically “entitled” to the
maximum density or intensity in the range indicated for each General Plan category.
Individual zoning districts within each category may distinguish where the “top” of
the range is acceptable, and where the lower ends of the range are appropriate.
Table LU-2 indicates the land area in each General Plan category. Comparing Tables
LU-1 and LU-2, the greatest acreage change is in the residential category. Most of
Newark’s vacant land supply is designated for residential use, consistent with
approved specific plans for the Dumbarton TOD and the Southwest Newark area
(formerly Areas 3 and 4). It should be noted that some of the land tallied as “Low
Density Residential” in Table LU-2 will be set aside for open space or recreational
uses as development plans for vacant areas are finalized (see “Area 4” on the map,
shown with a cross-hatched pattern). Thus, “buildout” of the city will result in slightly
lower residential acreage than is indicated in Table LU-2, and slightly higher open
space acreage. Salt harvesting, refining, and production facilities will remain the
single largest land use category in Newark.

Four residential designations appear on the Map. These are defined as follows:
       Low Density Residential (Less than 8.7 units per net acre). This
        designation is intended for single-family residential development on lots larger
        than 5,000 square feet. It corresponds to most of Newark’s residential
        neighborhoods. Multiple zoning districts apply within Low Density Residential
        areas to distinguish areas with different minimum lot sizes. Other compatible
        uses, such as schools, childcare centers, parks, and religious facilities may also
        locate in areas with this designation, subject to appropriate permitting
        requirements.
       Low-Medium Density Residential (8.7 to 15 units per net acre). This
        designation is intended for small lot single-family homes, zero lot line and
        patio homes, mobile home parks, and other areas characterized by a mix of
        older single-family homes and small multi-unit buildings. These areas have
        the basic characteristics of single-family neighborhoods, such as front and rear
        yards, driveways, and garages, but have smaller lots and a wider variety of
        housing types. Densities in areas with this designation range from 8.7 to 15
        units per net acre, but the higher end of this range (e.g. from 11 to 15 units
        per acre) will only be allowed on properties which have their primary access
        on an arterial or collector street and which are found to be compatible with
        the character and intensity of residential development in the immediate area.
        Other compatible uses, such as schools, childcare centers, parks, and religious
        facilities may locate in all areas with this designation, subject to appropriate
        permitting requirements.
       Medium Density Residential (14 to 30 units per net acre). This
        designation is intended for garden apartments and condominiums,
        townhomes, row houses, 4 to 8 plexes, and older areas that contain a mix of
        multi-family and single-family homes within this density range. These areas
        tend to be multi-family in character but retain some of the characteristics of
        suburban neighborhoods such as landscaped yards, off-street parking,
        common open space, and low building heights. Densities in areas with this
         1
           To convert the residential density ranges from dwelling units per net acre to population per

the 2010 census.

                                        range (e.g. from 22 to 30 units per acre) will only be allowed on properties
                                        which have their primary access on an arterial or collector street and which
                                        are found to be compatible with the character and intensity of residential
                                                                                      2
                                        development in the immediate area. Additionally, to ensure that land with
                                        this designation is used as efficiently as possible, a minimum density standard
                                        of 14 units per net acre applies. Other compatible uses, such as schools,
                                        childcare centers, parks, and religious facilities may also locate in areas with
                                        this designation, subject to appropriate permitting requirements.
                                       High Density Residential (25 to 60 units per net acre). This designation is
                                        intended for apartment and condominium complexes that are generally three
                                        stories or more. On larger parcels with this designation, common open space
                                        and other shared amenities are typically provided. Structured (or basement-
                                        level/ podium) parking is also common. Densities range from 25 to 60 units
                                        per acre, corresponding to site area allowances of 725 to 1,450 square feet of
                                                                              3
                                        lot area per each dwelling unit. To ensure that land with this designation is
                                        used as efficiently as possible, a minimum density standard of 25 units per net
                                        acre applies. Other compatible uses, such as schools, childcare centers, parks,
                                        and religious facilities may also locate in areas with this designation, subject to
                                        appropriate permitting requirements.
                                  COMMERCIAL AND MIXED-U SE DESIGNATIONS
                                  Four commercial designations and one mixed-use designation appear on the map.
                                  These are defined below.
                                       Neighborhood Commercial. This designation encourages the development
                                        and preservation of retail stores, services, and other businesses which meet
                                        the day-to-day shopping needs of the surrounding residential neighborhoods.
                                        Neighborhood Commercial uses may be found in auto-oriented shopping
                                        centers or on individual parcels along collector and arterial streets. Examples
                                        include the Newark Square Shopping Center at Thornton Avenue and Newark
                                        Boulevard and Mowry Plaza at Mowry Avenue and Cedar Boulevard. Larger-
                                        scale commercial uses such as department stores and hotels are generally not
                                        appropriate in areas with this designation. Neighborhood Commercial areas
                                         2
                                           Densities above this range may be permitted with a Density Bonus, as prescribed by zoning.

  are also not appropriate for residential use and should be maintained to
  provide convenient, walkable shopping destinations for nearby residents. FARs
  are generally in the range of 0.2 to 1.0. The actual intensity of development
  on any given site is dictated by a number of factors, including height limits,
  parking and landscaping requirements, and site size and dimensions.
 Community Commercial. This designation encourages the development of
  services and businesses which meet the comparison shopping needs of the
  city’s residents and workers. Such centers may include supermarkets, home
  improvement stores, variety stores, pharmacies, restaurants, and similar uses
  which serve the community. Examples include the Home Depot on Thornton
  Avenue and the multiple shopping centers around the four corners of Newark
  Boulevard and Jarvis Avenue. Larger-scale commercial uses such as hotels and
  office buildings are acceptable in areas with this designation. Community
  Commercial areas are generally not appropriate for residential use, although
  housing may be considered as a component of future planned developments
  within these areas in the event a shopping center is reused. FARs are generally
  in the range of 0.2 to 2.0. The actual intensity of development on any given
  site is dictated by a number of factors, including height limits, parking and
  landscaping requirements, and site size and dimensions.
 Regional Commercial. This designation supports the largest and most
  complete shopping facilities in the city. The emphasis is on a broad array of
  goods and services, including department stores, retail shops, restaurants,
  entertainment facilities, and similar uses which draw patrons from throughout
  Newark and the surrounding region. This designation is applied to NewPark
  Mall and some of the commercial areas on the Mall’s perimeter. Uses such as
  hotels and corporate office buildings are acceptable in areas with this
  designation. Housing at densities greater than 30 units per acre may be
  included in Regional Commercial areas if such housing is a component of a
  large-scale planned development which is primarily oriented around regional
  retail commercial uses. FARs are generally in the range of 0.2 to 4.0. The
  actual intensity of development on any given site is dictated by a number of
  factors, including height limits, parking and landscaping requirements, and site
  size and dimensions.
 Office Commercial. This designation supports local-serving offices
  accommodating such uses as finance, insurance, and real estate businesses,
  legal and other professional services, banks, personal services, business-
                                                                                                                LU-13

L A N D U S E
                                        support activities, and dental and medical services. These uses may form a
                                        transition between retail uses and residential areas, or a buffer between
                                        arterial streets and residential areas. An example is the area along Thornton
                                        Avenue north of Newark Boulevard. Retail uses are discouraged in Office
                                        Commercial areas, and housing is only permitted if it is a component of a
                                        larger-scale planned development. FARs are generally in the range of 0.5 to
                                        1.5. The actual intensity of development on any given site is dictated by a
                                        number of factors, including height limits, parking and landscaping
                                        requirements, and site size and dimensions.
                                       Commercial Mixed-Use. This designation supports a combination of office,
                                        residential, and retail use, with an emphasis on specialty commercial uses
                                        such as antique stores, boutiques, galleries, cafes, and restaurants.
                                        Development standards should foster a walkable, pedestrian-oriented
                                        character that emphasizes a fine-grained building scale and streetscape.
                                        Structures that are entirely residential or entirely commercial are both
                                        permitted, but the optimal development form on larger sites would include
                                        housing located above ground level retail shops or services. This designation
                                        is used in Old Town Newark, where it recognizes the historic scale, lot pattern,
                                        and context of this district. FARs are generally in the range of 0.5 to 2.0. The
                                        actual intensity of development on any given site is dictated by a number of
                                        factors, including height limits, parking and landscaping requirements, and site
                                        size and dimensions. Multiple zoning districts apply in this designation, with
                                        one zone focused on ground floor retail uses and the other allowing more
                                        diverse ground floor uses, such as offices and housing.
                                  INDUSTRIAL DESIGNATIONS
                                  Three industrial designations appear on the map. These are defined below.
                                       Limited Industrial. This designation is intended to meet the needs of a
                                        variety of light industrial and commercial service uses. It serves as a transition
                                        between heavier industrial activities and residential neighborhoods. Uses such
                                        as light manufacturing, warehouses, sales and offices, auto repair, printers,
                                        and contractor’s services are typical. An example is the area on the east side of
                                        Cedar Boulevard north of Central Avenue. All uses in Limited Industrial areas
                                        should be designed to be compatible with nearby uses, including housing.
                                        Activities generally occur within enclosed structures, and a high standard of
                                        property maintenance, landscaping, and screening is required. Performance

                                                                                                         L A N D U S E
  standards may be imposed to reduce or eliminate the potential for off-site
  impacts. A limited number of office, commercial recreation, and group
  assembly uses may be considered in this designation, subject to appropriate
  conditions to reduce potential land use conflicts. FARs are generally in the
  range of 0.2 to 1.5. The actual intensity of development on any given site is
  dictated by a number of factors, including height limits, parking and
  landscaping requirements, proximity to residential areas, and site size and
  dimensions.
 General Industrial. This designation is intended to accommodate a broad
  range of manufacturing, warehousing, wholesaling, and distribution uses.
  General Industrial areas should not be located next to residential, commercial,
  or other sensitive uses because they are often characterized by outdoor
  storage, noise, odors, hazardous materials handling, and heavy truck activity.
  An example of a General Industrial area is the area around Central Avenue
  and Willow Street. Performance standards may be imposed in such areas to
  reduce or eliminate the potential for off-site impacts. Non-industrial uses, such
  as retail stores, free-standing office buildings, and group assembly uses, are
  not permitted in General Industrial areas. Buffering and screening may be
  required to enhance public rights of way, and to ensure compatibility between
  uses. FARs are generally in the range of 0.2 to 2.5. The actual intensity of
  development on any given site is dictated by a number of factors, including
  height limits, parking and landscaping requirements, proximity to residential
  areas, and site size and dimensions.
                                                                         st
 Special Industrial. This designation is intended to foster 21 Century
  workplaces developed to the highest standards of building design,
  landscaping, and aesthetic amenities. Allowable uses are typically associated
  with advanced technology, research and development, manufacturing, and
  related support facilities. An example is the Pacific Research Center between
  State Route 84 and Jarvis Avenue. Performance standards are used to ensure
  that uses and facilities in Special Industrial areas will create minimal off-site
  impacts and therefore may be appropriate neighbors to residential and other,
  more sensitive uses. Special Industrial areas include business parks, industrial
  parks, technology parks, and other master planned industrial subdivisions.
  Such developments may include complementary uses which support the
  employee population, such as hotels, restaurants, office buildings, childcare
  facilities, and business services. FARs are generally in the range of 0.2 to 3.0.
                                                                                                                 LU-15

N E W A R K G E N E R A L P L A N
L A N D U S E
                                         The actual intensity of development on any given site is dictated by a number
                                         of factors, including height limits, parking and landscaping requirements,
                                         proximity to residential areas, and site size and dimensions.
                                  RESOURCE PRODUCTION DESIGNATIONS
                                  The Land Use Map uses one category for resource production land uses, defined as
                                  follows:
                                        Salt Harvesting, Refining, and Production. This designation identifies areas
                                         used for salt harvesting, refining, and production, including man-made
                                         crystallizer beds used for salt crystallization, and related buildings, facilities,
                                         and operations for salt harvesting, stacking, sizing, packaging, and/or
                                         distribution. It applies to the privately owned Cargill Salt Company lands on
                                         the western side of the city. A standard of development intensity does not
                                         apply, as buildings unrelated to salt production are generally not appropriate
                                         in these areas. Williamson Act agricultural preserves are permitted in areas
                                         with this designation.
                                  PUBLIC D ESIGNATIONS
                                  The Land Use Map uses one category for public and institutional facilities, defined as
                                  follows:
                                        Public and Institutional. This designation is intended to identify existing and
                                         proposed public facilities, such as fire stations, City offices, libraries,
                                         corporation yards, pumping stations, and schools and colleges. It also may be
                                         used to identify railroad turnouts, junctions, and sidings; pipelines, utility
                                         rights-of-way, and storage tanks; transit facilities; and larger institutional uses.
                                         FARs are generally in the range of 0.2 to 1.0. The actual intensity of
                                         development on any given site is dictated by a number of factors, including
                                         height limits, parking and landscaping requirements, site size and dimensions,
                                         and the nature of the public or institutional activity on the property.
                                  OPEN S PACE D ESIGNATIONS
                                  The Land Use Map uses two categories for open space, defined as follows:
                                        Parks and Recreational Facilities. This designation is intended to identify
                                         open space lands whose primary purpose is active recreation. It applies to
                                         parks owned and operated by the City of Newark and other land that supports
                                         recreational activities such as golf courses, driving ranges, tennis clubs, and

       batting cages. Both existing parks and proposed parks are included. Typical
       uses include playgrounds, picnic areas, and sports fields. As appropriate, this
       designation may also apply to Newark Unified School District (NUSD) athletic
       fields and playgrounds subject to joint use agreements and available for
       public recreation. Buildings for recreation and community purposes are
       allowed. Height limits vary from 30 to 50 feet, depending on context.
      Conservation Open Space. This designation is intended to protect wildlife
       habitats and wetlands and is applied in areas not used for human habitation
       or employment. Land with this designation is typically owned by public
       agencies, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. A limited number of
       recreational improvements such as trails and interpretive nature centers may
       be acceptable. However, the primary purpose of this designation is to facilitate
       the restoration and enhancement of native habitat. A standard of
       development intensity does not apply, as buildings are generally not
       appropriate in these areas.
FOCUS AREAS
This section of the Land Use Element provides direction for several “Focus Areas”
within Newark. Figure LU-2 indicates the location of these areas.
Each Focus Area has unique issues that require more detailed discussion than is
provided in this Element for the city as a whole. Two of the Focus Areas have been
the subject of recent Specific Plans. A third has been the subject of prior planning
studies and evaluations, and another is anticipated to be the subject of an area plan
in the coming years. Each Focus Area requires special considerations relative to land
use, transportation, housing, urban design, and conservation.
The Focus Area discussions include a description of each area and a summary of key
development objectives. The Focus Areas are also the subject of individual goals in
the last section of this Element, coupled with policies and actions to guide future
land use decisions.

The Dumbarton TOD area covers just over 200 acres on Newark’s west side. The site
extends along both sides of Willow Street, roughly between the Union Pacific
Railroad on the north and Central Avenue on the south. The railroad right-of-way
along the northern edge of this area has been designated as the alignment for a
potential new transit line linking Southern Alameda County with the Peninsula, with
a future station at Willow Street. This creates the opportunity for development
around the new station with high-density residential, retail, and office uses that are
designed to encourage walking, bicycling, and transit use for most trips.
A Specific Plan for the area was adopted in 2011, providing the City with a
mechanism for directing development and ensuring the installation of adequate
infrastructure. The Specific Plan includes a Land Use Plan, design guidelines,
development regulations, and specifications for new utilities. It also includes
provisions for a network of open spaces and pedestrian corridors which provide
connections to new transit facilities. The TOD area is envisioned a place where
housing, recreation, retail, and employment uses are integrated in a traditional
village atmosphere. Because of the area’s proximity to premium transit, owning a car
should be an option rather than a necessity for those who will live and work here.
On the General Plan Map (Figure LU-1), areas within the Dumbarton TOD Specific
Plan boundary have been assigned the “best fit” land use designations using the
citywide land use categories. The actual categories and density ranges in the Specific
Plan are slightly different than those in the General Plan, given the more detailed
nature of the Specific Plan and its intent as a regulatory tool. In the event of a
conflict between a General Plan land use definition and a Dumbarton TOD Specific
Plan land use definition, the Specific Plan shall prevail.
The Dumbarton TOD area was initially developed with industrial and agricultural
                                   th
uses dating back to the early 20 Century. Much of the area has been vacant for
several decades. Prior to 2010, the area had been designated for limited and general
industrial uses. The proposal for rapid transit across the Bay provided the impetus to
develop a new vision which capitalizes on this proposed public investment. The area
is abutted on the eastern side by residential neighborhoods in Newark. The vision is
to extend this residential pattern to the west, providing new connections between
established neighborhoods and the Bay. The site will continue to be bracketed by
salt evaporation ponds and the wildlife refuge on the south and west.
                                                                                                                    LU-19

                                  Development of the Dumbarton TOD area will incorporate “smart growth”
                                  principles, including the preservation of natural resources, narrower streets and
                                  slower travel speeds, an expanded range of transportation options, an emphasis on
                                  public health, and a focus on walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods. This vision will be
                                  achieved in part through adoption of a form-based zoning code for the area. Such a
                                  code establishes development standards which define the building envelope and
                                  design without rigidly dictating the allowable activities within each structure. The
                                  development will also embrace “green” development principles, including low-flow
                                  water fixtures, bay-friendly landscaping, retention of stormwater runoff on-site,
                                  minimal use of herbicides and pesticides, reduced impervious surface coverage,
                                  green building construction, and renewable energy use.
                                  About six acres have been set aside for the Dumbarton transit station itself, including
                                  bus transfer areas, pick up and drop off areas, and parking. The station site should
                                  be connected by bus, and at some point in the future by train, to job centers across
                                  the Dumbarton Bridge, and to existing rail transit facilities in the Tri-City area.
                                  Adjacent to the station, an open area will provide a gathering place for the
                                  community and space for outdoor activities and civic events.
                                  The Plan envisions a small neighborhood center adjacent to the station. The center
                                  should include a grocery store, restaurants and cafes, personal services, and other
                                  local businesses. An area west of the neighborhood center will provide land for up to
                                  195,000 square feet of office and retail uses. Opportunities for high density housing
                                  will also be provided in the center, potentially above ground floor retail uses. Design
                                  guidelines have been prepared to ensure distinctive architecture and to establish
                                  standards for building form, landscaping, lighting, and street furnishings.
                                  The Specific Plan accommodates up to 2,500 new residential units, including a mix
                                  of townhomes, apartments, condominiums, and single-family detached homes.
                                  Residential areas will generally be organized along a grid of walkable streets. Some
                                  homes may face pedestrian-oriented streets, parks, and garden courts. Where
                                  individual garages are provided, they would generally be accessed from rear alleys
                                  rather than from the street. Design guidelines have been prepared to lay out the
                                  desired residential building styles. These range from agrarian and farmhouse styles
                                  to arts and crafts and French Country themes.

A park and open space system will help weave the community together, while
providing new recreational facilities and features. At least 16 acres of parkland will be
provided, including a new neighborhood park west of the transit station and a
designated dog park area. Other park amenities might include play fields, picnic
areas, and new recreational facilities. New parks will be complemented by new trails,
linking the transit station to nearby residential areas and extending the Bay Trail and
spur trails through the site. Planting and landscaping palettes have been developed
for the community to create a strong sense of place and enhance community
aesthetics. An extensive set of lighting standards also has been developed.
New infrastructure will be necessary to facilitate the Dumbarton TOD project. The
Specific Plan calls for improving several off-site intersections. It also includes detailed
guidelines for the design of local streets, with a focus on maximizing amenities for
pedestrians and bicycles.
A Backbone Circulation Plan has been adopted indicating the approximate alignment
of future roads. This includes a western extension of Central Avenue and
improvements to Enterprise Drive, Willow Street, and Hickory Street. In addition, a
Street Standards Table has been adopted indicating street widths and right-of-way
treatments (cross-sections) for varying street types. The Circulation Plan includes
pedestrian circulation routes, a bike route network, and potential bicycle parking
areas. Roundabouts are proposed to accommodate through-traffic at major
intersections. Future projects in the Specific Plan area will also be required to
contribute to the funding of a new railroad overcrossing of the Union Pacific tracks
on Central Avenue. Although this crossing is located one mile east of the Specific
Plan area and a new overcrossing is not essential to facilitate the Specific Plan, this
improvement will help maintain traffic flow and provide for emergency access as this
area is developed.
An expanded network of water, sewer, and storm drainage lines will be required to
serve new homes and businesses in this area. While trunk utilities exist throughout
the area, extensions and upgrades will be required to provide sufficient capacity and
serve individual development parcels. The Specific Plan identifies the backbone utility
network, as well as principles for the planning and design of infrastructure. Grading
and drainage improvements are particularly important, both to reduce on-site flood
risks, and to maintain water quality. Private utilities, such as electrical distribution and
cable, are also discussed in the Specific Plan. There is an extensive network of
                                                                                                                          LU-21

                                  easements through the site, including pipelines and other transmission facilities
                                  requiring relocation.
                                  A range of strategies will be needed to pay for infrastructure construction in the TOD
                                  area, potentially including cash, loans, assessment districts, benefit districts, capital
                                  improvements, and state and federal grants. A variety of phasing options also may
                                  be explored. Since funding of the Dumbarton Rail itself remains uncertain, the City
                                  will continue to promote interim high-quality transit service to the area, including bus
                                  service to BART and the West Bay.

                                  This is the largest area proposed for future development in Newark, comprising 636
                                  acres in the area bordered by Mowry Avenue on the west, Stevenson Boulevard on
                                  the east, Cherry Street on the north, and Mowry Slough on the south. The Union
                                  Pacific Railroad bisects the area.
                                  Previous General Plans for Newark referred to the land north of the railroad as “Area
                                  3” and the land south of the Railroad as “Area 4.” Area 3 was originally 298 acres,
                                  but 221 acres of this total has been committed to other land uses, including the
                                  Newark campus of Ohlone College, Sportsfield Park, and the Stevenson Point
                                  Technology Park. The remaining 77 acres, which is located along the south side of
                                  Cherry Street west of Stevenson Boulevard, was vacant as of 2013.
                                  The area south of the railroad tracks is 559 acres. Most of the land is vacant,
                                  although the area near the end of Mowry Avenue includes an auto-dismantling yard.
                                  The remainder of this area has been disked and graded for agricultural use since the
                                  early 1900s. The entire area has been designated for residential use for over 20
                                  years. A ballot measure to change the designation to conservation and open space
                                  land uses was rejected by Newark voters in 1999.
                                  A Specific Plan for the 636-acre area was adopted in 2010. The Plan calls for the
                                  development of up to 1,260 housing units, a major recreational facility such as an
                                  18-hole golf course, and the dedication of conservation open space on some of the
                                  low-lying areas south of the railroad tracks. An area facing Cherry Street just east of
                                  Ohlone College has been set aside for a new 600-student elementary school and a
                                  new neighborhood park. The rest of former Area “3” has been designated for Low-
                                  Medium Density Residential uses on the General Plan Map. The Specific Plan

envisions single-family lots ranging from 3,150 square feet to 4,800 square feet,
although the flexibility exists to transfer the allowable density within this area to
facilitate multi-family housing construction on a portion of the site.
Development of single-family lots is planned south of the railroad tracks. Some of
the area designated as “Low Density Residential” on the Map will be conserved as
wetland habitat and some will be improved with recreational facilities. The Specific
Plan divides the area south of the tracks into four lettered sub-areas. Of these four
areas, one is planned for housing, one may be used for a golf course or similar
recreational amenity, one is to be conserved as open space, and one may be used
for either recreation or housing.
In the event a golf course is developed, it is envisioned as an 18-hole public course.
A golf course could provide an amenity that is lacking in Newark today and would
round out the range of recreational opportunities available to those who live and
work in the city. It could also be an economic development asset that can attract
businesses, executive housing, and higher quality retail uses nearby. Ancillary
facilities such as a clubhouse, banquet facility, driving range, and maintenance
buildings, could potentially complement such a facility. Construction of a golf course
is contingent on its fiscal feasibility, market demand, and other factors. In the event a
golf course is not developed, another citywide recreational amenity should be
provided here.
The Specific Plan includes residential street and intersection standards, along with
plans for a railroad overpass at Stevenson Boulevard. The Stevenson Avenue Bridge
should include a 12-foot travel lane in each direction, adjacent to 5-foot bike lanes.
One side of the bridge will have a sidewalk for pedestrians. A pedestrian and bicycle
bridge across the Alameda County Flood Control Channel is also planned,
connecting the site to Ohlone College. A multi-use trail is also proposed across the
southern part of the site, providing a component of the Bay Trail.
Elevations within the Southwest Newark area range from sea level to about 20 feet,
with a substantial portion of the area south of the railroad located at less than 10 feet
above sea level. A grading and fill plan for this area will be prepared to ensure that
future development areas are elevated above the base flood elevation. Building pads
of occupied structures will be at least 11.25 feet above mean sea level (msl), with
the finished floor at least six inches above the building pad. The top of curb grades

                                  for residential streets will be no less than 10 feet above msl. Detailed grading and
                                  stockpile management plans will be required before construction is approved and
                                  stormwater management plans will be required to contain runoff. A new network of
                                  water, sewer, and storm drain lines will be constructed to serve the development,
                                  supplemented by related infrastructure such as pump stations.
                                  Landscaping guidelines are included in the Specific Plan. These call for plants which
                                  respond to the wind, cooler temperatures, and soil conditions found on the site. A
                                  dual water system will be developed so that recycled water and other non-potable
                                  water sources may be used for irrigation potable when they become available from
                                  the Alameda County Water District.
                                  The Specific Plan places a strong emphasis on conserving remnant natural habitat
                                  areas on the site, and restoring the seasonal wetland functions of some of the low-
                                  lying areas. Some of the poorer quality wetlands and aquatic habitat areas south of
                                  the railroad tracks may be filled, with mitigation provided by restoring wetlands
                                  nearby or elsewhere. The exact location and amount of wetlands to be conserved or
                                  impacted by development, and the exact location and configuration of residential
                                  lots and other recreational uses, will be determined through subsequent entitlement
                                  processes and studies.

                                  Old Town is the historic heart of Newark. Its grid of streets reflects the original the
                                  Town Plan from 1878. Its land use pattern was already well-established by the time
                                  Newark incorporated in 1955. The area includes a diverse mix of uses, including
                                  single and multi-family housing, retail stores, restaurants, service businesses, light
                                  industry, public buildings, and churches.
                                  Old Town has been the subject of planning studies dating back to the 1960s. The
                                  overarching goal of these studies has been to strengthen the area’s role as the
                                  commercial and cultural center of Newark. Various studies have sought to revitalize
                                  the Thornton Avenue shopping district, promote infill housing opportunities,
                                  improve public spaces, and enhance the streetscape. However, there has not been a
                                  comprehensive effort to address all of these topics in a single, unified Area Plan in
                                  over 20 years. Such a plan is recommended by the General Plan as a way of better
                                  achieving the objectives for Old Town.

                                                                                                            L A N D U S E
In 1990, the City adopted the Historic Newark Area Plan (HNAP) as part of the City’s
General Plan. The HNAP defined a vision of Old Town as a “bustling commercial
district” with “modern shopping and services in a setting reminiscent of a turn-of-
the-century small town downtown.” Key goals included protecting single-family
neighborhoods, setting high quality standards for new multi-family housing,
revitalizing and beautifying Thornton Avenue, encouraging development on key
vacant sites, and preserving historic buildings and historic character. Most of the
goals and policies set forth in 1990 continue to be applicable today. However, the
growth of the city and recent trends in shopping and housing require new strategies
to achieve these goals.
More recent studies for Old Town include an Economic Development Strategy Plan
in 1999 and an Infill Housing Study in 2008. Again, the focus of these studies was on
improving the streetscape, enhancing public space, and making Old Town a place to
drive “to” rather than “through.” This was to be achieved in part by creating a
municipal parking lot serving the area’s businesses and creating a public plaza
between Ash Street and the train tracks (where a new fire station now stands). Prior
plans for Old Town also called for a public park within the large open railroad
junction between Sycamore and Ash Streets.
The City will continue to strengthen the Old Town commercial district as a
destination, with a core retail area extending along Thornton from Ash Street to Olive
Street, and more limited commercial areas from Olive to Cherry Street on the east
and from Ash to Elm Streets on the west. The City strongly encourages mixed-use
development in the area between the railroad and Olive, including ground floor
retail with housing above. There is particular interest in attracting a grocery store,
restaurants and cafes, and additional specialty shops to the area. There would be a
greater variety of uses allowed on the blocks of Thornton east of Olive, in order to
keep the retail “core” focused on the area between Olive and Ash Streets.
By filling in vacant lots and attracting more active ground floor uses, the area can
become more appealing to residents and visitors. This will attract investment and can
reduce the number of vacant buildings. Old Town’s revitalization should be
accomplished without losing the “country” feel of the area, adversely affecting
existing small businesses, or using eminent domain. The City should also work with
the railroad to improve the appearance and condition of the large railroad-controlled
properties within this area, potentially adding new fences or walls.
                                                                                                                    LU-25

                                  Because of the age and diversity of its housing stock, Old Town plays an important
                                  role in helping Newark meet its housing goals. It has the oldest homes in the city
                                  and the greatest variety of housing types, affordability levels, and densities. The City
                                  will continue to explore programs which assist residents in older homes with
                                  maintenance and rehabilitation, while encouraging high standards of upkeep for
                                  rental properties. Existing single-family homes and blocks should be protected from
                                  tall or bulky structures through zoning standards and design guidelines. Buildings
                                  should be no more than three stories tall, although some exceptions may be
                                  considered to achieve other General Plan goals.
                                  Several specific properties in Old Town have been identified as Housing Opportunity
                                  Sites in the Newark Housing Element. Further consolidation of these properties is
                                  encouraged to create more viable development sites. New housing on such sites
                                  should enhance the existing mix of units and should include market-rate and
                                  affordable units, and rental and owner-occupied units. Bringing more residents into
                                  the area can provide an expanded customer base to support retailers in the Old
                                  Town district, and create a stronger sense of Old Town as the heart of the city.
                                  Public investment will be needed to catalyze private investment in the Old Town
                                  area. This should include streetscape and façade improvements along Thornton
                                  Avenue, improved street lighting, and new street furnishings such as benches and
                                  seating areas. Sidewalks and curbs should be improved so they are more consistent
                                  and connected, both on Thornton Avenue and along the side streets. Funding for
                                  tree planting and landscaping improvements should also be pursued, utilizing a
                                  variety of grant and capital improvement program options. In the recent past, several
                                  sites have been studied for a pocket park or plaza in this area; alternatives should
                                  continue to be evaluated. The plaza should provide a focal point for Old Town and
                                  an opportunity to commemorate Newark’s history.
                                  Parking and circulation improvements should also be pursued. This could include
                                  the development of a shared parking lot for use by area businesses, and
                                  opportunities to calm (or slow) traffic on Thornton Avenue. Crosswalks and other
                                  improvements should make the area safer for bicyclists and pedestrians. Old Town
                                  Newark was designated as a Priority Development Area by the Association of Bay
                                  Area Governments (ABAG) in 2007, enhancing its competitive position for attracting
                                  regional transportation dollars for such improvements.

The area along Thornton Avenue between Cherry Street and Newark Boulevard may
provide additional opportunities for new infill development in the next 20 years.
Some of the parcels in this corridor are large and contain single story commercial,
medical, or institutional buildings surrounded by parking. Other parcels include small
residences, some of which have already been converted to commercial use.

Greater NewPark Mall includes the 125-acre area bounded by Cedar Boulevard on
the north and west, Interstate 880 on the east and Balentine Drive on the south.
Approximately half of this area consists of the Mall itself, including the perimeter
parking lots. The Mall is ringed by related commercial uses, including restaurants,
hotels, office buildings, and shopping centers. There are also several vacant sites and
buildings in the area, and the Shirley Sisk Eucalyptus Grove Park.
NewPark Mall includes over 1.1 million square feet of floor space and is anchored by
Macy’s, JC Penney, Sears, and Burlington Coat Factory. Since it opened in 1980, it
has been the largest enclosed retail center in Southwest Alameda County and one of
the largest regional malls in the Bay Area. Several of its anchor tenants have closed
or changed hands in recent years, including Target which closed in 2012. Changing
retail trends and competition from newer centers like Pacific Commons and Union
Landing have diminished the Mall’s pre-eminence in the region. This has prompted
the City to explore new ideas for sustaining the Mall’s role as an essential part of
Newark’s economy. The Mall has been Newark’s principal shopping area for three
decades and is an important source of revenue and employment.
In 2012, the City began a visioning process for Greater NewPark Mall. The objective
was to explore the unrealized potential of the area, along with ways to enhance the
success of its retail businesses. Improving the retail climate around NewPark would
not only provide economic benefits, it would also create an exciting destination
within the city. The General Plan calls for completion of the visioning process, to be
undertaken collaboratively with property owners and local businesses, to explore
options for achieving these outcomes.
Ultimately, new land uses could be considered in the NewPark area to complement
the area’s retail focus. Taller buildings may be appropriate in this area to create visual
landmarks and accommodate a more intense level of development than would be
appropriate in Old Town, Four Corners, and other commercial districts.

                                  The NewPark area also provides an opportunity for high-quality architecture that
                                  creates a stronger sense of identity for Newark. Building elevations should
                                  incorporate a variety of forms and textures, and building materials should create a
                                  cohesive character for the area.

                                  In addition to the areas listed above, the Newark Housing Element identified a
                                  number of areas where land use changes are expected in the coming years. These
                                  are profiled below.
                                  CIVIC CENTER
                                  The Newark Civic Center provides a unique development and place making
                                  opportunity. The Civic Center was built in 1966 and includes City Hall, the Public
                                  Library, and an adjoining city park. City Hall does not fully meet Newark’s modern-
                                  day administrative and municipal needs and has a number of seismic safety and
                                  maintenance deficiencies. It could potentially be rebuilt through a public-private
                                  partnership, with the City providing land to offset developer costs. The option of co-
                                  locating School District administrative offices and/or meeting facilities in this complex
                                  has been discussed and should continue to be explored. Other amenities such as a
                                  performing arts center and a rebuilt public library could be incorporated in the
                                  design plan.
                                  Although the City Hall site is designated as “Public/Institutional” on the General Plan
                                  Map, the City strongly supports a design concept which incorporates higher density
                                  residential use. Housing with densities of at least 30 units per acre should be
                                  included in any future site plan. To the extent feasible, the design of a Civic Center
                                  complex should also include plans for the parcels between the Civic Center and
                                  Thornton Avenue. Ideally, the area should be planned as a single, phased
                                  development, helping link City Hall to Old Town and creating a stronger sense of the
                                  entire area as the center of Newark. At least 215 new high-density housing units are
                                  anticipated in this area; additional housing units may be included if feasible.
                                  CEDAR BOULEVARD FROM MOWRY TO CENTRAL
                                  Over the next decade, the east side of Cedar Boulevard between Central Avenue and
                                  the Greater NewPark area is envisioned as transitioning from commercial and
                                  industrial uses to medium and high density residential uses. This area presently

                                                                                                             L A N D U S E
contains two motels, several heavy equipment and machinery service lots, auto
service businesses and body shops, a camper repair business, an RV storage lot, an
overhead door company, mini-warehouses, and similar businesses. The City has
already approved 200 townhomes in this area, and the 2010 Housing Element
identified the potential for over 360 more multi-family units on the industrial sites
and 257 more units on the motel sites.
The General Plan designation of this area was changed through the 2010 Housing
Element. The former industrial sites are shown as Medium Density Residential on the
Land Use Map and the motels are shown as High Density Residential. Development
in this area will need to incorporate visual and acoustical buffers due to proximity to
the Nimitz Freeway. Future air quality studies may be required on a project-by-
project basis.
MAYHEWS LANDING R OAD AND NEWARK BOULEVARD
The intersection of these two thoroughfares has historically been developed with
commercial uses. Its character has become more residential due to changing market
conditions and retail development elsewhere. The 5.4-acre Purity Plaza (Fry’s) site
has already been redeveloped with housing, and the former gas station on the
corner has been closed. The gas station site has been cleaned to residential
standards and is designated for Medium Density Residential uses. Across the street is
the underperforming Old Town Shopping Center. The 5-acre site is likewise
designated for Medium Density Residential use, creating an opportunity for
townhomes or garden apartments in the future. A buffer of single-family homes
should be included in the rear portion of the development, to provide a transition to
the lower density neighborhood to the west.
NEWARK UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FACILITIES
The NUSD owns a number of properties in Newark which may transition to new
uses in the next two decades. Among them are the NUSD administrative offices,
which are located on a 3-acre site on Musick Avenue just south of Musick School.
Although the property has not yet been declared excess by the School District, it has
been designated for Low Density Residential Uses on the Land Use Map. This would
permit its reuse for single-family homes in the event the School District offices are
relocated.
                                                                                                                     LU-29

                                  Several blocks to the west is the 7.7-acre Ruschin School campus. The school was
                                  built in the 1970s but has not been operated as an elementary school since 1989.
                                  The School Board has discussed the possible sale of the site. It has been designated
                                  for Low Density Residential uses on the Land Use Map. In the event the site is
                                  redeveloped, a portion of the school playfields should be preserved as a
                                  neighborhood park.
                                  The third school property with the potential for change is the 7.3-acre NUSD
                                  Corporation Yard, located at the west end of Birch Street. The site is likewise
                                  designated for Low Density Residential use on the Land Use Map, and could support
                                  an estimated 53 homes. Such a development would only occur if the School District
                                  relocates its Corporation Yard to another site and declares the site excess.
                                  Development on any of the NUSD properties would require detailed site planning,
                                  environmental, and traffic studies, and would be the subject of subsequent
                                  evaluations. These evaluations would include public hearings and opportunities for
                                  public comment, as well as specific design proposals for each site. In each case,
                                  future development should be comparable in character and density to the
                                  surrounding single-family neighborhoods. In the event that these sites are not sold,
                                  the existing School District uses are also considered compatible with the Low Density
                                  Residential designation.
                                  DESIGN AND PRESERVATION
                                  This section of the Land Use Element addresses the factors that define Newark’s
                                  character, including its architecture, streets and public spaces, landscapes, and
                                  historic buildings. Collectively, these features create a sense of place that
                                  distinguishes Newark from other Bay Area cities. One of the goals of the General
                                  Plan is to strengthen this sense of place so the city is perceived as more distinctive
                                  from neighboring cities. Newark should be a place that people remember and want
                                  to return to. The City is especially interested in establishing stronger connections to
                                  San Francisco Bay, reinforcing Old Town as a historic community center, and
                                  reshaping the NewPark vicinity to make it a more vibrant regional destination.
                                  C REATING A S TRONGER S ENSE OF P LACE
                                  An important strategy for improving Newark’s distinct identity is to strengthen city
                                  gateways. Key gateways include the portions of Thornton Avenue and Newark
                                  Boulevard between State Route 84 and Jarvis Avenue, and the sections of Thornton
LU-30

                                                                                        N E W A R K G E N E R A L P L A N
                                                                                                             L A N D U S E
Avenue, Mowry Avenue, and Stevenson Boulevard just west of Interstate 880. The
City has invested in gateway signage and landscaping at most of these locations, and
has installed banners on light poles to create a sense of arrival. Newark also has an
Art in Public Places program, intended to beautify the community and provide space
for creative expression. Several outdoor sculptures have been installed at the Silliman
Recreation Center and at the intersection of Newark and Jarvis. The potential for
additional public art exists throughout the community and should continue to be
explored.
Newark’s street system also shapes the City’s identity. It provides Newark’s defining
views and vistas and provides a visual connection between the “public realm” and
private property. Overall, Newark’s streets are attractively landscaped and well
maintained. Thoroughfares include planted medians and mature trees, which
enhance aesthetics, provide shade, reduce reflected heat, and soften the visual
quality of the street environment. Newark has been named a “Tree City” by the
National Arbor Day Foundation for the last 25 years. The City has also invested in
street furnishings, such as lighting, benches, and trash cans, to improve safety and
provide functional benefits for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists. Additional
investment is encouraged, not only to make the streets safer and more functional,
but also to better define commercial districts and make the city more welcoming to
pedestrians.
Establishing a stronger sense of place is a neighborhood-level goal as well as a
citywide goal. While some of Newark’s neighborhoods, such as the Lake District and
Old Town, have a distinct identity, others are more homogeneous and are not clearly
distinguished from one another. The General Plan supports greater recognition of
the different neighborhoods and business districts that comprise the city. This
includes shopping centers and technology park areas, as well as residential areas.
Areas such as Pacific Research Center, Stevenson Point Business Park, Four Corners,
and NewPark Mall will continue to evolve in the future, with high quality
contemporary architecture that enhances the city’s reputation as a great place to
work and do business.
Finally, Newark’s location as a bayside city should become a more integral part of its
identity. Opportunities to improve connections to the Bay may be realized through
development of the Dumbarton TOD and Southwest Newark Residential and
Recreational Project, and through continued development of the Bay Trail and spur
                                                                                                                     LU-31

L A N D U S E
                                  trails. The Bay and its sloughs are important visual and recreational resources, and
                                  will be more prominently highlighted as community assets in the future.
                                  L AND U SE C OMPATIBILITY
                                  One of the purposes of the General Plan is to maintain and enhance the character of
                                  Newark’s established residential neighborhoods. This does not mean that existing
                                  neighborhoods will remain exactly as they are today. Property owners will be
                                  encouraged to invest in their homes and new projects will be encouraged on vacant
                                  lots and parcels that are not developed to their fullest potential. Homes will continue
                                  to be expanded and adapted to reflect changing design trends and household
                                  needs. The goal is to ensure that alternations and infill development respects its
                                  context, enhances neighborhood character, and mitigates impacts on surrounding
                                  properties.
                                  Most of Newark is characterized by low-density residential neighborhoods, with most
                                  homes constructed between the mid-1950s and late 1970s. Homes are typically one
                                  to two stories with front lawns and backyards, creating a suburban character that is
                                  valued by residents. Infill development should generally be consistent in scale and
                                  character with what is around it, but does not need to match it exactly. Architectural
                                  variety and diversity is encouraged. Factors such as privacy, noise, shadows,
                                  landscaping, views and the quality of exterior materials will be important
                                  considerations in determining what constitutes a compatible structure or addition.
                                  Non-residential uses such as churches and large childcare centers will continue to be
                                  allowed in residential areas, as they are today. The City will continue to administer
                                  permitting procedures which ensure that the public is involved when such facilities
                                  are proposed, and that impacts on parking, traffic, noise, and other factors are
                                  appropriately mitigated.
                                  Beyond established residential neighborhoods, Newark has an opportunity to
                                  introduce new forms of development and new architectural themes that do not exist
                                  in the city today. This is particularly true in the Dumbarton TOD area, but it is also
                                  true around NewPark Mall, in Southwest Newark, and even in the city’s industrial
                                  districts. There are opportunities to explore more innovative approaches to
                                  community design in these areas. These locations provide opportunities for taller
                                  buildings, contemporary architecture, and new landmarks which help define Newark.
                                  There may also be opportunities to “reinvent” older neighborhood shopping centers,
                                  particularly those that are dated or have high vacancy rates. Such centers can

potentially be redesigned so they are more pedestrian-oriented, better connected to
nearby neighborhoods, and provide gathering places for the neighborhoods they
serve.
H ISTORIC P RESERVATION
Newark has had an official Historic Preservation Program since 1989. The City’s
Municipal Code includes procedures for the designation, modification, and
demolition of historic resources. The City also has established criteria to designate
historic resources as primary or secondary landmarks depending on such factors as
the age of the resource and its relationship to a historic event, person, or
architectural style.
The greatest concentration of older buildings is in Old Town, which is the area
roughly bounded by Cherry Street on the east, Spruce Street on the west, the
Newark Slough (flood control channel) on the north and the railroad on the south.
The heart of this area is the Thornton Avenue commercial district between Ash Street
and Olive Street. However, the entire Old Town area includes homes and
commercial buildings representing a variety of architectural styles including
Craftsman Bungalows, Mission Revival and Queen Anne cottages, and traditional
“Main Street” style commercial buildings. The 2010 US Census reported that there
were 343 homes in Newark built in 1939 or earlier.
When the City of Newark established its preservation program, it identified 42
buildings of historic merit in Old Town. Two of these—St. Edward’s Church/Rose of
Sharon Chapel (7160 Graham Avenue) and the James Graham residence (7705 A/B
Thornton)—were listed on a local register. However, neither these structures nor any
of the others have been formally nominated to the National Register of Historic
Places or the California Register of Historic Resources. There may be other potentially
eligible structures in Newark, including some of the city’s older industrial buildings
and transportation facilities related to the railroad and Dumbarton Bridge. The
railroad has been in place since 1878, and the first rail bridge across the Bay dates to
                                                                             th
1910. In addition, much of the city’s building stock dates from the mid-20 Century;
such structures are now more than 50 years old, and some may meet state and
federal criteria for historic significance.
                                                                                                                      LU-33

N E W A R K G E N E R A L P L A N
L A N D U S E
                                  The importance of historic resources will grow as Newark matures and more
                                  structures become eligible. Preservation not only provides a link to the past and a
                                  reminder of local history, it also is an important part of establishing a unique identity
                                  for the city. Preservation can be an economic development tool, a sustainable
                                  development tool, the basis for heritage tourism, and a source of civic pride. General
                                  Plan policies seek to increase recognition of historic resources and avoid demolition,
                                  either purposefully or by neglect through disinvestment. Policies further seek to
                                  reinforce the historic character of Old Town by respecting, and where appropriate
                                  replicating, traditional architectural styles and elements. Greater awareness of local
                                  history is also strongly supported, through educational programs, special events,
                                  markers, and walking tours.

GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
Q UALITY OF L IFE
GOAL LU-1        Maintain a desirable quality of life in Newark by preserving
                 a small town, neighborhood-oriented atmosphere and
                 sustaining a balanced mix of land uses.
P OLICIES
Policy LU-1.1    Balance of Uses. Maintain a reasonable balance of land uses in the
                 city so that residents can live close to where they work and satisfy their
                 shopping, educational, personal, health, entertainment, and
                 recreational needs close to home.
Policy LU-1.2    Growth Focus Areas. Achieve a future growth pattern which includes
                 new neighborhoods on vacant land along the southern and western
                 edges of the city, and infill development in transit-served areas such as
                 Old Town and the Greater NewPark Mall Area. Zoning and
                 development review decisions should recognize these areas as the
                 priority locations for growth and change over the next 20 years.
Policy LU-1.3    Jobs-Housing Balance. Seek to balance housing and job growth. The
                 City should strive to have a roughly equal number of jobs and
                 employed residents, with a mix of housing types that meets the needs
                 of the local workforce.
                  In 2010, ABAG estimated that the Bay Area had 2,608,000
                  households and 3,385,000 jobs, or a ratio of 1.30 jobs per
                  household. In Newark, the ratio was 1.33, which is just above the
                  regional average. The City will continue to strive to maintain a jobs-
                  housing ratio which is close to the regional average, yielding roughly

                                  Policy LU-1.7  Executive Housing. Develop and maintain a range of housing types
                                                 in the city, including executive housing which provides residents with
                                                 opportunities for "move up" housing within the city.
                                  Policy LU-1.8  Housing Opportunity Sites. Ensure that adequate sites are provided
                                                 for the private and non-profit sectors to develop housing for seniors,
                                                 persons with disabilities, and lower income households. Such housing
                                                 should be well designed and managed, and located in a manner that

                                                 and best use, consistent with the designations shown on the General
                                                 Plan Diagram. Future growth in the city should generally be directed
                                                 to the areas identified in this General Plan.

                                                 points and gathering places for neighborhoods, and create identity
                                                 and a stronger sense of place for the city. Centers may include
                                                 shopping areas, parks and public facilities, mixed-use districts, and
                                                 other amenities that meet the diverse needs of Newark residents and

                                                 these areas with existing uses and adjacent neighborhoods, and which
                                                 includes a mix of uses that makes these areas more conductive to

               storage, linear parks, and utility functions only.
Policy LU-1.14 Cost Recovery. Ensure that new development generates sufficient
               revenue and pays its reasonable share to offset its cost impacts on
               public services and facilities.
Policy LU-1.15 Mixed-Use. Provide opportunities for development combining
               residential and commercial uses (e.g. "mixed-use" development) in
               areas where the impacts of one land use on the other and the impacts
               on nearby neighborhoods can be sufficiently mitigated.
Policy LU-1.16 Planned Unit Development. Use the planned unit development
               approach or form based zoning codes to accommodate attractive,
               creative development on sites where traditional zoning standards do
               not achieve the best design solution.
Policy LU-1.17 Sustainable Development Emphasis. Ensure that new development
               incorporates green building and sustainable design principles and
               encourage renovation of existing development to use water and
               energy more efficiently. Newark will reduce dependence on fossil fuels
               by citing homes, jobs, shopping, and services within walking distance
               of each other, and developing a circulation network that encourages
               walking, bicycling, and transit use.
A CTIONS
Action LU-1.A  Zoning Update. Update the Newark zoning regulations as needed to
               implement General Plan Map and policy changes. This could include
               the development of additional mixed-use districts to implement
               General Plan Map designations and form based zoning codes.
               Newark's zoning regulations should ensure that the city remains an
               attractive location for business, while protecting the quality and value
               of Newark's neighborhoods.
Action LU-1.B  Environmental Review. Use established environmental review
               processes and programs to minimize the potential impacts of any new
               development to levels that are determined acceptable.

                                  Action LU-1.D  Minimum Densities. Set minimum residential densities in all areas
                                                 designated on the General Plan Diagram for medium- to high-density
                                                 residential use, and for mixed-use development. The minimum
                                                 densities will ensure that this land supply is used as efficiently as
                                                 possible and will help ensure that the city meets its adopted housing

Policy LU-2.3 High-Quality Development. Maintain standards for medium-density,
              high-density, and mixed-use development that ensure high quality
              development and adequate buffering and screening from nearby
              lower density uses.
Policy LU-2.4 Buffering from Transportation Facilities. Ensure that the design of
              new residential development near rail lines, truck routes, freeways, or
              major thoroughfares includes setbacks, landscape screening, and
              other provisions to minimize exposure to negative impacts such as
              noise and air pollution.
Policy LU-2.5 Transitional Land Uses. Incorporate transitional land uses as buffers
              between land uses which are potentially incompatible. For example,
              this could include office uses as a buffer between industrial and
              residential areas, and medium density residential uses as a buffer
              between high and low density residential uses.
Policy LU-2.6 Scale Transition. Avoid abrupt transitions from taller buildings to low-
              rise buildings, especially where commercial and higher density
              housing abuts neighborhoods characterized by one-story homes.
              Buildings taller than three stories should be required to step down in
              height when located adjacent to single-family lots. Overpowering
              contrasts in scale and height between adjacent lots should be avoided.
Policy LU-2.7 Design Guidelines. Maintain design guidelines and a design review
              process that applies to building and site design throughout the city.
Policy LU-2.8 Relating Density to Transit Service. Allow higher residential densities
              in areas with more frequent and reliable public transit service, and
              ensure that public transit services are expanded in areas where growth
              is projected.
Policy LU-2.9 Home-Based Businesses. Permit home-based businesses, provided
              that off-site impacts are minimized and the residential nature of
              structures and their surroundings is not compromised.
               Home-based businesses, also called home occupations, are defined
               by the Newark zoning code. They include business services provided
               from an individual’s residence, and the hand-crafting of products in
               an individual’s home. Typical home-based businesses might include
               consulting practices, accountants, artist studios, photographers,
               music instructors, and similar activities. Home-based businesses are

Policy LU-4.2 Connectivity. Improve connectivity between neighborhoods and
              commercial districts so that the city’s shopping areas function as
              neighborhood gathering places and focal points. Over time, shopping
              centers which are oriented exclusively to auto traffic should be
              redesigned so they are more pedestrian friendly and better integrated
              with the uses around them.
Policy LU-4.3 Urban Centers. Create locations in Newark which are more urban
              and pedestrian-oriented in character than they are today. Such areas
              include the future Dumbarton Transit Oriented Development and Old
              Town. These areas should be transformed over time into mixed-use
              centers with retail, office, civic, and higher density housing uses.
Policy LU-4.4 Greater NewPark Area. Modernize the Greater NewPark Area to
              create a vibrant regional retail location which provides urban
              amenities and gathering places. A mixture of higher density housing,
              office, hotel, entertainment, civic, and other uses should be
              encouraged, to the extent that these uses enhance regional retail as
              the primary use and assist in the area’s revitalization.
Policy LU-4.5 Gateways. Maintain high standards for the design and appearance of
              development at major gateways into Newark, and along major
              arterials. Public art, landscaping, paving, lighting, and signage should
              be used to create a positive visual impression at these locations.
               Gateways make an important first impression and can define a city's
               image for residents, businesses, and visitors. They help define the
               edges of the city and establish it as a unique place. Design elements
               such as landscaping, contouring, signage, entry monuments, and
               lighting can enhance visibility and make city entry points more
               dramatic and memorable. Newark’s gateways should convey an
               image of high quality and lasting value.
Policy LU-4.6 Streetscapes. Ensure that medians, sidewalks, planting strips and
              other areas within the right-of-way of major thoroughfares are
              attractively landscaped and well maintained.
Policy LU-4.7 Lighting. Manage exterior lighting to reduce potential light and glare
              impacts, improve public safety, and enhance the character of the
              streetscape.
               Exterior lighting includes streetlights for roads and parking areas,

                                                 community building and social interaction. This should include parks,

                                  Policy LU-4.11 Activating the Street. Incorporate streetscape features in the Old
                                                 Town Newark, NewPark Mall, and future Dumbarton TOD areas that
                                                 support active street life and a stronger sense of place. This includes
                                                 wider sidewalks, ground floor retail stores with display windows
                                                 oriented to pedestrians, outdoor dining areas, special landscaping and
                                                 lighting standards, street furniture, and other amenities. Streetscape
                                                 improvements should minimize the impacts of vehicle traffic on
                                                 adjacent properties and make walking more enjoyable and

                                  Policy LU-4.12 Fences and Gates. Ensure that fences, gates, railings, walls, and other
                                                 site elements intended to provide safety, security, and privacy are
                                                 designed to be compatible with each other, with adjacent structures,
                                                 and with the neighborhood context. Fence, wall, or hedge designs
                                                 which obscure lines of sight for motorists, or create potential conflicts
                                                 between pedestrians and cars, should be avoided.
                                  Policy LU-4.13 Bayfront Identity. Reinforce Newark’s identity as a bayfront city by
                                                 orienting new development on the western and southern edges of the
                                                 city toward the bay and shoreline areas. Future projects in these areas
                                                 should enhance views to the water and wetlands and be compatible
                                                 with the area’s scenic and recreational qualities. The bayfront identity
                                                 should be emphasized in gateways and public art as well.

Action LU-4.A  Gateway Improvement Plans. Develop special design standards and
               improvement plans for entry points and gateways into the City,
               including Thornton Avenue, Newark Boulevard, and Cherry Street, and
               the existing gateways at Mowry Avenue and Stevenson Boulevard.
               These standards should provide for enhanced landscaping, signage,
               and art at these locations in order to reinforce a sense of arrival. Public
               private partnerships should be explored as a way of implementing and
               funding these improvements.
Action LU-4.B  Reducing Light and Glare Impacts. Use development regulations
               and design review procedures to reduce light and glare impacts from
               new development. Design review procedures should encourage less
               intense lighting where security needs allow, restricting the height and
               direction of exterior fixtures to minimize light spill, shielding for
               exterior lights, minimizing the use of highly reflective exterior
               materials, and restricting hours of non-security exterior lighting for
               commercial, industrial, and institutional uses.
Action LU-4.C  Lighting Improvements. Identify priority locations for lighting
               improvements along streets, in parks, and in public places to address
               public concerns about safety.
Action LU-4.D  Public Art Program. Continue to implement a public art program
               which installs art that is accessible or visible to the public. Such art
               should be conveniently or prominently situated in public places and
               new developments.
                Public art is defined as any work of art displayed in an open area or
                on the exterior of any facility, public area, lobby, or public assembly
                area on City or privately owned property. It should be visible or
                accessible to the public and typically includes such components as
                sculpture, statuary, fountains, murals, and landscape elements.

                                                  follow appropriate mitigation, preservation, and recovery procedures
                                                  in the event that important resources are identified during
                                                  development.

                                                 the area's role as a walkable business district. A mix of office, retail,
                                                 and upper story residential uses should be encouraged.
                                                 The City encourages the consolidation of commercial properties
                                                 along Thornton Avenue to enable development of new commercial
                                                 and higher density mixed-use projects. Higher densities along
                                                 Thornton are desired to help support adjacent commercial uses and

Policy LU-8.5 Thornton Avenue Streetscape. Consider streetscape and traffic
              improvements to Thornton Avenue between the Union Pacific
              Railroad and Olive Street which improve pedestrian safety and
              comfort, reduce vehicle speed, and enhance the character of the area
              as a "walking" street.
              Street improvements in this area should balance the needs of cars,
              bicycles, transit users, and pedestrians and reinforce Old Town's role
              as a destination rather than a conduit for pass- through traffic. In
              particular, changes in street design should minimize curb cuts,
              maximize on-street parking, and accommodate pedestrians without
              damaging street trees and landscaping.
Policy LU-8.6 Old Town Civic Space. Create civic gathering places, outdoor seating
              areas, fountains, and other public spaces in Old Town Newark which
              contribute to the area's role as the historic center of the city, and make
              it a more attractive destination for Newark residents, workers, and
              visitors. Once constructed, such spaces should be programmed for
              civic events which draw people to the area and create more active
              street life.
Policy LU-8.7 Railroad Heritage. Recognize the railroad as a primary factor in the
              early development of Old Town, and commemorate its role through
              architecture, historic preservation, and streetscape design. \
Policy LU-8.8 Old Town Residential Area. Beyond Thornton Avenue, create
              attractively maintained, well lit, tree-lined residential streets that
              encourage people to walk to Old Town.
Policy LU-8.9 Merchant and Resident Involvement. Encourage the participation of
              merchants and residents in the Old Town area in the planning process
              and the review of future use permits and large development project
              applications.

                                                historic character. Guidelines should promote denser mixed-use
                                                development along Thornton Avenue and lower density development

                                                For properties along Thornton Avenue, design guidelines should
                                                encourage mixed uses which reflect the traditional massing and scale
                                                of Old Town while still allowing for contemporary architecture. For

                                                are present. This could include allowing larger second units rather
                                                than duplexes, and encouraging small multi-family developments on

INTRODUCTION
State law requires that local general plans include a Circulation Element. As
prescribed by the Government Code, the Element must address “the general
location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation
routes, terminals, and other local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the
land use element of the plan.” The Newark General Plan covers public utilities and
facilities in a separate Element, allowing this Element to focus on transportation. The
Element also covers broader issues related to travel in and around the city,
connections between Newark and the region, and the way that transportation shapes
Newark’s form and identity.
Newark is served by an interconnected transportation system that connects homes
and businesses to local and regional destinations via freeways, roads, trails, rail, and
public transportation. The safety and efficiency of this system is essential to Newark’s
quality of life and the health of the local economy. The Transportation Element
provides the policies needed to improve mobility and accessibility as the city grows,
and to diversify capital investments so that other modes of travel become more
viable. By improving conditions for bicycles, pedestrians, and transit users while also
improving conditions for motorists, the city can become safer, more attractive, more
connected, and more sustainable.
The shift to a “multi-modal” transportation system recognizes that Newark residents
have different mobility needs and physical capabilities. The city’s residents include
students, disabled persons, and senior citizens who may not be able to drive.
Newark also includes commuters seeking alternatives to freeway traffic, a local
workforce using public transportation, and many residents who would prefer to walk
or bicycle when making short trips, rather than using their cars.
Like other elements of the General Plan, this chapter is organized into two parts. Part
One provides an overview of the existing transportation system and the different
                                                                                              T-1

                                    modes of travel within Newark. It also includes projections and priorities for the
                                    future. Traffic forecasts for the year 2035 are presented, and specific
                                    recommendations are made to keep the transportation system operating at
                                    acceptable levels.
                                    The second part of the chapter includes transportation goals, policies, and actions.
                                    The intent of the policies is to ensure that transportation and land use decisions are
                                    coordinated and that transportation services and facilities are improved in a way that
                                    serves all Newark residents and businesses. Policies are organized around seven
                                    major themes, including:
                                          Creating a street network that enhances Newark’s sense of place, connects the
                                           city, protects neighborhoods from high traffic volumes and speeds, and meets
                                           the needs of all travelers.
                                          Providing a citywide pedestrian and bicycle system that can be safely used for
                                           day-to-day trips as well as recreational travel.
                                          Improving the public transportation system, including the development of
                                           new services and better access to existing services.
                                          Reducing the number of vehicle miles traveled by Newark residents and
                                           workers by providing more non-automobile travel options and more efficient
                                           land use patterns.
                                          Maintaining vehicle flow and reducing congestion through improvement of
                                           roads.
                                          Leveraging Newark’s transportation assets for economic development and job
                                           creation.
                                          Managing parking in a way that supports local businesses and meets the
                                           needs of Newark residents.

                                    Newark’s location at the east end of the Dumbarton Bridge mid-way between San
                                    Francisco-Oakland and San Jose has influenced the development of the city and the
                                    transportation needs of its residents and businesses. The City depends on the
                                    regional transportation network for the movement of people and goods across the
                                    region, state, nation, and globe.

Two major freeways link Newark to the rest of the Bay Area and California. Interstate
880 (I-880) is located on the east side of the city and provides a direct connection to
San Jose to the south and Oakland to the north. State Route (SR) 84 is a major
gateway to the job centers of northern Santa Clara and southern San Mateo Counties
on the other side of the Dumbarton Bridge. SR 84 also provides an easterly
connection to the Tri-Valley area of Livermore, Dublin, and Pleasanton. Newark is
within 20 miles of three international airports and 5 miles of two BART stations. It is
crossed by an Amtrak line, an Altamont Commuter Express line, and two Union
Pacific freight rail corridors.

The context for transportation planning in the city is further defined by federal, state,
and regional agencies. At the federal level, the US Department of Transportation
oversees transportation funding and ensures the safety and efficiency of the nation’s
highways, airports, rail lines, and ports. At the state level, the California
Transportation Commission (CTC) sets transportation priorities and prepares the
State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), a multi-year capital improvement
program. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) manages more
than 45,000 miles of highway and freeway lanes, provides intercity rail services,
permits more than 400 public use airports and special-use hospital heliports, and
works with local agencies to manage local transportation projects. State regulations
also establish design standards for highways, access standards for public roadways,
and the requirements for regional transportation planning.
At the regional level, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) is tasked
with developing a Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) which identifies transportation
investments for the next 25 years. The regional plan calls for improving road
conditions, retrofitting bridges, upgrading rail stations, expanding the bus network,
and providing new pedestrian infrastructure. The Plan also calls for greater
transportation efficiency through electronic toll collection, HOV lanes, and ramp
improvements. Additionally, in collaboration with the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG), MTC adopted a regional Sustainable Communities Strategy
(SCS) in July 2013.
Another regional agency with transportation oversight is the Bay Area Air Quality
Management District (BAAQMD). BAAQMD’s 2010 Clean Air Plan identifies
strategies to reduce air pollution through land use and transportation strategies
                                                                                                                            T-3

                                    which reduce the necessity of driving and encourage low-emission transportation
                                    modes.
                                    At the county level, transportation planning is guided by the Alameda County
                                    Transportation Commission (Alameda CTC). In accordance with State law, Alameda
                                    CTC prepares and updates a Congestion Management Program (CMP) every two
                                    years. The CMP establishes performance standards for different modes of
                                    transportation, a capital improvement program, and a travel demand management
                                    (TDM) program for Alameda County. Alameda CTC also manages the County’s half-
                                    cent transportation sales tax, which is used to support capital projects and
                                    operations. It distributes funds to cities and other agencies for streets, transit, special
                                    needs transportation, bicycle, and pedestrian safety projects, and transit-oriented
                                    development (TOD).
                                    At the local level, the City of Newark is responsible for the planning, maintenance,
                                    and operation of the local roadway system. The City has adopted roadway design
                                    standards through its Municipal Code. Chapter 16.12 of the Code includes
                                    requirements for street width for various roadway types, grading, and access, as well
                                    as standards for sidewalks and cul-de-sacs.

                                    Although Newark has a roughly equal number of jobs and employed residents, a
                                    majority of its residents commute to other cities for work each day. Census
                                    transportation planning data indicates that only 12 percent of the city’s employed
                                    residents actually work in Newark. About half of the city’s residents work in Alameda
                                    County and about half commute elsewhere. Many Newark residents commute west
                                    across the Dumbarton Bridge or south along I-880 to job centers in Fremont,
                                    Milpitas, San Jose, and elsewhere in Silicon Valley. Likewise, those commuting in to
                                    Newark for work begin and end their trips in other parts of the Bay Area, or in
                                    locations as far away as San Joaquin and Stanislaus Counties.
                                    The dispersed pattern of jobs and households in the Bay Area creates complex travel
                                    patterns on local freeways. According to the Alameda CTC, the segment of I-880 just
                                    south of the City between Auto Mall Parkway and Mission Boulevard is one of the
                                    ten most congested freeway segments in the county. The heaviest traffic is in the
                                    southbound direction in the morning and the northbound direction in the afternoon.

Traffic is also heavy in both directions on SR 84 between I-880 and the Dumbarton
Bridge.
Chart T-1 provides information on how Newark residents travel to work, based on
2007-2011 sample data from the US Census. The data indicates 78 percent of the
city’s residents drove alone to work. About 13 percent of the city’s residents
carpooled and 4 percent took public transportation. Less than 2 percent of Newark’s
residents worked at home and less than 2 percent walked or bicycled to work. These
statistics are similar to those in nearby communities. In fact, the percent of work trips
made by solo drivers is more than 70 percent in almost every city in the region
outside of Oakland, Berkeley, and San Francisco.

Census data further indicates that the median travel time to work for Newark
residents was 26 minutes. About 40 percent of the city’s residents had one-way
commutes of 30 to 60 minutes, and 5 percent had commutes longer than one hour
in each direction.

                                    Newark’s street network consists of a hierarchy of arterial, collector, and local streets.
                                    In addition, regional access to the city is provided by freeways. Components of the
                                    street network are profiled below. Figure T-1 shows the existing network.

                                    Freeways are dedicated exclusively to vehicle movement with no property access.
                                    They are typically high speed/high capacity transportation facilities serving regional
                                    traffic. Intersections with other roadways are grade separated and are spaced and
                                    designed to maintain smooth traffic flow. Newark is served by two freeways, both
                                    operated and maintained by Caltrans.

                                    Most of the I-880 interchanges were reconstructed between 1990 and 2010 to
                                    handle additional volume. Ramp meters have been installed and capacity has been
                                    increased. In 2012, approximately 200,000 vehicles a day traveled on I-880 in the
                                    Newark vicinity.
                                    SR 84 is a six-lane east-west freeway with three lanes in each direction and a
                                    westbound HOV lane. Full access interchanges are located at Thornton
                                    Avenue/Paseo Padre Parkway and at Newark Boulevard/Ardenwood Boulevard along
                                    the north edge of Newark. SR 84 becomes the Dumbarton Bridge just west of the
                                    city. According to the 2012 Caltrans Traffic Volume Book, the freeway has an average
                                    volume of 61,000 vehicles a day at Thornton Avenue.
                                    A RTERIALS
                                    Arterials carry large traffic volumes within and through urban areas. They are
                                    designed to operate at efficient speeds and to link neighborhoods, shopping areas,
                                    and employment districts to the freeways and to each other. The principal objective
                                    for an urban arterial is mobility, rather than access to adjoining properties. To keep
                                    traffic moving smoothly, ingress and egress may be limited.
                                    Backup walls are included along some of Newark’s arterials to buffer the rear yards
                                    of adjoining residences and provide definition to the street right of way. The city has
                                    placed a high priority on landscaping the area between the edge of the curb and the
                                    backup wall, as these areas are an important part of Newark’s visual character.
                                    Additional back-up walls are programmed for construction in the coming years along
                                    a number of the city’s arterials.
                                    Newark’s arterials are profiled below.
                                           Stevenson Boulevard is an east-west roadway located on the city’s southern
                                            boundary. Between I-880 and Cedar Boulevard, Stevenson Boulevard has
                                            raised medians, six travel lanes, and turn lanes at major intersections. At Cedar
                                            Boulevard, the roadway narrows to four travel lanes. This configuration

  combination of raised medians and two-way turn lanes, continuing across
  I-880 until it terminates at Fremont Boulevard.
 Thornton Avenue crosses Newark on a curved alignment. It enters the city
  from Fremont on the west at the SR 84 overcrossing, where it provides a
  continuation of Paseo Padre Parkway. From SR 84, the road curves in a
  southeasterly alignment to Willow Street. Just before that point, the road turns
  northeast. Between Willow and Sycamore Streets, Thornton Avenue has one
  lane in each direction and a two-way left turn lane in the center. It widens to
  three travel lanes east of Sycamore and then to four lanes east of Cherry
  Street. The street continues as a four-lane roadway across I-880 and into
  Fremont on the east.
 Jarvis Avenue is an east-west arterial that extends between Gateway Boulevard
  and Lake Boulevard. Jarvis Avenue provides access to residential, commercial,
  and light industrial areas, and has four travel lanes between Gateway
  Boulevard and Cardiff Street, with a combination of raised medians and two-
  way turn lanes. The roadway narrows to two lanes as it extends northeasterly
  to Lake Boulevard.
 Gateway Boulevard is classified as an arterial for the four-lane segment
  between Jarvis and Thornton Avenues. North of Jarvis, it is a two-lane collector
  road that extends to Fircrest Street.

                                    Classification System as arterial streets. The City will coordinate with Caltrans to
                                    modify the classifications for these streets and to make other adjustments to arterial
                                    designations as appropriate.

                                    Collector streets provide access to individual parcels but also move traffic through
                                    residential, commercial, and industrial areas. They connect arterials with local streets,
                                    and typically serve short trips from homes to activity centers. In some cases,
                                    collectors incorporate the design features of an arterial but are shorter in length with

lower volumes. In other cases, collectors may resemble local streets, with driveways
to abutting properties. Streets currently classified as collectors include Brittany
Avenue/Cherry Street (north of Thornton), Carter Avenue/Filbert Street, Edgewater
Drive, Enterprise Drive, Fircrest Street, Gateway Boulevard (east of Jarvis Avenue),
Haley Street/Sycamore Street, Hickory Street, Joaquin Murieta Avenue, Lafayette
Avenue, Lake Boulevard, Lido Boulevard, Mayhews Landing Road (east of Spruce
Street), Smith Avenue (east of Cherry Street), Spruce Street (north of Thornton
Avenue), and Willow Street (south of Thornton Avenue). Other streets that could be
considered as collector streets by the City based on current and future uses include
Balentine Drive, Bettencourt Street, Birch Street, Bridgepointe Drive, Moores Avenue,
Robertson Avenue, Ruschin Drive, and Wells Avenue.
Figure T-1 identifies all of these segments, although not all were recognized as
collectors by the Federal Highway Administration at the time the General Plan was
adopted. The City will coordinate with Caltrans to make adjustments to the FHWA
collector street designations and overall segment limits.
L OCAL S TREETS
Local streets provide access to property. Movement is incidental and involves
traveling to and from collector streets. Frequent driveways and curb cuts may be
present. Local streets carry relatively low volumes of cars and should be designed to
emphasize walking, bicycling, and safe access to abutting parcels. All streets that are
not classified as either arterial or collector streets are considered local streets.
M OVING T OWARD “C OMPLETE S TREETS ”
Much of Newark was developed during the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, an era when auto
convenience and speed was the highest transportation priority. This system has
served the city well, but it will need to evolve to meet new mobility needs and
respond to future challenges.
In 2008, the California legislature passed the “Complete Streets Act,” requiring
transportation planning to consider the needs of all road users. The vision for
Newark, as in other California communities, is to transform local thoroughfares by
incorporating sidewalks, crosswalks, space for bicycles, and other amenities that
make it safer and easier to travel without a car. This concept is applicable to the
design of all streets, but it has the most far-reaching effects on the design of arterial
and collector streets.
                                                                                                                           T-11

T R A N S P O R T A T I O N
                                    The Complete Streets concept also considers the needs of children, seniors, persons
                                    with disabilities, and non-drivers in the design of the transportation system.
                                    Complete streets also support complementary General Plan goals, including creating
                                    a stronger sense of identity in Newark, enhancing public safety by reducing accident
                                    hazards, and improving public health by making the city more walkable.
                                    In March 2013, the Newark City Council adopted a citywide Complete Streets Policy,
                                    with the vision that “All transportation improvements in the City of Newark will be
                                    planned, funded, designed, constructed, operated and maintained to provide safe
                                    mobility for all users appropriate to the function and context of the facility.” As part
                                    of the policy, the City has established complete streets principles, including:
                                           Serving all users and modes, including pedestrians, bicyclists, persons with
                                            disabilities, motorists, movers of commercial goods and freight, transit riders
                                            and operators, emergency responders, seniors, children, youth, and families;
                                           Responding to context, such that roadway features and amenities are reflective
                                            of the surrounding area, working with key stakeholders;
                                           Addressing complete streets as part of routine procedure for all city
                                            departments; and
                                           Ensuring that all projects and project phases, with appropriate limited
                                            exceptions, account for and respond to complete streets policies and
                                            requirements.
                                    The City of Newark has also adopted traffic calming measures to reduce traffic and
                                    speeding in residential areas and along collector streets. The City offers six potential
                                    traffic-calming measures, listed in descending order of preference: (1) resident
                                    education and selective speed limit enforcement, (2) street centerline striping, (3)
                                                                      1
                                    stop signs, (4) chicanes , (5) center islands/medians, and (6) speed bumps.
                                    Requests may be initiated by residents and are subject to evaluation by the City
                                    Engineer based on appropriateness for a specific street. For speed bumps, at least
                                    two-thirds of the residents on a street or street segment must sign a petition before
                                    they can be considered. Traffic studies may be required to determine the best
                                    solution and to mitigate the impacts on nearby streets.

PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE TRAVEL
Newark provides an excellent environment for bicycling, including a temperate
climate, flat terrain, and a system of low volume streets ideal for novice cyclists.
Presently, bicycling in the city is constrained by a lack of continuous bicycle facilities
on Newark’s major arterials, particularly on north-south routes. The I-880
interchanges are also difficult to navigate for bicyclists and pedestrians, making it
challenging to reach nearby designations such as Ardenwood Regional Park and the
Fremont or Union City BART stations. In addition, many Newark neighborhoods
were developed with cul-de-sacs and looped street networks, with limited
connectivity for pedestrians and bicycles. As a result, walking or bicycling from home
to school or shopping areas may require long, circuitous routes.
Designing a quality bicycle system requires considering the needs of multiple user
groups with varying levels of confidence and experience. Key user groups include
students traveling to school, commuters going to work, persons running errands,
and those simply riding for leisure and exercise. Each user group requires different
amenities. For example, bike improvements for commuters could include showers
and bike lockers at work places in addition to bike lanes on local streets. Commuter
improvements might also focus on connecting area neighborhoods with particular
destinations, such as Pacific Research Center or the BART stations in Fremont and
Union City. Increasing the share of trips made by bicycle or on foot in the future will
depend on a number of factors such as the as the availability of well-connected
facilities, and the location, density, and type of future development
At the time of General Plan adoption, the City was in the process of preparing a
Pedestrian and Bicycle Master Plan (PBMP). Once adopted, the PBMP will
supplement the General Plan and establish a program for building a connected
system of on-street and off-street bikeways and support facilities. It will set the
framework for improving pedestrian and bicycle access to schools, employment
areas, shopping areas, and parks. The PBMP will also establish criteria for different
kinds of bike facilities, identify capital projects, establish design standards, and list
recommended education and safety programs.
B IKEWAY F ACILITIES
Bikeway planning and design in California typically relies on guidelines and
standards established by Caltrans. These standards provide for three distinct types of
bikeway facilities, as documented below:
                                                                                                                            T-13

                                           Class I Bikeways (Bike Path or Multi-Use Path) provide a completely
                                            separate right-of-way and are designated for the exclusive use of bicycles and
                                            pedestrians with vehicle and pedestrian cross-flow minimized. Bike paths are
                                            for non-motorized use only. Bike paths often traverse open space areas, such
                                            as regional parks.
                                           Class II Bikeways (Bike Lane) provide a restricted lane at least five feet wide
                                            within a road right-of-way that is designated for the use of bicycles. They are
                                            designated with a striped lane on a street or highway.
                                           Class III Bikeways (Bike Route) provide for a right-of-way designated by
                                            signs or pavement markings for shared use with pedestrians or motor
                                            vehicles. A Shared-Use Arrow (or “Sharrow”) can be marked in the outside
                                            lane on a Class III route to show the suggested path of travel for bicyclists.
                                    An additional facility type, the Neighborhood Bike Route is proposed for inclusion in
                                    Newark, as described below:
                                           Neighborhood Bike Routes are facilities that are designated for shared
                                            bicycle and motor vehicle use. They are low volume, low speed residential
                                            streets that are central to beginner cyclists to build experience and confidence.
                                            They also provide circulation within neighborhoods and connect homes to
                                            many of Newark’s schools.
                                    The City presently has several arterial and collector streets that provide opportunities
                                    to connect Newark with nearby destinations. Bicycle facilities along these routes
                                    currently include a combination of Class II and Class III facilities; however, there are
                                    significant gaps. Most notably, Cedar Boulevard, Newark Boulevard, and Cherry
                                    Street lack sufficient signage and protected space for bicycles, and there are
                                    inadequate opportunities to cross the I-880 and SR 84 freeways. This impedes safe
                                    access to the nearest BART stations, and to trails connecting to workplaces and
                                    regional parks in Fremont and elsewhere. In addition, bike lanes on many of the
                                    city’s arterials often end in advance of intersections to avoid conflicts with turning
                                    cars, and many of the city’s intersections are timed for motorists and pedestrians,
                                    rather than for bicyclists. The city also lacks a coordinated wayfinding signage system,
                                    which makes the bicycle system more difficult to navigate. There are many
                                    opportunities to improve safety, comfort, and access for bicyclists on city streets.

The proposed bicycle network for Newark is shown in Figure T-2. In incorporates the
existing system, with improvements added to provide safer and more direct travel
paths. Key corridors identified for bike travel are Newark Boulevard, Spruce Street,
Bettencourt Street, Cedar Boulevard, Cherry Street-Brittany Avenue-Ruschin Drive,
Mayhews Landing Road, Thornton Avenue, Willow Street, and Central Avenue.
Specific improvements for this network will be identified and evaluated in the City’s
PBMP. Most of these streets are recommended for Class II bike lanes that are striped
and signed on both sides of the roadway. Coordination with the City of Fremont will
be important to ensure the continuity of these bike lanes across city boundaries.
The City’s bikeway system will be further enhanced by off-street facilities (e.g., Class I
routes), including new and upgraded bicycle and pedestrian bridges and other road
crossing improvements. This includes development of the Bay Trail within the
Dumbarton TOD and Southwest Newark Residential and Recreational Project
(formerly Area 3 and 4) and development of a bike path and linear park along land
that was previously reserved for an extension of Cedar Boulevard. The Bay Trail
project has been the subject of a recent joint planning study with the City of Fremont
to identify the best alignment between the Dumbarton Bridge and Santa Clara
County. The Cedar Boulevard extension would incorporate a bridge over the railroad
tracks, with a possible interim alignment along local streets until the bridge can be
funded. Other off-street improvements are planned beside Bunker School (Birch
Street) and along the north side of the railroad tracks between Cherry Street and
Cedar Boulevard (parallel to Baine Avenue).
New support facilities will also improve the viability of bicycling and walking. These
might include short and long-term bicycle parking, showers, lockers, restrooms, and
improved lighting. Bike racks presently exist at local schools, in parks, and other civic
buildings. The City will work toward the provision of additional bike parking in the
future, both at public buildings and in private development through new bicycle
parking requirements. Additional wayfinding signage will also be encouraged, to help
bicyclists navigate through the city and onward to destinations such as BART and the
shoreline.

P EDESTRIAN F ACILITIES
Sidewalks exist along most streets in Newark, although a few gaps exist in industrial
areas. Pedestrian improvements also include crosswalks, some with pedestrian-
activated push buttons at signalized intersections. The General Plan provides policy
direction to make Newark more “pedestrian-friendly” in the future. On a practical
level, this means including more provisions for pedestrians when existing streets are
redesigned or new streets are constructed. This could include narrowing the curb-to-
curb widths at intersections along Thornton Avenue in Old Town Newark, additional
traffic signal timing adjustments to provide more time for pedestrians to cross the
street, and providing more countdown crosswalks, more school crossing guards, and
other measures which improve conditions for pedestrians.
Pedestrian safety and comfort can also be improved through land use and urban
design strategies. For example, locating retail development along the street frontage
rather than set back behind large surface parking lots can make walking a more
pleasant experience. Providing amenities such as street trees, benches, display
windows in retail stores, and outside dining space can also encourage pedestrian
activity. In the Dumbarton TOD area, the design of the street system itself will
encourage walking by creating a connected grid of streets rather than curvilinear
streets and cul-de-sacs.
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
B US S ERVICE
AC Transit currently provides local bus service for western Alameda and Contra Costa
counties, extending from Pinole on the north to Fremont and Newark on the south.
The Transit District has been operating since 1956 and has more than 100 bus lines
across the service area. AC routes provide feeder service from Newark to the
Fremont and Union City BART stations. Many of the routes include stops at NewPark
Mall and several serve Ohlone College. There is also limited service between Lido
Faire Shopping Center and Newark Memorial High School at the start and end of the
school day. Bus routes in the city as of 2013 are shown in Table T-1 and are mapped
in Figure T-3.
AC Transit buses also provide connections to Santa Clara Valley Transportation
Authority (VTA) buses at the Fremont BART Station. The VTA buses generally travel
to the south and southwest, providing transit access to job centers throughout Silicon
                                                                                                                        T-17

Valley. Additionally, the Dumbarton Express provides weekday bus service from
Fremont to Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties, including a stop at the Ardenwood
Park and Ride just north of the Newark City limits.
AC Transit has developed a Strategic Vision Plan that calls for high-frequency
enhanced bus routes, new vehicles, on-street rider amenities, signal priority on major
streets, and round-the-clock service. However, funding cuts and budget shortfalls
have led to service reductions, making it difficult to achieve long-term ridership
goals. The City of Newark will continue to evaluate the best arrangement for
improving transit service to its residents.
As appropriate, routes and headways should be adjusted to serve new development
in the Dumbarton TOD area, and to respond to increased employment at Pacific
Research Center, Stevenson Point Technology Park, the NewPark Mall area, and
other growth locations. A key objective is to continue improving feeder service to
BART, both for Newark-bound commuters and for those who live in Newark who
commute elsewhere. Improved service to the West Bay via the Dumbarton Bridge is
also a priority.
P ARA -T RANSIT
In addition to the transit services described above, Newark is also served by para-
transit for seniors and persons with disabilities. Newark Para-transit is a door-to-door
alternative service provided between 8 AM and 5 PM on weekdays and 8 AM to
3 PM on Sundays. Service costs are subsidized by Alameda County Measure B sales
tax revenues. Applicants are required to submit a form and go through a review
process to be eligible for services. Similar services are provided by East Bay Para-
transit and the Tri-City Taxi Voucher program. There is also a VIP Rides program
which pairs seniors and disabled residents with local volunteers who provide free
transportation to appointments, grocery stores, and other local destinations.
BART S ERVICE
Although Newark does not have a BART station, most of the bus lines in the city
begin or end at BART stations in Union City and Fremont. In addition, the Fremont
BART station has 1,500 parking spaces which are available to commuters from
Newark, Fremont, and other nearby cities. BART provides rail access to San
Francisco, Oakland, and job centers in other parts of the East Bay and northern
Peninsula. The Fremont Station and the Union City Station are within 5 miles of the
Newark city limits.

An extension of BART from Fremont station to San Jose and Santa Clara is presently
under construction. A new 5.4-mile segment is expected to be operational by 2015,
with a station at Warm Springs and a potential station in Irvington. Beyond Warm
Springs, the BART extension will continue into Santa Clara County, with stations in
Milpitas and Berryessa. Eventually BART would be extended further, with stations at
Alum Rock, Downtown San Jose, Diridon, and Santa Clara. The extension includes
connections to the VTA light rail system and Caltrain system at a number of
locations. The BART extension may increase demand for bus service between
Newark and the Fremont stations, as more commuters use BART to travel to jobs in
the South Bay.

The Amtrak “Capitol Corridor” and Altamont Commuter Express (ACE) provide
passenger rail service in the Newark vicinity via the Fremont Centerville Train station,
located just over a mile northeast of Newark. The Capitol Corridor provides daily
service between San Jose and Sacramento, making stops in Santa Clara, Fremont,
Hayward, Oakland, Emeryville, Berkeley, Richmond, Martinez, Suisun-Fairfield, and
Davis. On both weekdays and weekends, seven southbound Capitol Corridor trains
provide passenger rail service to Santa Clara and Downtown San Jose, and seven
northbound trains provide service to Oakland, Davis, Sacramento, and the other
previously mentioned intermediate communities to the north.
ACE provides service between San Jose and Stockton, with stops in Santa Clara,
Fremont, Pleasanton, Livermore, Tracy, and Lathrop-Manteca. On weekdays, ACE
offers four eastbound trains from Fremont to Stockton, making stops in Pleasanton,
Livermore, Tracy, and Lathrop-Manteca, and four westbound trains from Fremont to
San Jose, making two stops in Santa Clara. ACE does not currently offer weekend or

A rail bridge was first built across the southern part of San Francisco Bay by the
Southern Pacific Railroad in 1910. The line primarily carried freight traffic, but for a
period of time before 1920 it also was used for transbay passenger service. In the
mid-1990s, a proposal was initiated to re-establish passenger rail service across the
South Bay, connecting the Union City BART station to the Peninsula via a new rail
bridge. The project was included for funding in Regional Measure 2, passed by the
voters in 2004. The train is intended to improve connectivity between the East Bay
                                                                                                                          T-21

                                    and the Peninsula, and reduce roadway, rail, and bridge congestion, as well as
                                    improve travel reliability.
                                    The Dumbarton Rail corridor is 20.5 miles long. The project would improve,
                                    rehabilitate, and reconstruct the rail tracks, including rehabilitation of a rail bridge
                                    across the bay. At the eastern terminus in Union City, an intermodal hub would
                                    connect the rail to BART, Amtrak, and the ACE commuter trains. The
                                    Fremont/Centerville ACE/Amtrak Station would be upgraded, and new stations
                                    would be developed in Newark, Menlo Park, and Redwood City. The Dumbarton line
                                    would join the Caltrain line for access to San Jose and San Francisco. Initial service is
                                    proposed to consist of six trains across the bridge in the morning commute and six
                                    during the evening commute.
                                    In anticipation of Dumbarton Rail, the City of Newark adopted the Dumbarton TOD
                                    Specific Plan in 2011. The Specific Plan envisions a walkable, pedestrian-oriented
                                    neighborhood developed around the future Newark station at Willow Street just
                                    south of Thornton Avenue. A diverse mix of housing types, retail stores, and open
                                    space amenities are planned. The transit station itself would include provide
                                    connections to local buses, with feeder service provided to Newark neighborhoods.
                                    The Dumbarton Rail will require additional funding to proceed and the timeline for
                                    its construction is uncertain. As an interim measure, the City of Newark supports
                                    continued improvements to transbay bus service, potentially including bus rapid
                                    transit (BRT) type service and/or associated “stations” between Newark and the
                                    Peninsula. Passenger capacity should be sufficient to support TOD as planned in the
                                    vicinity of the proposed Dumbarton Rail station. Express bus service should be
                                    viewed as an interim solution, and not as a long-term replacement for investment in
                                    rail.

                                    efficient use of the transportation system. It includes strategies to coordinate land
                                    use and transportation decisions, increase the capacity of existing roads without
                                    major physical changes, and reduce peak hour demand on the transportation

C OORDINATING L AND U SE AND T RANSPORTATION
One of the basic principles of transportation efficiency is the coordination of land use
and transportation decisions. At the most basic level, this means planning for
additional transportation capacity when new development is proposed. It also means
guiding new development to areas with available transportation capacity. This is the
underlying premise behind the idea of TOD, particularly around rail transit stations.
The substantial investment made in rail transit can be amortized by using land
around the station in a way that will maximize transit ridership and take full
advantage of the opportunity for less car-dependent development.
In Newark, the General Plan Map provides for more density and intensity around the
future Dumbarton Rail station near Willow Street, anticipating that residents and
workers in this area will be able to use rail and/or bus transit for commuting. This
General Plan also encourages mixed-use development in areas like Old Town
Newark. Such development often combines retail and residential uses and enables
residents to walk rather than drive when running errands or traveling to basic
services. At a citywide scale, transportation and land use decisions can also be linked
by balancing job and housing growth, so that Newark’s workers and residents have
the opportunity to live and work locally rather than commuting. As noted in the Land
Use Element and the Economic Development Element, the City is striving not only to
balance jobs and housing, but also to provide a better match between the housing
needs of the Newark workforce and the type of housing being planned in the city.
As noted earlier, another fundamental aspect of coordinating land use and
transportation is to design new development to facilitate all modes of travel. The
goal is not to make it more difficult to drive, but rather to make highways, parking
lots, and cars a less dominant feature of the cityscape. Improvements such as street
trees, landscaping, lighting, benches, and wider sidewalks on commercial streets are
key to this philosophy. This includes gateway features along Thornton Avenue in the
Old Town area, and other beautification improvements to the stretch of Thornton
between Willow Street and Old Town. It also includes improvements such as curb
cuts for wheelchair access, bike lanes, crosswalks, and other changes that are
consistent with the Complete Streets concept.
T RAFFIC O PERATIONS AND C ONTROLS
One approach to managing congestion is to synchronize the timing of traffic signals.
In 2013, there were 43 signalized intersections in Newark. Most are located along
                                                                                                                          T-23

T R A N S P O R T A T I O N
                                    arterial streets, with posted speed limits between 30 and 45 miles per hour. All
                                    signals are fully actuated by traffic, but are not currently synchronized to prioritize
                                    vehicle flow along major arterial corridors. The City continues to explore
                                    opportunities to provide signals at additional intersections where warranted and to
                                    adjust the timing of signals to improve the flow of vehicular traffic while balancing
                                    pedestrian and bicycle safety and access needs. Traffic signal interconnect projects
                                    for Cherry Street, Newark Boulevard, and portions of Thornton Avenue are listed in
                                    the current City Capital Improvement Plan as unfunded projects, but may be
                                    implemented when warranted. Other measures, such as adding or modifying turning
                                    lanes and regulating speeds along City streets can be used to improve traffic flow
                                    and balance demands on the system.
                                    Directional signs are also used to guide Newark’s motorists to destinations in and
                                    around the city and to avoid congestion on busy travel routes. Emerging services
                                    such as car-sharing and bike-sharing are also making it easier to forego car
                                    ownership, or to reduce the number of vehicles per household. Car-share programs
                                    are typically initiated by the private sector, but the public sector plays a role in their
                                    success through its parking policies and development review procedures.
                                    T RANSPORTATION S YSTEMS M ANAGEMENT
                                    The City of Newark adopted a Transportation Systems Management (TSM)
                                    Ordinance in 1992. The intent of the Ordinance is to curb congestion on the local
                                    and regional transportation networks through programs by local employers to
                                    reduce peak hour trips. The Ordinance supports alternatives to driving alone to work
                                    in order to reduce traffic congestion, parking demand, air pollution, gasoline
                                    consumption, and time loss. TSM strategies include carpool and vanpool programs,
                                    shuttles to BART, flexible work hours and allowances for telecommuting, ridesharing

                                    and showers at the work place). The TSM ordinance requires Newark businesses
                                    with more than 50 employees on-site to develop a commute alternatives program
                                    and to inform employees about the commute options available to them.
                                    A number of large employers and employment centers in Newark have initiated TSM
                                    programs. For example, a private shuttle provides five trips a day between the Union
                                    City BART Station and Pacific Research Center during the morning commute and five
                                    trips a day in the reverse direction during the evening commute. Some local
                                    employers have also adopted flextime and telecommuting programs, preferential

parking programs for carpools, and similar initiatives. Newark residents and workers
may also participate in the regional 511.org program that provides ride-matching
and carpool services to persons across the Bay Area.
Newark is also served by the Ardenwood Park and Ride facility, located just outside
the city limits on the north side of SR 84 at Ardenwood Boulevard. The site has 300
free parking spaces and 50 paid spaces. Bike parking is also available on the site. AC
Transit buses and Dumbarton Express buses stop at the Park-and-Ride, providing
connections to San Francisco, Stanford University, BART stations, and major
employment centers in the West Bay.
VEHICLE FLOW
Preparation of the Newark General Plan included an evaluation of existing vehicle
traffic flow and projected flow in the Year 2035 based on planned development and
future transportation improvements. The evaluation considered development
facilitated by the General Plan, as well as development in nearby cities and growth at
the regional level. A computerized transportation model was used to estimate
existing and future congestion levels at key intersections around the city and
determine the need for physical improvements to ensure that Newark’s roads will
continue to operate at acceptable levels of service. Traffic volumes and turning
movements were measured at intersections throughout Newark to provide a starting
point (or “baseline”) for this analysis.
The performance of the road system is evaluated through a measurement called
level of service (LOS). LOS is a qualitative description of operating conditions in
which road segments or intersections are graded on a scale of A to F. LOS A
indicates free-flow conditions with little or no delay, while LOS F indicates jammed
conditions with excessive delays. The letter grades are based on the time delay to
travel through an intersection. Table T-2 provides a narrative description of
conditions under each of the six lettered service levels.
For the past several decades, Newark has used a standard of LOS D for its signalized
intersections. This means that intersections operating at LOS A, B, C, or D are
considered to be performing acceptably, while those operating at LOS E or F are not.
In total, 37 intersections were evaluated as part of the General Plan. Some of these
intersections are signalized and some are not. For non-signalized intersections, the
                                                                                                                        T-25

                                                Signal progression is extremely favorable. Most vehicles arrive

                                                still pass through the intersection without stopping.
                                                The influence of congestion becomes more noticeable. Longer
                                                delays may result from some combination of unfavorable signal

                                                noticeable.
                                                This is considered to be beyond the limit of acceptable delay. High

                                                failures occur frequently
                                                This level of delay is considered unacceptable by most drivers. This

potential benefits of installing a traffic signal were evaluated. The actual installation of
a signal at any given intersection would require further analysis to evaluate its effects
on traffic and safety, and to confirm that the signal is warranted based on State of
California criteria.
Table T-3 shows existing LOS at major Newark intersections as of 2012. All of the
                                                                                               2
intersections are meeting the City’s standard and are operating at LOS “D” or better.
Most are operating at LOS A, B, or C.
Table T-3 also shows projected LOS at the same intersections in 2035. These
projections consider the benefits to traffic flow that will be provided by programmed
capital improvements, and planned improvements associated with the Dumbarton
TOD, the Southwest Newark Residential and Recreational Project, and other
approved developments in the city. They also consider the potential for reduction in
traffic volumes due to General Plan policies. For example, the General Plan
encourages pedestrian and bicycle travel, transit use, TOD, telecommuting, and
other strategies to reduce vehicle trip generation and divert more trips to other travel
modes.
The analysis indicates that traffic congestion is expected to increase at most Newark
intersections by 2035. Future residential, commercial, and industrial development
will result in additional vehicle trips. More significantly, additional population and job
growth in the Bay Area will increase traffic on the region’s freeways. As freeway
congestion on I-880 and SR 84 gets worse, more drivers may divert on to Newark
roadways or cut through Newark on their way to other destinations.
The evaluation of future traffic conditions indicates that seven intersections would
operate at LOS E or F by 2035 unless additional capital improvements are
programmed. Service levels can be restored to acceptable (LOS D or better)
conditions at all of these intersections if they are improved. In most cases, this can
be accomplished through restriping existing the right-of-way and adding turning
lanes, which would not require acquisition of additional right of way. However, two
of the intersections are jointly managed by Newark and Fremont, and portions of the
area requiring improvement are in Fremont.

                                    Table T-4 indicates the seven intersections where improvements are required, along
                                    with a description of these improvements and potential constraints to their
                                    construction. Two of the intersections are associated with the on and off ramps at
                                    the Newark Boulevard/SR 84 interchange. The Cherry Street intersections at
                                    Thornton, Mowry, and Stevenson also appear in the table. The intersection of
                                    Gateway and Thornton, at the west end of Pacific Research Center, is also listed. The
                                    last of the intersections listed (Cedar and Smith) is presently unsignalized and would
                                    require a traffic signal by 2035.
                                    In addition to the improvements listed in Table T-4, a number of projects are already
                                    listed in Newark’s bi-annual Capital Improvements Plan. These include a widening of
                                    Thornton Avenue between Gateway Boulevard and Hickory Streets, and a grade-
                                    separated structure where Central Avenue crosses the Union Pacific railroad tracks.
                                    Dumbarton TOD projects will be required to contribute towards the funding of this
                                    grade separation structure as discussed at pages LU-19-21. Capacity enhancements
                                    are also planned at the Cherry Street/Central Avenue intersection, the Thornton/
                                    Cedar intersection, and the Cherry Street/Mowry Avenue intersection. Signal
                                    coordination improvements are planned at the Cherry Street and Stevenson Avenue

                                    segment between Stevenson and SR 84 is projected to operate at LOS F in both
                                    directions during both peak periods. However, this scenario is anticipated with or
                                    without the Newark General Plan. I-880 is a state-operated facility, and the City’s
                                    ability to control its traffic volumes and delay levels is limited. The City of Newark will

                                    reduction measures at the local level. Many of the traffic management measures in
                                    the Alameda CTC Congestion Management Program are also included in the Newark
                                    General Plan, including increased telecommuting, promotion of ridesharing,
                                    reduction of vehicle use, and incentives for transit use. Proving a better match
                                    between jobs and housing is also critical, so that a larger number of Newark
                                    residents can work locally and a larger number of those who work in Newark can
                                    find housing within the city.
                                    While the General Plan traffic modeling indicated that most roads would operate at
                                    LOS D or better in the future, the City will continue to require traffic studies for
                                    individual development projects. It is possible that some of these projects could
                                    result in LOS E or F at individual intersections. There are a limited number of
                                    circumstances where this outcome may be acceptable. For example, in specific
                                    locations such as the Old Town Newark commercial district, maximizing vehicular
                                    flow through intersections may not be the highest priority. In this area, the City seeks
                                    to create a welcoming environment for pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users, with
                                    vibrant local businesses and an attractive streetscape. Slower vehicle travel speeds
                                    and longer intersection delays may be acceptable in such locations. The City will
                                    determine the need for exceptions to its LOS standards on a case by case basis in
                                    the future. New metrics for calculating LOS also may be developed, considering
                                    multiple modes of travel and just motor vehicles.

                                    Major thoroughfares in Newark carry large volumes of traffic, creating the risk of
                                    traffic accidents. The Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System indicates that there
                                    were 97 injury collisions in Newark in 2010 and 96 injury collisions in 2011. There
                                    were 7 pedestrians and 5 bicyclists injured in 2010 and 8 pedestrians and 5 bicyclists

                                    injured in 2011. The largest number of accidents in the city occurs at the
                                    intersections of major arterial streets. Based on California Highway Patrol data, the
                                    areas of greatest accident frequency are on Thornton Avenue at its intersections with
                                    the I-880 ramps and with Cedar Boulevard, and Newark Boulevard at its intersections
                                    with the SR 84 ramps and with Jarvis Avenue. Other areas where accidents are
                                    relatively common include the Mowry Avenue corridor near NewPark Mall.

The City continues to pursue measures to make its streets safer for motorists,
pedestrians, and bicyclists. Establishing and enforcing speed limits is critical, but must
be done in accordance with state requirements. Ongoing maintenance of road
surfaces and markings within the rights of way is also important. Other approaches,
such as the redesign of intersections, the addition of traffic calming or warning signs,
the use of new technologies, and modification of street geometrics, can mitigate
accident hazards and reduce accident-related delays.
In addition, future development near any existing or proposed railroad rights of way
should be planned with the safety of the rail corridor in mind. New development
may result in higher traffic volumes at grade-level crossings, and increased numbers
of pedestrians and bicyclists crossing the tracks. As noted later in this chapter, the
city is planning for a number of grade separation projects and improvements to at-
grade crossings to reduce safety hazards. Other measures such as vandal-resistant
fencing and barriers which limit pedestrians on the tracks also may be considered.
F UNDING
Funding for transportation improvements comes from a variety of sources. Gas tax
funds may be used for expenses related to street construction, maintenance, and
design. These funds include state gas tax subventions, Measure B revenues, Traffic
Congestion Relief Funds (Proposition 42), Transportation Development Act – Article
3 funds, Transportation Fund for Clean Air (TFCA), and Alameda County Vehicle
Registration Fee funds. Local tax revenues are the primary source for street
maintenance and improvement projects. Funds for smaller capital projects may also
be derived from unallocated General Fund dollars. The City also collects
development impact fees from private development, but these funds may only be
used where a nexus is established between development and the capital project. A
General Plan action item has been included to study the current traffic impact fee,
and to adjust the fee as appropriate so it more closely reflects the true cost of
transportation improvements.
Larger capital projects are typically funded through state and federal grants. For
example, federal Community Development Block Grants may be used for street
construction and other capital projects. Other grants are authorized through the
Federal Transportation Act, the federal Highway Safety Improvement Program, the
Highway-Railroad Grade Separation Program, the Safe Routes to School Program,
the federal stimulus program, and periodic State transportation bond acts. The

                                    Newark does not have its own airport, but relies on nearby airports for passenger
                                    travel and the shipment and delivery of goods. San Francisco International Airport,
                                    the region’s largest airport, is located approximately 25 road miles from Newark and
                                    can be accessed via the Dumbarton or San Mateo Bridges. Oakland International
                                    Airport is approximately 20 road miles north of the city via I-880. San Jose
                                    International Airport is approximately 17 road miles south of the city via I-880.
                                    Smaller general aviation airfields exist in closer proximity. These include Palo Alto
                                    Airport, approximately 10 miles to the southwest and across the Dumbarton Bridge,
                                    and Hayward Airport, approximately 10 miles to the north via I-880.
                                    Each of the airports listed above is required by law to prepare an Airport Land Use
                                    Compatibility Plan. The Plan includes provisions to ensure the safety of aircraft,
                                    passengers, and development in the vicinity of each airport, including structural
                                    height limits, land use requirements in different zones around the runways, and
                                    regulations on landing and take-off patterns. Newark is beyond the area covered by
                                    the Airport Land Use Plan for each of the airports listed above.
                                    There are no heliports for public or private use in Newark. The closest heliports are
                                    approximately 2 miles away in Fremont, with one serving Washington Hospital and
                                    the other serving the First Interstate Bank Operations Center. Helicopter operations
                                    at these locations do not follow a regular schedule.

                                    Trucks make up a relatively small percentage of the traffic volume on Newark streets,
                                    but have a major impact on the transportation system and the local economy. Most
                                    Newark businesses depend on trucks for shipping and delivery, and some of the
                                    city’s larger businesses include trucking operations which connect Newark with
                                    markets across the country. Truck movement and parking is regulated by the
                                    California Vehicle Code as well as by the Newark Municipal Code.

To avoid conflicts with residential traffic and land uses that might be adversely
affected by truck traffic, the City has designated certain streets as truck routes. This
includes most of Newark’s arterials as well as Sycamore, Willow, and Filbert Streets,
Clark Avenue, and Enterprise Drive. Figure T-4 highlights the currently designated
truck routes in the City.
F REIGHT R AIL
Newark is traversed by two active rail lines, both owned by the Union Pacific
Railroad. The Union Pacific Coast Subdivision (formerly the Southern Pacific Mulford
Line) runs from northwest to southeast through the city, roughly parallel to Newark
Boulevard and Cherry Street. The Union Pacific Niles Subdivision branches off the
Coast Subdivision just east of Sycamore Street and runs northeast towards Fremont,
roughly midway between Thornton and Central Avenues. The City of Newark was
initially laid out around the intersection of these two lines, in the vicinity of Thornton
Avenue and Sycamore Street.
In 2011, the Union Pacific Railroad managed 142 freight trains a week through
Newark. Major origin and destination points include the Port of Oakland to the
north, the Central Valley to the east (via the Altamont Pass), and Southern California
to the south.
There are 12 active at-grade railroad crossings in the city, occurring at Jarvis Avenue,
Haley Street, Cedar Boulevard, Mayhews Landing Road, Thornton Avenue, Carter
Avenue/Filbert Street, Sycamore Street, Cherry Street, Cedar Boulevard, Central
Avenue, Mowry Avenue, and Stevenson Boulevard. There are also three inactive at-
grade crossings where Ash, Spruce, and Willow Streets cross the former Dumbarton
Rail. There are grade-separated railroad crossings at Newark Blvd, I-880, and SR 84.
An important General Plan policy is to replace some of the at-grade railroad
crossings with grade-separated rail overpasses. This will enhance safety, reduce travel
delays at railroad crossings, and improve emergency access. Grade separations are
planned at Central Avenue with a funding contribution from the Dumbarton TOD
project and at either Mowry or Stevenson Avenue as part of the Southwest Newark
Recreation and Residential project. A grade separation will also be explored at the
Filbert/Carter crossing south of Old Town Newark, and a grade separated bicycle and
pedestrian crossing is being pursued in the Cedar Boulevard extension right-of-way
west of Haley Street.

PARKING
Parking management is a land use issue, a transportation issue, an economic
development issue, and an urban design issue. The availability of an adequate
supply of off-street parking spaces is important to local businesses and to the quality
of life in Newark’s neighborhoods. At the same time, providing too much parking
can affect the character of the city and impede the city’s goal to encourage
alternative means of travel.
Newark will continue to strive for balanced solutions that reconcile these competing
objectives. A key part of the city’s parking management strategy is to provide a
sufficient number of spaces but to locate and design parking areas so they are not a
property’s dominant design feature. For example, the convention in most Newark
shopping centers has been to set retail buildings far back from the curb, with large
parking lots facing the street. In the future, a greater focus will be placed on placing
retail buildings along the street frontage, with parking to the rear. This can change
the look and feel of a shopping district and create a more comfortable and active
street environment for pedestrians.
The Newark zoning code indicates parking requirements for different land uses. For
example, two off-street covered parking spaces are required for each single-family
home. Studio and one-bedroom apartments are required to provide 1.5 spaces per
unit, while apartments with two or more bedrooms must provide two spaces per
unit. Provisions for guest parking also apply. For larger apartment complexes,
flexibility is provided as to whether the spaces are covered or uncovered.
For non-residential uses, different metrics are used to establish the parking
requirements. For example, the requirement for churches and theaters is based on
the number of seats, the requirement for nursing homes is based on the number of
beds, and the requirement for retail stores and offices is based on floor area. The
ordinance also establishes standards for the dimensions of parking spaces, including
allowances for compact spaces. Design standards for access drives and aisles also are
included.
In the past, zoning regulations have prescribed parking requirements for individual
land uses but have not allowed reductions for shared parking when land uses with
different demand characteristics could use the same spaces. For instance, an office
building adjacent to a movie theater might require fewer spaces than an office
                                                                                                                          T-39

T R A N S P O R T A T I O N
                                    building alone, since most of the theater’s parking would be used in the evenings
                                    and empty during the daytime. Future zoning revisions may consider adjustments to
                                    the parking standards to encourage the sharing of spaces in such instances. Likewise,
                                    a shared parking lot serving Old Town Newark will continue to be studied. This
                                    would provide an important resource for small businesses with inadequate space for
                                    off-street parking on their properties.

             schedules to reduce waiting and transfer times, particularly between
             local transit and BART.
A CTIONS
Action T-3.A BART Shuttle. Study the feasibility of a private, public-private, or local
             transit shuttle that connects Newark’s major employment centers,
             major shopping destinations, and other destinations (such as Ohlone
             College) with the BART stations in Fremont and/or Union City.
             Such a system could also include a connection to the Altamont
             Commuter Express/Capitol Corridor station in Centerville.
Action T-3.B Dumbarton Rail Design and Funding. Continue planning, design,
             and financing studies for the Dumbarton Rail between the Union City
             BART station and the Peninsula. Support phased implementation of
             the project, with Newark to the Peninsula as the first phase.
             The City will continue working with regional transit and transportation
             planning agencies to advance the Dumbarton Rail project, including
             a station located in the vicinity of Willow Street and Enterprise Drive.
             Goals for the design of the station have been established through the
             Dumbarton TOD Specific Plan. These goals focus on the visibility of
             the station, its accessibility to bicyclists and pedestrians, its parking
             areas, its connectivity to surrounding development and other transit
             modes, and provisions for arriving and departing passengers.
Action T-3.C Consultation with Local Transit. Work with the local transit provider
             to align transit routes in Newark in a way that better achieves the goals
             of the General Plan. This should include better connections between
             Newark’s neighborhoods and shopping centers, including New Park
             Mall, Old Town Newark, and the Four Corners area, greater frequency,
             and more route clarity.

             and ride lots in and around Newark.
Policy T-4.9 Telecommuting and Flextime. Encourage Newark employers to
             reduce peak hour commute volumes by offering flexible work
             schedules and telecommute options for employees, and by providing

Policy T-5.3 Collector Standards. Maintain standards for collector streets which
             ensure that Newark’s neighborhoods and business districts have easy
             access to arterials, while minimizing the intrusion of high traffic
             volumes into residential areas. Where necessary, collector streets
             should be improved to better link arterials with the local street system
             and reduce “cut through” traffic problems without requiring circuitous
             routes.
Policy T-5.4 Level of Service Standards. Strive for Level of Service (LOS) "D" or
             better at all major intersections in Newark. It is recognized that lower
             levels of service are projected at some intersections due to future
             increases in local and regional traffic. Decreases in the desired LOS
             may be acceptable at certain intersections due to conditions beyond
             the City’s control, or to achieve other mobility and economic
             development objectives.
             These other objectives might include improved conditions for
             pedestrians and bicycles, slower speeds to improve safety, higher
             aesthetic quality, more dynamic workplaces and increased
             employment, and protection of neighborhoods from non-local traffic.
Policy T-5.5 Transportation Improvements. Regularly evaluate the need for
             transportation improvements to maintain satisfactory levels of service
             on Newark streets. These needs should be expressed in the City’s
             Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) that is updated biennially. The CIP
             should be considered when determining traffic impact fees and
             necessary improvements when development takes place.
Policy T-5.6 Right-of-Way Reservation. Ensure that adequate right of way is
             reserved for future transportation projects, consistent with the General
             Plan Transportation Diagram.
             When a property owner along an arterial or collector street requests
             development approval, the City may require the dedication of public
             use easements or rights of way to allow for eventual improvement of
             the road in conformance with adopted City policies and standards.
             Similarly, when new roads are developed, the City may require
             landscaped easements along these roads to retain to retain the
             flexibility for future widening or other transportation improvements.

                                    Policy T-5.12 Funding. Develop mechanisms for funding the transportation
                                                  improvements necessary to achieve the City's mobility goals, including
                                                  grants and local revenue sources such as assessment districts in new
                                                  development areas.
                                    Policy T-5.13 Inter-City Corridor Planning. Work collaboratively with the City of

Action T-5.B New Level of Service Measurement. Explore new metrics for
             measuring LOS which consider variables other than vehicle speed and
             delay time.
Action T-5.C Findings for Exceeding Adopted Levels of Service. Establish
             findings for approving development which would result in levels of
             service which exceed the City's adopted standards, even after
             mitigation measures are implemented.
             Such findings would recognize the City's other mobility objectives,
             including safety, aesthetics, environmental quality, greenhouse gas
             reduction, and creating a balanced transportation system that serves
             all users. The findings would also recognize traffic impacts beyond
             the City’s control, such as those that occur due to increases in
             regional traffic volumes or development in nearby cities.
Action T-5.D Traffic Monitoring. Continue the current traffic count program to
             monitor traffic on major arterial and collector streets. These counts
             should be used to verify traffic service levels and to evaluate the traffic
             impacts of new development projects.
             Particular attention should be given to intersections that are
             approaching LOS D or worse.
Action T-5.E Transportation Impact Fees. Conduct a study to update
             transportation impact fees to ensure that they are high enough to
             provide transportation improvements needed to serve new
             development.
Action T-5.F Signal Interconnect Projects. Install interconnected signal systems on
             major arterials where practical and beneficial, including Stevenson
             Boulevard, Cherry Street, Thornton Avenue, Cedar Boulevard, Mowry
             Avenue, and Newark Boulevard.
Action T-5.G Dumbarton TOD Road System. Ensure that the design of roads in
             the Dumbarton TOD area conforms to the standards established by
             the Dumbarton TOD Specific Plan.
             These standards include blocks that are generally less than 450-feet
             in length, mid-block pedestrian crossings on longer blocks, and mid-
             block crosswalks to facilitate pedestrian circulation. Roads in the
             Dumbarton TOD area should connect with local and regional
                                                                                                                          T-53

Policy T-6.2 Freeway Improvements. Support improvements to I-880 and SR 84
             which improve Newark's connections to the region and provide the
             capacity needed for the City's continued economic growth.
Policy T-6.3 Airport Improvements. Support federal, state, and regional agency
             efforts to ensure that airport capacity in the Bay Area continues to
             grow to meet demand without adding new airports in the Newark
             area.
Policy T-6.4 Regional Passenger Rail Service. Promote improved passenger rail
             service between the Newark vicinity and other parts of the Bay Area
             and California, including improved Altamont Commuter Express (ACE)
             and Amtrak (Capital Corridor) service, as well as the BART extension to
             San Jose and the Dumbarton Rail project to the Peninsula.
Policy T-6.5 Freight Rail Service. Work with the Union Pacific Railroad to ensure
             the continued viability of freight rail service through Newark, and the
             availability of rail spurs and sidings to serve Newark’s industrial users.
             Work with the Union Pacific Railroad to assure compliance with
             adopted standards regarding blocking of roadways. The City supports
             efforts by the Union Pacific Railroad to improve maintenance, upgrade
             equipment, and improve the safety of existing railroad grade crossings.
Policy T-6.6 Grade Separations. Reduce the number of at-grade rail crossings in
             Newark. Grade separations are strongly supported as a way to
             facilitate emergency vehicle response, improve safety, reduce delays,
             and improve aesthetics.
Policy T-6.7 Truck Routes. Maintain a network of truck routes in Newark to ensure
             that truck traffic is directed away from residential areas and other
             sensitive uses, and to avoid congestion at major intersections. Truck
             traffic should be managed in a way that minimizes the distance that
             must be traveled between industrial areas and freeway interchanges
             while keeping commercial vehicles off of local streets and avoiding the
             potential for trucks to divert off of I-880 and SR 84 to "cut-through"
             Newark.

P ARKING
GOAL T-7     Manage parking in a way that balances aesthetic,
             environmental, economic development, and quality of life
             goals.
P OLICIES
Policy T-7.1 On-Street Parking. Provide for on-street parking on non-arterial City
             streets, unless existing right-of-way widths or safety considerations
             preclude the presence of dedicated parking lanes.
Policy T-7.2 Parking to Support Local Business. Ensure that adequate off-street
             parking is provided to promote local business development, and to
             avoid commercial parking overflow problems in residential areas.
Policy T-7.3 Parking Lot Location. In new or redeveloping commercial
             development areas, generally locate parking to the side or rear of
             buildings rather than between buildings and the travel lanes of
             adjoining streets.
Policy T-7.4 Shared Parking. Encourage the use of shared parking for uses with
             different demand characteristics as a way to reduce the total land area
             devoted to parking and maximize the efficient use of parking
             resources. In the event that parking structures are developed,
             encourage joint use agreements which enable multiple users to use
             such structures.
Policy T-7.5 Parking Lot Aesthetics. In areas of the City with high pedestrian
             volumes or high visibility to passing traffic, require parking lots to be
             attractively designed and landscaped. Parking areas in such locations

                                                 alternate modes of travel. These strategies could include the use of

HOUSING

INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the Housing Element is to ensure that safe, decent, affordable shelter
is provided for all Newark residents. The Element places a particular emphasis on
lower income Newark residents and residents with special needs, including seniors
and persons with disabilities. The Element includes an evaluation of housing needs
in the city, based on demographics and housing conditions. As required by state
law, it identifies sites sufficient to accommodate the city’s share of the region’s
housing needs over an eight year period. It also evaluates constraints to housing
production and establishes measures to mitigate such constraints.
Housing is one of the mandatory elements of the General Plan. Because the
Housing Element is subject to specific, prescriptive requirements and must be
prepared and updated on a cycle set by the California legislature, it stands on its own
as a separate document and is not included in this version of the General Plan.
However, it is an integral part of the Plan, has the same legal standing as the other
elements, and is internally consistent with the other elements.
Newark’s current Housing Element covers the period 2007 to 2014. It is anticipated
that a new Housing Element will be adopted in late 2014 covering the next planning
period, which runs from 2015 to 2022.
The Housing Element document may be consulted for additional detail.

INTRODUCTION
The Economic Development Element contains goals, policies, and actions to
encourage a robust economy, support existing businesses, and attract new
businesses that contribute to Newark’s quality-of-life and fiscal vitality. While this
Element is not required by State law, it is intended to provide policy guidance for
Newark’s future economic growth. The Element reflects the City’s desire to maintain
a positive balance between jobs and housing, provide pathways to employment for
Newark residents, strengthen the City’s competitive edge and identity within the
Silicon Valley market, make Newark a location of choice for retail and hospitality
development, and encourage diverse office and industrial uses. Including these
goals in the General Plan can help ensure that economic development
considerations are integrated into all aspects of city development.
The goals, policies, and actions of the Economic Development Element reflect the
aspirations of Newark residents and businesses. In 2011 and early 2012, residents
participated in community workshops to identify priorities and goals, including those
related to Newark’s economic future. In December 2012 and again in March 2013,
the City held Blue Ribbon Panel meetings to receive advice and input for the
Economic Development Element from the local business community. Ideas culled
from these meetings, together with input from local businesses, the Chamber of
Commerce, realtors, and economic development organizations were used to prepare
this Element.
OVERVIEW OF NEWARK’S ECONOMY
H ISTORICAL P ERSPECTIVE
From its inception, Newark was a manufacturing hub serving regional, national, and
international markets. A century before incorporation, Newark was the location of
orchards, dairies, and farms and served as a shipping point for wheat, hay, and coal.
Salt production began in the 1850s. Acquisitions and mergers ultimately resulted in
                                                                                         ED-1

E CO N O M I C D E V E L O P M E N T
                                     the Arden Salt Company, predecessor to Leslie Salt and today’s Cargill Salt.
                                     Completion of the railroad in the 1870s was the impetus for some of the town’s first
                                     manufacturers, including a railroad car building firm and a foundry which later
                                     manufactured Wedgewood stoves.
                                     Following incorporation, the City leveraged its location at the intersection of two
                                     major highways (Interstate 880 and Highway 84) and its proximity to Silicon Valley to
                                     create an inviting setting for the high technology and electronics industries, as well as
                                     the support services that underpin these industries. These services included
                                     warehousing and distribution, as well as computer parts manufacturing and
                                     assembly. The Cherry Street and Central Avenue industrial areas emerged as
                                     important industrial districts during this time period, providing an important link in
                                     the supply chain for the Bay Area’s technology sector.
                                     Sun Microsystems opened a 1.4 million square foot campus in Newark in the late
                                     1990s, with 4,000 employees at its peak. The facility closed in 2003 when Sun
                                     consolidated its real estate holdings, which was a significant loss for the city. The
                                     buildings and surrounding vacant properties were transformed into Pacific Research
                                     Center (PRC) in 2006, and are now a multi-tenant office, flex, and research and
                                     development park. Today, the City has rebounded from the loss of Sun and the
                                     105-acre PRC is one of the premiere business addresses in Southern Alameda
                                     County. The City continues to welcome new technology companies. In 2012 alone,
                                     Membrane Technology and Research, BioChain Inc., Belectric USA, United Logistics
                                     Solutions, Logitech, and Theranos chose to locate in Newark. 1
                                     In the early 1980s, Newark also emerged as a major retail center serving the growing
                                     “Tri-Cities” (Newark-Fremont-Union City) market. NewPark Mall opened in 1980,
                                     and became the first enclosed super-regional shopping mall in the Tri-Cities, a
                                     distinction it retains today. During the 1980s and 1990s, the City saw additional
                                     neighborhood and community shopping center development, especially on the
                                     perimeter of NewPark and in the Four Corners area around Jarvis Avenue and
                                     Newark Boulevard. The City’s hotel market also became well established during this
                                     period.

N EWARK T ODAY
Today, Newark has a multifaceted economy—from robust hotel and retail
establishments to a diverse office, manufacturing and warehousing sector. Like cities
throughout the Bay Area, Newark’s economy suffered during the recession of 2007-
2011. The City has higher commercial vacancy rates than other communities in the
Silicon Valley, although there are signs of recovery and many positive indicators.
Through careful planning and financial management, the City has been able to
balance its budget and create the potential for future surpluses at a time when many
other cities in California have not.
M AJOR E MPL OYERS AND C ORE I NDUSTRIES
Figure ED-1 shows the location of industrial and commercially designated areas in
the city. Commercial uses are clustered around NewPark Mall, the Four Corners
area, and in neighborhood shopping centers along Thornton Avenue. Technology
and office park uses are generally located on the northern edge of the City (Pacific
Research Center), the southern edge of the City (Stevenson Point Business Park). A
band of industrial and warehousing uses extends along the south/west side of the
Cherry Street corridor, and along Central Avenue and Wells/Enterprise in the western
part of the city.
The most recent comprehensive source of data on the composition of jobs in the
city of Newark is the 2007 US Economic Census. Chart ED-1 indicates the
distribution of jobs by sector, with exclusions for certain sectors such as public
administration. More than half of all jobs tallied by the Economic Census were
associated with either retail trade or manufacturing. Another 13 percent were
associated with accommodations and food and 14 percent were associated with
wholesale trade. Compared to nearby communities in Silicon Valley, there are a
relatively large number of moderately paying (e.g., “blue collar”) jobs and a smaller
number of professional and technical (e.g., “white collar”) jobs.
As of 2012, ten employers represented over 16 percent of the total jobs in Newark.
These employers included the Newark Unified School District (700 employees),
Logitech (689 employees), World Pac (280 employees), Full Bloom Baking
Company (280 employees), Risk Management Solutions (270 employees), Smart
Modular Technologies (249 employees), Morpho Detection (208 employees), Cargill
Salt (182 employees), the City of Newark (176 employees), and Valassis

Newark has a number of locational advantages, including its proximity to three
airports (Oakland, Mineta, San Jose, and San Francisco International), and access to
two major freeways via five interchanges (two on SR 84 and three on I-880). The
City is 25 miles from the Port of Oakland and 15 miles from the Port of Redwood
City, has rail-served industrial sites, and has land prices and rents which are far more
affordable than those in Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties. Newark is located just
less than 10 miles from Menlo Park and Palo Alto, and is within easy reach of the
expanding campuses of Google, Facebook, and other major employers on the Lower
Peninsula.

E CO N O M I C D E V E L O P M E N T
                                     While much of Newark’s economic development focus has been on its role as a
                                     “gateway” to Silicon Valley, the city is also an important part of the I-80/I-880
                                     industrial corridor. This corridor stretches from Berkeley to San Jose, and is the heart
                                     of Northern California’s transportation, manufacturing, and warehouse/distribution
                                     economy. In 2005, businesses in this corridor accounted for over 545,000 jobs.
                                     Thus, Newark is not only a gateway, it is also a crossroads—a city that offers access
                                     both to lower cost general industrial space and to high amenity space for industries
                                     in clean technology, bio-technology, health services, and computer manufacturing.
                                     As one of the smaller cities in Silicon Valley, Newark takes prides in providing fast,
                                     personalized service to new and existing businesses. Its zoning regulations offer
                                     flexibility, with fewer limits on building size and height than nearby communities.
                                     The City places a priority on helping businesses negotiate the planning and
                                     permitting processes quickly, efficiently, and with ease.3 The process in Newark is
                                     simple and clear—within two weeks of plan submittal, applicants receive a letter,
                                     tailored to the specific project, providing step-by-step advice on required review,
                                     necessary fees, and application requirements. Typically, the City is able to shepherd
                                     projects from application submittal to City Council determination within 30 days for
                                     smaller projects and 60 days for larger projects. 4

                                     According to the Draft ABAG forecasts for Plan Bay Area (2013), there were roughly
                                     17,870 jobs and 12,970 households in Newark in 2010, equating to a jobs-housing
                                     ratio of 1.38. By contrast, the average for the Bay Area as a whole is 1.29 jobs per
                                     household. Newark has a higher jobs-housing ratio than Fremont (1.27) and Union
                                     City (1.00) but a lower jobs-housing ratio than Hayward (1.52). The jobs-housing
                                     ratio is substantially higher across the bay in Menlo Park (2.35) and Palo Alto (3.37).
                                     This creates strong real estate market pressure on Newark to provide housing for the
                                     workforce in northern Santa Clara County and the Peninsula.
                                     In theory, a jobs/housing balance that is close to the regional average (1.29)
                                     indicates a sustainable economy with the potential for residents to live and work in
                                     the same community. However, because of the city’s location near “job-rich”
                                     communities and its affordability relative to these communities, much of the Newark

workforce commutes to jobs in other cities. By contrast, many of those who work in
Newark also commute in from other cities, in some cases from places as far away as
the Central Valley.
According to the 2009 to 2011 American Community Survey, about 84 percent of
Newark residents commute to jobs outside of Newark. This is not unusual for the
region: over 80 percent of Union City and almost 70 percent of Fremont residents
also commute to work in cities other than the ones where they live.
The City’s policies seek to improve this balance by providing more diverse housing
choices in the city and by attracting jobs which reflect the labor skills of the Newark
workforce. The city seeks both to attract “workforce” housing affordable to lower
and moderate income workers and market rate and “executive” housing for those
with higher incomes. At the same time, it is working to attract higher-paying jobs,
both to provide career opportunities for Newark residents, and to provide those who
work in Newark with the incomes needed to live locally rather than commuting in
from more affordable housing markets. Economic diversification is a critical part of
this strategy, so that the city’s jobs continue to provide a variety of wages for those
with different educational and skill levels.
Looking forward, the City expects to maintain a jobs-housing ratio which exceeds the
regional average. Although housing growth is expected to outpace job growth due
to large numbers of units in the Dumbarton TOD and Southwest Newark Residential
and Recreational Project, Newark continues to have the capacity for additional
industrial and office growth on industrially zoned land, and the potential for
commercial infill and intensification. The City will continue to maintain economic
development programs which attract prospective employers and retailers to these
areas, while providing opportunities to grow existing businesses and promote local
entrepreneurship.
E CONOMIC D EVELOPMENT P ROGRAMS
Economic development services in Newark are administered by the City’s
Community Development Department. As a small city, Newark does not have a
separate Economic Development Department or Division. The Community
Development Department works in partnership with the Chamber of Commerce to
facilitate business attraction, retention, and expansion, and to promote Newark to
prospective employers and businesses. The Department strives to support the City’s
                                                                                                                        ED-7

                                     position in the region.
                                     THE RETAIL ECONOMY
                                     Retailing is one of the strongest economic sectors in Newark and is one of the two
                                     main revenue sources for City government. According to the City’s 2012-2017 Five-
                                     Year Forecast, sales taxes represented 25 percent of municipal operating revenues in
                                     2011-2012 and are approximately equal to property tax revenues. The City
                                     experienced a drop in sales tax revenue between 2008 and 2012 due to the
                                     recession. While there are signs of recovery, the closure of major retailers such as
                                     Target in 2012 has hindered job and revenue growth. The retail sector is expected to
                                     rebound slightly in the coming years, and should grow much stronger as the city’s
                                     population increases due to new housing development.
                                     R ETAIL D ISTRICTS
                                     Newark’s retail industry is distributed into several different geographic areas: New
                                     Park Mall is located just south of the I-880/ Mowry interchange. Nearby shopping
                                     centers serve the southern part of the city, as well as adjoining neighborhoods in
                                     Fremont and other parts of Newark. The Four Corners area serves the northern part
                                     of the city, and to some extent serves the adjacent Ardenwood Technology Park and
                                     Ardenwood residential areas in Fremont. In the heart of the city, the Old Town
                                     Newark Retail area includes a mix of smaller shopping centers and local-serving
                                     businesses. There are also several neighborhood-scale shopping centers along
                                     major corridors, and scattered smaller retail businesses on the edges of the city’s
                                     industrial districts.
                                     New Park Mall occupies over 1,161,000 square feet and includes more than 140
                                     stores. It is home to Macy’s, JC Penney, Sears, and Burlington Coat Factory, along
                                     with many smaller shops and restaurants. As a regional retail destination, the Mall
                                     will continue to bring visitors and shoppers and be a significant revenue source for
                                     the city. The perimeter of the Mall includes other shopping centers, including the
                                     mostly vacant Mowry Crossings (formerly anchored by Mervyn’s), Mowry Plaza (also
                                     called the Lion Center), Cedar Village, and NewPark Plaza (home to TJ Maxx and
                                     Payless). To the south/east of this area, an adjoining retail district includes several

auto dealerships, other commercial uses such as health clubs and restaurants, and
several major hotels.
Four Corners, a retail district in the northern portion of the City, consists of stores
and services located around the four corners of Jarvis Avenue and Newark
Boulevard. Because of its proximity to offices and business campuses, workers
represent a significant part of the market here. The area includes several grocery
stores, including Safeway and Raley’s Supermarkets and a new Mi Pueblo
Supermarket (in a space formerly occupied by Albertsons), and several clothing and
general merchandise stores, including a new Ross Dress for Less in the Newark
Marketplace Shopping Center. Orchard Supply Hardware is also located in this area.
The area also includes a full complement of banks, restaurants, smaller retailers,
personal services, and auto-oriented uses.
Old Town Newark is Newark’s original shopping district and was the city’s major
retail area until the 1970s. It presents interesting historic characteristics which could
be attractive to retailers and consumers, although it serves a different niche than the
larger suburban-style shopping centers. The shopping district has the potential to be
a more dynamic, pedestrian-oriented retail district in the heart of the city, and could
capture niche uses such as restaurants, antique shops, and boutiques.
Other retail centers in Newark include a small shopping center at Mayhews Landing
Road and Newark Boulevard (anchored by Grocery Outlet), the Home Depot on
Thornton near I-880, Newark Square (Thornton at Cedar), and a neighborhood
shopping center at Central and Timber Lane just west of I-880. Monthly retail rents
at these centers and at other neighborhood shopping centers in the Four Corners
and NewPark areas were generally in the range of $2 to $4 per square foot in 2013.
Along with existing retail districts, there is also a planned retail district near the
Dumbarton Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) project. This center will serve
future residents and workers in the area. The new TOD retail center will be designed
to be more pedestrian and bicycle friendly than the city’s existing neighborhood
shopping centers and will serve arriving and departing transit passengers as well as
those living and working in the area.

                                     dynamic employment centers in the world (Silicon Valley), the city has a thriving
                                     hotel industry. The City’s hotel occupancy tax is an important source of municipal
                                     revenue and the hotels themselves generate hundreds of local jobs. Moreover, hotel
                                     visitors patronize Newark restaurants and businesses, generating additional revenue
                                     for the community and providing additional jobs. Because of the lower cost of land
                                     relative to the West Bay, room rates in Newark are generally lower than comparable
                                     accommodations in the 101 corridor.
                                     There are over 1,700 hotel rooms in the city. Newark provides a number of top-end

                                     concentrated in the Gateway area around the two SR 84 interchanges, and in the

                                     sales taxes and transient occupancy taxes between 2010 and 2014. As the table
                                     illustrates, total tax revenue from these sources has consistently been in the range of
                                     $11 million annually.
                                     Sales and Use Taxes, which generally come from retailers, generated roughly $8.1
                                     million in Fiscal Year 2010-2011. Projections indicate this volume will remain
                                     relatively flat for the coming years, although slight increases are projected as the
                                     economy recovers and vacancies are reduced. At the regional level, retail sales have
                                     seen an uptick and the cost of space is increasing. Between June 2011 and the end
                                     of 2012, the median cost per square foot of retail space in the San Francisco-
                                     Oakland-Fremont region increased 5.6 percent. 5
                                     Consumer retail preferences are changing, with a shift toward regional “power”
                                     centers such as Union Landing (Union City) and Pacific Commons (Fremont) and
                                     “urban mixed use” centers such as Santana Row in San Jose. The latter concept
                                     emphasizes active ground floor retail, restaurants, entertainment (such as movie
                                     theaters), structured parking, and architectural and streetscape features which

recreate a “traditional” downtown shopping environment. Upper story uses such as
housing are often introduced to add vitality to these centers. There may be
opportunities to pursue such retail formats in Newark in the coming decades.
Some of the interest in vacant retail spaces in the city has been from discount and
dollar stores. While the demand for these uses is a positive sign of a recovering
market, there is also a concern that a diverse mix of goods and services continue to
be offered. Newark is actively promoting higher quality retail, both to generate
revenue and because community members have repeatedly expressed a desire for
higher quality shopping and dining choices.
Along with the retail sales revenue, the hospitality tax (Transient Occupancy Tax) is
another major revenue source for the City. In Fiscal Year 2010-2011, the hospitality
sector brought the City $2,785,300 in revenue. It is projected to reach more than $3
million revenue by Fiscal Year 2013-2014, which would be about 11 percent of the
City’s total tax revenue.
Currently there are no new hotels being built in the city, but several are being
renovated. Occupancy rates have continued to improve during the last few years,
but average room rates have remained static. The City is working with the Chamber
of Commerce and hotel operators to developing marketing tools to attract business
travelers to the city, and make Newark the location of choice for the longer-term
business traveler to the Silicon Valley market.

                                     THE OFFICE AND INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY
                                     As noted earlier, Newark’s location in the northern part of Silicon Valley has
                                     contributed to its growth as an office and industrial center. The city’s rail and
                                     freeway access made it a high-demand location for warehousing, distribution, and
                                     manufacturing in the 1960s and 70s. Improvements to the Dumbarton Bridge and
                                     State Route 84 made the city a logical expansion area for the tech sector in the Palo
                                     Alto-San Jose corridor during the 1980s and 1990s. The city offered lower land
                                     costs, large vacant tracts, and proximity to the East Bay workforce, spurring the
                                     development of several business parks and technology campuses. These areas
                                     attracted businesses in the supply chain serving the tech economy, as well as tech
                                     businesses themselves.
                                     Sun Microsystems’ decision to develop its Newark campus in the late 1990s was a
                                     turning point for the city and heralded Newark’s emergence as location for corporate
                                     offices as well as manufacturing and distribution centers. Unfortunately, Sun’s
                                     departure in 2004 left Newark with one of the highest office/flex vacancy rates in the
                                     region. As of the fourth quarter of 2012, Kidder Matthews reported the city’s
                                     vacancy rate was 33.1 percent, compared to a submarket average of 12.8 percent.
                                     Rental rates averaged $1.00 a square foot, compared to $2.00 in Fremont and $5.60
                                     in Palo Alto.6 Lower rents provide an important competitive advantage for Newark,
                                     and make the city well positioned to capture start-up and incubator uses seeking
                                     affordable space for their initial operations.
                                     Despite persistent high vacancy rates in some parts of the city, Newark is also well
                                     positioned for recovery and continued growth. The city continues to have locational
                                     advantages which ensure its resilience as the economy grows and jobs increase.
                                     Pacific Research Center (PRC), in particular, offers opportunities for high-quality,
                                     amenity-rich office space. The 93-acre Stevenson Point Technology Park at the west
                                     end of Stevenson Boulevard, is likewise an attractive location for new and emerging
                                     industries, including those in the tech and biotech sectors. The City has made
                                     infrastructure investment a priority, and is seeking to provide the information and
                                     telecommunication capacity necessary to attract prospective employers.
                                     There are approximately 1,030 acres in the city with an industrial General Plan
                                     designation. Approximately 60 percent of this acreage is designated “general

industrial,” which is the most permissive of the industrial land use categories and
allows the broadest variety of industrial uses. Another 30 percent is designated
“special industrial,” generally corresponding to the PRC and Stevenson Point
Technology Parks. The remaining 10 percent is designated “limited industrial;” these
areas primarily serve as buffers between general industrial and residential areas, or
correspond to small, older pockets of industry within the city. In total, industrially
designated land represents 13 percent of Newark’s land area. If open space is
subtracted out of this equation, industrial land represents 21 percent of the city.
The City’s “Special Industrial” areas several sites appropriate for corporate
headquarters and large regional campuses. Opportunities for office space also exist
within the regional commercial area around NewPark Mall. In addition, some of the
city’s older industrial sites have low improvement to land value ratios (e.g., few
structures and high land values). These sites offer the potential for more
economically productive uses in the future, including office, manufacturing,
laboratories, research facilities, and other lighter industrial activities.
Newark’s more traditional industries will also be strongly supported and encouraged
in the future. While the City may attract tech firms and see some increases in
employment densities and space utilization, one of Newark’s strengths is its
affordability relative to other submarkets in the Bay Area. The City wishes to remain
a viable location for large scale warehouse and distribution facilities, general industry,
and activities requiring areas for outdoor operations and storage. Such activities are
expected to remain predominant in the Cherry Street industrial area and in the
Central Avenue and Wells/Enterprise areas. Unless compelling reasons and
economic benefits exist, zoning for these areas should preclude their conversion to
retail uses, housing, and activities which may interfere with industries on surrounding
sites.
WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS
According to 2007-2011 American Community Survey (US Census) data, there are
roughly 23,000 Newark residents in the labor force. Chart ED-2 indicates the types
of jobs held by these residents. Education, health care, and social services is the
largest single sector, employing 19 percent of the city’s workforce. This is followed
closely by manufacturing, which employs 18 percent of the workforce. Other large
sectors include Professional, Scientific, Technical and Management professions (14
percent), Retail Trade (11 percent).

                                     While manufacturing and retail jobs represent half of the jobs in the city (see Chart
                                     ED-1), they represent 29 percent of the jobs held by Newark residents. This suggests
                                     that a large number of those employed in these sectors are commuting into Newark
                                     from elsewhere.

                                     diploma, which is somewhat higher than Fremont and lower than Union City. About
                                     36 percent of Newark’s residents have a high school diploma but no further
                                     secondary education. This is substantially higher than the 20.5 percent in Fremont
                                     and 25.7 percent in Union City. The statistics point to the important benefits that
                                     Ohlone College can provide in preparing Newark adults for higher skilled, higher-
                                     paying jobs. Opportunities to partner with other institutions of higher learning, such
                                     as the California State University and the University of California, can also help
                                     promote lifelong learning in Newark.

The unemployment rate among Newark residents has fluctuated, as it has
throughout the Bay Area. Based on monthly data from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, the unemployment rate was 7.6 percent in December 2012, down from a
recession high of 10.9 percent in July and August 2010. Unemployment had been
as low as 1.8 percent in December 1999 and was 3.1 percent as recently as May
2007. The impact of the recession was most noticeable between September 2008
and July 2009, when unemployment in Newark grew from 4.7 percent to 8.2 percent
in just ten months. The city’s unemployment rate today is virtually the same as the
rate in Union City, slightly higher than Fremont (5.9 percent), and slightly lower than
Hayward (9.2 percent).
Income characteristics in Newark are also similar to neighboring cities. The city’s
median household income is $83,346, which is slightly higher than Union City
($80,281) and lower than Fremont ($95,182). The 2007-2011 American Community
Survey indicates that approximately 39 percent of Newark’s households have annual
incomes above $100,000, while 11 percent earn less than $25,000 a year. In order
to provide a better match between local jobs and workforce skills and raise the
income earning potential of Newark households, this Element supports quality
education and job training, and partnerships with local employers and institutions to
develop a highly skilled and competitive labor force. Policies and actions also seek
to attract small local businesses to create more local employment.

                                     As noted earlier, 84 percent of Newark’s workforce commutes to other cities for their
                                     employment. The median travel time in 2007-2011 was 25.6 minutes. About 78
                                     percent of the city’s employed residents drove alone to work, while 12 percent
                                     carpooled. Less than 4 percent used public transportation, and 2 percent worked
                                     from home. Moving forward, the city seeks to reduce the percentage of residents
                                     who drive alone to work by providing additional options, such as bicycling, BART
                                     shuttles, and new premium transit services to the West Bay.
                                     NEWARK’S IDENTITY
                                     One of Newark’s economic development and community development goals is to
                                     establish a strong, positive identity for the city. Over the years, the city has suffered
                                     from the lack of a distinct identity, in part because of its lack of a vibrant
                                     “Downtown,” its flat terrain and absence of strong visual landmarks, and its relatively
                                     uniform development pattern. For many Bay Area residents, there is little to
                                     distinguish Newark from Fremont and the other communities along the East Bay
                                     Plain. San Francisco Bay itself has been the city’s “back yard” rather than its “front
                                     yard.”
                                     Through adoption of this General Plan, Newark aspires to reorient itself to San
                                     Francisco Bay to a greater extent than it has in the past and to establish itself as a
                                     bayfront city. This can be accomplished while still protecting and even celebrating
                                     the active industrial and salt harvesting, refining, and production uses that occur near
                                     the shoreline. Construction of the Bay Trail, restoration of wetlands, and develop-
                                     ment of the Dumbarton TOD and Southwest Newark Residential and Recreational
                                     project all provide opportunities to focus on the Bay, and establish stronger
                                     connections to the marshes and sloughs that define the city’s western flank, while
                                     respecting Newark’s industrial past, present, and future.
                                     Another key factor in strengthening the city’s identity is to attract higher-end and
                                     more dynamic retail, restaurant, and entertainment choices to the city. In the
                                     coming years, Newark will face growing competition from surrounding cities aiming
                                     to create new “downtowns” and provide more sophisticated and contemporary
                                     shopping experiences. Newark residents and workers have expressed support for
                                     bringing a more vibrant, higher end retail mix to the city, with new restaurants and
                                     entertainment venues complementing new retail choices. These kinds of develop-
                                     ments can have a tremendous positive impact on the city’s image and appeal while
                                     generating revenues and creating jobs.

Newark has the opportunity to capitalize on its relatively healthy economic outlook
as it looks to the next 20 to 25 years. The city continues to do well in providing
diverse job and housing choices, but it must take additional steps to better match
available jobs and resident skill levels. Newark needs to attract employers to
accommodate its skilled labor pool; at the same time, it must improve the readiness
of Newark residents to fill new jobs. Education, job training, job creation, and job
placement must be carefully coordinated to fully achieve the City’s economic vision.
The goals, policies, and actions below are intended to help the City balance
competing priorities while accommodating the diverse needs for a sustainable
economic future.
GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
A R E S I LIENT A ND T H RI VING E CO NOMY
GOAL ED-1            Sustain a thriving and growing local economy that is
                     resilient to economic and financial cycles.
P O L ICIES
Policy E D-1.1       Quality Business Environment. Create a favorable environment for
                     business in New ark, with City policies, tax rates, and regulations that
                     encourage business growth and development.
Policy E D-1.2       Newark’s C ompetiti ve Edge. Maintain and enhance Newark’s
                     competitive edge relative to other cities in the East Bay, Silicon Valley,
                     and Peninsula Areas, particular ly in the technology sector. This w ill
                     require competitive fees and fast processing times.
Policy E D-1.3       Revenue Ge neration. Support continued expansion of the munic ipal
                     tax base, inc luding property, transient occupancy, and sales taxes, to
                     ensure adequate funding for public facilities and servic es.
                     Development should generally have a positive fiscal impact on the
                     City, unless other compelling community benefits will be provided.
                     An example of a project with a neutral or slightly negative fiscal
                     impact that provides a “compelling community benefit” might be
                     senior housing or childcare. Such uses help create and sustain a
                     strong community but do not necessar ily generate revenue for the
                     city.
                                                                                                                              ED-17

                                     Policy E D-1.4 Core Industries. Continue to support and grow the city’s core
                                                    industries, while remaining flexible as core industries change and
                                                    evolve. Work with the Chamber of Commerce and property owners
                                                    to leverage the potential of core industries and emerging industries to
                                                    provide employment opportunities in related or supporting sectors,
                                                    such as retail, hospitality, and health care.
                                     Policy E D-1.5 Managi ng Land Resources. Ensur e the wise use of Newark’s
                                                    available industrial and commercial land supply. The City w ill plan
                                                    strategically to ensure that the economic development potential of its
                                                    commercial and industrial areas is fully realiz ed. Vacant sites in such
                                                    areas should be view ed as essential assets that can be used to
                                                    strengthen and diversify N ewark’s economy. Land uses such as group
                                                    assembly, which are potentially incompatible with industrial
                                                    operations and retail vitality, should be discouraged in the city’s major
                                                    employment centers.
                                                    The C ity’s zoning regulations should address those business districts
                                                    where non-industrial uses such as group assembly may be
                                                    acceptable, and those areas where it should be prohibited or
                                                    permitted only with a use permit to avoid conflicts with industrial
                                                    operations nearby.
                                     Policy E D-1.6 Business Retention and Recruitme nt. Work with the Chamber of
                                                    Commerce and other local businesses and economic development
                                                    organizations to r etain jobs in the city, and to recruit and support new
                                                    business and business growth.
                                     Policy E D-1.7 Flexibility.     Ensure that City polic ies, zoning, and economic
                                                    development programs ar e flexible enough to respond to rapid
                                                    changes in technology, real estate market dynamics, and the
                                                    workplace. Economic development efforts should be modified and
                                                    adapted as necessary as local, regional, national, and global economic
                                                    conditions evolve.
                                     Policy E D-1.8 Partnerships. Build and str engthen partnerships with the C ity’s

Policy E D-1.9  Communic ations. Strive for frequent and effective communication
                with the business community. The Chamber of Commerce is a key
                partner in this regard. The City should provide opportunities for local
                businesses to communicate their issues and needs to City staff, and
                should demonstrate responsiveness through follow-up actions.
Policy E D-1.10 Infr astruc ture. Work with local utilities and other partner s to
                maintain the infrastructure needed to support economic development,
                including water, sew er, storm drainage, power, communications, and
                other utilities.
Policy E D-1.11 Transportati on. P lan for sufficient transportation capac ity and
                municipal services to serve the buildout of ar eas designated for retail,
                office and industry.          Recogniz e and respond to the special
                transportation needs of logistics, warehouse, and distr ibution
                industries, including provisions for trucks and easy access to Interstate
                880 and State Route 84.
Policy E D-1.12 Access to Mass Transit. I mprove transportation options for those
                who live or work in Newark. This should inc lude improved linkages
                between Newark’s employment centers and the BART stations in
                Fremont and Union City, as w ell as the planned Dumbarton rail
                service which will provide linkages to the employment c enters of the
                West Bay.

Policy E D-1.14 Jobs-Housing Ratio. Encourage a jobs and housing balance that is

                corresponds to the wages and employment characteristics of projected
                employment in Newark.
                The City will continue to provide sufficient residentially zoned land to
                meet its Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHN A) as defined by

               space, wildlife refuges, and bay vistas.
               The City’s natural features and connections to San Francisco Bay are
               a “selling point” that should be leveraged to attract new employers.

CONSERVATION AND
SUSTAINABILITY

INTRODUCTION
This Element of the General Plan addresses the preservation and conservation of
natural resources in Newark. It meets the Government Code requirement for a
“Conservation” Element which presents the City’s policies for soils, minerals,
wetlands, wildlife, water, and other natural resources. The City of Newark has
expanded the required scope of the Conservation Element to also address
sustainability. This provides an opportunity to express the City’s policies on tree
protection, greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction, green building and low impact
development, water and energy conservation, and waste reduction and recycling.
Like other elements of the General Plan, this chapter is divided into two sections.
The first section provides background information on the City’s natural resources, as
well as its sustainability programs. The second section provides goals, policies, and
actions on conservation and sustainability issues.
NEWARK’S NATURAL LANDSCAPE
Newark is located on the edge of San Francisco Bay, one of California’s most
important natural features. The city sits on an alluvial plain that slopes gently toward
the Bay. Newark’s terrain is relatively flat with ground elevations ranging from 5 feet
below sea level within diked pond areas near the Bay to 37 feet near the northern
edge of the city. San Francisco Bay itself has been significantly altered during the past
200 years as a result of diking and filling for agriculture, resource extraction, and
urban uses.
Approximately 46 percent of the city, or 4,126 acres, is categorized as non-urbanized
land. This includes 521 acres of open space, including 239 acres designated for Parks
and Recreational Facilities and 282 acres designated for Conservation.
                                                                                            CS-1

                                                          The Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge (originally called the
                                                          San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge) lies immediately adjacent to the western
                                                          edge of the city. The Refuge was created in 1974 and was the first urban national
                                                          wildlife refuge in the United States. The continuing mission of the Refuge is to
                                                          preserve natural resources, including habitat for migratory birds, harbor seals, and
                                                          threatened and endangered species; to provide environmental education and
                                                          wildlife interpretation opportunities; and to preserve open space and wildlife-
                                                          oriented recreation. Although most of the Refuge is in Fremont, it contributes to the
                                                          open space quality of the area and provides a unique natural resource for Newark

                                                          to utilize evaporator ponds, commonly referred to as “salt ponds” or “evaporators”
                                                          for its solar salt production system. The Refuge’s mission to protect natural resources
                                                          co-exists well with Cargill’s solar salt system. As noted by the San Francisco Bay
                                                          Conservation and Development Commission in its October 2005 Staff Report on Salt
                                                          Ponds, in connection with the San Francisco Bay Plan (Bay Plan), “[s]alt ponds

                                                          and “the Bay Plan salt pond policies should support ongoing salt production in San

                                                          Beyond the bayfront, most of Newark consists of urbanized uses where natural

                                                          yards, landscaped areas, and open spaces provide habitat for native and non-native
                                                          birds and animals. The city’s trees and green spaces define the character of the city,
                                                          add visual beauty, and enhance environmental quality. Newark’s physical setting is
                                                          an important component in guiding future development, and protection of its

                                                          Newark’s soils are composed of sand, silt, and clay deposited over thousands of
                                                          years by streams flowing from the East Bay Hills to the Bay. Historically, the
                                                          agricultural capacity of these soils was limited by poor drainage, excessive amounts
                                                          of salt that are toxic to most plants, and poor quality water for irrigation. Soil

suitability for field crops is rated on a scale of I to VIII, with I being the best and VIII
being the most limited. Newark’s soils range from Class III to VIII, but even the Class
III soils are classified by the Soil Conservation Service as having “severe” limitations.
With proper irrigation, Class III soils can be made productive; however, they occur in
parts of Newark that are already urbanized.
There are two areas in Newark that have been designated as Urban Prime
Agricultural Lands, including a conservation area east of the Thornton/Jarvis
intersection (designated as Conservation Open Space) and a 90-acre area west of
Stevenson Boulevard on the west side of the Union Pacific Railroad. In addition,
most of the land used by Cargill salt for the harvesting, refining, and production of
salt within the city of Newark (separate and apart from Cargill‘s solar salt pond
system within the Refuge within the city of Fremont) is zoned for agricultural use and
is covered by Williamson Act Agricultural Preserve contracts. The Williamson Act
provides a lower tax rate for these properties in exchange for a legal agreement to
retain them in agricultural use.
Soil conditions also affect the suitability of land for construction. Many of Newark’s
soils have a high clay content, which tends to shrink and swell as the level of
moisture in the soil changes. When the soil is dry, it becomes brittle and develops
cracks in the surface. When it is wet, it becomes elastic and weak. The continuous
expansion and contraction of the soil is sufficient to crack foundations and
pavement. Because much of Newark’s development is built in such soils, proper
drainage facilities, which divert water away from building sites and road bases, are
essential. Engineering solutions have been developed to compensate for site-specific
soil characteristics and reduce the risk of damage.
MINERAL RESOURCES
O VERVIEW
There are no mining operations within the city of Newark itself. There is one mining
operation commonly referred to as the Dumbarton Quarry just west of the City limit
line and south of SR 84. This is a gravel quarry within the city of Fremont. It closed
in 2007 and is not expected to reopen.
                                                                                                                                                 CS-3

                                                          Many of the original tidal marsh areas along the Bay shoreline were originally sold
                                                          and leveed for land development purposes under the federal Swamp Act of 1850
                                                          and the State of California Green Act of 1868. Although minor salt production was
                                                          initiated in the late 19th Century, large scale salt production was not initiated until the
                                                          beginning of the 20th Century. The salt evaporation ponds were largely located in
                                                          former tidal areas; however, the crystallizers and salt production facilities were
                                                          constructed in upland areas bordering the tidal marsh. Salt from the South Bay
                                                          ponds is used for a variety of purposes, including the California dairy industry,
                                                          pharmaceutical companies, and retail consumption.
                                                          The South Bay Restoration Project is a joint effort by the state and federal
                                                          governments to restore 15,100 acres of salt ponds in the southern part of the Bay,
                                                          known as the Ravenswood Ponds (near Redwood City), the Alviso Ponds (near San
                                                          Jose) and the Eden Landing Ponds (near Union City). These ponds were sold and
                                                          donated by Cargill in 2003. Although outside Newark’s city limits, the Project will
                                                          provide improved habitat for wetland species in the area.
                                                          Another 12,000 acres of salt ponds sold and donated by Cargill were placed into the
                                                          Don Edwards National Wildlife Refuge in the City of Fremont. The Refuge is
                                                          managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to provide for natural
                                                          resource and habitat preservation. As noted above, Cargill has retained perpetual
                                                          rights to utilize the salt ponds within the Refuge (and outside the City of Newark) for
                                                          its solar salt production system. These operations will continue for the foreseeable
                                                          future.
                                                          Within the Refuge, Cargill’s solar salt operation consists of a series of evaporator
                                                          ponds (also referred to as “salt ponds” or “evaporators”) where bay water is
                                                          introduced. Solar evaporation increases the salinity of the brines in these evaporators.
                                                          The brines are then pumped or transferred by Cargill sequentially through a series of
                                                          evaporators over a period of years. Each subsequent evaporation pond is more saline

Plant Site, which are large, man-made, engineered beds. Salt is precipitated within the
crystallizers, where it is mechanically harvested by Cargill using heavy equipment and
sent to an on-site processing facility. In contrast to the low salinity salt ponds within
the Refuge, the crystallizers are inhospitable to vegetation and wildlife due to the high
salinity of brines transferred into the crystallizers and the mechanized harvesting
process. Operations within the Newark Plant Site are also completely closed to the
public, due to the high salinity of the crystallizers and the presence of heavy
machinery and equipment. Hence, while some of the salt evaporators within the
Refuge (and outside the City of Newark) provide habitat for specific species of wildlife,
the Newark Plant Site contains very limited or no vegetation or biological
characteristics or habitat to support species use. 2
VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE
R EGUL ATORY F RAMEWORK
The management of Newark’s vegetation and wildlife is governed by federal and
state laws. Relevant federal laws include the Endangered Species Act, the Clean
Water Act (CWA), and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Applicable state laws include the
California Endangered Species Act, the Fish and Game Code, the Native Plant
Protection Act, the Marine Life Protection Act, and the Porter Cologne Water Quality
Protection Act. Collectively, these laws require that state and federal agencies are
consulted before changes that could affect fish and wildlife are approved.
The Federal Endangered Species Act protects fish and wildlife species that are listed
as threatened or endangered, including the habitats of these species. “Endangered”
species are those that are in danger of extinction in all or a significant portion of their
range. “Threatened” species are those that are likely to become endangered in the
near future. Federal agencies must consult with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration if they determine that a
project may affect a listed species. The Act also prohibits the “take” of any fish or
wildlife species listed as endangered, including the destruction of habitat that
prevents the species’ recovery. It also prohibits the unlawful removal, damage, or
destruction of endangered plants. Other federal laws govern actions that could affect
migratory birds and their nests, and the discharge of materials into surface water or
wetland areas.

                                                          At the State level, the California Fish and Game Code requires protection for a variety
                                                          of species. The California Endangered Species Act mandates that if a development
                                                          project would result in the ‘take” of a threatened or endangered species, then
                                                          mitigation must be provided as part of an Incidental Take Permit issued by the
                                                          Department of Fish and Wildlife. The State Code also requires a Streambed
                                                          Alternation Agreement before allowing any changes to shorelines, channels, or creek
                                                          banks. State law also prohibits the destruction of active raptor nests, including those
                                                          that relate to tree removal or nearby human activity, that causes nest abandonment.
                                                          California also has laws that protect native plants, including those listed as plants of
                                                          special concern by the California Native Plant Society (CNPS).

                                                          established in 1965 to promote responsible planning and regulation of San Francisco

       The US Army Corps of Engineers regulates the discharge of fill materials into
       wetlands, as well as sloughs, streams, and San Francisco Bay itself. Discharge
       into these waters is also regulated by the California Regional Water Quality
       Control Board (RWQCB). When development is proposed in areas where
       wetlands may be present, detailed on-site surveys are required and mitigation
       must be provided for any potential habitat impacts. If there will still be a
       possibility of impacts once a development is built, long-term agreements are
       required to ensure that wetlands are permanently protected.
       There are a variety of wetland types within the city, including:
        Saline emergent wetlands, which are located along the Bay and contain salt
          or brackish marshes.
        Lacustrine areas, which include inland depressions or
          channels with standing water.
        Fresh emergent wetlands, which are located along the shore and inland.
          These areas form the transition between hydric and non-hydric soils are
          among the most productive wildlife habitats in California. They provide
          food, cover, and water for numerous bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian
          species.
      Uplands. Upland areas in Newark consist primarily of urbanized land. These
       areas include tree groves (including non-native Eucalyptus groves), street
       trees, parks, and front and back yards throughout the city. Wildlife in the
       urbanized areas consist primarily of species that have adapted to urban
       conditions, including mice, skunks, foxes, and opossums. The city also
       contains pockets of annual grasslands, which provide foraging and breeding
       grounds for birds and other mammals and reptiles.

human activities. An overview of these species is provided below, based on a review
of the California Natural Diversity Data Base (CNDDB). Special steps are required
when making land use decisions in areas where rare, threatened, or endangered

water resources such as creeks, bays, and lakes. State and federal laws shape the City
of Newark’s water policies and ensure that water resources are carefully managed.
Among the most important federal water laws is the CWA of 1972. Under the CWA,
the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishes water quality regulations
to ensure the beneficial uses of water and protect these uses from pollution. The
CWA also established a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to
regulate municipal and industrial discharges to surface waters, including discharges
from City storm drains (generally referred to as non-point sources) as well as direct
outfalls from activities such as factories and wastewater treatment plants (generally
referred to as point sources). NPDES permits identify limits on the allowable
concentrations of different chemicals that may enter surface waters. They also
prohibit certain discharges and establish requirements for pollution pre-treatment,
prevention, and monitoring.
At the state level, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act was passed in 1969
to protect California’s streams, groundwater, and other bodies of water that are not
under federal jurisdiction. The Act established the State Water Resource Control
Board (SWRCB) and created nine RWQCBs to adopt plans that set water quality
objectives, along with programs to achieve those objectives. The RWQCBs also issue
and enforce a range of permits and standards. Newark is under the jurisdiction of
the San Francisco Bay RWQCB.
Other state agencies regulate the safety and quality of California’s drinking water,
environmental health and hazards, and the alteration of water bodies, including any
construction that would divert or obstruct the natural flow of water or substantially
alter the banks of any stream or lake. In addition, the Department of Water
Resources oversees water-related activities. Among the concerns expressed in its
most recent Water Management Plan are drought, aging infrastructure, climate
change, population growth, and sea level rise. State regulations also require
completion of water supply assessments when large-scale new development is
proposed, and the development of groundwater management plans. Newark’s water
supplier—the Alameda County Water District (ACWD)—has prepared such a plan for
the groundwater basin that underlies Newark.
Recent state laws also require water conservation. The Water Conservation Act of
2009 requires a 20 percent reduction in per capita water use, both for domestic and
                                                                                                                                            CS-9

                                                          ACWD to reduce water usage during the coming years. ACWD is already working to
                                                          achieve these targets through incentive programs and public education.
                                                          Since 2010, the State of California has also required all cities and counties to adopt
                                                          and enforce landscape water conservation ordinances. The State prepared a model

                                                          adopting their own requirements as long as the same objectives were achieved. The
                                                          City of Newark has adopted a Bay Friendly Landscape Guide that is consistent with
                                                          State requirements and encourages drought-tolerant plants and low-flow irrigation

                                                          The City’s water supply is managed by the ACWD. This supply includes water that
                                                          originates as precipitation within the Alameda Creek watershed and water that is
                                                          transported from the Sacramento/San Joaquin River Delta through the South Bay
                                                          Aqueduct. The South Bay Aqueduct delivers water to a treatment facility in Fremont,
                                                          where it is disinfected and filtered. Water from both sources is stored in a series of
                                                          large ponds in Fremont called the Quarry Lakes, where it percolates to the
                                                          groundwater basin.
                                                          Sixteen wells—including six located in Newark—are used to pump water from the
                                                          groundwater basin to a system of distribution mains serving residents and
                                                          businesses. These 16 wells are capable of producing up to 47.5 million gallons of
                                                          water per day (MGD). An additional 20 percent of ACWD’s water supply comes from
                                                          the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in Yosemite National Park. That water is purchased from
                                                          the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. The quality of the Hetch Hetchy water
                                                          is excellent and only requires simple disinfecting for domestic use.
                                                          ACWD also receives about 10 MGD of water from the Newark Desalinization Facility.
                                                          This is the first brackish water desalinization (Desal) facility in Northern California. It
                                                          produces drinkable water by removing salts and other minerals from brackish
                                                          groundwater through reverse osmosis. The treated saltwater is then blended with
                                                          other supplies for delivery.
                                                          The groundwater basin itself consists of gravel, sand, silt, and clay. The gravel and
                                                          sand is highly permeable, allowing water to seep into the ground where it is stored
                                                          in what is known as an aquifer. The Hayward Fault divides the Niles Cone into two
                                                          basins; Newark is located in the portion of the basin below the Fault line. This
                                                          aquifer is relatively shallow and lies between 40 and 140 feet below the ground in
                                                          most inland locations. The depth to groundwater is much shallower near the edge of
                                                          the Bay.
                                                          At one time, the Niles Cone was filled with fresh water and had a westerly gradient
                                                          toward the Bay. However, the pumping of water for agriculture and development in
                                                          the Niles Cone basin caused water levels to drop below sea level in the 1920s, which
                                                          caused saltwater from the Bay to migrate into the aquifer. This compromised water
                                                          quality and eventually required that ACWD purchase water from supplemental
                                                          sources to restore groundwater quality. Since the 1960s, ACWD has been using
                                                          water from the State Water Project to recharge the basin and correct water salinity

conditions. In the 1970s, ACWD took further steps to reduce saltwater intrusion,
including a series of wells to intercept bay water before it reached the aquifer.
Although there has been substantial improvement, a considerable amount of salt
water still remains. Potable water quality may also be threatened by urban activities,
and from past industrial activities that may result in chemical plumes. The ACWD
works continuously to address these issues through groundwater monitoring,
pumping operations, and the procurement of supplemental water supplies as
needed.
W ATER Q UAL ITY
Stormwater runoff is the principal source of water pollution in Newark, with the
potential to affect both surface water and groundwater. During periods of heavy rain,
stormwater can carry pollution and sediments into streams, channels, wetlands, and
the Bay either directly or via storm sewers. Non-storm discharges, such as accidental
spills and irrigation, can also carry contaminants from land surfaces into local waters.
Typical pollutants include oil and grease from motor vehicles, paint, leaves and yard
waste, pesticides and herbicides, fertilizer, solvents and household chemicals, animal
waste, litter, and construction debris. Although Newark does not have natural creeks
or rivers, its storm drainage system transports runoff from streets, parking lots, and
yards into a system of flood control channels that eventually reaches San Francisco
Bay.
The Engineering Division of the Newark Public Works Department is responsible for
carrying out the City’s stormwater quality initiatives. This includes stormwater control
requirements for businesses and new development, enforcement of illicit discharge
regulations, street sweeping, cleanouts of storm drain inlets, and a variety of public
education and outreach events. Public Works staff attends community events to get
the word out about water quality regulations, and to raise awareness of water quality
issues. The City also works closely with the Alameda Countywide Clean Water
Program on watershed planning and water quality monitoring.
SUSTAINABILITY
Sustainability refers to the use of resources in a way that ensures they are not
permanently depleted or damaged. Living more sustainably can help support the
quality of life for future generations by improving the balance between human
                                                                                                                                           CS-13

                                                          activity and nature. From Newark’s perspective, this requires planning not only for
                                                          today’s needs, but also for future needs, without harming the city’s natural resources.
                                                          Some of the most important ways a city can be more sustainable are by reducing
                                                          pollution, consuming less water and energy, reducing waste, recycling more, and
                                                          curbing the emission of GHGs, which contribute to global climate change.
                                                          The City of Newark was officially incorporated in 1955, a period synonymous with
                                                          car culture. Many cities that developed around this time were almost entirely focused
                                                          on cars. Cities emerged near newly constructed freeways, with wide streets and
                                                          plenty of parking. People began to commute to work by car, and lower density,
                                                          suburban-style development became common.
                                                          Today, the practicality of this style of development has diminished. Low density
                                                          housing is unable to efficiently accommodate the rise in population and
                                                          accompanying traffic congestion. Low densities also make it more difficult to sustain
                                                          a viable bus system, leading to service cutbacks and further reliance on the
                                                          automobile. Fuel prices have risen dramatically and the cost of owning and insuring
                                                          a motor vehicle has continued to rise. Additionally, pollution and climate change
                                                          have become growing concerns.
                                                          To adjust to these changes, the City of Newark is implementing goals, policies, and
                                                          actions reflective of the community’s vision for a sustainable future.

                                                          An “urban forest” is the collection of trees along streets, in private yards, and in
                                                          public spaces that together provide a living canopy for the city. Providing and
                                                          maintaining a healthy urban forest results in a variety of benefits to both the
                                                          community and the environment. Urban trees cleanse the air, reduce heating costs,
                                                          block gusting winds, reduce storm water runoff, buffer noise, and create pleasant,
                                                          safer, and more walkable neighborhoods. Many of these benefits have positive
                                                          secondary effects. For example, shade trees may also allow nearby buildings to
                                                          consume less energy for cooling. Trees can also enhance property values and
                                                          contribute to civic pride and identity.
                                                          The City of Newark understands the importance of the urban forest and has put in
                                                          place a Street Tree Maintenance Program. This program ensures that the City’s trees
                                                          are properly cared for by scheduling regular pruning for existing trees, establishing
                                                          guidelines for appropriate tree species for new or replacement trees, and providing

procedures for the removal of dead, dying, or undesirable trees. The City also has
adopted regulations for the removal of mature trees. In recognition of the city’s
existing tree canopy and commitment to tree planting and maintenance, Newark has
been named a “Tree City USA” for 26 consecutive years. To ensure that the City’s
urban forest thrives well into the future, the General Plan includes policies
supporting the preservation and management of existing trees, as well as the
planting of new trees.
C L IMATE AND G REENHOUSE G ASES
The City of Newark recognizes that climate change poses a potential threat to the
community and the environment. Climate change is directly related to GHGs. While
GHGs occur naturally in the atmosphere and produce beneficial effects, they can
also be adversely impacted by human activities. For example, burning fossil fuels
results in the release of carbon dioxide into the earth’s atmosphere. Without this
activity, carbon dioxide would be naturally stored underground in sediments, such as
petroleum, coal, and natural gas. Similarly, the removal of forests reduces the earth’s
capacity to absorb carbon dioxide, leading to greater concentrations in the
atmosphere.
As these types of activities have increased over the two centuries since the industrial
revolution, the amounts of GHGs have also increased, consequently enhancing the
natural greenhouse effect and contributing to global warming. In addition, some
GHGs, such as hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride, are
completely human-made, accelerating the extent to which heat may be trapped in
the atmosphere. A warming planet can lead to large-scale changes to a variety of
systems, resulting in such effects as sea level rise and increases in extreme weather
events.
The State of California has responded to the threat of global climate change by
adopting Executive Order S-3-05 in 2005 and Assembly Bill (AB) 32 in 2006. These
directives set a cap on statewide GHG emissions and established a regulatory
framework to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and to 80 percent of 1990
levels by 2050. In 2008, the State passed SB 375, establishing a range of land use
and transportation programs in pursuit of these targets. One of the outcomes of the
State initiatives is that local governments across California have been strongly
encouraged to adopt Climate Action Plans (CAPs) demonstrating the steps they will
take to help the State meet its targets.

                                                                 Reduce communitywide GHG emissions by 15 percent between 2005 and
                                                                  2020.
                                                          Data collected by the city through the GHG monitoring process shows the City has
                                                          already achieved the first two of these goals.
                                                          The CAP was intended as a springboard for the GHG reduction actions to be taken
                                                          over the next few years. One of its recommendations was to incorporate carbon
                                                          reduction into the General Plan to ensure that it is expressed as a continuing city
                                                          priority, with a commitment to long-term action. The CAP also seeks to maintain and
                                                          report GHG inventories on a regular basis, and promote the involvement of
                                                          Newark’s businesses in inventory efforts.
                                                          This General Plan supports these goals and priorities. It contains policies to reduce

                                                          development, increasing transportation options, and planning for rising sea levels.

                                                          Transit-oriented development (TOD) is based on the idea that jobs, homes, and
                                                          services should be located near public transit. In this way, people can live within a
                                                          short walk, bicycle- or transit-ride of many of their daily needs, reducing reliance on
                                                          auto-oriented travel. TOD is based on three key principles. The first is that densities
                                                          should be higher than conventional suburban development, in order to leverage the
                                                          public investment that has been in transit and maximize the number of potential
                                                          transit riders. The second is that land uses should be mixed, with residential, retail,
                                                          and office uses located within walking distance of each other. The third is that the
                                                          design of the circulation system should balance the needs of cars with the needs of
                                                          pedestrians and bicyclists, with an emphasis on easy access to the transit station.
                                                          At minimum, TOD shortens the distance a resident must travel in a vehicle to
                                                          complete errands. Ideally, TOD can also enable a resident to live, work, and shop in
                                                          the same area, reducing the need for auto ownership entirely, or enabling a two-car

cars can become more viable in such a setting. Fewer and shorter vehicle trips
translates into fewer GHG emissions and less fossil fuel use. Additionally, locating
services, jobs, and residences near one another incentivizes “buying local” and can
support the local economy.
Newark has designated a TOD area around the proposed site of the Dumbarton Rail
Station on the west side of the city. A Specific Plan has been adopted to ensure that
this area is developed in a way that enables future residents and workers to travel by
transit. Other public transit options in Newark include local and regional AC Transit
bus service, para-transit service for seniors and the handicapped, and BART shuttles.
I NCREASING T RANSPORTATION O PTIONS
While encouraging development near transit stations is one way to reduce GHG
emissions, there are other options. Some focus on reducing the number of “vehicle
miles traveled” by individual cars by promoting carpooling, ridesharing, commuter
shuttles, and telecommuting. Three people driving to work individually contribute
GHG emissions from three separate vehicles, whereas those same three people only
contribute GHG emissions from one vehicle if carpooling. Newark has had a trip
reduction ordinance for more than two decades, which encourages carpools and
vanpools.
Another option is the use of alternative fuel vehicles. These are vehicles that have
lower—or zero—GHG emissions because they use fuel sources such as biodiesel,
ethanol, electricity, natural gas, and hydrogen. Use of these vehicles is on the rise,
especially as the necessary infrastructure (e.g. specialized fueling stations) is
becoming increasingly available, making this a more feasible option. In 2013,
plugshare.com reported that Newark had one electric vehicle plug-in location (at the
Aloft Hotel near Thornton Avenue and Highway 84).
Another option for reducing auto-related GHG emissions is to make walking and
bicycling a more viable means of travel. The Federal Highway Administration (FHA)
reports that 1.0 percent of all trips in the US were made by bicycle in 2010,
compared to 0.7 percent of all trips in 1995. The percent of total trips made on foot
grew from 7.2 percent in 1995 to 10.9 percent in 2010. Echoing this national trend,
the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) reports that the total number of
bicycle and pedestrian trips in Alameda County increased 51 percent between 2002
and 2011.

                                                          development. Using data from the 2000 Census and regional travel forecasts, the
                                                          City has estimated that there were approximately 1,032 to 1,720 bicycle trips per day
                                                          in Newark in 2010. 3 This number is likely to increase in the future because of
                                                          General Plan policies that facilitate bicycle and pedestrian friendly design and

39 percent of energy resources, 38 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, and 11
percent of water resources was associated with buildings. Designing buildings to
reduce these percentages is an important part of reducing fossil fuel use, conserving
water, and curbing GHG emissions. Structures which are designed to conserve
natural resources and minimize impacts on the environment are sometimes referred
to as “green” buildings.
Green buildings use a variety of eco-friendly features such as solar panels, rain water
collection, grey water systems, recycled materials, and passive heating and cooling.
There are accrediting bodies and programs that certify a building as “green,” for
example, the national US Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED) program, the California Building Standards
Commission’s CALGreen program, and Alameda County’s StopWaste.Org Bay-
Friendly Landscaping and Green Building programs. As of 2011, the FullBloom
Bakery building and Ohlone College’s Newark Center for Health Sciences and
Technology have both attained LEED certification.
In 2007, the City of Newark adopted the Green Building and Construction and
Demolition Recycling Ordinance (Green Building Ordinance). The Ordinance
requires all City projects and some private projects to recycle construction and
demolition debris and complete a waste management plan. Additionally, the Green
Building Ordinance requires larger City projects to meet the LEED Silver level of
certification. 5 The City of Newark’s 2010 Climate Action Plan discusses green
building standards and contains measures for ensuring robust implementation of the
City’s Green Building Ordinance.
Low impact development (LID) is similar to green building but focuses on the areas
around the building rather than the building itself. Typically, LID consists of strategies
to retain stormwater on a development site, rather than letting it run off to storm
drains and waterways. Such strategies include pervious pavers, bioswales, rain
gardens, and other features that capture rainwater for reuse. As noted earlier in this
chapter, Newark has developed a Bay Friendly Landscape Guide with policies to
ensure that landscaping does not negatively impact the Bay.
          5
            LEED uses a point system for certification. The minimum number of points results in a
“Certified” rating, “Silver” is the second level, “Gold” the third, and “Platinum” the highest level rating.

According to the City of Newark’s CAP, the City continues to meet and may even
surpass its own energy reduction goals. To further strengthen this trend, the General
Plan contains policies seeking to reduce energy use, expand the use of renewable
energy, implement energy efficient design, increase the adoption of conservation
practices citywide, and facilitate access to solar energy.

Trash or garbage, otherwise known as solid waste, has a number of adverse effects
on the environment. Materials deposited in landfills emit GHGs such as methane as
they decompose. Additionally, landfills include numerous materials that take years to
decompose or contain potentially hazardous substances. Without recycling, landfill
capacity may be used more quickly, requiring additional land for waste disposal, and
additional costs to carry garbage to and from landfills. For the past 25 years,
California has worked aggressively to reduce the need to expand its landfills by
promoting recycling, waste reduction, and composting programs. Reducing solid
waste provides many environmental benefits; reducing GHG emissions is just one.
Solid waste services in Newark are handled by Allied Waste, a division of Republic
Services. Historically, the County has met State and local waste reduction and
diversion goals. Countywide waste was reduced by at least 50 percent between 1989
and 2000, in accordance with the target set by AB 939. The City of Newark has done
its part by participating in a residential recycling program. Commercial recycling in
Newark, while optional, is promoted by StopWaste.Org, a joint project of the
Alameda County Waste Management Authority and the Alameda County Source
Reduction and Recycling Board.
As of 2011, Newark’s annual waste disposal rate was 4.0 pounds per day per
resident, well below the target of 7.3. 7 According to StopWaste.Org’s 2013 report on
diversion rates by jurisdiction, the percentage of Newark’s waste diverted from
landfills increased from 27 percent of the waste stream in 1995 to 69 percent of the
waste stream in 2012. This was close to the countywide average of 70 percent.
Solid waste reduction will continue to be a priority in Newark. General Plan policies
promote continued recycling and reuse, including green waste collection and

Policy CS-2.1     Wildlife and Habitat Protection. Preserve and protect Newark’s plant
                  and animal species and habitats, including wetlands, salt marshes,
                  creeks, and lakes. Ensure that land use decisions avoid and mitigate
                  potential impacts on wildlife habitat to the extent feasible.
Policy CS-2.2     Special Status Species. Ensure that adverse impacts on special status
                  species, including those deemed rare, threatened, endangered, or
                  candidate species for protection, are avoided and mitigated to the
                  greatest extent feasible as development takes place.
Policy CS-2. 3    National Wildlife Refuge. Encourage the preservation and
                  maintenance of the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife
                  Refuge by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, including the management
                  of salt ponds to enhance their value for wildlife habitat.
Policy CS-2. 4    Wetlands Delineation. Encourage the owners of large potentially
                  developable properties to enter into early discussions with appropriate
                  federal agencies to conduct wetlands delineation studies. Such studies
                  should be used to identify areas to be conserved as permanent open
                  space, as well as appropriate mitigation measures to offset any
                  wetland impacts.
Policy CS-2. 5    Development Near Wetlands. Manage land use and development
                  on upland sites in a manner that minimizes off-site impacts to nearby
                  wetlands.

(3) Require the use of Best Management Practices (BMPs) to
    protect waters of the U.S./State and to ensure that water quality
    standards are not compromised. These practices can include
    installing construction fencing buffers, straw waddles to keep fill
    from entering preserved/avoided wetlands and other waters,
    and other protective measures; and requiring a biological
    monitor be on-site during project construction to monitor the
    integrity of any preserved wetlands and other waters during
    mass grading or filling of the project site.
(4) For those wetland areas that are not avoided, require wetlands
    mitigation approved by the USACE and the RWQCB either:
    (a) through the purchase of mitigation credits from an
    approved mitigation bank or an approved in-lieu fee mitigation
    entity at a minimum 1:1 ratio or at a ratio determined by the
    RWQCB and USACE at the time permits are issued; or
    (b) through the creation of wetlands of an equal or higher
    functional value than those wetlands affected by the project on-
    site. If wetlands are restored/ created, adequate compensation
    shall include creating wetlands at a suitable location that meet
    the following performance standards:
    1. The wetlands shall remain inundated or saturated for
         sufficient duration to support a predominance of
         hydrophytic vegetation.
    2. The wetlands shall exhibit plant             species   richness
         comparable to existing wetlands.
    3. The wetlands shall replace the lost wetlands at a minimum
         ratio of one acre created for each acre, or fraction thereof,
         permanently impacted.
    4. The developer shall provide for the protection of the
         mitigation areas in perpetuity, either through deed
         restrictions or conservation easements.
    5. The developer shall establish a five-year program to
         monitor the progress of the wetland mitigation toward
         these standards. At the end of each monitoring year, an
         annual report shall be submitted to the City, the RWQCB,
         and the USACE. This report shall document the hydrological
         and vegetative condition of the mitigation wetlands, and
         shall recommend remedial measures as necessary to
         correct deficiencies.

Policy CS- 5.2 Pedestrian and Bicycle Friendly Design. Ensure that new
               development is planned and designed to facilitate walking and
               bicycling as well as driving. This can potentially reduce the number of
               vehicle trips and related greenhouse gas emissions.
Policy CS- 5.3 Alternative Fuel Vehicles. Encourage the use of alternative fuel and
               electric vehicles and development of the necessary infrastructure for
               such vehicles to be viable in Newark.
Policy CS- 5.4 Reducing Non-Residential Transportation Emissions. Encourage
               the participation of the business sector in efforts to reduce greenhouse
               gases. This could include commuter benefit and transit pass programs
               that encourage employees to use transit rather than driving to work.
               This also includes efforts by local employers to encourage ridesharing,
               carpooling, BART shuttles, telecommuting, and other programs that
               provide alternatives to driving alone.
Policy CS- 5.5 Consideration of Climate in Transportation Planning. Consider
               potential greenhouse gas emissions impacts when making changes to
               the transportation system. Give preference to solutions that reduce
               auto dependency and minimize emissions.
Policy CS- 5.6 Local Purchasing. Encourage residents to "buy locally." This includes
               shopping in Newark rather than driving long distances to other cities
               for major purchases, and buying food and other products made in
               Newark to reduce the emissions associated with transportation from
               source to market.
Policy CS- 5.7 Public Awareness. Enhance and expand outreach, marketing, and
               education programs to raise awareness of Newark’s greenhouse gas
               reduction programs.
Policy CS- 5.8 Planning for Sea Level Rise. Require proposed development in low-
               lying areas to comply with applicable City of Newark standards for
               construction in flood hazard zones.
                See the Transportation Element for additional policies on
                encouraging transit, ridesharing, and clean transportation.

                  design of new municipal buildings and the renovation of existing
                  buildings. Long-term planning for a new Newark City Hall should take
                  into consideration such factors as energy and water conservation,
                  design for reclaimed water use, incorporation of recycled materials,
                  and other green building components.
Policy CS- 6.2    Encouraging Greener Construction. Encourage greener construction
                  methods and greater use of recycled-content materials in new
                  residential, commercial, and industrial construction projects.
Policy CS- 6.3    Green Retrofits. Encourage and support Newark property owners
                  seeking to retrofit their buildings to make them greener, more water-
                  efficient, and more energy-efficient.
Policy CS- 6.4    Green Roofs. Encourage the use of green roofs and cool roofs as a
                  way of reducing heating and cooling costs, and reducing stormwater
                  runoff.
Policy CS- 6.5    Minimizing Impervious Surface Coverage. Minimize impervious
                  surface coverage and related stormwater runoff in new development
                  areas by allowing narrower roads and shared driveways, and by
                  encouraging the use of pervious materials on driveways and parking
                  areas. Other means of reducing urban runoff, such as rain barrels and
                  bioswales, also should be encouraged.
Policy CS- 6.6    Cool Pavements. Encourage the use of cool (light colored)

PARKS, RECREATION,

INTRODUCTION
This chapter combines the State-mandated open space element with an optional
element focused on parks and recreation. Parks are one component of an open
space network that also includes wetlands and wildlife refuge areas, rights-of-way
such as the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct and PG&E transmission lines, school athletic
fields, salt evaporation ponds, and public and private lands. Open space defines the
edges of Newark on the south and west sides and is an important part of the city’s
history and character. This Element provides a framework to manage open space for
recreation, conservation, resource production, and public safety in the future.
The Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Element emphasizes the important role that
parks play in community life. Newark’s parks contribute to health and fitness, mental
well-being, aesthetics, and environmental quality. They are one of the most valued
aspects of the community and enrich the lives of residents of all ages. Planning for
the expansion and improvement of the city’s parks will be essential as Newark adds
residents and workers. It will also be important to adapt existing recreational facilities
and programs to respond to the city’s changing demographics and to trends in
leisure and sports activities. Funding for park improvements, operations, and
maintenance will continue to be critical issues.
Newark’s parks are supplemented by other recreational facilities, including those
operated by the Newark Unified School District, Ohlone College, and the private
sector. Private recreational facilities include community rooms, swimming pools,
tennis courts, tot lots, and similar amenities serving individual residential
developments. Newark is also home to commercial businesses offering recreational
activities such as martial arts training and dance instruction, and fraternal
organization facilities such as the Newark Pavilion. The City’s parks are further
supplemented by regional facilities beyond the city limits, including Ardenwood
Historic Farm and Coyote Hills Regional Park.

The geographic extent of land meeting the criteria above is shown on Figure LU-1 in
the Land Use Element. These areas correspond to the following land use categories:
Parks and Recreational Facilities, Conservation Open Space, and Salt Harvesting.
In 2013, 50 percent of Newark’s land area, or about 4,500 acres, consisted of
undeveloped or non-urbanized land. Over two-thirds of this area consists of salt
harvesting, refining, and production along the edge of San Francisco Bay in the south
and west parts of the city. This land is expected to remain in salt harvesting, refining,
and production for the duration of the planning period. The remaining one-third
includes Conservation Open Space (wetlands), City parks, agricultural areas, and
privately owned vacant land zoned for development. Although private vacant land is
not considered “open space” using the State definition, portions of these areas will
be set aside as future parks, conservation areas, and landscaped rights-of-way as
development takes place. The boundaries of future open spaces within development
areas will depend on detailed mapping of wetlands, site planning for new
development, and negotiations between the private sector and public resource
agencies.
In addition to the open spaces described above, most residential properties in
Newark include front yards, back yards, and side yards. These spaces are urbanized,
but they still create a sense of spaciousness, provide access to sunlight, and support
habitat for birds and other wildlife. Landscaped roadway medians, rights-of-way, and
lawns around public buildings also supplement the traditional open space network.
General Plan policies under Goal 1 of this Element express Newark’s commitment to
conserving open space in the future. The policies recognize the different types of
open space in the city, and the role these spaces play in protecting resources,
supporting Newark’s economy, and shaping the city’s character.
NEWARK’S PARK SYSTEM
For the past five decades, Newark’s parks have been planned and designed
according to accepted national standards for park development. In many cases, these
standards are still appropriate and have been carried forward in this Plan. However,
recreational needs are not constant, and the City’s ability to meet these needs has
                                                                                                                                          PR-3

                                                      changed over time. Newark is landlocked and has limited opportunities to develop
                                                      new parks. Funding for land acquisition has become more limited, and operating
                                                      budgets have become leaner. The emphasis in park planning is shifting to make
                                                      better use of existing parks and providing new facilities that do not exist today.
                                                      Partnerships with the private sector and other public agencies have become more
                                                      important to meeting community needs.
                                                      A DOPTED P ARK S TANDARDS
                                                      The City of Newark uses two types of standards in park planning:
                                                             Per capita standards, which establish the number of acres of parkland the city
                                                              should have per 1,000 residents. These are generally applied on a citywide
                                                              basis.
                                                             Service area standards, which are used to ensure that all residents have easy,
                                                              convenient access to a local park. These are generally applied on a
                                                              neighborhood basis.
                                                      PER CAPITA STANDARDS
                                                      The per capita acreage standards are based in part on existing conditions, in part on
                                                      national standards, and in part on State legislation which limits the amount of
                                                       parkland the city can require developers to provide when new housing is approved.
                                                       The Quimby Act was adopted by the California legislature in 1975 to allow cities to
                                                       require developers to set aside land or pay impact fees of equivalent value for park
                                                       improvements. Under state law, the dedication requirement ranges from up to 3.0
                                                      acres per 1,000 residents to up to 5.0 acres per 1,000 residents, depending on the
                                                      amount of parkland the city currently has. The intent of the Quimby Act is to help a
                                                      city retain its current ratio of park acres per 1,000 residents in the future; meaning
                                                      that cities with larger existing park areas can require higher set-asides. Revenue
                                                      generated through Quimby Act fees can only be used for land acquisition or capital
                                                      improvements, and cannot be used for park operations or maintenance.
                                                      Newark has adopted a 3.0 acre per 1,000 resident standard for planning purposes
                                                      and its Quimby Act fee is based on this ratio. Previous General Plans for the City
                                                       stipulated that two-thirds of the total should be targeted for community parkland and
                                                       one-third should be targeted for neighborhood parkland. The intent was to ensure
                                                       that the City added both large and small parks in the future, recognizing the different
                                                      function of each type of park. This division may no longer be appropriate in the

future, since the city is moving into a new era of park planning reflecting its mature,
built out character and the adopted plans for its remaining large vacant tracts of land.
Chapter 16.30 of the Newark Municipal Code requires that new subdivisions include
sufficient land to maintain the adopted per capita service standard, or pay a fee
which will enable the city to acquire land to maintain the standard. Smaller
developments typically pay the fee, since it is infeasible to provide a neighborhood
park of sufficient size on-site. As of 2013, the dedication requirement or fee was
based on .0102 acres (444 square feet) per single-family unit and .0072 acres (314
square feet) per multi-family unit. In 2013, these fees were $2,998 per single-family
unit and $2,278 per multi-family unit.
SERVICE AREA S TANDARDS
Like the acreage standards, the service area standards address two types of parks:
neighborhood parks and community parks. The standards are defined below:
       Neighborhood parks are typically 5 to 10 acres in size and are designed to
        serve residents living within a ½-mile radius. Most Newark residents should
        be able to walk to a neighborhood park within 10 minutes of their homes.
        Ideally, neighborhood parks should be away from arterial streets and should
        be adjacent to elementary schools to enhance the joint use of the space for
        field sports and school activities. Significant features of a neighborhood park
        include fields, lawns, walkways, picnic areas, and tot lots. Other small-scale
        recreational facilities such as basketball courts may be acceptable. However, to
        minimize auto traffic and parking demand, neighborhood parks should
        generally not have facilities that draw residents from outside the service area.
       Community parks are typically 20 acres or larger and are designed to serve
        residents living within a 1- to 2-mile radius. They may also have facilities which
        draw residents from throughout the city. Community parks are typically
        located near major streets and are accessible by public transportation. Off-
        street parking should be provided. These parks include a larger array of
        facilities than neighborhood parks, potentially including tennis courts,
        swimming pools, lighted fields, restrooms, recreation centers, and open space
        for unstructured play.
                                                                                                                                           PR-5

                                                      In addition to the two park types listed above, this General Plan introduces two
                                                      additional park categories which will become part of the city’s park inventory in the
                                                       future:
                                                              Mini-parks are typically less than one acre in size. They include small parks
                                                               within residential development areas, and civic plazas and open spaces within
                                                               urbanized areas. Although Newark does not have public mini-parks at this
                                                               time, the General Plan recognizes the opportunity for such parks in Old Town,
                                                               in the NewPark Mall area, and in new large-scale development. The service
                                                               area of a mini-park is typically ½-mile or less. Mini-parks do not include
                                                               private open spaces within subdivisions or multi-family complexes which are
                                                               reserved for the use of residents only.
                                                              Special use parks are parks associated with a unique function or facility. They

                                                      School recreational facilities are not typically included in the 3.0 acre per 1,000
                                                      standard, although there are exceptions for facilities such as MacGregor Fields, which
                                                      is subject to a long-term lease between the City and the Newark Unified School
                                                      District. Similarly, public land used for resource conversation such as the Don

                                                      recreational standard. In the event a golf course is developed in Southwest Newark,
                                                      the 3.0 acre per 1,000 resident standard may need to be recalibrated, as the golf
                                                      course alone could double the acreage of parkland in the city.

                                                      play fields, serving the entire community. Newark Community Park includes 16 acres
                                                      of playfields and outdoor activity space, including picnic areas and tot lots. The park
                                                      also includes a community center available for private rental. Adjacent to Ash Street
                                                      Park, the Newark Senior Center offers programs and activities for Newark seniors. At
                                                      Lakeshore Park, a 16-acre lagoon provides opportunities for fishing and boating.
                                                      Other parks in the city contain a mix of passive and active facilities, meeting the
                                                      recreational needs of persons of all ages.
                                                      While the City meets its overall acreage standard for parks, some neighborhoods are
                                                      better served than others. In particular, the high-density residential area southeast of
                                                      NewPark Mall is more than a ½-mile from the nearest city park. Other residential
                                                      areas may be within a ½-mile of parks that do not provide a complete range of
                                                      services and facilities. Other areas may be within the ½-mile radius, but face access
                                                      barriers such as railroad tracks and wide arterial streets. Policies in the General Plan
                                                      express the City’s continued commitment to expanding and improving access to its
                                                      parks to better serve all residents.
                                                      Several new parks are planned as part of future large-scale developments. The
                                                      Southwest Newark Residential and Recreational Development includes plans for a
                                                      golf course or major public recreational facility. A golf course would likely be 120
                                                      acres or larger and could potentially double the City’s total park acreage. The Specific
                                                      Plan for Southwest Newark (formerly Areas 3 and 4) also includes an approximately
                                                      5-acre neighborhood park, to be co-located with an elementary school on the south
                                                      side of Cherry Street east of Ohlone College. The park will not only serve new
                                                      residents, it will remedy a park access deficiency in the residential area on the north
                                                      side of Cherry Street in this area.
                                                      Two neighborhood parks are planned for the Dumbarton Transit-Oriented
                                                      Development (TOD) area, including one to the east and one to the west of the
                                                      future transit station. The development will also feature a linear park network,
                                                      including new sections of the Bay Trail. A total of 16.3 acres of new parks are
                                                      proposed in this area.

OTHER RECREATIONAL FACILITIES
S CHOOL P ROPERTIES
As noted above, the Newark City park system is augmented by an approximately
equivalent amount of recreational open space on school property. Among the most
important facilities are the 35 acres of athletic fields at Newark Memorial High School
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             PR-11

                                                      and the 26 acres at the Junior High School. Each of these areas includes a stadium
                                                       for organized school sports, such as football and track and field events. In addition,
                                                       Graham, Lincoln, Musick, and Snow Elementary Schools are adjacent to City parks.
                                                       This effectively increases the size of these parks, and allows for joint use
                                                       opportunities for both the City and the School District. As noted earlier, MacGregor
                                                       Field—adjacent to MacGregor Alternative Education Center—is owned by the School
                                                       District but leased by the City.
                                                       The general public does not have access to school athletic fields and playgrounds
                                                       when school is in session. However, the School Board has adopted policies
                                                       regarding access to school facilities and fields during non-school hours. Supervised
                                                       recreational activities may be scheduled on school properties by making prior
                                                       arrangements and receiving written authorization. Fees may apply to such activities
                                                       to recover direct costs. Similar arrangements may be made to use recreational
                                                       facilities within the schools themselves.
                                                      R EGIONAL P ARKS
                                                      Newark is served by the East Bay Regional Park District, a regional park agency
                                                      serving over 2.5 million residents in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties. Newark
                                                      residents have access to a network of 65 parks comprising 113,000 acres in the two
                                                      county area, with settings ranging from shoreline wetlands to mountain wilderness.
                                                      There are no regional parks within the City of Newark. The closest locations are
                                                      Ardenwood Historic Farm, which is adjacent to the city limits on the north side of SR
                                                      84, and Coyote Hills Regional Park, which is less than 1 mile northwest of the city
                                                      limits. Ardenwood Farm is a 205-acre working farm that has been in operation since
                                                      the 1850s. It provides educational programs, horse-drawn train rides, a blacksmith
                                                      shop, livestock areas, and public gardens. Coyote Hills is a 978-acre preserve
                                                      comprised of marshland and grassy hills. Its facilities include bicycling and hiking
                                                      trails, picnic areas, and bird watching areas. Newark is also about 2 miles away from
                                                      Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area, a 539-acre park with swimming, fishing,
                                                      biking, and picnicking areas.

The Refuge is the first urban National Wildlife Refuge in the United States. Its mission
is to preserve wildlife habitat from development, protect migratory birds and
endangered and threatened species, and provide opportunities for outdoor
recreation. Areas within the Refuge include salt ponds, salt marshes, mudflats, vernal
pools, open water, and grassland. The Refuge hosts over 280 species of birds each
year, including migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway. Its sloughs and marshes are
home to a number of threatened and endangered plants and animals.
P RIVATE F ACILITIES
The City’s park dedication ordinance allows developers to reduce the amount of
their park improvement fees by up to 50 percent when they agree to provide on-site
recreation amenities. Most condominium and townhome developments in Newark
provide such amenities, including swimming pools and tennis courts. In some
locations, the localized shortage of park acreage is offset by access to these facilities.
For example, private recreational facilities at the Murieta, Waterford, NewPark Village,
and Nantucket Cove developments serve the area southeast of NewPark Mall. This is
an area of the city that is more than a ½-mile from the nearest neighborhood park.
The City will continue to allow and encourage private recreational facilities in the
future, while still working to increase public park acreage.
PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE NEEDS
Newark’s population is projected to be 60,510 by 2035. Maintaining the adopted
service standard of 3.0 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents would require that the
City have 181.5 acres of parkland at that time. The City presently has 131 acres and
will not meet the 181.5-acre target unless it acquires more parkland in the next 20
years. As noted above, at least 21 acres will be added through new neighborhood
parks in the Dumbarton TOD and Southwest Newark projects. This leaves a potential
shortfall of 30 acres. The shortfall may be eliminated through development of a golf
course in Southwest Newark. In the event the golf course is not developed, the City
should maintain its service standard by designating sufficiently large park areas in
Southwest Newark and elsewhere in the city to close the gap.
Policies in this General Plan direct the City to consider opportunities for
neighborhood parks and mini-parks beyond the planned facilities at the Dumbarton
TOD and in Southwest Newark. Such opportunities exist in Old Town Newark, on
surplus school property, along the Hetch Hetchy Right of Way, along the vacant right-
of-way reserved for the extension of Cedar Boulevard, and within new infill
                                                                                                                                          PR-13

                                                      development sites. For example, high-density development in the NewPark vicinity
                                                      could include small pocket parks and plazas which would provide space for outdoor
                                                      events, farmers markets, and community gatherings. Such spaces would introduce a
                                                      new type of open space to Newark, augmenting the existing park inventory. There
                                                      may also be opportunities to partner with Ohlone College, which currently has a
                                                      large area of undeveloped land on its Newark campus.
                                                      Increasing park acreage is only one part of responding to future recreational needs.
                                                      Newark must also respond to the need for new recreational facilities. The City has
                                                      identified the need for a golf course, at least one additional lighted multi-purpose
                                                      field, additional lighted tennis courts, a skate park, a BMX park, and a fenced dog
                                                      play area. There is also interest in developing an ornamental garden similar to the
                                                      San Jose Rose Garden, and in developing additional community gardens around the
                                                      city. Gardens provide important opportunities for community building while also
                                                       providing aesthetic and scientific interest. As more people use Newark’s parks, the
                                                       City will need to determine the need for ancillary improvements, especially
                                                       restrooms and parking.
                                                       The siting of specific park improvements will require future study. Some parks, such
                                                       as Birch Grove and Sportsfield Park, may have opportunities for additional features,
                                                      while others are fully improved and already have an optimal balance between
                                                      passive and active uses. An action program in this General Plan recommends
                                                      preparation of a Parks Master Plan. Such a Plan would identify recreational needs at
                                                      a citywide and neighborhood level, and develop siting and facility recommendations
                                                      for individual parks.

                                                      Newark’s Recreation and Community Services Department provides recreational,
                                                      educational, and social programs that enrich the well-being of individuals and the
                                                      community as a whole. The Department offers fitness classes for persons of all ages,
                                                      youth and adult sports league activities, and community events such as a summer
                                                      concert series, Family Day at the Park, and the Senior Health and Resource Fair. It
                                                      also operates the Newark Senior Center, which offers programs ranging from daily
                                                      lunches to field trips, recreation, transportation, and health screening.
                                                      The Recreation and Community Service s Department monitors participation in its

demand. The Department has responded to demographic shifts, including the aging
of the population and increased cultural diversity. Programs such as Bollywood
Dance, Muy Thai, and Tai Chi are now being offered alongside traditional programs
such as softball and volleyball. The growing demand for cricket, lacrosse, and other
field sports activities has created the need for multi-purpose fields rather than fields
designed for a single activity such as softball.
Park maintenance is handled by the Newark Public Works Department. Park features
must be regularly maintained and repaired to address wear and tear and ensure the
continued safety of all users. This includes replacement of irrigation systems, graffiti
removal, lawn and field care, landscaping, turf replacement, and modernization of
older buildings and restrooms. Funding for such improvements is limited and is
allocated through the capital improvements program and ongoing expenditures in
the annual budget. These costs cannot be covered by facility rentals, concessions,
and program fees alone. Voter-approved bond measures, special assessments, and
other sources may be explored in the future to ensure sufficient investment in the
City’s parks.
BAY TRAIL
In 1987, the California Senate passed legislation authorizing the Association of Bay
Area Governments (ABAG) to develop a plan for a trail that circumnavigated San
Francisco Bay. ABAG adopted the Bay Trail Plan in 1999. The vision is to establish a
500-mile network of biking and hiking trails that circle San Francisco and San Pablo
Bays and connect the bay to nearby neighborhoods and business districts. As of
2012, about 310 miles of the Trail had been completed. The Trail provides accessible
hiking, bicycling, walking, bird watching, and educational opportunities.
In the Newark area, there are several off-road and on-road trails that are considered
part of the Bay Trail network. The Newark Slough Trail is a 6.5-mile off-road shared
use paved loop. Most of the trail is in Fremont but a short segment traverses the
Newark section of the National Wildlife Refuge. The trail is accessed via the Wildlife
Refuge Visitors Center just west of the city limits. Another paved all-purpose off-road
trail extends from Marshlands Road west of Thornton to a pedestrian overpass across
SR 84 to Coyote Hills; this trail is in Fremont, but provides the most direct access to
the shoreline from Newark. There is also a network of interpretive nature trails
around the Wildlife Center Headquarters on Marshlands Road in Fremont, west of
the Newark city limits.

                                                      An on-street portion of the Bay Trail extends along a loop formed by Thornton
                                                      Avenue, Paseo Padre Parkway, Ardenwood Boulevard, and Jarvis Avenue. The official
                                                       alignment of the trail through Newark includes on-street sections along Thornton
                                                       Avenue (between SR 84 and Cherry Street) and a parallel on-street route along
                                                       Willow Street and Central Avenue. The trail follows Cherry Street from Thornton to
                                                       the Fremont City limits, where it continues on Boyce Road.
                                                       Improvements to the Bay Trail are proposed in the future. The City is currently
                                                       considering the recommendations of a Bay Trail Study that would move the trail off-
                                                       road and closer to the shoreline in a number of locations. Specifically, development
                                                       of a new trail is proposed as part of the Dumbarton TOD development. This trail
                                                       would connect directly to the Newark Slough Trail and form a loop on the edges of
                                                       the TOD area, with a spur to the transit station itself. A trail is also proposed to loop
                                                       through the Southwest Newark Residential and Recreational Project. This segment
                                                       would be linked to Cherry Street on its western end and to future trail extensions
                                                       near the former Durham Road Landfill in Fremont on the eastern end. The possibility
                                                       of a trail along the north side of Plummer Creek between the Dumbarton TOD and
                                                       Filbert Street (to the rear of industrial properties along Central Avenue) has also
                                                       been explored.
                                                      Policies and actions in this Element provide guidance on improvements to the Bay
                                                      Trail. The policies aim to protect wildlife, avoid conflicts with industrial operations,
                                                      and ensure that trail design is sensitive to issues such as rising sea level. The City will
                                                       continue to work with property owners, ABAG, the City of Fremont, and other
                                                       agencies to provide improvements which enhance shoreline access while achieving
                                                       these objectives.

INTRODUCTION
The Environmental Hazards Element combines two of the seven mandatory
elements of the General Plan—Safety and Noise. It addresses potential risks to life
and property resulting from naturally occurring hazards such as earthquakes and
floods and man-made hazards such as noise and soil contamination. The Element
also addresses emergency preparedness and response. As in other elements of the
General Plan, background information on these topics is presented in the first part of
the chapter and goals, policies, and actions are presented at the end.
An important function of this Element is to identify locations in Newark that may be
inappropriate for certain land uses due to potential risks and hazards. The Element
also identifies areas where hazards are present, but can be mitigated through special
design and site planning measures. For example, Newark is located in a seismically
active area. While this does not preclude construction, it does require that buildings
are designed to withstand ground shaking and other hazards associated with
earthquakes. The hazards discussed in this Element have helped shape Newark’s
Land Use Map, and have influenced its land use, housing, open space, and
transportation policies.
The specific topics covered by this chapter are listed below:
      Geologic Hazards
      Flood Hazards
      Fire Hazards
      Hazardous Materials
      Emergency Preparedness
      Noise and Vibration
A number of topics related to environmental hazards are covered in other parts of
the General Plan. Water quality is addressed in the Conservation and Sustainability
Element, and air quality is addressed in the Health and Wellness Element. Police and

                                         together, the policies in the General Plan minimize risks, protect the quality of life,
                                         and provide a foundation for response and recovery when disaster strikes.
                                         GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
                                         L OCAL G EOLOGY
                                         Newark’s geological conditions have been mapped by the US Geological Survey.
                                         Most of the developed portion of the city is built on alluvial fan deposits, consisting
                                         of sandy clay. Areas closer to the bay consist of flood plain deposits with sandy or
                                         silty clay. The marshland areas are underlain by estuarine deposits such as Bay Mud,
                                         with a thickness that may exceed 60 feet. There are no bedrock outcrops (exposed
                                         rock) within Newark; the closest outcrops are in the Coyote Hills about a mile to the
                                         northwest.
                                         L OCAL E ARTHQUAKE H AZARDS
                                         While no active earthquake faults pass through Newark, the Bay Area as a whole is
                                         seismically active and the threat of earthquakes is pervasive. The city is located
                                         2 miles west of the Hayward Fault, 9 miles east of the San Andreas Fault, and
                                         13 miles west of the Calaveras Fault. Of these, the Hayward Fault is most significant
                                         threat to the city; it lies closest to Newark and has not experienced a major
                                         earthquake since 1868.
                                         Figure EH-1 illustrates the location of the known major faults in the Bay Area, and
                                         their associated earthquake probabilities. The Working Group on California

                                         (USGS), the California Geological Survey, and the Southern California Earthquake
                                         Center, estimates that the 30-year probability of a magnitude 6.7 or greater
                                         earthquake striking the San Francisco Bay area is 63 percent. 1 The USGS further
                                         estimated that there was a 31 percent probability of a magnitude 6.7 or greater
                                         earthquake on the Hayward Fault by 2036. Even though no known earthquake faults
                                         pass directly through Newark, an earthquake of moderate to high magnitude within
                                         the Bay Area could cause significant damage in the city.

N E W A R K   G E N E R A L  P L A N
E N V I R O N M E N T A L  H A Z A R D S
                                         When an earthquake occurs, energy travels in waves through the earth’s crust and
                                         causes ground shaking. The degree of shaking is dependent on the magnitude of the
                                         event, the duration of the event, the distance to the zone of rupture, and local
                                         geologic and soil conditions. Thus, an earthquake in Newark might be felt as a sharp
                                         relatively rapid vibration, or a swaying rolling motion. It could have no permanent
                                         effect on the ground, or it could trigger slumping near water bodies or a loss of
                                         support capacity near structures. These important differences would be a function of
                                         local soil and groundwater conditions, rather than distance from the fault.
                                         Ground shaking is measured on a scale ranging from I to X (the Modified Mercalli
                                         Scale) with shaking levels ranging from imperceptible to very violent. Most of the
                                         developed portions of Newark would experience “very strong” ground shaking (level
                                         VIII) in a 6.9 Hayward Fault earthquake, but some parts of the city would experience
                                         “violent” ground shaking (level IX). Ground shaking levels are higher on the
                                         southern and western fringes of the city.
                                         In addition to ground shaking, earthquakes also create the risk of fault rupture and
                                         liquefaction. The risk from fault rupture is considered very low in Newark, since there
                                         are no active faults within the city. Liquefaction is a greater risk, given Newark’s soil
                                         characteristics and underlying geology. Liquefaction results from a loss of soil
                                         strength during earthquake vibrations. Soils that are most prone to liquefaction are
                                         loose, saturated, fine-grained sands with shallow groundwater. During an
                                         earthquake, such soils may lose strength and fail, causing damage to buildings,
                                         bridges, and other structures.
                                         Based on the California Geological Survey’s 2003 seismic hazard report for the
                                         Newark quadrangle, the entire city is considered a liquefaction hazard zone. The
                                         level of risk varies from location-to-location, and can best be determined through
                                         site-specific geotechnical studies. Areas nearest to the bay, along sloughs, or on
                                         artificial fill, are generally considered more susceptible than other areas. Based on
                                         soil conditions and underlying geology, these areas may also be prone to more
                                         severe ground shaking in a major earthquake.

Bay shoreline. There are no significant hills or steep slopes. The California Geological
Survey’s Seismic Hazard Mapping Program reports no landslide hazard areas within
the city.
T SUNAMIS AND S EICHES
Tsunamis are sea waves generated by earthquakes. These waves have been known
to cause serious damage at coastal locations around the Pacific Rim, including
California. Tsunamis usually occur shortly after an earthquake and appear as a rapid
rising and falling of sea level over a period of several minutes or hours. Although San
Francisco Bay could be impacted by a Pacific Ocean tsunami, the effects would
dissipate by the time they reached Newark. The temporary rise in sea level triggered
by a tsunami would be comparable to an ordinary high tide.
A seiche is a local water wave generated by an earthquake. This would include
abnormal waves on San Francisco Bay generated by seismic activity, as well as waves
on lakes. The configuration of the shoreline and depth of water offshore is such that
this hazard is not judged to be significant in Newark. Similarly, the small ornamental
lakes and ponds in the city are not considered to constitute a seiche hazard.
S UBSIDENCE
Subsidence refers to the gradual settling or sudden sinking of the ground due to
movements below. It can also occur due to prolonged pumping of groundwater.
Groundwater elevations in Newark are generally 40 to 140 feet below the surface,
beneath a thick silt and clay layer. The Alameda County Water District has been
recharging the aquifer for the past 50 years to improve its stability and to reduce
saltwater intrusion. This also reduces subsidence risks and related damage potential.
R EDUCING R ISK L EVELS
State and local laws have been adopted to reduce exposure to seismic hazards. The
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act was passed in 1972 to prevent the
construction of buildings on top of active faults. Areas on either side of such faults
are referred to as “Earthquake Fault Zones.” Since there are no known active faults
in Newark, there are no designated Fault Zones in the city. In 1990, California
adopted the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act to assess the potential for other types of
earthquake hazards, including liquefaction. One of the purposes of the Act was to
assist local governments with land use planning by mapping high hazard areas.
                                                                                                                           EH-5

N E W A R K   G E N E R A L  P L A N
E N V I R O N M E N T A L  H A Z A R D S
                                         The California Building Code (CBC) also incorporates standards that reduce exposure
                                         to seismic risks. The CBC, which has been adopted as part of the Newark Municipal
                                         Code, provides specific requirements for seismic safety, excavation, foundations,
                                         retaining walls, grading, and demolition. The Code is updated as new data is
                                         collected and new construction techniques are developed to improve structural
                                         performance in an earthquake.
                                         Given the risk of liquefaction and potential for strong ground shaking, the City
                                         requires site-specific soils reports and geotechnical evaluations as part of the
                                         approval process for major developments. The City further requires that
                                         recommendations from such reports be incorporated into project design. Newark
                                         has adopted additional regulations for grading to reduce the potential for erosion
                                         and to ensure the stability of filled areas.
                                         Newark has also taken steps to improve the safety of existing buildings. In 1986, the
                                         State required jurisdictions in earthquake hazard areas to inventory unreinforced
                                         masonry (URM) buildings and establish programs to reduce the risks associated with
                                         these buildings. URM buildings are brick, stone, or concrete structures without steel
                                         reinforcement. Newark surveyed its buildings after this law was passed and
                                         determined there were no URMs present. However, the city does have structures
                                         that fail to meet modern structural code standards and may be susceptible to
                                         earthquake damage. As appropriate, the City may require such buildings to be
                                         upgraded when applications for building permits or use permits are filed.
                                         `Other hazards associated with earthquakes include shifting of homes off their
                                         foundations. This hazard can be minimized through structural connections between
                                         the house frame and foundation. Most homes in Newark are bolted to their
                                         foundations, but some are not. Older homes may also have unreinforced chimneys
                                         that may topple during strong ground shaking. Chimney ties can be used to make
                                         such structures more secure. Similarly, water heaters in older homes can be made
                                         more secure by bracing or tying them down.
                                         Older tilt-up industrial buildings may also be vulnerable to earthquake damage,
                                         particularly on the west side of the city where liquefaction hazards are higher.
                                         Another vulnerable construction type is soft-story apartment buildings. These are 2-

interior shear walls. Such structures can be retrofitted and reinforced to reduce
earthquake-related hazards.
The safety of public buildings during an earthquake is particularly important.
Buildings such as schools, libraries, community centers, and public offices are often
occupied by large numbers of people, including vulnerable populations such as
children and seniors. These same structures must also be used by first responders
following a disaster, and often serve as emergency service centers and shelters
during recovery operations. In 2011, Newark voters approved Measure G, a bond
measure that allocated $63 million for school renovation, including seismic upgrades
to existing Newark Unified School District facilities. The City itself periodically
evaluates the seismic safety of public buildings, including City Hall, to determine the
need for structural improvements to improve earthquake safety. A priority is placed
on locating new facilities in areas where safety, access, and operational capacity can
be ensured during and after an earthquake.
Roads, railroads, bridges, and utilities also may be vulnerable during an earthquake.
Subsidence and liquefaction can cause roads to settle and crack, making them
impassable to traffic. This has secondary complications, if roads become impassable
to emergency vehicles. Electric power lines and other overhead wires supported by
poles are prone to damage and disruption of service if poles topple over. If not
properly designed and maintained, water and sewer pipes also can be damaged by
ground movement, and power outages can interfere with the operation of pumping
stations and treatment facilities. The resulting loss of water pressure and supply can
impede fire-fighting capacity.
The City of Newark works closely with Caltrans, PG&E, and other utilities to support
seismic upgrades to infrastructure. Caltrans is in the process of completing a major
seismic upgrade of the Dumbarton Bridge and regularly inspects overpasses and
other facilities to ensure their safety. Alameda County Water District recently
increased its rates to fund a major seismic upgrade of its water mains and to replace
aging pipelines in the Tri-City area. The Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct is also being
upgraded to improve earthquake reliability. While these projects will not entirely
eliminate the potential for damage or service disruption, they will reduce the
duration and extent of outages, enhance post-disaster fire-fighting capacity, and
improve public safety.

                                         Earthquake-induced dam failure of the Calaveras, Del Valle, or San Antonio Dams
                                         could have serious effects on Newark. Calaveras Dam was built in 1925 and is 210
                                         feet tall. The dam was deemed seismically unsafe in 2001 and the reservoir was
                                         subsequently drained to about one-third of its capacity. A major reconstruction of the
                                         dam is currently underway. Once the dam is completed in 2017, the original capacity
                                         of the reservoir will be restored and its seismic safety will be greatly improved. The
                                         James H. Turner Dam, which impounds San Antonio Reservoir, was built in 1964
                                         and the Del Valle Dam was completed in 1968. Both of these dams are evaluated
                                         annually by the California Division of Safety Dams to ensure that they are safe and
                                         performing as intended.
                                         Dam failure from any of the three reservoirs would cause flooding in Newark, with
                                         floodwaters reaching the city in as little as 90 minutes. Virtually all property in the city
                                         would be impacted. Failure of large water storage tanks in Fremont or Newark could
                                         also lead to localized flooding in Newark, although these hazards are less
                                         widespread.
                                         FLOODING HAZARDS
                                         Flooding may result when heavy rainfall exceeds the capacity of Newark’s storm
                                         drains and flood control channels. Water may overtop channel banks or back up
                                         from storm drain inlets, inundating streets and surrounding properties. The risk of
                                         such flooding is highest adjacent to creeks, sloughs, and waterways. Flooding may
                                         also result from the failure of levees and dams, and is also one of the long-term
                                         effects of rising sea levels due to global climate change.
                                         Flood hazards in Newark are carefully managed to minimize the potential for
                                         damage. Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District
                                         (ACFC&WCD) maintains flood control systems, with channels following historic
                                         sloughs and former agricultural drainage channels. Major drainage courses in the city
                                         include Plummer Creek, Newark Slough, and Mowry Slough. Stormwater flows to
                                         these drainage courses through gutters, drains, channels, and culverts.
                                         The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has prepared Flood Insurance
                                         Rate Maps (FIRM) for Newark and other cities throughout the Bay Area. The maps
                                         indicate areas in the 100-year flood zone and the 500-year flood zone. The 100-year

flood zone areas are considered to have a 1 percent chance of flooding in any given
year. The 500-year flood zones are considered to have a 0.2 percent, or a 1-in-500,
chance of flooding in any given year.
Figure EH-2 indicates areas in Newark within the flood zones. These include narrow
bands along the flood control channels, and an expansive area that includes the tidal
marshes, and other areas on the western and southern edges of the city. Most of
these areas have been designated as open space, but a few are planned for
development. Flood control and stormwater management systems are planned in
future development areas to reduce the extent of flood hazards.
The bayfront areas of Newark are susceptible to flooding caused by levee failure.
FEMA has been working with flood control agencies across the country on a levee
accreditation program. Levee systems must meet minimum freeboard standards and
must be maintained according to an officially adopted maintenance plan to achieve
certification. The ACFC&WCD has jurisdiction over levee maintenance in Newark and
has been evaluating their condition since 2007 as it works toward FEMA
accreditation. The evaluations include subsurface field exploration, soil and stability
testing, and operation and maintenance plans. Until certification is received, areas
identified as flood prone are required to carry insurance through the National Flood
Insurance Program. Any levees associated with salt harvesting and production were
not constructed for flood protection.
Newark is also subject to sea level rise. As a result, bayfront areas could become
more prone to flooding during winter storms, and levees could face greater risks of
being overtopped in the future. According to the International Panel on Climate
Change, ocean levels may rise by 7 to 23 inches by the end of the century.
Preventative measures may be needed to address increasing flood danger in coastal
areas, including communities along San Francisco Bay. The City is working
collaboratively with other city and regional agencies to develop long-term adaptation
strategies to address this hazard.
R EDUCING R ISK L EVELS
The City of Newark requires drainage studies for major development projects to
ensure that such projects will not cause or worsen downstream flooding. The City
also requires that projects in the 100-year flood zone use fill to elevate structures at
least 1 foot above the flood elevation, thereby removing these areas from the flood

plain. The City further requires that building foundations be at least 11.25 feet above
msl unless special provisions are applied. Removal from the flood plain requires a
formal Letter of Map Revision from FEMA, and relieves the owner(s) of the mandate
to have flood insurance.
The City’s Building Code and stormwater management regulations also reduce the
impacts of flood hazards. Chapter 15.40 of the City’s Municipal Code sets standards
to minimize flood hazard risks, including anchoring and flood-proofing and a
requirement that the lowest floor, including basements, is at or above the 100-year
flood elevation. The City’s codes also require the use of materials and utility
equipment that are resistant to flood damage. Electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing, air conditioning, and other building systems must be designed to avoid
exposure to flooding. Water and sewer systems must also be designed to minimize
or eliminate the potential for infiltration of floodwater. The City has adopted
engineering standards and street design guidelines that further reduce the potential
for flooding.
FIRE HAZARDS
Newark is considered to be at low risk for wildfire. The California Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) has mapped areas at risk of fires around the
state, and determined that Newark is neither in a State High Fire Severity Area (SRA),
or a Local Very High Severity Area (LRA). The city does face the risk of urban
structure fires, as do all urbanized areas. Preventative measures in the Fire Code and
Building Code reduce the risk of fire and ensure the ability to detect and respond to
fires when they occur. These measures address evacuation, alarm systems,
emergency response, water availability and pressure, road design, and building
access.
Fire prevention and protection services in Newark are addressed in the Community
Services and Facilities Element of the General Plan.
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
O VERVIEW
Hazardous materials include substances that may pose a threat to human health or
the environment when they are improperly handled, stored, transported, or
disposed. They include toxic metals, chemicals, gases, flammable and/or explosive
                                                                                                                         EH-11

                                         materials, corrosive materials, infectious substances, and radioactive materials.
                                         Newark has sizeable number of industries where hazardous materials are used, and
                                         a rail and freeway network on which hazardous materials are frequently transported.
                                         The threat of an accident or spill requires precautions and emergency response
                                         plans. In addition, the clean-up of previously contaminated sites is a priority, both to
                                         improve environmental quality and reduce the risk of future exposure.
                                         Federal, State, and local laws guide the management of hazardous materials. The US
                                         Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets national standards for hazardous
                                         materials management. The EPA also controls the generation, handling,
                                         transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. The Clean Water
                                         Act governs hazardous material discharges into bodies of water. Other federal
                                         agencies with jurisdiction over hazardous materials include the Occupational Safety
                                         and Health Administration (OSHA), which ensures safe working conditions, and the
                                         US Department of Transportation (US DOT), which regulates the transportation of
                                         hazardous materials.
                                         At the State level, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) and the
                                         California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) manage lists of hazardous
                                         wastes subject to regulation. Both agencies also track the location of sites requiring
                                         hazardous material clean-up to ensure safe future development. Cal/EPA also
                                         monitors activities involving hazardous material within the State. The Department of
                                         Industrial Relations' Division of Occupational Safety and Health, better known as Cal-
                                         OSHA, was established under the California Code of Regulations, Title 8, to serve as
                                         an organization that oversees policies for workplace safety, including exposure to
                                         hazardous materials. The California Emergency Management Agency (CEMA)
                                         prepares hazardous materials release response plans and assists local government in
                                         disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.
                                         At the local level, the Alameda County Department of Environment Health (ACDEH)
                                         has developed a Hazardous Waste Management Plan. ACDEH has been designated
                                         as the Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) for Newark and as such, it
                                         coordinates and enforces environmental protection and hazardous material
                                         management, handling, and storage programs from the local to the federal level.
                                         These programs include the Hazardous Materials Business Plan (HMBP) Program;
                                         Hazardous Waste Generator Program; and California Accidental Release Program.
                                         Other County programs applicable to Newark include an underground storage tank

program, an aboveground storage tank program, a tiered permitting program, and a
risk management program.
Fire codes, which are enforced by the Alameda County Fire Department (ACFD), also
address the handling of hazardous materials, and the Newark Municipal Code
requires Hazardous Materials Storage Permits. The Alameda County Water District
addresses hazardous materials as they relate to the potential contamination of
groundwater. The Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) monitors
hazardous materials issues relating to urban runoff and stormwater. Construction
plans that disturb 1 acre of soil or more require that a Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP) be filed with the RWQCB. The SWPPP includes hazardous
materials discharge regulations, sediment and erosion control measures, and
detailed construction schedules.
H AZARDOUS M ATERIALS H ANDLING
Businesses that use hazardous materials are required to prepare HMBPs for their
operations. The HMBP must include a complete inventory of all materials that are
handled by type, quantity, storage conditions, and routes of transport. Each Plan
assesses the potential hazards associated with the materials and the steps to be
taken to minimize risks. The Plan identifies actions to taken in the event of a spill,
identifies a responsible person for the facility, and includes any other data
determined necessary to ensure public health and safety. The HMBP also addresses
the methods for storing hazardous materials, including the design of storage tanks,
containment facilities, and handling practices.
The General Plan encourages continued industrial growth in Newark, including
growth in bio-medical, laboratory, research and development, and other sectors that
will handle or generate hazardous materials. As development occurs, each proposal
will continue to be carefully evaluated to limit the potential for negative effects on
adjacent uses. Businesses will continue to prepare HMBPs that indicate the protocol
for minimizing risks. In addition, the City will continue to maintain distance
thresholds in its zoning regulations that ensure that businesses storing hazardous
materials are separated from residential uses.
T RANSPORTATION OF H AZARDOUS M ATERIALS
The transport of hazardous materials is closely regulated. The City has jurisdiction
over transportation on local streets, while the freeways and railroad are largely under
                                                                                                                         EH-13

                                         has identified a network of truck routes that direct vehicles carrying hazardous
                                         materials away from residential areas. The location of these routes will need to be
                                         periodically revisited, as a number of them pass through areas planned for future
                                         residential development. Backup routes also should be identified in the event a truck
                                         route is blocked or congested, impeding access by emergency vehicles.
                                         With respect to the freeways and railroad, the City has less control over such
                                         activities due to the interstate nature of this traffic. Communication with State and
                                         federal regulatory agencies is critical to reduce the risk of accidents and ensure that
                                         response to transportation-related hazardous materials incidents is immediate and
                                         effective. In the event of a hazmat incident in Newark, the ACFD has a Hazardous
                                         Materials Unit that would provide the initial response.
                                         The Transportation Element of the General Plan may be consulted for additional
                                         information on truck routes.

                                         The storage of petroleum products and other chemicals on sites in Newark has
                                         created the risk of soil and groundwater contamination in parts of the city. The
                                         SWRCB monitors gas stations and industrial operations that operate subsurface
                                         gasoline or diesel storage units in Newark to ensure compliance with applicable
                                         hazardous material regulations. Groundwater monitoring and soil vapor testing is
                                         conducted regularly at potentially contaminated and contaminated locations to
                                         assess the degree of pollution.
                                         Under California’s Cortese Act, the location of underground storage tank facilities and
                                         clean-up sites must be made available for the public to review. As of February 2013,
                                         there were 108 listed facilities and sites in or near Newark. Of these, 16 are
                                         permitted underground storage tanks, 35 are leaking underground storage tank
                                         clean-up sites (17 of which are closed cases), 18 are DTSC clean-up sites, and 39 are
                                         other clean-up sites (16 of which are closed cases). In addition, the DTSC indicated
                                         that there were 62 local properties requiring action or evaluation as of February
                                         2013. These included sites with varying levels of soil or groundwater contamination.
                                         The San Francisco Bay RWQCB is involved in clean-up oversight on some of these
                                         sites and serves as a lead agency on many cases involving chemical compounds.
                                         These compounds include tetracholoethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE),

trichloroethylene (TCA), volatile organic compounds (VOC), polynuclear aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHS), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBS). Clean-up oversight on
other contaminated sites is often the responsibility of the Alameda County Water
District.
Most chemical clean up locations are located in the industrial areas along Willow
Street, Central Avenue, Sycamore Street, and Cherry Street. However, the list includes
sites such as the Newark Police Pistol Range, which is affected by lead concentrations
in shallow soils. In 2012, there were six locations with covenants that prohibited
certain uses (day care, hospitals, homes, etc.) due to prior contamination. For
example, a covenant on the southern part of the Ohlone College campus prohibits
day care, elder care, hospitals, homes, or schools for persons under age 21.
The clean-up of contaminated sites will create new opportunities for development in
the city. In some instances, continued monitoring will be required to ensure
compliance with state and federal standards. In other cases, long-term development
restrictions will remain in place to reduce the potential for future risks. Additionally,
demolition of older buildings may require that special steps be taken to reduce the
potential for impacts associated with hazardous building materials such as asbestos,
PCBs, and lead paint.
The General Plan Environmental Impact Report (EIR) may be consulted for more
detailed lists of hazardous material sites and a description of the clean-up status. The
EIRs for various Specific Plans in the city include additional measures to reduce site-
specific impacts.
H OUSEHOLD H AZARDOUS W ASTE
Household hazardous waste includes products commonly used in the home such as
paint, motor oil, household cleaners, batteries, lawn care supplies, antifreeze, and
other consumer goods. Residents may be unaware of the potential damage these
substances cause when they are disposed in the trash, poured on the ground, or
dumped down an indoor or outdoor drain. Household hazardous wastes must be
safely disposed in designated facilities. The facility closest to Newark is located just
outside the city in Fremont. The City works with StopWaste.Org to educate residents
about the safe use and storage of household hazardous waste and its rules and
regulations for waste disposal.

                                         There are two large (20- and 30-inch) PG&E owned and operated high pressure gas
                                         lines running through Newark. Because of a gas explosion in San Mateo County in
                                         2010, PG&E is reviewing the safety of these lines and others. Moving forward,
                                         continued steps should be taken to ensure the long-term safety of the gas pipelines
                                         traversing the city.
                                         EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
                                         Newark’s location in an area prone to earthquakes, floods, and hazardous material
                                         incidents makes it essential to be prepared in the event of an emergency. The City of
                                         Newark and the ACFD work collaboratively to reduce exposure to hazards,
                                         implement training programs for residents, and ensure effective response and quick
                                         recovery following an incident.
                                         Newark has adopted two emergency response plans. The Emergency Operations
                                         Plan sets forth operational procedures for responding to a variety of emergency
                                         conditions. The procedures address the needs of the entire community and identify
                                         key responsible agencies and personnel. The City has designated an Emergency
                                         Operations Center so that citywide emergencies can be dealt with effectively from a
                                         central location. The Chemical Emergency Preparedness Supporting Plan establishes
                                         standard operating procedures for responding to a chemical spill or other hazardous
                                         materials incidents in the city.
                                         Both of these plans are periodically updated in response to new requirements,
                                         technology and communication protocol, and real-world experiences. Newark has
                                         also designated a Disaster Council comprised of the Mayor, City Manager,
                                         department heads, and representatives of schools and utilities, to discuss disaster
                                         preparedness. Disaster planning efforts are coordinated with the cities of Fremont,
                                         Hayward, and Union City to maximize mutual aid response.
                                         In addition, ABAG has prepared a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (LHMP) to prepare
                                         for and mitigate the effects of potential hazards in the Bay Area. Although the LHMP
                                         covers multiple communities, it has been adopted by each city it covers to ensure a
                                         coordinated regional approach to disaster response. In 2011, the City of Newark
                                         drafted a supplement to the plan (called an “annex”) which focuses on hazards that
                                         are specific to Newark. These include ground shaking, liquefaction, dam failure, and
                                         drought. Local priorities expressed in the Newark LHMP include inventorying

structures vulnerable to earthquake hazards, developing standards to lessen the
potential for damage to these structures, developing a back-up plan in the event City
Hall is damaged by an earthquake, and improving public information on earthquake
safety.
The City also encourages its residents and businesses to be better prepared for
disasters. The ACFD offers a local Community Emergency Response Training (CERT)
program for community volunteers. The training provides basic skills in fighting,
search and rescue, first aid, and emergency preparedness. Its main goal is to help
residents become self-sufficient for the first 72 hours after a major disaster.
Participants are provided with a training manual and take six classes free of charge.
NOISE AND VIBRATION
I NTRODUCTION
Noise is one of the seven mandated elements of a general plan in California.
Because noise is considered a public safety issue, the City of Newark has merged this
element and the State-mandated safety element into a combined Environmental
Hazards Element. The noise section of this chapter meets the requirements of
Government Code Section 65302(f) and provides the framework for protecting
Newark's residents from excessive noise.
The Noise section of the Environmental Hazards Element describes the major
sources of noise in the city. It includes measurements of existing noise levels along
with projections of future noise levels based on expected increases in traffic and
other factors. This section also establishes standards for acceptable noise levels for
different land uses. The final section of the Environmental Hazards Element includes
the City’s goals, policies, and actions related to noise. The Newark General Plan
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) may be consulted for additional information on
noise in the community.
Newark’s location in a large metropolitan area makes it susceptible to high levels of
noise. Each day, almost 200,000 cars pass along the city’s eastern boundary on
Interstate 880 while 60,000 cars pass along the northern boundary along State Route
84. Freight trains and large trucks pass through the city and aircraft fly overhead.
Even in relatively quiet parts of the city, residents contend with domestic noise
sources such as leaf blowers, barking dogs, and construction. Maintaining a relatively
                                                                                                                        EH-17

                                         quiet environment is considered an important quality of life goal in Newark’s
                                         neighborhoods.
                                         Noise is an important factor in determining the distribution of land uses shown on
                                         the General Plan Land Use Map. Policies in the Land Use Element and in this
                                         Environmental Hazards Element ensure that site planning for individual projects is
                                         responsive to local conditions, and protects public safety and well- being. For
                                         properties subject to high noise levels, this may mean that particular building
                                         orientations and buffering methods will be required, or that certain land uses may
                                         not be acceptable. Similarly, policies in the Transportation Element work in tandem
                                         with those in this Element to ensure that projected noise levels are considered in the
                                         design of transportation improvements.
                                         N OISE D EFINITIONS AND S TANDARDS
                                         Noise can produce undesirable effects that range from irritability to hearing loss. The
                                         extent of adverse effects depends on the intensity, duration, time, and frequency of
                                         noise. Even noise of moderate volume and short duration, such as a heavy truck
                                         passing by, can have physiological effects.
                                         The level of noise at a given location is usually expressed in decibels (dB). Decibels
                                         are measured on a logarithmic scale. This means that 10 dB is 10 times more
                                         intense than 1 dB, 20 dB is 100 times greater than 1 dB and 30 dB is 1,000 times
                                         greater than 1 dB. A particular type of decibel scale, called the “A” scale, is used to
                                         relate decibels to human perception. The A scale filters out very high and very low
                                         frequencies. Everyday sounds range from 30 dB, which is very quiet, to 100 dB,
                                         which is very noisy. Above 70 dB, noise can become irritating and disruptive.
                                         When reporting noise levels, it is important to also report the distance between the
                                         source and receiver. Under typical atmospheric conditions, sound attenuates at a
                                         rate of 3 to 6 dB for each doubling of the distance. An untrained human ear typically
                                         cannot detect a difference in sound levels of less than 3 dB. It is difficult to tell the
                                         difference between 60 dB and 62 dB, but the difference between 60 dB and 65 dB is
                                         easily noticed.
                                         Typical A-weighted sound levels for various sources of noise measured at specific
                                         distances are shown in Table EH-1. Different rating scales have been developed to

                                         assess the severity of noise exposure, taking into consideration such factors as
                                         duration, repetition rate, background levels, and time of occurrence.
                                         The term Ldn is used to express the average sound level over a 24-hour period, with a
                                         10 dBA weighting factor applied for noise that occurs between 10 PM and 7 AM.
                                         The adjustment for night-time noise accounts for the greater human sensitivity to
                                         noise during these hours. The use of a 24-hour measurement period accounts for
                                         the variations in the intensity of sound levels that may occur throughout the day.
                                         N OISE C RITERIA FOR L AND U SE P LANNING
                                         The potential for adverse psychological and physiological impacts related to noise
                                         requires that criteria be established for determining acceptable levels of noise for
                                         different land uses. Certain land uses are considered “sensitive receptors,” meaning
                                         they are more prone to the adverse effects of high noise levels than others. These
                                         include residential areas, schools, childcare centers, hospitals, churches, libraries, and
                                         nursing homes, among others. Future land use decisions should protect these uses
                                         from high levels of noise. At the same time, when land uses such as housing and
                                         schools are developed in the future, it is important that they are located and
                                         designed in a way that protects occupants from potential impacts from existing noise
                                         sources.
                                         Table EH-2 provides interior and exterior noise compatibility guidelines for different
                                         land uses. To avoid the potential for noise-related problems, future development
                                         proposals should comply with these guidelines to the greatest extent feasible.
                                         Table EH-2 uses four terms to define the level of noise compatibility for each land
                                         use:
                                               "Normally Acceptable" means that the specified land use is satisfactory based
                                                on the assumption that any buildings involved are of normal conventional
                                                construction, without any special noise insulation requirements.
                                               "Conditionally Acceptable" means that new construction or development
                                                should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of noise reduction
                                                requirements is made and necessary noise mitigation measures are included
                                                in the design.

                                                 the particular land use should be discouraged. If new construction or
                                                 development proceeds, a detailed noise analysis must be performed.

                                                 generally not be undertaken.
                                         The noise criteria for multi-family housing should also comply with the Noise
                                         Insulation Standards of the California Code of Regulations, Part 2, Title 24
                                         (commonly referred to as “Title 24”). These standards establish minimum noise
                                         insulation levels for new hotels, motels, dormitories, long-term care facilities,
                                         apartments, and other attached or multi-family dwellings. Consistent with Title 24,
                                         when part of a development site is exposed to exterior noise levels greater than 60
                                         dB Ldn, an acoustical analysis is required. The analysis should include measures that
                                         reduce the noise levels in interior living spaces to 45 dB Ldn or less.
                                         N OISE E MISSION S TANDARDS
                                         In addition to the noise compatibility standards in the previous sections, State and
                                         federal agencies have established standards for motor vehicles. Section 38370 of the
                                         California Vehicle Code establishes noise emission standards that are enforced
                                         during licensing. The Newark Police Department may enforce noise violations
                                         caused by vehicles operating in excess of State standards.
                                         Noise criteria which are designed to protect the health of employees in workplaces
                                         have been established at the federal level by the EPA and OSHA. The California
                                         Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) generally mirrors the
                                         federal standards.
                                         G ROUND V IBRATION
                                         Ground-borne vibration can be detrimental to structures and can cause annoyance
                                         to persons within those structures. The level of vibration is influenced by a number
                                         of factors, including soil characteristics, groundwater depth, and geologic conditions.
                                         In the past, the greatest vibration-related concerns in Newark have been freight traffic
                                         along the Union Pacific Railroad, trucks along major thoroughfares, and heavy
                                         construction activity such as pile drivers, vibratory rollers, and jackhammers.
                                         Vibration levels usually dissipate rapidly with distance, so the area of concern is
                                         typically close to the source(s).

Policies in this Element ensure that vibration impacts are considered when
development is proposed. Appropriate setbacks for structures are determined on a
site-by-site basis during the environmental review process for any planned
development along a railroad corridor. Additionally, the City sets limits on
construction hours and activities to reduce the potential for vibration-related impacts
to become a source of annoyance and/or structural damage.
T HE N EWARK N OISE E NVIRONMENT
The noise environment in Newark is influenced primarily by roadway traffic, railroad
operations, industrial activities, and to lesser extent, commercial and residential
activities. Major noise sources include Interstate 880 and State Route 84, the Union
Pacific Railroad, and major thoroughfares such as Mowry Avenue, Thornton Avenue,
Stevenson Boulevard, Cherry Street, Cedar Boulevard, Central Avenue, Jarvis Avenue,
and Newark Boulevard. There are also a number of stationary noise sources in the
city’s industrial areas that create localized areas with high noise levels.
To identify existing noise conditions and develop a baseline for the projection of
future noise conditions, noise level measurements were made at three long-term
(LT) sites and ten short-term (ST) sites as part of the 2013 General Plan revision.
Noise levels reported in various EIRs and prior planning documents also were
considered. Using the noise measurement data, noise contour maps have been
prepared to show the noise environment in the city under both existing and future
traffic conditions. Figure EH-3 shows current (2013) noise contours while Figure
EH-4 shows projected contours in 2035. The contour maps also consider existing
and projected railroad noise.
The major types of noise sources within the city are profiled below.
V EHICLES
Cars, motorcycles, trucks, and buses are the principal sources of vehicle noise in
Newark. Vehicle noise is generated by engines, tires, and exhaust systems. The
highest noise levels are associated with Interstate 880, which borders the city on the
east, and State Route 84, which borders the city on the north. Both freeways are at
grade, with under-crossings or overpasses at major interchanges. In addition, arterial,
collector, and local streets create a significant source of ambient noise around the
city.

                                         Figure EH-3 shows the noise contour lines along the Newark side of the two
                                         freeways and along major arterials as of 2013. Figure EH-4 shows projected noise
                                         levels in 2035 in the same locations. A slight increase in noise levels is anticipated as
                                         a result of increased traffic volumes. 2 The General Plan EIR may be consulted for a
                                         more detailed evaluation of the data. Policies and actions later in this Element
                                         indicate the steps that should be taken to mitigate the impacts of roadway noise on
                                         existing development and future development that takes place near the freeways
                                         and along major arterials.

                                         The Union Pacific Railroad includes two lines that bisect the city – one running north-
                                         south and another running east-west. The two lines intersect near Thornton Avenue
                                         and Sycamore Street. Newark’s railways serve freight trains and passenger trains. In
                                         2013, there were eight Altamont Commuter Express trains and 14 Capitol Corridor
                                         trains each weekday. The number of freight trains varies from day-to-day, depending
                                         on the local and regional demand for the movement of goods.
                                         Noise from passing trains is generated by locomotive engines, mechanical
                                         components, warning horns, crossing guard bells, and the interaction of steel wheels
                                         and rails. Federal regulations require that trains sound a warning horn ¼-mile before
                                         they approach a grade-level crossing. Some cities have established “Quiet Zones”
                                         where these regulations are suspended, but Newark has not done so.

                                         Aircraft contribute to the noise environment in Newark, but they are not considered
                                         a major problem at this time. The city is located roughly 10 to 15 miles from
                                         runways at the region’s three international airports. At these distances, the city is not
                                         within the airport land use planning areas or runway protection zones associated
                                         with these airports. Smaller airports, including the Palo Alto and Hayward Airports,
                                         are located more than 5 miles away from the city. Low-altitude regular traffic patterns
                                         to and from the region’s airports do not occur over the city. Further, there are no
                                         heliports in Newark or in immediate proximity to the city. While intermittent aircraft
                                         or helicopters over-flights may produce single-event noise levels of approximately 60

STATIONARY NOISE SOURCES
Stationary noise is generated by day-to-day activities associated with industrial,
commercial, residential, and public uses. These land uses may generate noise from
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, loading and delivery
activities at local businesses, and the use of motorized equipment and heavy
machinery. Even public uses such as schools and parks may generate noise
associated with outdoor activities such as physical education programs and sporting
events.
Industrial uses are generally located in the area west of Cherry Street and along both
sides of Central Avenue between Cherry and Willow Streets. There are also areas of
industrial activity along Cedar Boulevard near Central Avenue and along the
southern perimeter of Old Town Newark along Wells Avenue and Enterprise Drive.
Noise from these areas varies widely, with some businesses operating only during
typical work-day hours and others operating on a 24-hour basis. The city’s heavier
industrial activities, such as Pabco Gypsum and Cargill Salt, tend to be more distant
from residential uses. The potential for noise conflicts may be greater where
industrial uses are adjacent to homes or generate noise that is perceptible at nearby
neighborhoods.
Domestic noise also has the potential to create conflicts. This includes noise
associated with yard maintenance activities such as leaf blowers and lawn mowers,
and noise from loud music, barking dogs, parties, and other household sources.
These types of noise issues are typically controlled through administrative processes
such as police complaints, rather than through land use planning.
I MPACTS OF L AND U SE C HANGES ON N OISE -R ELATED I SSUES
The future noise environment in Newark will be impacted not only by changes in
traffic volumes, but also by changes in land use. In particular, new transit-oriented
development around the future Dumbarton Rail station and residential development
in Southwest Newark will result in a larger population in areas that are presently
vacant. New homes may be built in areas subject to railroad noise and in areas
where there is audible noise from nearby industrial activities. The environmental
impact reports (EIRs) prepared for approved development in these areas included
measures to mitigate potential noise impacts. Likewise, future EIRs will include such
measures, as appropriate.
                                                                                                                         EH-27

                                         Similarly, the development of new medium-density housing along Cedar Avenue
                                         between NewPark Mall and Mowry Avenue and potentially in the NewPark area
                                         could result in higher populations near Interstate 880. Infill development in Old
                                         Town Newark and on other housing sites will likely mean more residents living along
                                         major thoroughfares in the city. Development of the remaining vacant sites in Pacific
                                         Research Center, Stevenson Point Technology Park, and other industrial areas of the
                                         city could create new noise sources, which in turn could affect nearby residential
                                         areas.
                                         Policies and actions in the General Plan have been developed to reduce the potential
                                         for impacts associated with these changes. As appropriate, through implementation
                                         of a new Noise Ordinance, the City will continue to require acoustical studies when
                                         development is proposed near noise sources, or when new development will
                                         generate noise that could impact nearby sensitive receptors.
                                         When an acoustical analysis is required, it must be submitted at the same time as
                                         the application for a planning or building permit. The City requires that the analysis
                                         be prepared under the supervision of a person experienced in the field of acoustical
                                         engineering. The reports must include noise data obtained from on-site sound level
                                         measurements with appropriate variations based on the time of day and different
                                         locations on the site. Factors such as topography, the location, and characteristics of
                                         noise sources, and projected noise sources must be considered and discussed. As
                                         appropriate, acoustical reports also must include noise attenuation measures, and an
                                         analysis that demonstrates that interior noise level requirements will be achieved in a
                                         manner consistent with Title 24 and other applicable building code requirements.
                                         C ONTROLLING F UTURE N OISE E FFECTS
                                         Noise problems are usually associated with one of three components: 1) noise
                                         sources, 2) the noise transmission pathway, and 3) noise receivers. Most measures
                                         to reduce the effects of noise focus on some combination of these three
                                         components. These measures include reducing noise at the source, providing
                                         greater distance separation (buffering) and/or barriers along the path between the
                                         noise source and the noise receiver, and modifying the receiver through sound
                                         insulation and/or other means.

                                                                                            E N V I R O N M E N T A L H A Z A R D S
NOISE SOURCE C ONTROLS
One of the most effective ways to reduce noise is to control it at the source. This can
be accomplished by placing enclosures around motors, requiring quieter machinery
and equipment, regulating the hours during which noise is generated, and similar
measures. For example, conditional use permits may specify that certain businesses
activities are prohibited during night-time hours to reduce potential noise conflicts.
Likewise, construction may be prohibited during certain times of the day and night.
Other examples of noise source controls include federal regulations for quieter
aircraft and motor vehicle mufflers, and the designation of certain streets as truck
routes to direct truck traffic away from residential streets.
The Newark Municipal Code regulates industrial operations to reduce noise levels
that could disturb nearby sensitive uses. The code sets strict limits on the emission of
noise from industrial sites and also sets limits for the reception of noise at certain
land uses adjacent to industrial districts. Noise from home occupations, animals,
agriculture, alarms, and vehicles is also addressed by different sections of the
Municipal Code. As noted earlier, an action in the General Plan calls for the
reorganization of these various provisions into a City Noise Ordinance.
NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS
Noise levels can be reduced by modifying the pathway that noise travels between its
source and nearby receivers. Typical noise barriers include earthen berms and sound
walls. Fences are sometimes used on private properties to absorb noise and increase
privacy. Planting and shrubbery are less effective as roadway noise barriers, although
they do provide privacy and visual screening. Another example of noise path control
is to increase the separation distance between the source and receiving point.
Sound walls have been constructed along portions of Interstate 880 to reduce noise
levels in adjoining residential areas in the northeastern part of Newark. Residents
have expressed interest in using taller walls to further reduce noise levels in this area.
The City has also constructed back-up masonry walls along arterials where noise
levels exceed residential compatibility guidelines. These walls exist along portions of
Thornton Avenue, Cherry Street, Cedar Boulevard, Newark Boulevard, Mowry
Avenue, and Jarvis Avenue.

                                         Adjusting the noise receiver is typically done through site planning, building design,
                                         and construction. Lower noise levels can be achieved by designing a development to
                                         maximize separation distance between noise sources and receptors, and taking
                                         advantage of natural barriers and topography. For example, mechanical equipment
                                         should be placed away from sleeping areas. Likewise, decks and balconies should be
                                         avoided on facades that face noisy streets. Interior rooms should be arranged so that
                                         noise-sensitive spaces such as bedrooms are placed further away from the roadway
                                         or other nearby noise sources. Within the building itself, noise levels can be reduced
                                         by increasing wall mass and thickness, using double glazed windows and solid core
                                         doors, and through interior finishes such as carpeting, drapes, and acoustical ceiling
                                         tiles.

P OLICIES
Policy EH-7.1 Land Use Planning and Noise Compatibility. Use the noise
              compatibility guidelines in Table EH-2 and the future-conditions noise
              contour map in Figure EH-4 to plan for appropriate land uses near
              existing uses that generate noise. Noise mitigation should be included
              to ensure that new residential areas and other noise-sensitive uses are
              appropriately buffered from significant noise sources.
Policy EH-7.2 Noise Compatibility Strategies. Where land use noise compatibility
              conflicts currently exist, explore the need for mitigation measures on
              noise sources that may be adjacent to sensitive receptors. In planning
              for future developments, promote the use of buffer zones,
              barrier/shielding measures, and/or sound insulation building
              techniques to preclude noise impacts to noise-sensitive land uses.
Policy EH-7.3 Reducing Exposure to Operational Noise. In new residential and
              mixed-use developments, require that stationary equipment (such as
              air conditioning units and condensers) be placed in separate spaces,
              rooftops, or other areas such that noise impacts to interior living areas
              will be reduced. Similarly, potentially noisy common spaces, such as
              trash collection areas and loading zones, should be located away from
              residential units or other noise-sensitive spaces.
Policy EH-7.4 Residential Noise Standard – Exterior. Plan for and implement
              strategies to maintain exterior noise levels that are consistent with the
              noise compatibility guidelines in Table EH-2. For residential areas, this
              limit is 60 dBA Ldn for outdoor living areas. Where this level is
              exceeded due to freeways, arterials, and/or railroads, the construction
              of berms, walls, buffer zones, and other noise-reduction measures to
              reduce noise to the greatest extent feasible will be required.
Policy EH-7.5 Residential Noise Standard – Interior. Use site planning and
              architectural design to protect occupants of new buildings from
              excessive noise, per California State Noise Insulation Standards
              (California Code of Regulations, Title 24) and Chapter 35 of the
              Uniform Building Code (UBC). For example, site planning should
              place bedrooms and other noise-sensitive rooms away from exterior
              noise sources and architectural design should use double-paned
              windows and other insulating measures to reduce interior noise.
                                                                                                                          EH-43

                                         Policy EH-7.7 Acoustical Study Requirement. Require acoustical studies for new
                                                       developments in areas where the noise levels exceed the ‘normally
                                                       acceptable’ levels for the proposed land use; based on Table EH-2. For
                                                       residential uses, the analysis should include mitigation measures to
                                                       limit the noise exposure in interior living spaces to 45 dB Ldn,

Action EH-7.B Conditional Use Permits. Use the development review process,
              including conditional use permits, to limit activities which would
              generate high levels of noise during nighttime hours (i.e., from 7 PM
              to 7 AM).
Action EH-7.C Allowing Noise-Sensitive Uses Near Noise Sources. Use the
              development review process when evaluating zoning changes to
              consider potential noise impacts due to noise-sensitive uses being
              located near commercial uses, industrial uses, or other activities that
              typically generate excessive noise.
Action EH-7.D Vibration-Intensive Construction. Implement a standard operating
              procedure that requires the evaluation of vibration impacts for
              individual projects which use vibration-intensive construction activities,
              such as pile drivers, jack hammers, and vibratory rollers, near sensitive
              receptors. If construction-related vibration is determined to be
              perceptible (i.e., in excess of Federal Transit Administrations vibration
              annoyance criterion) at vibration-sensitive uses, then additional
              requirements, such as the use of less-vibration-intensive equipment or
              construction techniques, shall be implemented during construction.
Action EH-7.E New Development Near Railroads. Implement a standard operating
              procedure that requires the evaluation of potential vibration impacts
              for new development that occurs within 200 feet of a railroad track, in
              accordance with the FTA’s vibration screening distances. In such
              instances, the project property owner/developers shall retain an
              acoustical engineer to conduct an acoustic analysis and identify, where
              appropriate, site design features and/or required building construction
              improvements to ensure that vibration impacts would remain below
              acceptable levels for residential uses.
              Acceptable levels of vibration, as referenced in Actions, are
              documented in the General Plan EIR.

INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the Newark Health and Wellness Element is to promote and sustain
the health of Newark residents. Although this is not a mandatory element of the
General Plan, the City of Newark recognizes that land use, transportation, housing,
and natural resource decisions directly influence public health. The Health and
Wellness Element establishes goals, policies, and actions that strive to improve air
quality, promote physical fitness, ensure access to healthy foods, expand local health
care facilities, protect residents from exposure to hazards, reduce crime, and create a
greater sense of civic engagement and mental well-being.
The profession of city planning itself has its roots in public health planning. A centu-
ry ago, major cities prepared plans to protect residents from disease. As sanitation
improved and overcrowding subsided, the focus of planning shifted to other quality
of life issues. Today, new trends are compelling cities to take a second look at the
relationship between public health and urban planning. An increasing number of
Americans suffer from diabetes, obesity, asthma, and other conditions that are influ-
enced by the way we live, the air we breathe, and the foods we eat. By rethinking
the way communities are designed, cities can help their residents’ lead healthier
lives.
This Element begins with a profile of public health in Newark today, including statis-
tics on the health of residents and a discussion of the conditions that can create a
healthier city. The second part of the Element includes goals, policies, and actions
that address the major health issues facing the city.
HEALTH IN NEWARK
In 2010, Alameda County released a report on the health of residents in the County
                                            1
and its 14 cities, including Newark. Since the conclusions of this report mostly re-

                                  flect data from 2006-2008, the City has provided more current statistics where they
                                  are available. A summary of the statistics is provided in Table HW-1. Differences
                                  between the statistics for Newark and for the County as a whole are discussed be-
                                  low.
                                  Overall, Newark residents enjoy a long life, give birth to healthy children, and are in
                                  better health than the average resident of Alameda County. Life expectancy in New-
                                  ark is 81.9 years, slightly higher than the County average of 81.6 years. Newark resi-
                                  dents have a roughly equal hospitalization rate for asthma compared to the County
                                  average. Newark residents had about the same odds of developing cancer com-
                                  pared as the average Alameda County resident. However, for certain types of cancer,
                                  the incidence is substantially higher in Newark than in the County as a whole and
                                  the survival rates are lower.
                                  For example, Newark women are slightly more likely to develop breast cancer than
                                  Alameda County residents as a whole. However, the breast cancer mortality rate is
                                  more than 50 percent higher than the County average. The incidence of lung cancer
                                  was 40 percent higher in Newark than in the County as a whole. Similarly, Newark
                                  residents develop colon cancer at a 4 percent higher rate than the County average,
                                  and are 13 percent more likely to die of colon cancer.
                                  Although obesity data is not available at the city level, it is estimated that roughly
                                  one-third of Alameda County’s adult population was overweight and nearly a quarter
                                                                                2
                                  of the population was obese in 2007. Some weight-related ailments have a greater
                                  incidence in Newark than in the County as a whole while others have a lower inci-
                                  dence. For example, the County Public Health Department reports that hospitaliza-
                                  tion due to heart disease is 13 percent higher among Newark residents than in the
                                  County as a whole. On the other hand, Newark residents are 21 percent less likely
                                  to die from a stroke. Health statistics also show Newark school children are slightly
                                  less likely to be overweight than children in the County as a whole.
                                  Certain segments of the population are more vulnerable to physical health problems
                                  than the population as a whole. Children, seniors, and lower income populations, in
                                  particular, have a higher exposure risk to a number of illnesses.

                                  Children are more susceptible to asthma than adults. This has implications for the
                                  design of housing, schools, childcare facilities, and other uses near freeways and
                                  industrial uses where air pollutant concentrations may be higher.
                                  Persons under the age of 20 represent roughly one-third of Newark’s population.
                                  Walking and bicycling could be a more viable mode of travel for Newark’s youth, but
                                  the risk of accidents associated with walking and bicycling on a street network de-
                                  signed for cars is currently a deterrent. As a result, youth do not get the exercise
                                  they would if walking and bicycling were safer. Improving pedestrian and bicycle
                                  safety provides the triple benefit of improving mobility, promoting physical fitness
                                  and exercise, and reducing air pollution.
                                  About 4,500 Newark residents were older than 65 at the time of the 2010 Census.
                                  The number of seniors is expected to grow dramatically in the next two decades as
                                  baby boomers reach retirement age. This will trigger a shift in health care needs, as
                                  well as transportation, housing, and personal care needs for seniors. As residents

live longer, there will be a greater need for services for persons with limited mobility,
cognitive disabilities, and chronic illnesses.
There is also a correlation between poverty and health. Communities with a high
incidence of poverty have been found to experience higher rates of disease, injury,
and child wellness issues. The cost of medical care, including insurance, can be bur-
densome for lower income households. The 2010 Census indicated that 8 percent
of Newark residents had incomes below the poverty level (compared to 11.8 percent
in the County as a whole). In addition, 17 percent of the City’s residents had a disa-
bility, which in some cases prevented them from working. While there are state and
federal programs to assist lower income households with health care, these pro-
grams often focus on treatment rather than the preventive care needed to live a
healthier life and avoid future medical expenses.
AIR QUALITY
Air pollution can have significant health impacts, and can contribute to asthma, eye
irritation, bronchitis, emphysema and other respiratory ailments. In addition, a
number of air contaminants are known carcinogens. Air quality is closely regulated
by federal and state agencies and laws, and is the focus of several local and regional
initiatives relating to land use and transportation planning.
R EGULATORY F RAMEWORK
The federal Clean Air Act amendments of 1970 enabled the US Environmental Pro-
tection Agency (EPA) to regulate levels of air pollutants around the United States.
EPA has developed standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur
dioxide, particulate matter, and lead. Air basins that do not meet these standards are
referred to as “nonattainment areas” and are required to develop plans and pro-
grams to demonstrate how they will attain the standards in the future.
California has adopted additional legislation to address air quality issues. The state
standards tend to be more restrictive than the national standards and include similar
requirements for attainment by the earliest practical date. The California Air Re-
sources Board (CARB) is responsible for developing plans to meet the federal and
state standards. CARB also regulates “tailpipe” emissions from motor vehicles in
California.
Much of the authority for regulating air pollution and developing plans to bring Cali-
fornia’s air basins into compliance with air quality standards has been delegated to
                                                                                                                         HW-5

                                  Quality Management District (BAAQMD) regulates emissions from stationary sources
                                  such as power plants and refineries. BAAQMD also conducts air quality permitting,
                                  monitoring, and enforcement. The agency works collaboratively with agencies such
                                  as the Alameda County Transportation Commission and the Metropolitan Transpor-
                                  tation Commission to develop air quality improvement strategies.

                                  Both California and the federal government have established health-based air quality
                                  standards for seven air pollutants, which are shown in Table HW-2. These standards
                                  are designed to protect the health and welfare of the populace with a reasonable
                                  margin of safety.
                                  An overview of the major air pollutants of concern is provided below:
                                        Ozone (O3) is commonly referred to as “smog” and is a gas that is formed
                                         when reactive organic compounds and nitrogen oxides undergo photochemi-
                                         cal reactions in the presence of sunlight. Ozone concentrations are typically
                                         highest in the summer months. The primary sources are motor vehicle emis-
                                         sions, power plants, refineries, and solvents.
                                        Carbon Monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas formed by the incom-
                                         plete combustion of fuels and other organic substances. Motor vehicles are
                                         the main source. CO concentrations tend to be highest during winter morn-
                                         ings, when surface-based inversions trap pollution at ground levels.
                                        Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) are a byproduct of fuel combustion and a contributor
                                         to ozone and particulate matter. The two major components, nitric oxide and
                                         nitrogen dioxide, are considered irritants and contribute to a number of res-
                                         piratory ailments.
                                        Sulfur Dioxide is a colorless gas with a strong odor. It is generated through
                                         the combustion of fuels containing sulfur, such as oil and coal. At high con-
                                         centrations, it can irritate the upper respiratory tract. At lower concentrations,
                                         it can harm lung tissue.
                                        Suspended Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10) includes a range of solid and
                                         liquid inhalable particles. Air quality standards differentiate between particles
                                         less than 10 microns and less than 2.5 microns in diameter. Major sources in-
                                         clude road dust, agriculture, soot, fires, and construction and demolition.

                                           Particulate matter can increase the risk of chronic respiratory disease and ex-
                                           acerbate breathing problems for those with respiratory conditions. It also
                                           contributes to asthma and cardiopulmonary disease.
                                         Lead is a widely used metal that can contaminate air, food, water, or soil. It is
                                          found naturally in the environment as well as in manufactured products. High
                                          levels are typically associated with lead smelters, waste incinerators, and utili-
                                          ties. Leaded gasoline was formerly a primary source, but it has been banned
                                          since 1995.
                                  In addition to the pollutants listed above, California also regulates more than 240
                                  compounds that are classified as Toxic Air Contaminants (TACs). TACs include air
                                  pollutants which contribute to increase in mortality or serious illnesses, or which
                                  pose a present or potential human health hazard. Diesel particulate matter is a TAC
                                  of particular concern, as it accounts for much of the cancer risk from airborne toxics.
                                  Other sources of TACs include gasoline stations, dry cleaners, and auto body shops.

                                  The air quality monitoring station closest to Newark is in Hayward, about 10 miles to
                                  the north. Data from this station is summarized in Table HW-3. Because this station
                                  only monitors ozone, data was obtained from the San Jose monitoring station for the
                                  other criteria air pollutants. The data show occasional violations of the state and
                                  federal ozone standards, the state PM10 standard, and the federal PM2.5 standard.
                                  The state and federal CO, SO2, and NO2 standards have not been exceeded in the
                                  last five years in the vicinity of Newark.
                                  Table HW-3 also shows the attainment status for the listed pollutants as of 2011, the
                                  most recent year for which data is available. Although the Bay Area as a whole is
                                  considered a non-attainment area for the state and federal ozone standard, the
                                  standard was not exceeded in 2011 at the station closest to Newark. The federal fine
                                  particulate standard was exceeded on three days (in San Jose), while the coarse par-
                                  ticulate standard was not exceeded. Because of Newark’s bayside location, its air
                                  quality is somewhat better than air quality in the Bay Area’s sheltered inland valleys.
                                  According to a 2008 criteria and toxic pollutant emissions facilities data base, there
                                  are 74 stationary sources of pollution in Newark, including gas stations, print shops,
                                  auto body shops, and dry cleaners. The largest sources are industrial activities such
                                  as a waste oil refining facility, a gypsum manufacturing plant, a plastics packaging

                                  A IR Q UALITY P LANNING
                                  The BAAQMD prepares air quality management plans that set forth strategies to
                                  attain air quality standards in the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin. These plans in-
                                  clude Ozone Attainment Plans for the national O3 standard and Clean Air Plans for
                                  the California O3 standard. The most recent adopted plan is the 2010 Bay Area
                                  Clean Air Plan. It included new emissions inventories, modeling tools, and emission
                                  control measures to reduce ozone concentrations.
                                  Air quality planning is also a major focus of the Alameda County Transportation
                                  Commission’s Countywide Transportation Plan (CTP). The 2012 CTP recognizes the
                                  connection between land use planning, transportation, and air quality conditions. In
                                  addition to promoting alternatives to single passenger driving, the CTP also supports
                                  a land use pattern that reflects the region’s transportation network and constraints.
                                  This includes locating development near mass transit to reduce the necessity of driv-
                                  ing.
                                  Similar themes are expressed in the Sustainable Communities Strategy being pre-
                                  pared by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and Metropolitan Trans-
                                  portation Commission (MTC). This Plan, which is intended to comply with California
                                  Senate Bill 375, emphasizes the importance of connected streets, diverse housing
                                  choices, and walkable neighborhoods as a way to reduce vehicle miles traveled
                                  (VMT), improve air quality, and achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets.
                                  At the local level, the City of Newark addresses air quality through its land use plan-
                                  ning and environmental review processes. Land uses such as housing, schools, con-
                                  valescent homes, and hospitals are referred to as “sensitive receptors.” The Bay Area
                                  Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) has adopted guidelines to reduce the
                                  exposure of such land uses to air pollution, particularly toxic air contaminants, and
                                  fine particulate matter. BAAQMD generally considers areas within 500 feet of free-
                                  ways and high volume roadways (more than 10,000 vehicles per day) to have higher
                                  potential risks. Accordingly, future housing developments and other new sensitive
                                  receptors near State Routes 84 and Interstate 880 may need to incorporate special
                                  site planning and construction features to reduce risk exposure.

                                                                                             H E A L T H A N D W E L L N E S S
Local development review procedures also address the potential for odors when
development is proposed. BAAQMD has established specific distance thresholds for
land uses with the potential to generate odor complaints, such as wastewater treat-
ment plants, composting facilities, food manufacturing, and waste transfer stations.
Strategies to reduce odors are required when these uses are developed near sensi-
tive receptors. Such strategies may also be necessary in mixed-use projects, when
uses such as restaurants and bakeries are located immediately adjacent to housing.
Since automobiles are the principal source of air pollution in the Bay Area, a major
focus of air quality planning is focused on the transportation sector. This includes
promoting cleaner burning fuels—and reducing the necessity of driving and the
length of motor vehicle trips. An important goal is to achieve a better balance be-
tween jobs and housing in communities in the Bay Area, which in turn can help re-
duce commute lengths. As noted elsewhere in this chapter, improving the bicycle,
pedestrian, and public transportation systems is also an important part of these ini-
tiatives. Many of the policies in the Land Use and Transportation Elements of the
General Plan are focused on reducing auto dependency as a way to alleviate conges-
tion, improve air quality, and curb GHG emissions.
Construction is another source of air pollution. Construction can produce exhaust
emissions from equipment and vehicles, dust from demolition and grading, and
reactive organic gases from asphalt, paints, and coatings. A number of basic control
measures are prescribed when development is approved to reduce construction-
related air quality impacts. Similarly, new homes are subject to regulations for wood-
burning fireplaces, asbestos disposal, and other activities with the potential to gener-
ate particulates and other airborne contaminants.
The City also implements BAAQMD and State air quality recommendations for spe-
cific uses, such as dry cleaners and gas stations. The California Air Resources Board
has adopted distance thresholds which ensure that land uses such as housing and
schools are located a safe distance away from uses such as distribution centers (with
high volumes of diesel-powered trucks), chrome plating facilities, and refineries.
FITNESS AND WALKABILITY
Over the past 40 years, the number of Americans who are overweight or who are
suffering from weight-related illnesses has increased significantly. Weight is a factor
in the incidence of several serious medical conditions including Type 2 diabetes,
heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer. In Newark, 26.5 percent of all chil-
                                                                                                                      HW-11

                                  strokes or coronary heart disease.
                                  Physical fitness can help reduce obesity rates and the incidence of weight-related
                                  health problems. Exercise can also provide mental health benefits, such as alleviat-
                                  ing depression and promoting self-esteem. While not all residents may be inclined
                                  or able to engage in rigorous fitness activities, simple changes such as short daily
                                  walks can help curb obesity and lead to healthier living. Making Newark safer and
                                  more comfortable for pedestrians and bicyclists can increase the viability of walking—
                                  not only for leisure, but also for day-to-day errands and short trips. The more oppor-
                                  tunities the city provides for active transportation, the more opportunities there are
                                  to improve public health.

                                  The siting and orientation of different land uses within a city can affect public health.
                                  One of the fundamental purposes of zoning is to separate incompatible uses. Most
                                  zoning regulations and maps were initially developed in the 1920s and 30s to pro-
                                  tect residents from the noise, odor, pollution, and potential adverse health effects
                                  associated with living close to industry.
                                  Over time, the concept of separating different land uses expanded to uses which
                                  were not necessarily incompatible. Most neighborhoods developed after 1950 also
                                  separated residential uses from commercial uses, in some cases using street layouts,
                                  which made it difficult to walk from home to a nearby store, school, park, or shop-
                                  ping center.
                                  For over half a century, the suburban development model was to design communi-
                                  ties that kept housing and commerce apart. Such communities were often built with
                                  winding streets and cul-de-sacs, which lengthened the distance one had to travel to
                                  reach a destination. Wide streets, designed for fast-moving automobile traffic, made
                                  it even more difficult to walk from one point to another. One outcome of this ap-
                                  proach to community design was that residents became dependent on cars to make
                                  almost all of their daily trips. Walking to work, to school, or to run an errand be-
                                  came the exception rather than the rule. While there are many factors that have
                                  contributed to increasing obesity rates in America, the inability to comfortably walk in
                                  our own communities is one of the most pervasive.

During more recent times, community design has shifted back to the more tradition-
al idea of neighborhoods with multiple uses. While heavy industry and hazardous
uses must still be separated from housing, it is becoming more common for new
neighborhoods to integrate residential, commercial, and public uses in close proximi-
ty. One attribute of a traditional land use pattern is that it is denser than convention-
al suburban development. Housing is sometimes located above ground floor retail
uses. Such neighborhoods also are characterized by a grid street pattern (rectangu-
lar blocks), rather than meandering lanes and cul-de-sacs. By shortening the dis-
tance between origin and designation in a neighborhood, it becomes much easier
and more practical to walk.
S TREET D ESIGN
Land use is only one aspect of promoting healthy community design. The streets
themselves must be designed to accommodate walking and bicycling. A “walkable”
community includes continuous sidewalks, well-lit streets, shade trees for mid-day
walking, and safety features such as marked crosswalks. A number of design fea-
tures can be used to make it safer to cross wide or busy streets. For instance, streets
that are more than four lanes can include medians or pedestrian “refuges” at inter-
sections, curb extensions (also called “bulbouts”) which reduce the pavement width
at the crosswalk, and features such as digital countdowns, which indicate the time
remaining before the signal changes.
Most of Newark was designed during the automobile era, and many of its streets
were designed without these features. As of the 2010 Census, less than one percent
of the city’s residents walked to work. Walkscore, a company that measures the
walkability of neighborhoods across the country based on their land uses and trans-
portation systems, gave Newark a cumulative walkscore of 58 (on a scale of 100) in
2013. For comparison’s sake, the walkscore in both Fremont and Union City was 52.
Walkscores are higher in the Bay Area’s more urban communities such as San Fran-
cisco (85) and Berkeley (82).
While there is no official definition of “walking distance,” the benchmark is usually
either 1 mile or ½-mile. Longer trips are usually made by other transportation
modes such as bicycle, bus, or car. Of these modes, bicycling provides the greatest
potential health benefits—provided that conditions for cyclists are safe. Newark’s
terrain is conducive to bicycling, but bicycles must share the same traffic lanes as
cars on most of the city’s streets.

                                  It is estimated that 1,300 bicycle trips a day are made in Newark. The City is work-
                                  ing to create more dedicated bike lanes and is taking other steps to improve bicycle
                                  safety. These steps include additional bicycle parking facilities, resurfacing existing
                                  bike lanes, using high visibility road markings, and installing additional signs to call
                                  attention to bikes. Secured bike parking at home, at work, and at key destinations
                                  (schools, stores, restaurants, etc.) is also an important factor to make cycling more
                                  viable.
                                  FOOD ACCESS
                                  Another factor affecting community health is diet and nutrition. Lower income
                                  communities may have poorer access to supermarkets and fresh produce than more
                                  affluent communities. In such locations, the only option for groceries may be to
                                  shop at corner markets and convenience stores, and the only restaurant options may
                                  be fast food outlets. Residents in such areas may have diets that are high in sugars,
                                  salts, and fat. This can lead to higher obesity rates, as well as other chronic condi-
                                  tions associated with poor nutrition.
                                  Local policies can influence food access through zoning and economic development
                                  initiatives. Cities can also encourage farmers markets and community gardens, so
                                  that residents have additional opportunities to consume affordable, healthy food.
                                  Cities can also work collaboratively with school districts to promote nutrition educa-
                                  tion, healthier food choices in local schools, and a greater awareness of the relation-
                                  ship between diet and health.
                                  At the present time, Newark is well served by grocery stores. There are several su-
                                  permarkets in the Four Corners area, along Thornton Avenue, and in the NewPark
                                  vicinity. The City also has a number of ethnic markets, including those specializing in
                                  Asian and Hispanic foods. Most of Newark’s neighborhoods are within 1 mile of a
                                  large supermarket. Growth in the Dumbarton transit-oriented development (TOD)
                                  area and the Southwest Newark area will generate additional demand for fresh pro-
                                  duce; the City will encourage continued growth of supermarkets and green grocers
                                  to meet this demand.
                                  Newark also is home to one of the largest farmers markets in the Bay Area. The
                                  Newark Farmers Market operates year round every Sunday in the parking lot of
                                  NewPark Mall. Produce from farmers markets may be fresher than retail produce,

tionally, the Newark Farmers Market accepts food stamps, increasing its accessibility
to lower income residents.
As of 2013, there are no community gardens in Newark. However, the City has es-
tablished policies in this General Plan, which encourage community gardens in the
future. The City already encourages backyard food gardening and maintains zoning
regulations which enable small-scale urban agriculture.
The City of Newark also encourages the efforts of the Alameda County Food Bank,
which provides nutrition education to youth and adults. Persons served by the Food
Bank can learn how to eat healthy on a budget, and can take after-school healthy
cooking classes in English, Spanish, and Chinese. Another important resource is the
“garden-based education” program offered by the University of California Extension
of Alameda County. This program provides technical assistance and training to
teachers and community members interested in building gardens on school
grounds.
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FACILITIES
There are 15 medical facilities within a 10-mile radius of Newark, serving health
needs ranging from preventative to emergency care, with clients ranging from chil-
dren to veterans. The hospitals and clinics in the Newark area are listed in Table
HW-4.
Within the City of Newark there are three medical facilities: Newark Health Center,
Washington Hospital Clinic, and Doctors Express Newark. Larger medical facilities
are located about 4 miles away in Fremont. These facilities include Kaiser Perma-
nente Medical Center-Fremont, and Washington Hospital, both of which are large,
full-service hospitals with emergency and trauma care units. In Union City, roughly
10 miles away, there are additional medical facilities, including the Tiburcio Vasquez
Health Center, which serves people at all income levels in Spanish and English.
PERSONAL SAFETY
Part of creating a healthy community is creating a safe community. This requires
more than simply maintaining a police force and effective law enforcement services,
it also requires designing the city to reduce the potential for crime. The term “Crime
Prevention Through Environmental Design” (CPTED) has been coined to describe
the ways cities can become safer through good urban design.

CPTED is based on four key strategies:
       Natural surveillance, or making places highly visible and reducing hiding plac-
        es or sheltered areas for illicit activities.
       Territorial reinforcement, or creating clear boundaries and a sense of owner-
        ship and stewardship of common space.
       Access control, which is directing movement (along lighted pathways, etc.).
       Maintenance, which conveys the message that residents care about a space
        and are committed to its upkeep.
These strategies can be used in tandem to create public spaces that deter criminal
activity and anti-social behavior such as graffiti and vandalism. The City of Newark
uses the development review process to ensure that new development is designed
to reflect security considerations, along with provisions for emergency vehicle access.
Involvement of local police and fire personnel in development review is critical to
ensure that new neighborhoods and infill development are designed with safety in
mind.
MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL CAPITAL
In 2000, the Center for Disease Control reported that 5 percent of Americans suf-
fered from occasional or chronic depression. The rate in Alameda County was high-
er, at approximately 9 percent. While depression is a physiological condition, it can
be exacerbated by factors such as stress, lack of exercise, and poor environmental
quality. Such factors can be addressed to some extent through community design.
For instance, providing ample parks and open spaces, places to bike and run, and
public amenities such as gardens and nature preserves can have a positive effect on
mental health. Similarly, creating the opportunity for residents to live near their
place of employment (or work near their homes) reduces the amount of time spent
in traffic, and the associated stress, tension, and loss of family time.
Another measure of community mental well-being is called “social capital.” This
refers to the ability for residents to feel a sense of belonging in their community, and
to have a meaningful connection to the place where they live. Programs like Music
at the Grove, the annual Newark Days birthday celebration, and even community
clean-up and volunteer programs can more fully engage residents in public life. A
side benefit of these initiatives is that they leverage the capacity of Newark residents
                                                                                                                      HW-17

                                  the City itself could not otherwise provide.
                                  An important partner in promoting Newark’s social capital is the faith community.
                                  Another important partner is the non-profit sector, particularly organizations repre-

                                  become engaged in community life. There are also organizations such as the

                                  Center that provide opportunities for residents to help those in need, including the
                                  homeless. The City itself also works to promote physical and mental well-being, and
                                  provides safe houses for persons at risk of domestic violence or abuse.

COMMUNITY
SERVICES AND
FACILITIES
                                                                                     11
INTRODUCTION
Community services include education, law enforcement, fire protection, emergency
medical response, senior assistance and childcare, and other administrative services
provided by the City of Newark and other agencies. Community facilities include the
buildings and infrastructure used to deliver these services, including schools, fire
stations, libraries, and municipal buildings. Community facilities also include the
utilities necessary to sustain development, including water, sewer, storm drainage,
waste management, power, and telecommunications. Although State law does not
mandate a specific chapter of the General Plan on these topics, planning for
community services and facilities is integral to planning for the future of Newark.
The City of Newark maintains high standards for its community services. Public
buildings create a sense of place in the city and contribute to Newark’s sense of
community. Maintaining quality public facilities as the city grows will require
coordinated planning between different service providers, investment in new capital
facilities, and an ongoing commitment to maintenance and modernization. The
policies in this Element are intended to facilitate these objectives. The Element
describes Newark’s community services and facilities, reviews identified needs, and
sets goals, policies, and actions for the coming years.
The Community Services and Facilities Element also addresses the need to adapt
local services in response to changing demographics, technology, and resident
preferences. Even in a mature city with slow growth, service needs are constantly
evolving. Newark has become more diverse and its senior population is growing
rapidly. New technologies are reshaping the way services are delivered. Financing
options for capital facilities have become more complex, and fiscal resources
continue to be constrained. The General Plan provides a tool to respond to these
trends by presenting forecasts, identifying long-range development plans and related
capital improvement needs, and establishing policies for managing growth.

                                                         This chapter is organized into five major categories:

                                                         The first part of the chapter profiles each topic area and provides data and forecasts.
                                                         The second part includes goals, policies, and actions. The policies provide specific,
                                                         enforceable directives for those services that are provided by the City of Newark, and
                                                         general guidance for other service providers such as the School District and local
                                                         utilities.
                                                         The location of major community facilities is shown in Figure CSF-1.
                                                         ADMINISTRATIVE AND PUBLIC WORKS FACILITIES
                                                         The principal administrative and public works facilities in Newark are Newark City
                                                         Hall and the Newark Service Center. City Hall is located at 37101 Newark Boulevard.
                                                         It includes the City Council chambers, the Police Department, and the offices of most
                                                         City departments. At the time City Hall opened in 1966, it was the tallest building in
                                                         the East Bay between Oakland and San Jose. The eight-story building features 80-
                                                         foot tall stained glass windows and was designed to serve not only as the center of
                                                         government but as a civic gathering place for Newark.
                                                         Although the building was a state-of-the-art civic center when it opened, some of the
                                                         building systems are now outdated and the space does not fully meet the needs of
                                                         Newark today. Looking to the future, the City will consider options for modernizing
                                                         or replacing City Hall with a facility designed to contemporary standards. As noted in
                                                         the Land Use Element, plans for the Civic Center should consider not only the
                                                         building itself, but the larger area around it, which includes the Library, Civic Center
                                                         Park, and nearby properties along Thornton Avenue.
                                                         The Service Center is located at 37440 Filbert Street. It contains the City’s
                                                         Maintenance Division, which is responsible for the maintenance and repair of all City
                                                         buildings, including recreation centers. The Division is also responsible for
                                                         maintaining City parks, police and fire vehicles, and landscaped medians and rights-

                                                         students. The NUSD operates eight elementary schools (kindergarten through grade
                                                         5), two alternative high schools, one junior high, one comprehensive high school,
                                                         one adult school and one preschool. The location of schools is shown in Figure
                                                         CSF-1. School policy is set by a five-member elected Board of Education, within
                                                         parameters established by the State of California.
                                                         In 2011-2012, there were 630 staff members, making NUSD one of the largest
                                                         employers in the city. More than half of NUSD staff are full-time teachers. The
                                                         student-teacher ratio is 17:1, which is lower than the state average of 21:1, but
                                                         somewhat higher than the national average of 15.5 students per teacher.
                                                         Table CSF-1 shows enrollment levels in Newark’s schools between 2006 and 2013.
                                                         Total enrollment rose slightly between 2007 and 2009 but has been declining since
                                                         then. In 2006-2007, there were 7,067 enrolled students. In 2012-2013, there were
                                                         6,538 enrolled students. Not all schools have experienced the same rate of change,
                                                         however. The number of students has increased at a few of the elementary schools,
                                                         and some schools have seen enrollment decline more rapidly than others.
                                                         Many of the City’s schools were built during the 1960s and 70s when Newark was
                                                         growing rapidly. School enrollment declined through the 1980s and 90s, although
                                                         development continued in parts of the city. As a result, the northern part of Newark
                                                         now has a greater concentration of elementary schools than the southern part and
                                                         there are a few neighborhoods south of NewPark Mall that are more than one-half
                                                         mile from the nearest elementary school. A new elementary school is planned as
                                                         part of the Southwest Newark Residential and Recreational Project (in former
                                                         “Area 3”) to close this gap, while also meeting the demands of new residential
                                                         growth planned for this area.

                                                         Future residential development in Newark will add students, particularly in the
                                                         Dumbarton Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) and Southwest Newark areas. The
                                                         NUSD has developed student generation rates to determine the effect of this growth
                                                         on enrollment and facility needs. In 2012-2013, these rates were 0.416 students per
                                                         single-family home and 0.133 per multi-family home, for a weighted average total of
                                                         0.274 students per unit. The District uses these generation rates to collect impact
                                                         fees which are used for school construction and modernization. In the 2012-2013
                                                         school year, the fees were $3.20 per square foot for residential construction. Lower
                                                         fees are collected for commercial and industrial construction.
                                                         NUSD’s forecasts indicate that with the construction of a new 600-student
                                                         elementary school on Cherry Street just east of Ohlone College (former “Area 3”),
                                                         there will be sufficient capacity to meet projected demand at the elementary school
                                                         level. Elementary school boundary areas may need to be modified over time to
                                                         more evenly distribute available capacity. The junior high school and high school
                                                         already have sufficient capacity to meet the projected needs of new residential
                                                         growth and their service area is citywide.
                                                         Continued investment will be required to modernize schools, improve seismic safety,
                                                         and maintain operational efficiency. Policies later in this chapter provide guidance for
                                                         the City and the School District to work collaboratively to ensure that quality
                                                         educational facilities are provided for all Newark students. The policies also call for
                                                         joint use agreements to improve the synergy between school open space and City
                                                         parks and expand recreational opportunities for Newark residents. The City will also
                                                         continue to work with the School District to address physical planning issues such as
                                                         the safety of students walking to and from school, traffic and parking issues around
                                                         campuses, and compatibility with nearby uses.
                                                         Newark’s public schools also provide non-traditional learning environments,
                                                         including the MacGregor Alternative Education Center. The Center provides an
                                                         option for students who lack the credits to graduate or who seek an independent
                                                         learning environment or life skills training. In addition, the Newark Adult School
                                                         provides continuing education programs, including English as a Second Language,
                                                         high school equivalency exam preparation, and arts-based classes.

POST-SECONDARY SCHOOLS
Newark is part of the Ohlone Community College District. The District serves 18,000
students at its campuses in Newark and Fremont, with the main campus located in
the Mission San Jose district of Fremont. The 130,000-square-foot Newark Campus
opened on Cherry Street in January 2008, with a focus on health sciences and
technology programs. The Campus is a LEED-Platinum building and the building
itself is used by the college as a teaching resource for the environmental sciences.
In 2003, the District adopted a Master Plan for the Newark campus. The Plan was
affirmed in the 2012 District Facilities Master Plan which covers both the Fremont
and Newark campuses. At this time only 27 acres of the 83-acre site have been
developed. The Master Plan calls for eventual development of the southern half of
the property, following soil remediation and future planning studies. More
immediate recommendations for the Newark Campus include provision of additional
parking, development of a photo-voltaic solar array, construction of a maintenance
building, and better pedestrian linkages to adjoining properties.
LIBRARIES
The Newark Library is located at 6300 Civic Terrace Avenue in the Newark Civic
Center. It is a branch of the Alameda County Library system, which serves over
523,000 persons in five cities and the County’s unincorporated areas. The 15,000-
square-foot Newark Library was designed to incorporate special areas for pre-
schoolers, school age children, teens, adults, and older adults. It contains a
community meeting room, a conference room, four small individual study rooms,
and Wi-Fi access. The library contains over 81,000 items, including books,
magazines, newspapers, DVDs, CDs, and books on CD.
Newark’s public library is an important community institution and provides a place
for study, self-improvement, leisure, and life-long learning. It offers educational and
cultural programs for persons of all ages. However, the existing facility is over 30
years old and lacks some of the features found in a modern, state-of-the art library.
The ratio of collection items per capita was 1.88 in FY 2011/12, which was below the
Countywide average of 2.11. A larger building, designed to incorporate current
information and reference technology, would be beneficial to serve Newark’s
growing population and workforce. The City will work with Alameda County and its
non-profit fund-raising partners in the coming years to explore funding options for a
new facility or modernization effort.

                                                         HUMAN SERVICES
                                                         Newark provides an array of human services to its residents, including childcare,
                                                         youth and teen activities, and senior services. These services are supplemented by
                                                         local non-profit and private enterprises. The City coordinates with these enterprises
                                                         to close gaps, eliminate redundancy, and provide funding assistance to maximize
                                                         benefits to Newark residents.
                                                         C HILDCARE
                                                         Childcare programs assist working parents and provide socialization and early
                                                         childhood education for Newark’s youngest residents. The 2010 Census indicated
                                                         that there were 3,142 residents under age 5, and another 2,929 residents between
                                                         ages 5 and 9. Together these groups represent over 14 percent of Newark’s
                                                         population. In many Newark households, both parents are employed, which leads to
                                                         a need for childcare facilities. There are also over 1,000 single parent households
                                                         with one or more children under 18. Affordable childcare provides an important
                                                         benefit to these households and can provide the flexibility needed to find and
                                                         maintain a decent job.
                                                         The City of Newark has operated a full time State-licensed childcare program for over
                                                         20 years. The program operates from the Newark Community Center and serves 3-
                                                         to 5-year-olds. Its curriculum offers individual and group activities, including
                                                         kindergarten preparedness, art, science, computers, music, and playtime. Pre-school
                                                         activities are also provided at the Silliman Recreation Center. In addition, the Newark
                                                         Unified School District operates the June Whiteford Pre-School on the MacGregor
                                                         School campus. The Pre-School enrolls 67 students and has a speech therapist, a
                                                         psychologist, and a district nurse on staff. Other childcare resources include a Head
                                                         Start Center adjacent to Ash Street Park.
                                                         There are also private day care providers in the City. For example, Challenger School
                                                         has a private pre-K program. Newark has a number of Montessori schools and
                                                         several local churches include on-site childcare centers. There are also 17 home-
                                                         based childcare centers, most subject to size limits that are established by State law.
                                                         The City’s zoning regulations allow small family day care centers (typically with fewer
                                                         than 8 children) as a permitted use in residential areas. Large family day care centers
                                                         (typically with 8 to 14 children) are conditionally permitted in most locations.

General Plan policies express Newark’s commitment to maintaining quality, licensed
childcare facilities in the city. This will include a combination of public facilities and
private facilities, meeting the needs of persons of all incomes and backgrounds. The
City also supports the inclusion of childcare centers in new workplaces, and will
continue to provide zoning incentives for incorporating such centers in new
development.

Approximately 5,800 Newark residents are between the ages of 10 and 19. The City
seeks to provide a safe, positive environment for youth which connects them with
peers and adult leaders and promotes personal growth and responsibility. Youth
activities are provided through the Recreation and Community Services Department,
and through partner agencies such as the Newark Unified School District. The
Silliman Center has a Teen Area which includes ping pong and pool tables, games,
recreation equipment, and a social lounge. Programs include SAT Preparation

unit Newark Gardens development is located on Cedar Boulevard in the Four
Corners area. The complex is operated by Satellite Housing, Inc. and its apartments
are reserved for low- and very-low-income residents who are 62 or older. There are
also private assisted living and congregate care facilities serving senior Newark
residents. Additional services are provided through the Tri-City Elder Coalition, an
advocacy group including service providers, faith groups, hospitals, long-term care
facilities, and businesses in Newark, Fremont, and Union City.
There are more than 4,500 Newark residents over age 65 and this number is
expected to increase dramatically in the next two decades. The City has a Senior

                                                         The Newark Police Department (NPD) provides law enforcement services to the City
                                                         of Newark from its headquarters in the Civic Center complex at 37101 Newark
                                                         Boulevard. In 2013, the City had authorized 55 sworn staff, including one Police
                                                         Chief, three Commanders, eight Sergeants, and 43 Police Officers. Additionally, the
                                                         NPD staff includes 21 Non-sworn civilian positions.
                                                         The NPD runs three Divisions: Administrative Services, Field Operations and Support
                                                         Services. The Administrative Services Division is responsible for Records,
                                                         Communications, Detectives, Property and Evidence, Internal Affairs, and Personnel
                                                         and Training. Field Operations is the largest of the three divisions. It includes Patrol,
                                                         K9, Traffic, Animal Control, and Vehicle Abatement. The Support Services Division
                                                         oversees the Special Enforcement Team, School Resource Officer, Southern Alameda

                                                         Negotiation, and Emergency Preparedness.
                                                         City and FBI crime reports indicate that crime rates in Newark are comparable to
                                                         those in most of Southwest Alameda County. In 2010, the FBI reported 4.4 incidents
                                                         of violent crime per 1,000 residents, including murder, rape, robbery, and assault.
                                                         This compared to rates of 4.4 per 1,000 in Union City and San Leandro, 4.5 in
                                                         Hayward, and 2.4 in Fremont. FBI data further indicated 33.9 incidents of property
                                                         crime per 1,000 residents in Newark in 2010, including burglary, larceny, arson, and
                                                         auto theft. This compared to 24.7 per 1,000 in Union City, 21.5 in Fremont, 26.0 in
                                                         Hayward, and 40.0 in San Leandro. In general, property crime trended downward
                                                         between 2004 and 2011, with auto theft showing the greatest decline.
                                                         Crime prevention and response will continue to be an important issue in Newark in
                                                         the future. During General Plan workshops in 2012, residents expressed specific
                                                         concerns about gang activity and graffiti. The NPD has developed community
                                                         policing programs to address these concerns, including Business and Neighborhood

Watch Programs, and School Resource Officers at the High School and Junior High.
The Department also offers a free Citizen Police Academy to teach residents about
day-to-day law enforcement and crime prevention operations.
In 2010, the Police Department developed a Strategic Plan to express the NPD’s core
values and manage the workload over the next five years. The Strategic Plan
addresses the integration of technology into Department activities, improved
communication capacity, and the need for upgrades to Police buildings and the
vehicle fleet. In the long run, the Department anticipates the need for new,
modernized space, which would likely be included as a component of a new City
Hall complex. Relocation of the Police shooting range also will be required, since the
existing site is planned for new uses in the future.
Police Department personnel are involved in the development review process. This
helps ensure that crime prevention and emergency access considerations are
considered in site planning and building design. In addition, new construction is
subject to development impact fees which partially defray the cost of expanding
facilities and acquiring equipment to accommodate increases in population.
FIRE AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES
The Alameda County Fire Department (ACFD) provides fire protection services to
approximately 508 square miles in Alameda County, including Dublin, Newark, San
Leandro, Union City, and the unincorporated areas. ACFD responds to structure fires,
wildland fires, auto fires and extrications, medical emergencies, special rescues, and
natural disasters. The Department also provides public education and disaster
preparedness training. ACFD is organized into three major divisions: Operations,
Administration, and Fire, Life, and Environmental Protection (FLEP).
There are three fire stations serving Newark:
        ACFD Station 27 is located at 39039 Cherry Street. Station 27 was built in
         1981 and is home to a crew of three firefighters that staff one fire engine.
        ACFD Station 28 is located at 7550 Thornton Avenue. Station 28 is Newark’s
         newest and largest fire station. It opened in 2005 and is approximately 13,500
         square feet. This station is maintained by a crew of three firefighters that staff
         a Quint (a piece of fire apparatus that combines the features of a ladder truck
         and a fire engine) and one Battalion Chief.
                                                                                                                                          CSF-11

                                                         The ACFD has allocated nine captains, nine engineers, nine firefighters, one deputy
                                                         fire marshal, and one code compliance officer to the City of Newark. Newark is also
                                                         responsible for a portion of positions that are shared by the Department at-large,
                                                         including fire chief, deputy fire chiefs, division chiefs, battalion chiefs and
                                                         administrative staff. The daily minimum staffing is 3 captains, 3 engineers, and 3
                                                         firefighters. There are also at least 9 paramedics and 18 emergency medical
                                                         technicians assigned to the City of Newark at any given time. This capacity is
                                                         provided by the captains, engineers, and firefighters listed above.
                                                         During the 2010-11 Fiscal Year, the Newark Fire Department responded to 2,952
                                                         calls, of which 2,000 were emergency medical service calls. The Department has
                                                         adopted an average response time goal of five minutes or less for 90 percent of the
                                                         calls for the first responding unit, and 10 minutes or less for 90 percent of the
                                                         remaining units responding to a first alarm assignment.
                                                         ACFD includes a Fire Prevention Branch which reviews building and facility plans.
                                                         Fire Prevention personnel also inspect completed work to ensure that new and
                                                         remodeled buildings and facilities meet State and local fire codes and standards.
                                                         New development is required to meet Fire Code requirements, including those
                                                         related to interior sprinklers, water flow and hydrant requirements, and the design of
                                                         driveways and access points to ensure adequate access for responding vehicles. The
                                                         City collects a Capital Facilities Fee on new development to cover a portion of the
                                                         cost associated with expanding facilities and acquiring new equipment.
                                                         Additional information on emergency preparedness and response may be found in

The District’s primary water sources include the State Water Project (SWP), the San
Francisco Regional Water System (RWS), and local sources. The SWP provides
approximately 40 percent of ACWD’s supply through a statewide water storage and
delivery system that includes 28 reservoirs and 660 miles of aqueducts across
Northern and Central California. The RWS provides approximately 20 percent of the
supply, primarily from the Sierra Nevada via the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct. ACWD has
a 25-year agreement with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission to access
this supply. The remaining 40 percent of the District’s water comes from local
sources, including groundwater from the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin, desalinated
brackish groundwater, and surface water from Del Valle Reservoir.
Prior to delivery, water is treated at four District facilities. There are two water
treatment plants that treat water from the SWP, both located in Fremont. There is
also a desalination facility in Newark that treats brackish water from the aquifer with
reverse osmosis to remove salts and other impurities. In addition, ACWD operates a
blending facility which combines Hetch Hetchy water with local groundwater to
provide a supply with lower hardness values. Treatment and distribution capacity of
the water treatment plants is approximately 89.5 million gallons per day. The treated
water meets or surpasses all state and federal drinking water standards.
Water is distributed to customers throughout the ACWD service area via 12
reservoirs and tanks and 825 miles of pipelines. Systemwide, approximately 70.4
percent of the water consumed was used by residential customers, about 14.1
percent was used by business customers, and about 8.8 percent was used by
industry. Miscellaneous users accounted for the remaining 6.7 percent.
Since 1983, most urban water suppliers in California have been required to prepare
and adopt Urban Water Management Plans (UWMPs). By law, the Plan must include
measures to ensure a sufficient water supply to meet projected growth over a 20-
year period. The Plan must also establish water conservation and efficiency goals.
UWMPs are required to consider potential water sources during dry weather years,
and opportunities for reclaimed water use from wastewater plants to offset growth in
potable water demand. More recently, UWMPs must also include strategies to
reduce per capita water use by 20 percent by 2020, consistent with state legislation
passed in 2009.

                                                         The ACWD updated and adopted its UWMP in 2011 for the period from 2010
                                                         through 2015. At that time, the District’s annual water delivery was approximately
                                                         50,000 acre feet per year (AFY). The UWMP projected that by 2035, demand would
                                                         increase to 72,800 acre-feet-per year (AFY) under normal weather conditions. Total
                                                         projected water capacity by 2035 was projected to be 78,300 acre-feet per year
                                                         (AFY), indicating that there would be sufficient supply to meet demand in normal
                                                         rainfall years.
                                                         The ACWD forecasts indicate that future shortages may be experienced during dry

                                                         up to 10 percent. In such cases, the District would secure additional supplies through
                                                         a California Department of Water Resources (DWR) drought water bank or a similar
                                                         water purchase/transfer program. In a multi-year dry period, the District would
                                                         implement drought contingency plans, which include measures to reduce demand
                                                         by up to 50 percent. Despite these plans, a number of uncertainties affect future
                                                         water supply, including the effects of climate change, limitations related to fishery

                                                         ongoing concerns about the health of the Delta and reliability of the SWP supply.
                                                         ACWD adopted a 25-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) in 2011, building on
                                                         the recommendations of the UWMP and other water-related studies. The CIP

S EWER
The Union Sanitary District (USD) provides wastewater collection, treatment, and
disposal services to residents and businesses in Newark, Fremont, and Union City.
The USD serves an area of approximately 60.2 square miles, with a population of
approximately 331,000. The District is a member of East Bay Dischargers Authority
(EBDA), a Joint Powers Agency, which also includes the cities of Hayward and San
Leandro, and the Oro Loma and Castro Valley Sanitary Districts. EBDA was formed to
collectively manage wastewater treatment and disposal from these five agencies.
The USD owns and maintains over 783 miles of sanitary sewer pipelines, four lift
stations, three major pump stations, and 13 miles of dual force mains that transport
wastewater to the Alvarado Wastewater Treatment Plant (AWWTP) in Union City.
Newark’s wastewater is collected and conveyed by gravity sewers to the Newark
Pump Station and is then pumped to the AWWTP. Once wastewater is treated at the
plant, it is transported to EBDA’s system for final dechlorination and is then
discharged to San Francisco Bay via an outfall pipe in San Leandro.
The USD completed an $11 million expansion project at the Newark Pump Station in
2010, which will accommodate increases in flow rates for the foreseeable future.
Long-term plans call for a wastewater detention facility adjacent to the Pump Station.
The USD is also planning to eventually add a third force main between the Pump
Station and the treatment plant.
The treatment plant itself has the permitted capacity to treat an average dry weather
flow of up to 33 MGD. It is currently treating 24 MGD. The discharge permit allows
the limit to be increased to 38 MGD upon the development of planned new
facilities, completion of an Effluent Characterization Study and Report, and approval
by the Executive Officer.
Wastewater discharges are governed by a number of clean water regulations,
including the federal Clean Water Act and the National Pollutant Discharge
                                                                                                                                      CSF-15

                                                         which set discharge requirements for commercial and industrial customers.
                                                         The Sanitary District has prepared a Master Plan for the Newark Basin which includes
                                                         20-year demand projections and a capital improvement program for the central part
                                                         of its service area, including Newark. Based on the growth projected by this General

                                                         (ACFC). ACFC is responsible for planning, constructing, and maintaining flood
                                                         control channels and culverts, while the Public Works Department is responsible for

       north of Moores Avenue and passes under Birch and Cherry Streets before
       running parallel to Smith Avenue.
      The F Line is an open channel that passes under Cedar Boulevard north of
       Central Avenue, turns north after crossing under Newark Boulevard, and then
       follows the railroad tracks, widening into Plummer Creek. This line was
       expanded in 2008 to increase its capacity.
      The I Line enters the city as an underground culvert near Thornton and I-880
       and becomes an open channel west of Cherry Street near Mayhews Landing
       Road. It becomes the Newark Slough as it approaches the bay.
      The H Line drains the Lake and Rosemont areas and emerges as an open
       channel west of Haley Street. It passes beneath Spruce Street before entering
       marshland on the east side of Thornton Avenue near Jarvis.
ACFC manages two pumping stations which discharge stormwater into the Bay
during high tides. The J-2 pumping station has a capacity of 107,712 gallons per
minute (GPM) and the J-3 pumping station has a capacity of 45,920 GPM. A holding
pond provides additional flood control by receiving overflow water from Alameda
Creek. Natural creeks, including Crandall, Dry, and Plummer Creeks and Newark and
Mowry Sloughs, are also an important part of the drainage system.
Improvements to Lines H and D have been included in ACFC’s capital improvement
program and are scheduled for construction in 2016 or 2017. In addition, ACFC is
planning to complete a Drainage Master Plan Study in 2014, which may result in
additional capital projects. The capital projects are intended to address existing
deficiencies and accommodate the needs of future development. ACFC is currently
developing a Hydrology and Hydraulics Manual to provide flood control guidance for
new development.
New development is subject to regulations and standards which ensure that
drainage needs are met. This includes requirements for stormwater management
plans and stormwater pollution prevention plans. It also includes compliance with
best management practices to reduce construction impacts and control soil erosion
and sedimentation. Newark is covered by a Municipal Regional Stormwater NPDES
permit issued in 2009 that requires stormwater controls, along with street sweeping
programs, storm drain cleanouts, and other activities to reduce polluted runoff. Local

                                                         is to minimize increases in runoff as development takes place. This provides the dual
                                                         benefit of reducing downstream flooding while minimizing water quality impacts

As noted in the Conservation and Sustainability Element of the General Plan, Newark
is diverting approximately 72 percent of its waste from landfills through recycling,
composting, source reduction, and other measures. The diversion rate has increased
significantly in the past 16 years—it was just 27 percent in 1995.
Non-recyclable waste is transported to the 2,300-acre Altamont Landfill east of
Livermore for disposal. The landfill currently receives about 7,000 tons of waste per
day and is permitted to receive up to 11,150 tons per day. About 2 percent of the
waste stream entering the landfill originates in Newark. The Altamont Landfill had
54.7 million cubic yards of capacity remaining in 2008. Based on remaining capacity
and projected volumes, the landfill operators estimate its closure date to be 2040.
Continued efforts will be made to divert solid waste from landfills in the future.
Alameda County and its 14 cities have set a waste diversion target of 75 percent and
will implement additional programs to reach this goal. Construction and demolition
debris recycling is already required, and expansion of green waste programs and
commercial recycling programs is underway.
The Conservation and Sustainability Element may be consulted for additional
information on solid waste management and recycling.
E NERGY AND T ELECOMMUNICATIONS
Newark receives natural gas and electricity from Pacific Gas and Electric Company
(PG&E). PG&E has a service area of 70,000 square miles in Northern California and
serves over 15 million people. Natural gas is provided through a network of
underground pipelines and distribution mains originating from sources across North
America. Electricity is generated by natural gas, nuclear energy, hydroelectricity, coal,
and renewable sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal energy. Power is also
purchased from independent producers and out of state suppliers. Because electric
power generation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, a number of
initiatives are underway to increase the share of energy generated from renewable
sources.
A grid of high voltage transmission lines is used to transport power around the state.
Power is stepped down to lower voltages at substations in Fremont and Union City
and is fed into a distribution system serving neighborhoods and business districts
across the area. The City of Newark works with PG&E to coordinate the provision of
                                                                                                                                        CSF-19
