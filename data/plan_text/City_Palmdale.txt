INTRODUCTION
A.      Overview of the City of Palmdale
1.      Location and Regional Setting
The City of Palmdale is located in the High Desert region of Los Angeles County,
approximately 60 freeway miles north of downtown Los Angeles (see Exhibit I-1).
Palmdale is one of two incorporated cities and several unincorporated communities
within the Antelope Valley. The City is bordered by the City of Lancaster and
unincorporated community of Quartz Hill to the north; unincorporated communities of
Lake Los Angeles and Littlerock to the east; the unincorporated community of Acton to
the south; and the unincorporated community of Leona Valley to the west (see Exhibit I-
2).
The City of Palmdale Planning Area encompasses approximately 174 square miles
within a transitional area between the foothills of the San Gabriel and Sierra Pelona
Mountains and the Mojave Desert to the north and east (see Exhibit I-3). As a result,
the Planning Area contains a variety of plant and animal communities, slope conditions,
soil types and other physical characteristics. In general, the Planning Area slopes from
south to north-northeast, with surface flows and subsurface flows trending away from
the foothills to Rosamond Dry Lake. The major watercourses flowing through Palmdale
are Amargosa Creek, Anaverde Creek, Little Rock Wash and Big Rock Wash. While
foothill areas within and adjacent to the City contain significant slopes, a majority of the
Planning Area is relatively flat.
The climate of Palmdale and the Antelope Valley is dominated by the region’s Pacific
high pressure system, which contributes to the area’s hot, dry summers and relatively
mild winters. The climate is characterized by its wide swings in temperature between
day and night. Temperatures in the area average lows and highs of 71°F and 95°F,
respectively, in the summer months and 36°F and 58°F, respectively in the winter
months. Average annual precipitation is eight (8) inches.
                                            I-1                  Adopted by City Council
                                                                                    1/25/93




                                                                             Introduction
Palmdale is sheltered from import of inter-basin pollution by mountain barriers extending
on the north and south. Air quality is generally good; however, the City receives
windborne air pollutants from the greater Los Angeles area via canyons, such as the
Newhall Pass and Soledad Canyon, which lie to the south of the City.
The City of Palmdale is strategically located with respect to the Antelope Valley, San
Joaquin Valley, Owens Valley and the San Fernando Valley/Los Angeles Basin. With
direct access to State Route 14 (Antelope Valley Freeway) and Highway 138, as well as
rail access via the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, Palmdale is readily
accessible to commuters and future commercial or industrial users.
Being the most southerly community in the Antelope Valley, the City of Palmdale enjoys
a locational advantage for homebuyers from the San Fernando Valley, Santa Clarita
Valley, Los Angeles Basin and Venture County. The Planning Area contains
approximately 11 miles of freeway frontage along SR-14. A large portion of this
frontage is undeveloped, giving the City ongoing opportunities to attract quality
development. The Planning Area also contains 17,750 acres which has been
designated as Palmdale Regional Airport, owned by the City of Los Angeles Department
of Airports. More than 12,000 acres of vacant land exist adjacent to the airport site,
allowing the City to attract related commercial/industrial uses. The Planning Area also
contains a variety of housing types, including estate, equestrian, single family and multi-
family residential development.
2.     City and Sphere Boundaries
The City of Palmdale encompasses approximately 95 square miles and has been an
adopted sphere of influence containing approximately 174 square miles. The Planning
Area referred to in the General Plan generally extends east to 120th Street East, south
to the alignment of Avenue W (Angeles National Forest) to the east of SR-14 and
follows an irregular boundary along the Sierra Pelona ridgeline west of SR-14, north to
Avenue M and L, west to 80th Street West south of the Ritter Ridge and 110th Street
West north of Portal Ridge (see Exhibit I-3).
The City of Palmdale was incorporated on August 24, 1962. At incorporation, the City
encompassed a total of 2.1 square miles. Since that time, numerous annexations and
sphere of influence amendments have been approved by the County’s Local Agency
Formation Commission (LAFCO). The most recent sphere of influence amendment
involved approximately 23,000 acres on the southern and western boundary of the City,
including the Ritter Ranch Specific Plan area. There is currently a large annexation
being processed to the southwest of the City (City Ranch) which, if approved, would add
approximately 3 square miles to the City. A number of smaller areas, including ten
“County Islands”, are under consideration for annexation.

                                                                                   1/25/93

Introduction
3.     City Structure and Planning Functions
Palmdale is a “general law” city operating under the council-manager form of
government. Four City Council members are elected at large for four year overlapping
terms. The Mayor is elected at large for a two year term. The City Administrator is
appointed by, and serves at the pleasure of, the City Council.
The Planning Commission is a five member advisory body, appointed by the City
Council for two-year terms. The City’s Planning Department provides support staff to
the Planning Commission, under the direction of the Director of Planning. Development
proposals are reviewed by the Development Advisory Board (DAB), comprised of
representatives of the City’s Planning, Building and Safety, and Public
Works/Engineering Departments, the Los Angeles Fire Department, and the Los
Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
The City of Palmdale currently provides general administrative, recreational, and library
services, and performs most community development and public works functions. Fire
prevention and protection are provided through the Los Angeles County Consolidated
Fire Department. Police, road maintenance, and animal control services are provided
under contract by Los Angeles County. The City is served by the Los Angeles County
Sanitation District, Los Angeles County Waterworks District, Palmdale Water District
and a number of local mutual water companies. These districts function independently
of the City.
4.     Planning Issues
During the last ten years, the City of Palmdale has evolved from a small established
agricultural town to a thriving urbanized city of more than 80,000 residents. With this
growth came the challenges of meeting increasing needs of the City and its residents.
Over the last several years, numerous meetings and public hearings have been
conducted by the City Council, Planning Commission, and Citizen’s Advisory Committee
(CAC). Additionally, a community attitude survey was conducted prior to initiation of the
General Plan process. Through this process the following issues and opportunities
have been identified to be addressed in the General Plan.
Existing Growth Patterns
The City of Palmdale occupies a unique position. It lies at the entrance to the Antelope
Valley, a spectacular location with strong physical assets including hillsides that define
the western, southern, and eastern edges of town and an expansive central core. The

                                                                            Introduction
City has been in a development boom with a potential to be an example to the region in
terms of growth patterns.
The physical expanse of land within the City and its potential for growth within that area
are both an issue and an opportunity for the community. The planning process has
helped shape community goals such as:
        •  Provision of adequate land in various use designations and development of
           policies to promote a stable and diversified economic base;
        •  Buffering of incompatible land uses;
        •  Revitalization of the historic downtown;
        •  Protection of sensitive ecological areas;
        •  Development of a community identity;
        •  Maintenance of a high quality of development;
        •  Provision of adequate infrastructure to support new development;
        •  Preservation of viewsheds and open space.
Issues on growth patterns and community goals are addressed in all the Elements of
the General Plan.
Circulation Patterns
The City’s circulation system has developed around a grid system in which major
arterials are spaced every mile and minor arterials are spaced at half-mile intervals
between the major arterials. This pattern provides a solid foundation for serving the
community’s mobility needs. Palmdale has the opportunity to develop a master
circulation system before new development takes place. By establishing ultimate rights-
of-way today, the problems associated with inadequate roads to meet future traffic
demands can be mitigated.
The majority of arterial street segments currently operate at LOS C or better, indicating
good traffic flow. However, substantial growth in all sectors of the community has
created concerns among residents regarding the adequacy of the street system to
accommodate future traffic volumes. These concerns will be addressed through
development of the roadway network proposed in the Circulation Element. Components
of this network are in place in the developed portions of the City; as the City continues
to develop, the arterial roadway network will be expanded to those areas currently
vacant. However, due to land use and topographic constraints, there are several
arterials which will not be continuous, even at buildout of the General Plan, because
they are interrupted by USAF Plant 42, the proposed regional airport, or steep terrain.
                                             I-7               Adopted by City Council
                                                                                   1/25/93

Introduction
This discontinuous street pattern may contribute to connectivity problems, making the
circulation network less efficient.
As with many agricultural communities, Palmdale’s growth occurred adjacent to the
railroad and highways that carried livestock and agricultural products to distant markets.
The Southern Pacific Railroad, Sierra Highway, and Pearblossom Highway, running at
grade through the Planning Area, served that function. Although these major
transportation links offer excellent opportunities to increase local commerce, their
present design contributes to localized congestion. As development occurs, congestion
at railroad crossings will likely increase. In addition, congestion on Palmdale Boulevard
will increase until Caltrans’ plan to reroute Highway 138 up to the vicinity of Avenue P-8
is implemented.
The City of Los Angeles Department of Airports is planning to develop Palmdale
Regional Airport on 17,750 acres in the northeastern section of the Planning Area.
When fully operational, the airport will handle up to 12 million air passengers annually.
The airport will become a major employment base and will attract commercial and
industrial uses and support services to the area. To accommodate future traffic around
the facility, an east/west freeway linking the Airport to the Antelope Valley Freeway will
be needed.
These issues are addressed in the Circulation Element of the General Plan.
Housing Opportunities
Rapid growth in the Antelope Valley has changed the composition of the City’s
population and housing stock. Affordable land has made Palmdale attractive to
residential developers, who have constructed thousands of single family residences in
the past few years. This extensive amount of affordable housing, providing a range of
residential options and locations, has lured many former residents of the Los Angeles
area to the Antelope Valley. Although single family residential housing opportunities
abound locally, there are other housing issues that the City must address. These
issues include:
        •   Provision of a wide range of housing types;
        •   Provision of low to moderate-income housing;
        •   Buffering of residential areas from incompatible uses;
        •   Rehabilitation of older housing stock; and
        •   Provision of adequate infrastructure to support residential uses.
Housing issues are addressed in the Housing Element of the General Plan.

                                                                               Introduction
Availability of Public Services and Utilities
Development and population increases have placed new demands on service providers,
including the City, resulting in increased demands for new infrastructure, schools, parks,
fire, and other related facilities. While the City and other agencies have worked to
improve facilities and services to meet present and future needs, the General Plan will
provide an action program to achieve this goal.
Rapid growth in the Planning Area has substantially increased the demand for water,
which has been obtained from groundwater pumping and delivery of imported water
from the State Water Project’s California Aqueduct. Reliance on groundwater, even
when supplemented by imported water, has caused overdrafting of the aquifer. This
overdraft condition will continue to worsen in the future unless imported water is used to
fill the gap between the safe yield from the aquifer and the local demand for water.
Without assurance of adequate water resources, the City may not be able to maintain
the rate of development experienced during the past decade. The continued availability
of water to meet the demands of a growing population is an issue that must be
addressed.
The contamination of groundwater from septic tanks, solid waste, and hazardous
materials also raises a concern for public health and safety. Not all areas are served by
a sewer system. Reliance on septic systems to dispose of sewage may pose potential
health problems. Treatment plant capacities should keep pace with the growth and
development of the area as the amount of sewage generation increases proportionately
with population.
Floodplains are associated with drainage channels which cross the Planning Area.
They include Little Rock Wash, Big Rock Wash, Amargosa Creek and Anaverde Creek.
While creek channelization will control flood hazards, it decreases recharge of the
aquifers and disturbs sensitive habitats. The use of drainage swales and compatible
land uses around flood hazard areas could have less adverse impacts on the
environment.
The lack of a storm drainage system has caused intermittent street flooding in certain
areas of the City. Impermeable soils in hillside areas and increases in storm runoff
within developed areas add to flooding in low-lying areas. Implementation of the City
Drainage Master Plan is expected to mitigate flooding impacts within the City and
downstream.
Present developments have occurred far from existing infrastructure and public
services, resulting in the underutilization of existing utilities and services in developed
                                              I-9                  Adopted by City Council

Introduction
areas and the costly extension of new infrastructure in outlying areas. Overlapping of
service areas has also raised service costs and made coordination difficult.
These issues are addressed in the Land Use and Public Services Elements of the
General Plan.
Preservation of Quality of Life
The character of the Planning Area is defined by its location. The high desert climate,
vegetation and wildlife, nearby mountains, abundant land, and affordable housing have
drawn residents to the City of Palmdale. With so much open space, the City has the
opportunity to plan a cohesive community, preserve scenic views, and maintain air
quality. Uncontrolled development could eliminate these qualities and deprive the City
of these resources.
Many residents moved to the community to enjoy the less congested atmosphere of the
Antelope Valley. Many take pleasure in the keeping of horses and other livestock. The
recent construction of new housing tracts has rapidly changed the appearance and
function of Palmdale from a rural community to an urban center. Therefore, the balance
between rural and urban lifestyle needs to be considered in the policies and programs
of the General Plan.
The prevalence of vacant land allows for the future preservation and conservation of
open space within the City. Significant open space areas and parkland must be
preserved from premature development and urbanization. The rational management of
natural resources and preservation of quality of like should recognize and retain the
following significant resources:
       •   Hillside areas and viewsheds;
       •   Agricultural land;
       •   Sand and gravel resources;
       •   Sensitive ecological areas;
       •   Endangered plant and animal species.
Open space and resource conservation are addressed in the Land Use and
Environmental Resources Elements of the General Plan.
Safety
The General Plan acknowledges a number of natural and man-made hazards which
constrain development. To minimize these hazards, public safety will be promoted
through educated land use decisions in order to avoid loss of life or major property

damage. Emergency preparedness programs and procedures have been established
and will continue to be updated and implemented, to ensure adequate response in case
of a threat to public safety. Significant hazards which are addressed in this General
Plan are described below.
        •   The San Andreas Fault zone traverses the southwest portion of the Planning
            Area. Geologic hazards associated with seismic activity will be reduced by
            application of setbacks and building construction standards.
        •   Flooding associated with the natural drainage courses in the Planning Area,
            and geologic hazards associated with soil conditions or topography, present
            planning and structural considerations for development which are addressed
            in various policies.
        •   Aircraft crash zones associated with the USAF Plant 42 and the proposed
            regional airport are delineated and adjacent land uses regulated to minimize
            public safety hazards.
        •   Further development of United States Air Force (USAF) Plant 42 and other
            industrial uses will increase the potential for the use and handling of
            hazardous materials, and consequently, the accidental release of these
            materials. Appropriate policies are established to respond to these concerns.
        •   The increase in population brings with it an increase in criminal activity. The
            security of neighborhoods has become a priority of many residents.
These issues are addressed in the Land Use and Safety Elements of the General Plan.
Noise
The USAF Plant 42 is a major employment base in the Planning Area. At the same
time, it is a source of aircraft noise. The Southern Pacific Railroad, the Antelope Valley
Freeway, and several major arterial roadways also serve as major transportation
corridors which generate noise impacts. Measures should be taken to reduce noise at
their sources or to protect sensitive uses from noise impacts. This issue is addressed in
the Land Use and Noise Elements of the General Plan.
Future Growth
With approximately 79 percent of the Planning Area vacant, buildout of the City could
completely change the character of the community. In order to ensure that new
development is an asset, the General Plan must address the issues of balanced growth,

                                                                                    1/25/93

Introduction
adequate infrastructure and public services, development standards, economic stability,
and the preservation of scenic qualities and open space.
Rapid development in the past few years was influenced by the favorable economic
climate. The effects of urbanization on physical, social, and economic resources of the
City must be carefully evaluated, and development paced to avoid boom and bust
cycles.
These concerns are addressed in all Elements of the General Plan.
Economic Development
Palmdale’s economic base has historically been tied to the aerospace industry.
Fluctuations in the world political landscape, economy and federal program funding
have affected the aerospace industry throughout the country and particularly Southern
California. At present, approximately 34 percent of residents of the City commute to
jobs outside the Antelope Valley. A majority of these persons are employed within the
San Fernando Valley or the Los Angeles Basin.
While increased development has led to a dramatic increase in retail sales and jobs
within this sector, service and industrial sector jobs have not been as readily created.
Constraints to the expansion of employment-generating development include the lack of
infrastructure and perceived limitations in inter- and intra-state access. The City of
Palmdale must coordinate efforts to provide infrastructure, ensuring that new
development continued to provide infrastructure to support itself without burdening
existing residents. Continued efforts by the City through the economic development
process and implementation of the General Plan will be necessary to continue
expansion of the local economy.
These issues point to a need for diversification and development of employment
opportunities in the City. Thus, the General Plan addresses:
        •  Designation of land for a diversity of commercial and industrial land uses to
           improve the jobs/housing balance and create a more stable economic base.
        •  Enhancement of the downtown area.
This issue is further addressed in the Land Use Element of the General Plan.

                                                                            Introduction
B.      Overview of the General Plan
1.      Purpose of the General Plan
The General Plan for the City of Palmdale has been prepared pursuant to California
Code Section 65300, which requires that each city and county within the state “adopt a
comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of the county or
city, and of any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency’s judgment
bears relation to its planning”.
The General Plan serves as a foundation in making land use decisions based on goals
and policies related to land use, transportation routes, population growth and
distribution, development, open space, resource preservation and utilization, air and
water quality, noise impacts, safety issues and other related physical, social and
economic development factors. In addition to serving as a basis for local decision
making, the General Plan established a clear set of development rules for citizens,
developers, decision makers, neighboring cities and counties, and provides the
community with an opportunity to participate in the planning and decision making
process.
The purpose of this General Plan is to comply with state requirements, and to provide
the City with a comprehensive, long-range policy guideline for future development.
2.      Scope of the General Plan
In accordance with California Government Code Section 65302, the General Plan must
contain discussion in the following areas: a) land use; b) circulation; c) housing; d)
conservation; e) open space; f) noise; and g) safety. This General Plan contains
elements addressing these areas, as well as a Public Service Element. In the future, it
is the City’s intent to adopt elements for Community Design and Parks, Recreation and
Trails. The issues of conservation and open space have been combined in the City’s
Environmental Resources Element. Each of the elements contain diagrams and text
setting forth goals, policies, actions and implementation measures for long-range
physical development within the City’s incorporated boundaries and sphere of influence
areas.
Development within the incorporated boundaries of the City will be directly guided by the
goals and policies contained in the General Plan. As specified in Government Code
Section 65300, the General Plan must also address “any land outside its boundaries
which….bears relation to its planning”. Therefore, the General Plan has considered all
land within the City’s adopted sphere of influence, as well as a three (3) square mile
area bisected by Godde Hill Road (see Exhibit I-3). The General Plan functions as a
                                            I-13               Adopted by City Council
                                                                                 1/25/93

Introduction
means of formally communicating with the City’s concerns and issues are in regards to
development proposals, master planning of infrastructure, pre-zoning sphere areas prior
to annexation, preservation of open space and resource conservation lands, and other
related planning issues which may impact the orderly growth of the City.
In developing goals and policies for the City’s General Plan, regional issues pertaining
to transportation, housing, open space, infrastructure, coordination of emergency
services, and other physical, social and economic concerns were considered.
3.      Development of the General Plan
The City’s General Plan has evolved from numerous studies and public hearings
involving a Citizen Advisory Committee, the Planning Commission and the City Council.
All issues and concerns identified during the public hearing process were evaluated and
addressed. This input provided valuable assistance to staff and consultants in refining
the document.
4.      Citizen Input
California Government Code Section 65351 states that during preparation of the
General Plan “…opportunities for the involvement of citizens…and other community
groups” be provided “through public hearings and any other means the city…deems
appropriate”.
In accordance with state law and the recognition of the importance and value of citizen
involvement, the City has created numerous opportunities for citizen participation
throughout the General Plan development process.
As noted above, a 21-member Citizen Advisory Committee was established to review
the General Plan Elements. The CAC met regularly from 1988 to 1989. Community
ideas were exchanged and concerns and issues were identified and addressed during a
number of advertised public meetings. Meeting dates, times and locations were
published in the Antelope Valley Press, and notices were posted in three public areas in
the City.
Between 1990 and 1991, the Planning Commission held 23 public meetings on the
General Plan. In 1991, the planning process was interrupted due to the City’s attention
to other development issues, but public meetings before the Planning Commission
resumed in March 1992. Earlier drafts of the General Plan maps and text were revised
to address existing conditions in 1992, and the traffic model was run again based on
revised land use assumptions. Between March and October, 1992 the Planning
Commission held a total of 12 public meetings to review the final draft General Plan,
Adopted by City Council                    I-14

                                                                                Introduction
providing the community with an avenue for expressing ideas and concerns relating to
the General Plan. The City Council began its formal review of the General Plan on
November 19, 1992 and concluded a series of 7 hearings on January 25, 1993, on
which date the Council certified the EIR and adopted the General Plan.
5.       Adoption of the General Plan
On January 25, 1993, the City Council of the City of Palmdale adopted Resolution No.
93-10, certifying the Environmental Impact Report and approving the General Plan.
6.       Consistency of General Plan Elements
The General Plan has been prepared in accordance with California Government Code
Section 65300.5, which specifies that the “General Plan and elements…comprise an
integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies”. Consistency
among the Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Environmental Resources, Safety, Noise,
and Public Service Elements of the General Plan is reflected in the goals, policies,
actions, implementation programs and maps contained therein.
7.       Consistency with Zoning
Current zoning within the City may not be in conformance with the objectives, policies,
land uses, and programs specified in the City’s General Plan. Therefore, it is the intent
of the City to prepare a revised zoning map and Zoning Ordinance for the City of
Palmdale, which will be consistent with the General Plan’s goals and policies.
8.       Amending the General Plan
It is the intent of this General Plan to provide a flexible planning tool for the community
to utilize in achieving its long-term goals. The General Plan must respond to changing
community needs, values, and environmental conditions to ensure continued
effectiveness of the plan. Monitoring of the Plan will be accomplished through annual
reviews that will help in determining when revisions are necessary. State law permits
up to four amendments a year; however, major updates to the plan will be undertaken
every five to seven years to reflect new conditions, local attitudes and policy changes.
9.       Implementing the General Plan
As specified in each of the following elements, implementation of the General Plan will
occur in many forms. Through formulation and adoption of land use policies and
regulations such as the City Zoning Ordinance, through the development review
process conducted by the Development Advisory Board and the Planning Commission,
                                            I-15                  Adopted by City Council
                                                                                     1/25/93

Introduction
through adoption of ordinances, specific plans, financing programs, enforcement
actions, and other means, the City will implement the goals and policies contained in the
Plan. In order to ensure implementation and provide a measure of compliance with the
Plan’s directives, each element outlines specific actions to be completed by the City.
When the General Plan is updated—at five to seven year intervals—it is intended that
these actions be reviewed to ascertain the City’s success in meeting General Plan
goals.

                                                                                 Land Use
SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element of the General Plan contains the City's blueprint for long-range
growth and development. The goals, objectives and policies contained within this
element address the significant issues facing the community through a variety of land
use planning strategies. The quality and quantity of future residential, commercial,
industrial development and public facilities are addressed, along with mineral resources,
economic development and open space issues. The goals, objectives and policies of
each of the other elements of the General Plan have been integrated here to the extent
that they affect land use.
The Land Use Element addresses the rapid growth and resulting development patterns
which have occurred in Palmdale, and establishes a framework for focusing future
growth in a logical manner. The distribution of land uses by type and intensity is
addressed. The Land Use Element also identifies existing and potential development
opportunities and constraints. Special land use planning issues for Palmdale which are
addressed in this Element include the existence of the Air Force Plant 42 flight test
facility within the Planning Area and its ongoing importance as an employment center,
plans for a new regional airport, regionally significant sand and gravel resources and the
presence of the San Andreas fault system within the Planning Area.
Specifically, the Land Use Element serves the following purposes:
         1.     The Land Use Element informs the public of the City's land use goals,
                objectives, and policies for long term development. It serves as a
                foundation for private, as well as public decision making.
         2.     The Land Use Element serves as a guide for the day-to-day operational
                decisions of City staff. It sets forth policies for dealing with land use
                issues and responding to opportunities for growth and development.
         3.     The Land Use Element establishes land use classifications for land within
                the City and the standards of density and intensity for each classification.
                It also outlines standards and programs that implement the stated goals.
         4.     As a state-mandated element, it fulfills one of the requirements of the
                State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code Section 65000 et seq.
                                           L-1                     Adopted by City Council
                                                                                   1/25/93
                                                                              Land Use
SECTION 2: GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
GOAL L1: Create a vision for long-term growth and development in the City of
Palmdale which provides for orderly, functional patterns of land uses within
urban areas, a unified and coherent urban form, and a high quality of life for its
residents.
Objective L1.1: Establish a blueprint for the physical form and development of the City.
      Policy L1.1.1: Through adoption of the Land Use Map, direct future growth to
      areas which can accommodate development based upon topography,
      environmental factors, availability of infrastructure, and/or comprehensive
      planning. These areas include the following:
      1.      Vacant land within urbanized areas (infill lots), where backbone
              infrastructure is available or planned for;
      2.      Areas governed by adopted Specific Plans;
      3.      Areas in which infrastructure master planning has occurred.
      Policy L1.1.2: Provide incentives to promote infill development, in order to foster
      more cohesive neighborhoods, maximize use of infrastructure, consolidate
      development patterns and enhance community appearance.
      Policy L1.1.3: Respond to the rapidly changing needs of the City by reviewing
      the General Plan every five to seven years, and updating each Element as
      needed.
      Policy L1.1.4: In considering requests to amend the Land Use Map, discourage
      proposals for development requiring urban services in those areas which are
      functionally separated from developed portions of the City by lack of
      infrastructure, expanses of vacant land, significant topographic or jurisdictional
      barriers, or other similar constraints.
Objective L1.2: Implement annexation policies that promote logical and orderly
boundaries, respond to community concerns, and minimize fiscal impacts to the City.
      Policy L1.2.1: Focus planning efforts within the present sphere of influence
      during the planning period.
                                          L-2                 Adopted by City Council
                                                                                 1/25/93
Land Use
      Policy L1.2.2: Seek to negotiate equitable property tax transfers with the County
      of Los Angeles for areas proposed for annexation, to ensure cost recovery to the
      City for increased municipal services to these areas.
      Policy L1.2.3:         Consider the provisions of adopted Memorandums of
      Understanding in establishing land use regulations for areas to be annexed.
      Policy L1.2.4: Encourage Los Angeles County to apply City of Palmdale land
      use policies and standards to development proposals within the City's sphere of
      influence.
      Policy L1.2.5: Evaluate future annexations to consider the following criteria:
      1.     No annexation should occur unless:
             a)       An equitable property tax transfer can be negotiated with the
                      County to ensure cost recovery to the City for providing municipal
                      services to these areas; or
             b)       The area to be annexed would provide benefits including but not
                      limited to employment opportunities, increased jobs-housing
                      balance, recreational amenities or other elements having a citywide
                      benefit which outweigh the potential long term fiscal costs; or
             c)       Sales tax or other revenue sources resulting from annexation will
                      adequately offset service costs to the City, as determined by the
                      City Council.
      2.     Evaluation of annexation proposals should fully consider all costs,
             including capital facilities, maintenance and administration costs,
             associated with each proposal. These costs may include but are not
             limited to upgrading, retrofitting and maintenance of infrastructure
             facilities, including but not limited to sewer, water, streets, street lighting
             and storm drainage; code enforcement; housing rehabilitation needs;
             provision of social and recreational programs; law enforcement, fire
             protection and emergency services; and City administration.
      3.     No annexation of largely undeveloped areas should occur unless
             adequate master planning of infrastructure has been completed to the
             satisfaction of the City.
Adopted by City Council                  L-3
1/25/93
                                                                                Land Use
       4.      The annexation of land to the City shall represent a logical expansion of
               City boundaries and provide for a planned, orderly and efficient pattern of
               urban development. Annexation requests shall not be approved where
               the City Council finds that such expansion of the City’s boundary may be
               detrimental to the value and development potential of property within the
               existing municipal boundaries.
       5.      A primary function of the City of Palmdale is to provide municipal services
               to support urban development. Therefore, future annexations should
               focus on those areas which are planned for and represent a logical
               extension of urban services and development. Servicing of non-urban
               areas should remain a function of the County.
       6.      The City should focus annexation efforts on "County islands" and other
               areas which are infill in nature, where affected residents and property
               owners are generally supportive of such annexation efforts, and should
               give priority to annexing these islands over further expansion into outlying
               areas.
       7.      Annexation of any area which is within the boundaries of an adopted
               community standards district shall consider and respect the provisions of
               such standards in any future land use approvals.
Objective L1.3: Ensure compatibility between land uses which have different functions,
requirements and impacts.
       Policy L1.3.1: On the Land Use Map, designate land uses in consideration of
       topography, environmental constraints, availability of infrastructure, and intensity
       of adjacent uses.
       Policy L1.3.2:        Adopt standards for transition areas between potentially
       incompatible uses.
       Policy L1.3.3: Through the development review process, evaluate proposals
       with respect to their impacts on adjacent properties, including their impacts on
       existing uses of those properties, and require that project designs employ
       appropriate techniques to increase compatibility between uses.
Objective L1.4: Adopt land use policies which minimize exposure of residents to
natural hazards, protect natural resources, and utilize land with limited development
potential for open space and recreational uses where feasible.
                                          L-4                    Adopted by City Council
                                                                                   1/25/93

Land Use
      Policy L1.4.1: Establish the following transitional standards between Mineral
      Resource Extraction designations and less intensive uses, in order to protect
      residents from noise and dust while preserving the availability of mineral
      resources:
      1.       Where feasible, encourage a transition of uses between quarry operations
               and less intensive uses.
      2.       Separate residential neighborhoods from mineral extraction zones by
               public streets, setbacks, berms, landscaping, green belts, trail systems, or
               other similar buffers or combinations thereof.
      3.       When land designated for less intensive uses abuts mineral extraction
               areas, the responsibility for providing adequate buffers should be borne
               equitably by both quarry operators and adjacent developers, where
               feasible based upon existing conditions and existing approvals.
      Policy L1.4.2: Establish the following standards in and adjacent to Alquist-Priolo
      Earthquake Fault zones and other active fault zones as determined based on
      geotechnical analysis, in order to protect residents, property and infrastructure
      systems from damage by seismic activity: (General Plan Amendment 96-4, adopted by City
      Council April 9, 1997. General Plan Amendment 98-3, adopted by City Council June 10, 1998.)
      1.       Restrict development of habitable structures in these zones in accordance
               with requirements of State law.
      2.       Establish a maximum permitted density for all residentially-designated
               land between the outer boundaries of the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault
               Zone of three (3) dwelling units per acre (gross) within the project site,
               except where the Land Use Map indicates lower densities in these areas.
               This policy specifically excludes any non-residential land uses within the
               project site from the calculation of density. (General Plan Amendment 96-4, adopted
               by City Council April 9, 1997. General Plan Amendment 98-3, adopted by City Council June 10,
               1998.)
      3.       Require placement of roads, utilities and other infrastructure to be located
               outside of active fault zones, where feasible.
      4.       Establish a maximum floor area ratio (FAR) of .5 for new non-residential
               development within Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zones. (General Plan
               Amendment 98-3, adopted by City Council June 10, 1998.)
Adopted by City Council                        L-5
1/25/93
                                                                                Land Use
       Policy L1.4.3:     Establish the following standards for development in hillside
       areas:
       1.     Development in hillside areas should minimize grading, conform to natural
              topography, preserve ridgelines and exhibit sensitivity to natural
              landforms.
       2.     Development should be restricted on natural slopes of fifty percent and
              greater.
       3.     Visually prominent ridges and hillsides should be retained in a natural
              condition.
       4.     Flexibility in land use regulations may be permitted when it can be
              demonstrated that such flexibility will meet hillside management
              objectives.
       Policy L1.4.4: Establish the following land use policies adjacent to airport uses:
       1.     On the Land Use Plan, designate uses adjacent to airport uses which

GOAL L3: Provide a high quality of life for all existing and future residents,
meeting the needs of a variety of lifestyles.
Objective L3.1: Provide for the distribution of residential densities and housing types to
meet the varied lifestyles and needs of existing and future City residents.
      Policy L3.1.1: On the Land Use Map, establish residential land use designations
      for a range of residential densities as follows:
      1.      Equestrian Residential: The Equestrian Residential (ER) designation is
              intended for single family residential uses at a maximum gross density of
              .40 du/ac (1 unit per 2½ acres), yielding an estimated population of 800
              persons per square mile. Equestrian and related animal keeping activities
              are permitted within this designation. The character of areas within this
              designation will be rural in nature with parcel sizes of 2½ acres or larger.
              Clustering to preserve significant natural landforms is feasible, although
              where this designation is located in established rural neighborhoods on
              level terrain, clustering may not be acceptable. Full urban services such
              as community water and sewer may not be available to these areas, and
              public improvements may be constructed to rural standards where
Adopted by City Council                       L-9
1/25/93

                                                                      Land Use
   permitted. Densities within this designation may decrease pursuant to
   slope density ratios established in the Hillside Management Ordinance.
   Actual permitted density will be determined through the development
   review process, based on applicable environmental and infrastructural
   conditions.
2. Low Density Residential:            The Low Density Residential (LDR)
   designation is intended for single family residential uses at a maximum
   gross density of 1 dwelling unit per acre with an estimated population of
   1,600 persons per square mile.           The Low Density designation is
   appropriate to hillside areas and as a transition between rural and
   suburban areas. It is generally expected that urban services such as
   community sewer and water will be provided to new development
   proposed within this designation, although rural street and lighting
   standards may be appropriate to some projects. Minimum lot size within
   this designation will generally be one (1) acre or larger, although clustering
   may be permitted to encourage preservation of natural resources and
   steep slopes. Densities within this designation may decrease pursuant to
   the slope density ratios established in the Hillside Management
   Ordinance.      Actual permitted density will be based on applicable
   environmental and infrastructural conditions.
3. Single Family Residential-1 (0-2 du/ac): The Single Family Residential-
   1 (SFR-1) designation is intended for single family residential uses with
   gross densities ranging from 0-2 du/ac and an estimated population of
   3,600 persons per square mile. Net lot sizes will generally be one half
   acre or larger, creating a semi-rural environment with horse/animal
   keeping possible. This designation may be utilized in lower hillside areas
   where inclines are present but topography is lacking significant slope
   constraints. It may also be utilized in outlying valley areas where large lot
   subdivisions are desired.       Full urban services are expected in these
   areas, although larger lot subdivisions may develop with rural street and
   lighting standards as determined by the City.            Clustering may be
   permitted to preserve steep hillsides and significant physical features.
   Densities within this designation may decrease pursuant to slope density
   ratios establishing in the Hillside Management Ordinance.              Actual
   permitted density will be based on site specific environmental and
   infrastructural conditions.
4. Single Family Residential-2 (0-3 du/ac): The Single Family Residential-
   2 (SFR-2) designation is intended for single family residential uses with
   gross densities ranging from 0-3 du/ac and an estimated population of
                             L-10                     Adopted by City Council
                                                                         1/25/93
Land Use
           5,600 persons per square mile. Net lot sizes will generally be 10,000
           square feet or larger, although clustering may be permitted to preserve
           steeper terrain or significant physical features. This designation is
           appropriate in those areas between the valley floor and steeper hillside
           areas (generally having less than ten percent slope). Full urban services
           will be required in new development areas. Densities within this
           designation may decrease pursuant to slope density ratios established in
           the Hillside Management Ordinance. Actual permitted density will be
           based on site specific environmental and infrastructural conditions.
      5.   Single Family Residential-3 (3.1 - 6 du/ac): The Single Family
           Residential-3 (SFR-3) designation is intended for single family residential
           uses with gross densities ranging from 3.1-6 du/ac and an estimated
           population of 9,700 persons per square mile. Subdivisions containing the
           City's standard 7,000 square foot minimum lot size will typically be located
           within this designation. Densities under this designation may decrease
           pursuant to the slope density ratios established in the Hillside
           Management Ordinance. Actual permitted density will be based on site
           specific environmental and physical constraints.
      6.   Medium Residential: The Medium Residential (MR 6.1 to 10.0 du/ac)
           designation is intended for residential uses at maximum gross densities
           ranging from 6.1 to 10 units per acre and an estimated population of
           16,200 persons per square mile. Housing types may include single family
           detached, single family attached, townhouses, condominiums, duplexes,
           triplexes, apartments, or manufactured housing developments. Permitted
           structure types will be as specified in the underlying zone district. For
           single family residential uses within this designation, the minimum
           permitted lot size is 7,000 square feet, unless otherwise specified in an
           approved specific plan or residential planned development offering a
           variety of lot sizes, housing types, and public amenities, a senior housing
           project, or other approved development plan.
           The Medium Residential designation is appropriate within those areas
           having existing or planned residential uses at 6.1 to 10 units per acre,
           which are or will be served by adequate infrastructure and services
           needed to support this level of development. Maximum permitted density
           will be determined through the development review process, based upon
           environmental and infrastructural conditions. Equestrian and large animal
           uses are not intended within this district.

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
The City’s circulation system supports vitality and growth. From the system’s most
basic component, pedestrian walkways, to interstate transit and regional air service, the
transportation network connects City neighborhoods to each other and to the region. If
the network fails and this linkage is interrupted, the local economy and quality of life in
the community may suffer.
Palmdale depends more heavily upon transportation systems for its economic viability
than some communities, because many of its residents must commute to jobs outside
the region, and because the local economy has been based upon the aerospace
industry for many years. Continued growth in Palmdale will be constrained by the ability
of its circulation system to accommodate new development. This Circulation Element is
designed to provide a blueprint for construction and maintenance of a transportation
network which will accommodate growth, support economic development, allow safe
and convenient access, and meet regional transportation goals.
The Element is consistent with State law and with the other Elements in the General
Plan. The road network is based upon projected development permitted by the Land
Use Element. The public transit and trip reduction policies are in conformance with
State, County and regional programs. Policies requiring coordination of circulation
systems with other public infrastructure conform to the Public Services Element, while
others requiring protection of resources relate to the Environmental Resources Element.
Projected noise levels as contained in the Noise Element were based upon models
developed for the Circulation Element, and Safety Element policies have been
incorporated into all aspects of the Circulation Element.
The Element addresses the City’s plans to upgrade and expand its pedestrian
walkways, surface streets, arterial and regional highways, public transportation, rail
service and air service. Recreational trail plans and bikeways are addressed in the
Parks, Recreation and Trails Element.
The following sections contain the City’s goals, objectives and policies for circulation;
implementation programs; and background information identifying opportunities and
constraints to circulation planning within City and the Planning Area.
                                            C-1                 Adopted by City Council
                                                                                 1/25/93

                                                                              Circulation
SECTION 2: GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
GOAL C1: Establish, maintain and enhance a system of streets and highways
which will provide for the safe and efficient movement of people and goods
throughout the Planning Area, while minimizing adverse impacts on the
community.
Objective C1.1: Adopt and implement a street and highway plan designed to meet
existing and future circulation needs.
       Policy C1.1.1: Designate roadways within the Planning Area as local, collector,
       secondary arterial, major arterial and regional arterial streets, as shown on the
       Circulation Plan Map, and adopt standards for right of way and design of these
       streets which will ensure appropriate capacity and performance of each roadway.
       Policy C1.1.2: Cooperate with Caltrans and other affected jurisdictions to
       establish and adopt standards for intra-regional expressways.
       Policy C1.1.3: Develop and maintain a computer traffic model based upon the
       designated network, and assess existing and projected levels of service on
       streets within the network in making land use decisions and formulating the Land
       Use Plan.
       Policy C1.1.4: Periodically monitor levels of service within the existing street
       network to identify deficient street segments and intersections, and develop
       programs to improve service levels where needed.
       Policy C1.1.5: Improve the existing street network based upon the adopted
       Circulation Plan, through implementation of the Capital Improvement Program
       and through requirements placed upon new development approvals.
       Policy C1.1.6: Design the Circulation Plan Map so as to protect existing
       neighborhoods and/or significant environmental resources, wherever feasible.
       Policy C1.1.7: Ensure that right-of-way is reserved wherever possible to
       implement the adopted Circulation Plan.
       Policy C1.1.8: Evaluate all land use decisions to ensure consistency with the
       Circulation Plan.
                                           C-2                 Adopted by City Council
                                                                                  1/25/93
Circulation
      Policy C.1.1.9: Ensure that the cumulative and regional impacts of new
      development on the circulation system are mitigated to the extent feasible,
      concurrent with development. Concurrent shall mean that required facilities are
      installed as needed during various stages of development.
      Policy C1.1.10: Develop and adopt standards regulating where raised medians
      will be required, and where right-of-way and pavement width may be reduced,
      based upon existing and approved development, access control, and circulation
      needs.
Objective C1.2: Maintain and expand the arterial and regional roadway system to
serve existing and future circulation needs.
      Policy C1.2.1: Provide adequate system capacity and efficiency through
      exclusive turn lane additions at arterial intersections and other significant
      locations.
      Policy C1.2.2: Assure safe and efficient arterial operations through careful
      control of access, signal spacing, median placement, and overall street and
      development design.
      Policy C1.2.3: Protect and increase the capacity of arterial streets through the
      following measures:
      1.      No new direct residential driveway access will be permitted onto regional,
              major and secondary arterials or highways, except where no other feasible
              access is available.
      2.      For residential development, full intersections will generally be permitted at
              no less than one-quarter mile spacing along arterial streets. Where it is
              determined by the City Traffic Engineer that community-wide circulation
              will not be negatively impacted, full intersections (non-signalized) may be
              permitted at approximately one-eight mile spacing.
      3.      Except as specified in Policy C1.2.3.b, right turn only access will typically
              be permitted at approximately one-eighth mile spacing in residential
              developments, unless no other feasible access is available. Additional
              right-of-way may be required on arterials for right turn lanes onto local and
              collector streets, and significant private streets or driveways.
      4.      On-street parking will be prohibited on arterial roadways, unless otherwise
              approved by the City Traffic Engineer.
Adopted by City Council                      C-3
1/25/93
                                                                            Circulation
5.      New arterial streets, and extensions of existing arterial streets, will be
        designed so as to eliminate jogs and discontinuities and facilitate regional
        traffic flow.
6.      All secondary, major and regional arterials should be constructed with
        medians.
Policy C1.2.4: Promote development of regional arterial links within the
community where needed to serve existing and future needs, including but not
limited to the following:
1.      Promote development of grade separations at railroad tracks, in particular,
        at Palmdale Boulevard.
2.      Coordinate with Caltrans and other affected agencies to expedite rerouting
        of Highway 138 and widening of State Route 14.
3.      Coordinate with affected agencies and jurisdictions to address the
        potential for establishing a regional north-south transportation corridor
        within the west side of the Antelope Valley.
Policy C1.2.5: In order to maintain the efficiency, effectiveness, and safety of
Pearblossom Highway, a corridor design study shall be conducted. The design
shall incorporate expressway design features to the extent practical. The design
shall include, but not be limited to, features such as the following:
1.      Identification of potential traffic signal locations, with application of the
        maximum practical spacing and limitation of signals to arterial
        intersections.
2.      Where practical, intersections should be grade-separated.
3.      Direct driveway and local or collector street access should be minimized.
        Direct access should be avoided if alternative access is available;
        maximum driveway spacing (generally 400 feet or more spacing between
        driveways) should be utilized; left-turn restrictions shall typically apply and
        right-turn lanes shall be provided; joint access shall be encouraged to
        minimize the number of driveways.
                                       C-4                  Adopted by City Council

Circulation
       4.     Intersection designs should include provision of right-turn lanes and
              double left-turn lanes. Free flow right-turn lanes shall be used at arterial
              intersections to the extent practical.
       5.     Lane widths should be no less than 12 feet and the median should be 30
              feet in width or more where feasible.
       6.     Consideration for pedestrian and non-motorized vehicle safety shall be
              incorporated into the design. Features to be considered may include
              grade separations, setback of facilities from the roadway, and restriction of
              crossings.
       7.     The design shall incorporate aesthetic features and positive advance
              guide signing.
Objective C1.3: Establish a system of local and collector streets which serve
residential neighborhoods while protecting them from intrusion of through traffic flow.
       Policy C1.3.1: Promote development of local street patterns which create and
       unify neighborhoods, rather than divide them, through the following means:
       1.     Local street patterns should provide access between subdivisions within a
              neighborhood, with the exception of through traffic which should be
              directed onto major and secondary arterials.
       2.     The local street system should be logical and understandable for the user.
              Creation of circuitous and confusing travel paths between internal
              neighborhood areas and adjacent arterials should be avoided.
       3.     The street system should be designed to avoid creating local streets which
              will ultimately function as collectors. A local street may be determined to
              function as a collector street when it is or will be used to collect traffic from
              local streets and convey it to an arterial street. This function of collecting
              traffic may be due to the street’s length, alignment, design or the lack of
              other streets which may be used to convey traffic to nearby arterials. In
              general, local streets will be discouraged from extending more than one-
              half mile so as to avoid serving this function.
       4.     Direct residential driveway access onto collectors, or onto local streets
              which function as collectors, is discouraged.

                                                                            Circulation
      5.     Local street design should provide efficient connection to the arterial
             highway system while discouraging excessive speeds and volumes within
             neighborhoods.
      6.     Maximum cul-de-sac length should be 700 feet. “Dog-leg” cul-de-sacs
             with one or more turns between the bulb and the outlet should be avoided.
      7.     To discourage excessive speed and through traffic, street width should not
             exceed that required for the level of use; right-of-way and pavement
             widths on local streets may be reduced when it can be demonstrated that
             such reduction will not negatively impact internal and external circulation.
             Where such reductions are proposed, the City Traffic Engineer shall make
             appropriate recommendations to the Planning Commission during review
             of the tentative map.
Objective C1.4: Adopt policies and standards for street design and construction which
promote safety, convenience and efficiency.
      Policy C1.4.1: Strive to maintain a Level of Service (LOS) C or better to the
      extent practical; in some circumstances, a LOS D may be acceptable for a short
      duration during peak periods.
      Policy C1.4.2: Ensure that approvals of new development are correlated with
      any roadway improvements that would be necessary to maintain the existing
      level of service or LOS C, whichever is less, and other performance
      characteristics applicable to the affected roadways. Development shall not be
      authorized until measures are in place to construct any necessary improvements;
      these measures may include, but not be limited to, payment of traffic impact fees
      or construction of street improvements as required in the conditions of approval.
      Policy C1.4.3: Establish street design standards which provide the capacities
      that are needed to adequately serve the projected travel demand.
      Policy C1.4.4: Promote safe circulation and emergency access, through the
      following means:
      1.     Require a minimum 26-foot wide paved access from an improved public
             street to all developments. Individual single family residences (not
             associated with a tract map) are excluded from this requirement except as
             deemed necessary by the Los Angeles County Fire Protection District.
             Access roads shall be increased to 28 feet in width within 200 feet of an
             intersection with a public street.
                                            C-6               Adopted by City Council
                                                                                 1/25/93

Circulation
      2.      Two points of ingress and egress should be provided to every subdivision
              or phase thereof. Exceptions may be granted for small subdivisions
              where physical constraints make it difficult or impossible to provide a
              second access point.
      3.      Medians constructed in arterial streets should be provided with decorative
              paved crossover points for emergency vehicles, where deemed necessary
              by the Fire Department.
      4.      Street naming and numbering should consider ease of use for dispatch of
              emergency services.
      5.      The street system should function safely and effectively, without the
              subsequent need for excessive traffic control devices.
      Policy C1.4.5: Locate and design intersections so as to promote safe and
      efficient circulation, through the following means:
      1.      Local to local street intersections should be spaced at least 150 feet apart
              (from centerline to centerline).
      2.      Intersections, including knuckles, should generally be perpendicular.
              Public streets should intersect at a 90 degree angle plus or minus five
              degrees. Knuckles should be constructed at a 90 degree angle, plus or
              minus 10 degrees.
      3.      Excessive grade variations, curves or other features which impair sight
              distance at intersections shall be avoided.
      4.      Local to collector street intersections should be spaced no less than 300
              feet apart, where necessary to provide adequate queuing room for left turn
              movements on to the collector street. Where left turn movements onto the
              collector street are not needed, this spacing requirement may be reduced
              to 150 feet.
      5.      On local to local intersections, four-way intersections should be avoided.
      6.      For intersections of collector or larger streets, four-way intersections are
              preferred over offset or “T” intersections.

       Policy C1.4.6: Adopt standards for use of private streets, where appropriate;
       private streets, other than driveways and alleyways typically associated with
       multi-family development, should be constructed to City standards for public
       rights-of-way, and should be used only for gated communities.

Objective C1.6: Ensure that the City street system is adequately maintained, to
promote safety and increase the useful life of these facilities.
       Policy C1.6.1: Pro-actively maintain all City streets; maintenance levels and
       schedules should consider long-term costs of street maintenance.
       Policy C1.6.2: Require assurance of long-term maintenance for all private
       streets constructed within the City.
Objective C1.7: Ensure adequate access within the Planning Area for trucks, while
protecting incompatible uses from through truck traffic.
       Policy C.1.7.1: Review periodically, and update as necessary, City Code
       provisions concerning truck routes and enforcement.
       Policy C.1.7.2: To the extent feasible, route through truck traffic around existing
       and future residential neighborhoods.
       Policy C.1.7.3: Designate truck routes which will serve commercial/industrial
       areas while minimizing adverse impacts of heavy truck traffic on these uses.

SECTION 3: IMPLEMENTATION
The City’s goals, policies and objectives for development of a transportation system to
meet future community needs will implemented by the following means:
A.     Circulation Plan
The City will construct or require construction of roads and transportation facilities in
conformance with the Roadway Network, presented in Exhibit C-4. The City will
regularly update the Roadway Network and coordinate it with the Land use Plan, to
ensure provision of transportation facilities adequate to support permitted land uses
throughout the Planning Area.
B.     Traffic Model
The City’s traffic consultants prepared a computer model of the City’s street and
highway network in order to evaluate adequacy of the Circulation Plan to accommodate
build-out of the Land Use Plan. The City will maintain this model to reflect changing
conditions, as road improvements are constructed and new development takes place.
The model will be used to evaluate future proposed changes to the Land Use Element
of the General Plan.
C.     Street Standards
The City’s adopted standards for typical street sections are established as shown on
Exhibit C-1 and Table C-1.         Standards specified here in shall be maximum
requirements; where existing streets and approved development preclude adherence to
these standards, the City will give consideration to modifications to reflect standards
under which previous development was approved. Standards will be developed for
intersection enhancement where needed. The cross-sections listed on Table C-1 shall
be reviewed and updated as needed by the City Public Works Department.

SECTION 4: ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
The purpose of the Circulation Element is to evaluate the transportation needs of the
City and present a comprehensive transportation plan to accommodate those needs.
The Element addresses surface streets and highways, air and rail service, public transit
and transportation management issues. Background information and planning issues
relating to each of these topics are contained in this section of the Element.
A.      Street and Highway System
A city's roadway system consists of a wide range of transportation facilities which serve
two basic functions: mobility and land access. Mobility means providing the ability for
motorists to travel between their points of activity. Land access means providing for
parking, storage or other types of driveway access at the final destination. A circulation
network is composed of facilities that emphasize mobility or access to different degrees.
The following types of facilities are typically defined:
•       Freeway. Mobility with very limited access.
•       Expressway. Mobility with more frequent access to arterial streets than a
        freeway, but no direct land access.
•       Arterial. Mobility with access to collectors, some local streets and major traffic.
•       Collector. Connects local streets with arterials and also provides access to
        adjacent land uses; thus balancing mobility with access.
•       Local. Provides access to adjacent land uses exclusively.
Street and highway systems are designed in the above manner as a means of
achieving the goals of mobility and access in an efficient manner. While it might be
desirable to provide both access and mobility on all facilities, no one would favor arterial
street standards for all facilities in a circulation system. The designation of the above
types of streets thus has a functional and economic value to the community.
Problems occur when a street designed to provide mobility is expected to provide for
land access as well. Land access typically requires driveways or local streets to move
vehicles off the street and onto the property in question. When too many access points
are provided on a street intended for mobility, friction and conflicts occur between
vehicles needing access and vehicles using the facility for mobility.
The different functions of various roadways require specific methods of analysis and
design. Each street type must meet different traffic capacity and access requirements.
For example, local streets are not designed or intended to serve as regional
thoroughfares. For this reason, various street types are treated separately in the
                                             C-27                Adopted by City Council
                                                                                    1/25/93

Circulation
following discussion. Prior to discussing existing and future roadway conditions in the
Planning Area, however, a brief overview of the methodology used to analyze the street
network is provided.
1.      Circulation Analysis Methods
Five steps were involved in developing the roadway component of the Circulation
Element: (1) documenting existing conditions and assembling a factual data base; (2)
the development and validation of the transportation model, which was used to forecast
future usage of alternative circulation plans; (3) the identification of problems,
opportunities and issues; (4) testing and evaluating alternative improvement plans; and
(5) the selection and refinement of the recommended circulation plan. These steps are
briefly described below.
a.      Existing Roadway Analysis
Palmdale's existing roadway network and functional classification system is illustrated in
Exhibit C-5. Annual daily traffic volumes for most of the arterials within the City (1990)
were obtained through traffic counts, to assess existing levels of service.
The evaluation of Palmdale's circulation system focused on two major criteria: capacity
and connectivity. Capacity refers to the ability of the street system (roadways and
intersections) to adequately serve the demand placed on it. It is a measure of how well
the mobility needs of the City are provided for. Connectivity is defined less precisely as
a measure of how well various parts of the City are joined together, and how easy it is to
move between different parts of the City. Connectivity is also related to how well, in a
more global sense, land access is provided in the City.
The capacity of a roadway is affected by a number of factors, including the street's
width, the number of crossing arterials and collectors, the amount of green time given to
the street at each signal, the presence or absence of on-street parking, the number of
turning lanes at each intersection and the number of driveways. Roadway capacities
were defined for each street (see Table C-5).
Intersection capacity depends on the lane configuration, meaning the number of through
lanes and left-turn lanes. Utilization of an intersection during the peak hours provides a
measure of service level.
The level of service (LOS) designation of a roadway or an intersection indicates whether
the capacity is adequate to handle the volume of traffic using the facility. LOS A
indicates a good service level, with minimal stacking of vehicles, while LOS F describes

                                                                             Circulation
densely congested conditions. A description of service level categories is provided in
Exhibit C-2.
Existing capacities and levels of service for Palmdale's arterial streets and highways
were calculated and are presented in the following sections dealing with specific
roadway types.
With regard to connectivity or linkage within Palmdale's roadway system, the Element
analyzed missing segments in the street pattern which disrupt traffic flow. A discussion
of future needs in this area is also included in sections dealing with specific roadway
types.
b.      Development of the Traffic Model
The traffic consultants retained to analyze Palmdale's roadway system and develop a
circulation plan utilized a computerized traffic model. The traffic model focuses on the
Palmdale/Lancaster area, and extends from Avenue J to the north to Mt. Emma Road
and Soledad Canyon Road to the south, and from 110th Street West to the west to
120th Street East to the east. For modeling purposes, this area was divided into 91
traffic analysis zones (TAZ's). Another 32 zones were identified where roadways cross
the analysis area boundary to represent trips to/from locations outside the study area.
Though the model includes a portion of Lancaster for purposes of developing the
Circulation Element, only the City of Palmdale was studied.
The traffic model utilized TRANPLAN software, which has also been utilized by the
same consultant (DKS Associates) to model the City of Lancaster's General Plan
network. TRANPLAN software is also used by Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG) and Caltrans for their subarea studies, ensuring that Palmdale's
traffic model has regional as well as local applications.
Traffic analysis with a model of this type involves four steps: (1) specification of the
roadway network; (2) development of vehicle trip generation rates for uses within each
analysis zone; (3) distribution of these vehicle trips to destination points; and (4)
assignment of vehicle trips to specific roadway segments. Based on this analysis, the
model will indicate whether planned roadway widths will be adequate to handle
projected traffic volumes, and where capacity problems will occur.
                                            C-29               Adopted by City Council
                                                                                 1/25/93

                                                                            Circulation
 The first step in the process was to model the existing road system in Palmdale. This
step was used to test the model's accuracy by its ability to replicate existing traffic
conditions. The four components of this analysis were:
•        Roadway Network: the model used Palmdale's existing road system, shown on
         Exhibit C-5.
•        Trip Generation: the number of trips generated from existing land uses is
         summarized below in Table C-2.

Circulation
•      Trip Distribution: Distribution of vehicle trips was calibrated based upon an
       analysis of existing traffic counts within the Planning Area. Trips were distributed
       both within and outside the study area.
•      Trip Assignment: Trip assignments were refined based upon a detailed analysis
       of intersection capacity to produce estimates of traffic volumes on the roadway
       system.
After developing and calibrating the traffic model, the consultants performed several
different runs of the model based upon various assumptions. The model was run to
predict traffic volumes in year 2010 and at buildout of the land uses permitted by the
Land Use Element. It was also run using the existing Circulation Plan network and a
revised network.
The estimated number of trips generated from General Plan buildout is shown in Table
C-3.
The model was also run assuming that various trip reduction (Transportation Demand
Management, or TDM) measures were adopted throughout the City. TDM measures
reduce the total number of vehicle trips at peak hours by promoting public transit, ride-
sharing, flexible working schedules, telecommuting and similar methods.
Results of the various model runs are discussed in the following sections.
c.     Identification of Issues
Based upon their analysis of existing conditions and the traffic model results, the
consultants identified several traffic needs which have been addressed throughout this
Circulation Element. Other issues were identified through the public input process, CAC
meetings and Planning Commission hearings. The following issues were identified:
1.     The need to upgrade and increase capacity on State Route 14, including
       interchange upgrades.
2.     The need to realign and widen Highway 138 for additional capacity, improved
       level of service, and to serve the Regional Airport.
3.     The need for increased arterial roadway capacity along north-south routes,
       especially east of State Route 14.
4.     The need for grade separations over the railroad tracks.

9.      The need to coordinate circulation plans of individual development projects with
        each other and with the surrounding street network.
10.     The need to define alignments for arterial roads within vacant, undeveloped
        areas which are ready for development.
11.     The need to protect arterial street capacity from excessive cross traffic and
        turning movements.
d.      Evaluating Alternative Improvement Plans
Once the traffic model was completed and run, it was necessary to make certain
adjustments to the Land Use Plan and the road network plan to achieve acceptable
Levels of Service at General Plan buildout. In addition, it was necessary in 1990 to
expand the network and model to include two specific plan areas in the southwest
portion of the Planning Area. In 1991, the model was re-run to reflect revised estimates
of buildout, particularly in the Industry Trade Center and Airport Corridor Specific Plan
areas, and to more accurately reflect existing build-out conditions. The latest traffic
model run was completed in March, 1992, and shows acceptable levels of service
throughout the Planning Area.
e.      Refinement of the Circulation Plan
Based upon the latest traffic model run, the original network has been re-evaluated and
several adjustments were made to recommended street widths. In some cases,
ultimate right-of-way was reduced based on projected traffic volumes which were lower
than expected. In other cases, additional right-of-way is recommended. The final result
of this analysis is presented in Table C-4 which lists the buildout traffic volumes on the
Future Roadway Network.

The following sections describe how the circulation analysis relates to specific street
types, from highways to local streets.
2.       Highways and Regional Arterials
a.       Existing Roadways
Palmdale is about 35 miles north of Los Angeles on a straight heading, and about 60
miles north of Los Angeles via the Antelope Valley Freeway (SR-14). SR-14 runs north
into Kern County and south to the San Fernando Valley to provide the Palmdale
community with regional and inter-regional connectivity via an interchange with the
Golden State Freeway (I-5). I-5 runs north into central and northern California, as well
as south into Orange and San Diego Counties.
The Antelope Valley Freeway (State Route 14) is a north/south freeway which provides
regional access for the entire Antelope Valley to the rest of Los Angeles County.
Further south, the Antelope Valley Freeway becomes an east/west route providing
access to the Santa Clarita Valley. It has four travel lanes south of Avenue P-8 and six
travel lanes north of Avenue P-8. The current traffic volumes on the Antelope Valley
Freeway range between 40,000 and 43,000 average daily trips (ADT).
Several arterials in the City of Palmdale serve a regional function as well as local needs.
Palmdale Boulevard connects Palmdale with Victorville to the east in San Bernardino
County. Elizabeth Lake Road, which is the westerly extension of Palmdale Boulevard,
connects with Avenue D, which in turn, connects to Interstate 5, near the Ventura
County border. Pearblossom Highway (SR-138) branches near the San Bernardino
County border into Palmdale Road, which connects to I-15 near Victorville, and SR-138,
Adopted by City Council                         C-42
1/25/93
                                                                                   Circulation
which connects to I-15 near San Bernardino. Sierra Highway links Palmdale with the
City of Mojave to the north in Kern County and with the I-5/SR-14 interchange to the
south near Sylmar. These roads are further described below:
Palmdale Boulevard/Elizabeth Lake Road has a total of two through lanes west of
Foxholm Drive near the City limit, four lanes between Foxholm Drive and 47th Street
East, and two lanes east of 47th Street East. In addition, Palmdale Boulevard has a full
(partial cloverleaf) interchange configuration with the Antelope Valley Freeway and a
raised, landscaped median island between 10th Street West and 11th Street East.
Caltrans has recently removed the serrated median island between 11th and 22nd
Streets East and is currently replacing it with a flash median.
Pearblossom Highway (SR-138) extends from the San Bernardino County border to
Sierra Highway, where it branches into SR-14 and Antelope Highway (SR-138). Within
the City of Palmdale, it has four through lanes west of Old Nadeau Road, and two lanes
to the east. Old Nadeau Road is located about 600 feet north of Sierra Highway.
Sierra Highway extends from the City of Mojave, in Kern County, through Palmdale to
the I-5/SR-14 interchange to the south. Within the City, it has four through lanes north
of Avenue R-8, two lanes between Avenue R-8 and 1,200 feet south of Avenue S, four
lanes between 1200 feet south of Avenue S and 3,000 feet north of Barrel Springs
Road, and two lanes to the south. Sierra Highway generally runs adjacent to SR-14
and turns into an east/west arterial a few miles south of the Planning Area.
b. Existing Levels of Service
With few exceptions, the City of Palmdale arterial network currently operates at
acceptable levels of service. A few arterial segments are currently operating near or
above their striped capacity at LOS D, E, or F. These congested segments are located
on major arterial sections that have yet to be built to the full major arterial cross-section.
Palmdale Boulevard, between the Antelope Valley Freeway and 30th                   Street East,
currently operates at LOS E, indicating significant levels of congestion for motorists.
This section of Palmdale Boulevard has four through lanes with a paved median island
on an 84-foot cross-section. By eliminating on-street parking, this section can be
restriped to six through lanes and a median, which would accommodate the traffic. This
would improve the operating level to LOS C.
Pearblossom Highway, between Barrel Springs and 30th Street East, currently operates
at LOS F. This segment is currently striped for two through lanes and has yet to be built
to the full major arterial cross-section.

Circulation
The intersection of Pearblossom Highway and Avenue T operates at LOS D (V/C =
0.84) during the a.m. peak hour, and the intersection of Palmdale Boulevard and 30th
Street East operates at LOS D (V/C = 0.87) during the p.m. peak hour. Continued
monitoring of future growth along these intersections will facilitate implementation of
appropriate mitigation strategies at specific times. The Traffic Impact Fee Assessment
and Master Traffic Level Maintenance Plan identifies various links as candidate
locations for this funding strategy.
S.R. 138 is currently operating at LOS E. This facility is striped for total of two through
lanes and has yet to be built to the full major arterial cross-section.
Sierra Highway, between Avenue M and Avenue P, which is currently striped for four
through lanes is operating at LOS E.
Sierra Highway, between Pearblossom Highway and the Antelope               Valley Freeway,
currently operates at LOS F. This segment is striped for four through lanes.
c.      Future Regional Arterial and Highway Needs
When running the traffic model, the consultant calculated that highways and regional
arterials could carry 10,000 vehicles per lane per day. This figure assumed that traffic
improvements, including signal coordination and progression, would occur concurrently
with development and that full roadway improvements would be in place at General
Plan build-out. SR-14 was assumed to have four lanes in each direction through the
study area. In addition, several existing major arterials were recommended to be
upgraded to Regional Arterial status, including the following road segments:
East-West Arterials
•       Avenue L west of 10th Street East;
•       Avenue M between 30th Street West and 50th Street East;
•       Elizabeth Lake Road between 25th Street West and Palmdale Boulevard;
•       Palmdale Boulevard between Elizabeth Lake Road and Division Street;
•       Avenue S between 35th Street East and 3800' east of 47th Street East; and,
•       Pearblossom Highway between Sierra Highway and Avenue T.

North-South Arterials
•       10th Street West between Avenue M and Palmdale Boulevard;
•       Sierra Highway between Avenue M and Avenue P;
•       Sierra Highway between Pearblossom Highway and SR-14;
•       47th Street East between Palmdale Boulevard and Ft. Tejon Road;
        Ft. Tejon Road between 47th Street East and Pearblossom Highway; and,
        50th Street East between the Cross Town Freeway and Palmdale Boulevard.
In addition to these upgrades, other recommended regional improvements included the
following:
•       Upgrading of 50th Street East to an expressway designation north of Avenue P-
        8. An expressway has more capacity that either an arterial or a regional arterial,
        approaching that of a freeway. This is achieved by providing grade-separated
        intersections, preferential signal timing, and very limited access (one-mile or half-
        mile spacing).
•       A new east/west freeway along the alignment of Avenue P-8, having three lanes
        in each direction from SR-14 to just east of 90th Street East. For purposes of
        this study, interchanges were assumed at SR-14, 10th Street East, 25th Street
        East, 40th Street East, and at the new six-lane north/south freeway. Future
        studies of this facility should consider additional interchange locations.
•       A new north/south freeway having three lanes in each direction from SR-138 on
        the south to the City of Lancaster to the north. For purposes of this study,
        interchanges were assumed at the new six-lane east/west freeway, Palmdale
        Boulevard, Avenue S, and SR-138. Future studies of this facility should consider
        additional interchange locations.
•       Expansion of SR-14 from four lanes each way to five lanes each way between
        Avenue L and Crown Valley Parkway.
The proposed east/west freeway is projected to carry about 75,000 vehicles per day
between SR-14 and 50th Street East and about 40,000 vehicles per day further east.
The proposed north-south freeway is projected to carry approximately 50,000 vehicles
per day.
Along with additional freeways and designation upgrades, the consultants
recommended trip reduction measures to reduce total vehicle trips throughout the
Planning Area by 15 percent. However, even with these measures some regional
arterial locations within the City will be operating at LOS D or worse at the year of land
use buildout. These locations include: Sierra Highway, between Pearblossom Highway
                                              C-45                 Adopted by City Council
                                                                                     1/25/93

and the Antelope Valley Freeway; Avenue M, between the Antelope Valley Freeway and
Division; and Palmdale Boulevard between the Antelope Valley Freeway and Division.
Based on the traffic model analysis, the regional roadway improvements mentioned
above will be necessary to ensure acceptable levels of service within the Planning Area
as buildout occurs.
3.      Arterials
a.      Existing Roadways
Major Arterials
Major arterials as previously designated on the City's General Plan Circulation Map are
spaced at approximately one-mile intervals, and represent the major carrying capacity
for traffic to and within the City. The City's current policy is to create major arterials at
one-mile intervals and secondary arterials at one-half mile intervals between the majors.
Previous design standards for a major arterial called for a paved section of 84 feet
within a 100-foot right-of-way which, when built to its full carrying capacity, provides for
either three lanes of through traffic in each direction and a median for left-turning traffic,
or two lanes in each direction, a left-turn median, and a curb lane for parking. In some
portions of the City, the median is paved to create specific left- and U-turn bays; in other
locations, painted medians with optional/dual left-turn lanes are used.
Some of the major arterials within Palmdale are discontinuous, and many have yet to be
built to the full 84-foot paved cross-section along the entire length. A detailed
discussion of each major arterial follows.
Avenue L is discontinuous along its length, which extends from west of 70th Street West
to the City limit at 120th Street East. It is classified as a major arterial west of 40th
Street East, and as a minor to the east. It has a total of two through lanes over its
length.
Avenue M extends from 90th Street West to east of the City limit at 120th Street East,
and has a total of two through lanes over its entire length.
Avenue N, a two-lane arterial, is discontinuous along its length. It reaches from 70th
Street West to Sierra Highway, and from about 2,000 feet west of 40th Street East to
east of 110th Street East.
Avenue R extends from Tierra Subida Avenue to 3,000 feet east of 47th Street East. It
has two through lanes west of 6th Street East, four lanes between 6th Street East and

has two lanes over its entire length except for the following segments which have two
lanes eastbound and one lane westbound: between Sierra Highway and 15th Street
East, and between 25th Street East and 35th Street East. The arterial has a full-
diamond interchange with the Antelope Valley Freeway, providing regional connections

Avenue Q is discontinuous along its length. It reaches from Palmdale Boulevard to 6th
Street East where it is classified as a secondary arterial, and from Sierra Highway to
40th Street East where it is classified as a major arterial. This arterial has one through
lane in each direction along its entire length, though between 30th and 35th Street East,
the south side is currently paved wide enough for two lanes.

90th Street East extends from north of Avenue K to south of Avenue T, where it
becomes 87th Street East. It has two through lanes along its entire length.
Secondary Arterials
Under the previous General Plan, secondary arterials were designated so as to be
spaced at approximately one-half mile intervals between the major arterials, and provide
access to the major arterials. Previously, design standards for a secondary arterial
called for a paved section of 64 feet within a 80-foot right-of-way width. When built to its
full carrying capacity, this cross-section provides for either two lanes in each direction
with a painted median left-turn lane, or one lane in each direction with a painted median
left-turn lane and curb parking. Typically, secondary arterials do not have a raised
median.
Some of the secondary arterials within Palmdale are discontinuous, and have yet to be
built to the full 64-foot paved cross-section along their entire length. A detailed
discussion of each secondary arterial follows.

b.     Arterial Levels of Service
Capacity
Existing service levels on major and secondary arterials were analyzed and determined
to be generally good. (See Table C-5 and Exhibit C-6.)
However, Palmdale Boulevard between SR-14 and 30th Street East was found to be
operating at LOS D during peak hours. It should be noted, in reviewing Table C-5, that
LOS standards shown for each link may vary due to irregularities in the model.
Intersection capacities were analyzed using turning movement volumes obtained from
actual counts taken during the months of August and September 1989. Forty-seven
                                           C-51               Adopted by City Council
                                                                               1/25/93
Circulation
intersections were analyzed for the evaluation of existing capacities. All of the 47 study
intersections operate at LOS D or better. A few intersections may be characterized as
approaching the maximum acceptable LOS value, LOS E.
Connectivity
The City of Palmdale's circulation system has, for the most part, developed around a
grid system in which major arterials are spaced approximately every mile and
secondary arterials are spaced every half-mile between the major arterials. As the
capacity evaluation shows, this pattern appears to be providing a solid foundation for
serving the community's mobility needs. The majority of the arterial segments are
currently operating at LOS D or better, which indicates good traffic flow.
There are, however, many missing segments in the street pattern that currently result in
connectivity problems, some of which will contribute to capacity problems in the future,
as the City's population and traffic increase.
As the community develops, it is planned that the majority of the major and secondary
arterials will be made continuous throughout the limits of the City. The following
arterials are currently continuous along their entire lengths within the City: Avenue L,
Avenue M, Palmdale Boulevard, Pearblossom Highway/Avenue T, 60th Street West,
30th Street West, 20th Street West, 10th Street West/Tierra Subida Avenue, Sierra
Highway, 47th/50th Street East, 90th Street East, and 110th Street East.
Adopted by City Council                     C-52
1/25/93







Circulation
Several arterials are not planned to be or cannot be continuous because they intercept
the United States Air Force Plant area or the proposed Palmdale Regional Airport site.
These arterials include Avenues N through Q, 10th through 40th Streets East, and 60th
through 80th Street East.
Future Arterial Needs
To help mitigate the effects of future traffic growth and improve the circulation system
within the City, many of the existing gaps in the existing arterial system will need to be
closed to accommodate projected buildout traffic conditions. The arterials that are
recommended to be made continuous throughout the City are: Avenue M, Avenue P-8,
Avenue R, Avenue R-8, Avenue S, Division Street, 10th Street East, and 110th Street
East.
In addition, several new north/south and east/west arterials are planned in the
southwestern region of the City (south of Elizabeth Lake Road and west of Tierra
Subida Avenue). The east/west facilities include Ritter Ranch Road (which is the
westerly extension of Avenue S); City Ranch Road (which is the westerly extension of
Avenue R); and Santa Fe Hills Drive. The north/south facilities include Bridge Road and
Ranch Center Drive.
The analysis indicated that even with implementation of transportation demand
management measures, some arterial locations within the City will be operating at LOS
D or worse at the year of land use buildout. The most significant locations are listed
below:
•      Avenue M between 30th Street West and Division Street
•      Avenue P between 15th Street West and Sierra Highway
•      Avenue Q
•      Elizabeth Lake Road between Bridge Road and Palmdale Boulevard
•      Palmdale Boulevard between Elizabeth Lake Road and 30th Street East
•      Avenue R between Tierra Subida Avenue and 47th Street East
•      Godde Hill Road
•      10th Street West between Avenue M and Palmdale Boulevard
•      5th Street West between Avenue P-8 and Tierra Subida Avenue
•      Division Street between Avenue P and 1500 feet north of Avenue Q
•      Sierra Highway near the Antelope Valley Freeway
•      10th Street East between Avenue P and Palmdale Boulevard
•      20th Street East between Palmdale Boulevard and Avenue S
•      25th Street East near Avenue S

•        30th Street East between Avenue P and Avenue Q
•        40th Street East south of Pearblossom Highway
Intersection capacities in the new Circulation Plan at land use buildout were also
analyzed. The increased capacity of the new Circulation Plan will improve overall
intersection traffic operations at buildout. The addition of the new freeway facility along
the alignment of Avenue P-8 will facilitate east/west travel movements in the City.
Parallel facilities such as Avenue M are expected to experience slight improvements in
traffic operations. Nonetheless, it is anticipated that some intersections may operate
beyond LOS D. Unacceptable levels of congestion are likely to occur without further
specific capacity improvements at intersections or reduction of traffic demand through
aggressive local TDM measures. These focused capacity improvements may include
an increase in the number of through lanes, additional turning lanes, channelization of
various intersections, computerized traffic signal coordination measures, etc.
4.       Local and Collector Streets
The recent rapid development of single-family residential subdivisions in Palmdale has
produced thousands of affordable homes in the last few years. However, the same
rapid pace of development has sometimes caused traffic problems on the local
neighborhood street systems. In some areas, such as segments of Avenue R-4 and
Spanish Broom Drive, local streets provide through access and attract high traffic
volumes at excessive speeds.            In other areas, the mass of cul-de-sacs and
discontinuous local streets bearing the same name has created confusing and
circuitous networks, which are difficult to navigate for both visitors and emergency
vehicles.
Proper design of local streets is critical to creation of livable neighborhoods. Both safety
and aesthetic concerns must be addressed. Streets that are too long and straight
contribute to a monotonous streetscape and potential traffic hazards associated with
speeding traffic. Alternatively, overly complex neighborhood street networks may lack a
logical flow pattern, provide an inefficient traffic pattern, and impede emergency vehicle
response times.
Local street design issues must be addressed both at the in-tract level and on a broader
neighborhood scale. Because there are many smaller parcels in the City, it can be
expected that multiple small subdivisions may be proposed within a larger neighborhood
unit. In these situations, local street connections between the unrelated subdivisions
may be desirable to ensure neighborhood linkages. However, these linkages must
avoid creation of local streets functioning as collectors. When this occurs, and multiple
lots front that street, hazards from excessive vehicular speeds may result. Therefore, it
is critical that both existing and planned circulation systems be considered to provide
                                              C-61                  Adopted by City Council
                                                                                     1/25/93

Circulation
the proper balance between creating neighborhood linkage and avoidance of high
volume through traffic problems.
In the context of neighborhood planning and local streets, cul-de-sacs provide both
opportunities and potential constraints. A properly located and designed cul-de-sac can
provide a residential setting where traffic speeds and volumes are reduced. Residents
are generally comfortable with front yard activities in a cul-de-sac setting. However, the
excessive use of cul-de-sacs can create numerous local intersections, poor integration
of neighborhood components, uneven distribution of traffic volumes on other local
streets, and disrupted traffic flow patterns. "Dog leg" cul-de-sacs, with one or more
turns between the bulb and the outlet, result in dead ends that are not apparent when
the street is entered.
The key to successful future neighborhood planning will be creation of a local street
network that provides optional travel paths for traffic dispersal while avoiding an overly
regimented grid system. The number of local street intersections on two arterial and
collector streets must be at defined intervals to provide a logical internal street pattern.
Efficiency is desired; however, it must not be accomplished at the expense of
neighborhood safety via long, straight streets.
To address these issues, policies for local and collector street design were drafted and
accepted by the City Council as interim policies in February, 1992 ("Subdivision Design
Guidelines"). These policies have been incorporated into the General Plan policy
sections, where appropriate, including the Circulation Element (see Objectives C1.3 and
C1.4).
A need was also identified to develop special street standards for hillside areas, rural
developments and private gated communities. Opportunities exist to develop special
standards which could minimize grading in hillside areas, maintain the character of rural
areas, and to ensure that private streets are constructed to appropriate standards. The
City will develop special street standards to serve these needs.
5.      Truck Routes
On December 9, 1991, the Palmdale City Council adopted Ordinance No. 953,
establishing truck routes within the City of Palmdale. The Ordinance regulates vehicles
exceeding 10,000 pounds gross weight and prohibits their use on undesignated City
streets, except when delivering or otherwise servicing uses on such streets.
Designated truck routes include the following (see Exhibit C-7):
•       10th Street West from Avenue P to Avenue M
•       Sierra Highway from the Antelope Valley Freeway to Avenue M
•       50th Street East from Palmdale Boulevard to Avenue M
Adopted by City Council                     C-62
1/25/93

                                                                               Circulation
•      Avenue M from the Antelope Valley Freeway to 50th Street East
•      Avenue P from 10th Street West to 50th Street East
•      City Ranch Road, Tierra Subida, Rayburn Road and Avenue R from the Antelope
       Valley Landfill to Sierra Highway
•      Avenue S from the Antelope Valley Freeway to Sierra Highway
•      Pearblossom Highway from Sierra Highway to Fort Tejon Road
•      Avenue T from Fort Tejon Road to 90th Street East
Additional truck routes may be needed to serve the access needs of the eastside
Mineral Resource Area (MRE), particularly for that portion north of the railroad tracks.
Establishing truck routes connecting this area to Avenue T or Palmdale Boulevard could
prevent quarry trucks from using Avenue R, Avenue R-8 and Avenue S as primary
access routes. Policy C1.7.1 addresses the need to maintain the City's truck route
program.
6.     Congestion Management Plan
The Congestion Management Program (CMP) was enacted by the state legislature in
1989 to improve traffic congestion in California's urbanized areas. The program
became effective with the passage of Proposition III in June, 1990, which increased the
state gas tax by nine cents over a five year period. The increase in funds generated by
Proposition III will be available to cities and counties for regional road improvements,
provided that they are in compliance with CMP requirements. If a city does not comply
with the CMP, it could lose funding under Proposition III. Therefore, it is imperative for
Palmdale to develop local programs to comply with the Congestion Management
Program.
Under the program, regional agencies are designated within each County to prepare
and administer the CMP. In Los Angeles County, the Congestion Management Agency
is the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission (LACTC). LACTC is in the
process of drafting the countywide Congestion Management Plan and preparing an
Environmental Impact Report for the Plan. When completed, the CMP Exhibit C-
73(Map) will be submitted to SCAG, which will determine the Plan's consistency with the
Regional Mobility Plan.
After the CMP plan is adopted, each City within the County must take steps to
administer elements of the plan locally. The City's responsibilities include the following:
•      Assisting in monitoring the CMP system;
•      Adopting and implementing a trip reduction and travel demand ordinance;
                                            C-63                Adopted by City Council
                                                                                     1/25/93

Circulation
•       Analyzing the impacts of local land use discussions on the regional transportation
        system; and,
•       Preparing annual deficiency plans for portions of the CMP system where level of
        service standards are not maintained.
LACTC will annually review the City's performance of these responsibilities to ensure
they are in compliance with the CMP. After notice and a correction period, LACTC will
report local agencies who are out of compliance to the State Controller, who will then
withhold a portion of their state gas tax funds.
LACTC adopted the County's Congestion Management Plan in November, 1992. As
approved, the CMP includes the following roadways within the City of Palmdale:
•       Antelope Valley Freeway (Highway 14)
•       State Route 138
After adoption of the CMP, levels of service on these roadways must stay at LOS E or
better; if they do not, the City must prepare a deficiency plan to bring the level of service
back up to LOS E. Under the CMP legislation, once a roadway is entered into the CMP
network it cannot be deleted, even if service levels are ultimately improved. Because
the City is responsible for monitoring and reporting service levels on all CMP roadways,
the City's position has been to discourage the addition of any additional links into the
CMP network.
The City's policy since 1991 has been to condition development projects to comply with
CMP requirements. Policy C2.1.5 reinforces the City's intent to maintain compliance
with the CMP process.
7.      Street System Maintenance
Presently the City contracts with Los Angeles County Department of Public Works to
provide maintenance on public streets within Palmdale. Services provided include
street sweeping, filling of potholes and cracks, snowplowing, maintenance of drainage
structures, and bridge inspection. It is anticipated that, in the future, the City will
assume these maintenance responsibilities, as funds become available to establish a
public works corporation yard and acquire street maintenance equipment. The City
could begin phasing in some maintenance duties within the next five years, and fully
take over maintenance responsibilities within ten to twelve years, depending on funding
availability.
Some portions of the Planning Area require additional street maintenance due to
substandard street sections. Several of the unincorporated County "islands" currently
Adopted by City Council                     C-64

                                                                                Circulation
under consideration for annexation were developed without curbs, gutters, sidewalks or
drainage. As a result, stormwater runoff undermines the paving and maintenance costs
are increased. As these older areas become redeveloped, road improvements will be
required to upgrade the street systems.
In general, street maintenance levels are adequate to meet existing City needs. As the
City continues to develop and expand, the contract maintenance costs will increase to
the point where it will be more economical for the City to take over this function.
Private streets are required to be maintained by property owners or homeowners
associations. Objective C1.6 and related policies address road maintenance issues.
B.      Public Transit and Alternative Travel Modes
1.      Fixed Route Bus Service
Bus service within the City of Palmdale is provided through the Antelope Valley Transit
Authority (AVTA), a joint powers agency whose members also include the City of
Lancaster and Los Angeles County. The AVTA recently completed a five-year plan for
service within the Antelope Valley, the Antelope Valley Transit Need Plan. They are
currently developing a ten-year transit plan for the area.
The AVTA is responsible for overseeing bus services, including selection of service
provider and establishment of routes, schedules and hours of operation. Recently
AVTA awarded the service contract to DAVE Transportation Services. Service includes
fifteen buses in service and five buses in reserve. Weekday service includes five core
urban routes and four supplemental routes. Supplemental routes or additional buses
are utilized during morning and afternoon hours on school routes. Student bus use to
and from school is causing extra service requirements during limited hours. Saturday
service will include five core routes in the urban area.
Bus frequency is two bus trips per hour on inter-city routes. Service hours are from 5:30
a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on weekdays and 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on Saturday. This level of
bus service represents a considerable improvement of service levels before 1992, in
terms of geographic coverage, frequency of service, and span of service. Total hours of
service have almost doubled over 1991 levels.
The five fixed routes serve many of the major thoroughfares in Lancaster and Palmdale.
Three of the five routes either terminate or pass through the Antelope Valley Mall, which
functions as a focal point for local service. Route locations are shown on Exhibit C-7.
2.      Inter-City Bus Services
                                             C-65                Adopted by City Council
                                                                                    1/25/93
Circulation
DAVE Transportation Services operates two commuter bus lines between Palmdale and
central Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. Nine buses are in service with two in
reserve. Service operates on Monday through Friday, with seven trips to downtown Los
Angeles on Route 785 and two trips to the San Fernando Valley on Route 787. Routes
are shown on Exhibit C-8.
Service is available in the morning from 4:30 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. trips to Los Angeles and
the San Fernando Valley, and in the afternoon for return trips to Palmdale from 3:30
p.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Under the administration of AVTA, commuter bus service was expanded substantially in
1992. The seven existing service runs will increase to nine as ridership increases.
Total service hours were increased 50 percent over 1991 service levels.
In addition to AVTA services, Greyhound Lines provides bus service to Lancaster and
Palmdale, primarily as intermediate stops along routes heading toward central or
northern California, or Los Angeles. Service is limited to two trips in each direction, and
tickets have to be purchased from the driver. A limited number of Palmdale residents
use this service as a commuter bus to get to and from work in areas such as downtown
Los Angeles.
Antelope Valley Airport Express offers a reservation-only scheduled van between
Antelope Valley and Los Angeles, as well as similar service to airports.
3.     Dial-A-Ride Bus Service
Dial-A-Ride service is provided by DAVE Transportation Services, which operates
thirteen vans in service, and two vans in reserve. Services are offered to disabled
persons and senior citizens (age 62 and older) with priority given to persons determined
to be eligible for ADA paratransit, between 5:30 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. on weekdays and
between 8:30 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Saturdays. On Sundays, Dial-A-Ride services are
available to the general public residing within the service area. Outside the service
area, capacity-constrained service is available to the general public on weekdays
between 7:30 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. The service area boundary is shown on Exhibit C-9.
Adopted by City Council                   C-66
1/25/93

Circulation
Along with its expansion of fixed route and commuter bus service, AVTA increased
service levels for Dial-A-Ride service. The service area was extended to the same area
served by the fixed-route system, over the same operating hours, and complies with the
requirements of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. The service was also
extended for the first time to rural areas of the Antelope Valley, including Acton, Lake
Los Angeles and Lake Hughes. Total service hours increased 300 percent over 1991
levels.
4.      Incentives to Promote Bus Use
The City will continue to promote expansion of transit service to serve all need groups
within the community. In addition, the City will utilize bus service as part of its
comprehensive vehicle trip reduction strategy. Public transportation issues will be
considered in the development review process as well, to ensure provision of adequate,
convenient bus turnouts along streets served. Bus service can be made more effective
through implementation of the following measures:
•       Bus stops provided at regular intervals along each route.
•       Bus stops provided with attractive weather-resistant benches and/or shelters.
•       Bus transit directories provided at each bus stop and placed at a height readable
        by children and wheelchair users.
•       Pocket transit guides designed and made available for all residents and visitors
        informing them of the transit routes and services.
•       Requiring all new or remodeled developments on existing or future streets served
        by public transit to provide a bus turnout lane.
5.      Commuter Van Services and Carpools
Commuter Transportation Services (CTS) is a private non-profit ridesharing
organization which provides ridesharing services throughout the SCAG region, including
the Palmdale area. CTS is funded by Caltrans, SCAG, San Bernardino Associated
Governments, Ventura County Association of Governments, and the Transportation
Commission of Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside Counties. Contributions are also
made by the City of Los Angeles and more than 1,000 private companies which utilize
CTS.
CTS operates 86 vans which serve vanpoolers in the Palmdale area who travel south to
communities in the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles. Each van seats between 12
and 15 passengers.

                                                                             Circulation
CTS estimates that 21 percent of the Antelope Valley commuters are using vanpool
services. This is higher than the regionwide average of 17 percent of commuters who
are utilizing vanpools. CTS continues to organize additional vanpools as the commuting
population increases.
CTS also organizes car and vanpools for commuters and estimates that 5 percent of the
Antelope Valley commuters carpool. The City encourages carpooling by providing park-
and-ride lots. Developers and employers are also providing park-and-ride lots in
convenient locations for commuting. Currently there is a City of Palmdale park-and-ride
lot located at Avenue S and the Antelope Valley Freeway (700 spaces). The City is
assisting Los Angeles County in construction of a park-and-ride lot on Sierra Highway
near the Antelope Valley Freeway (300 spaces). In addition, developers or employers
have provided park-and-ride lots at Avenue P near the Antelope Valley Freeway in the
Walmart store parking lot (200 spaces) and the Target store parking lot (52 spaces),
and on Avenue P in the Lockheed facility parking lot (133 spaces). Additional park-and-
ride spaces will be provided within the City as need and funding sources are identified.
6.      Paratransit Services
Senior and transportationally-handicapped paratransit service in Palmdale is provided
by four nonprofit organizations with county and/or state funding and two private
companies. Service providers include the following:
•       Antelope Valley Committee on Aging (Public)
•       Los Angeles County Community and Senior Citizen Services Department (Public)
•       North Los Angeles County Regional Center (Public)
•       Independent Senior Center (Public)
•       Mediride (Private)
•       Antelope Valley Taxi (Private)
7.      Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Measures
The City of Palmdale has been pro-active in promoting reductions in trips through ride-
sharing programs. As noted above, the City has provided and required developers to
provide several park-and-ride sites throughout the City. In the future, the City will
formulate a comprehensive park-and-ride plan to coordinate location of these facilities
with public transit routes.
Other TDM measures will include preparation and adoption of a TDM Ordinance, in
compliance with the Congestion Management Plan. Various TDM measures which
might be addressed in this ordinance include:
                                           C-69                Adopted by City Council
                                                                                 1/25/93

Circulation
•        Require that if employers subsidize parking, they also subsidize transit;
•        Proactive work place based promotion and marketing of commute alternatives,
         employee        rideshare    coordinators     and     Transportation  Management
         Organizations;
•        Financial subsidy for transit riders and carpoolers including fare subsidies and/or
         transportation allowance;
•        Employee-paid parking charges;
•        Provision of midday transportation and guaranteed-ride-home for ridesharers;
•        Walk-accessible transit services;
•        Preferential treatments for ridesharing, including parking and high occupancy
         vehicle facilities;
•        Modified work weeks;
•        Flexible work hours; and,
•        Work at home and satellite work centers.
C.       Rail Service
The Southern Pacific Transportation Company owns and operates two rail lines which
traverse the City of Palmdale. The Valley Mainline, located adjacent and parallel to
Sierra Highway, generally bisects the Planning Area from north to south. The Colton
Cutoff line branches off from the main line south of Avenue R and runs easterly towards
the Cajon Pass in San Bernardino County, where it heads south into the cities of San
Bernardino and Colton. These lines are illustrated on Exhibit C-10.
Trains run twenty-four hours a day on these two lines, with approximately fourteen to
sixteen trains daily around the clock. The peak volume of train traffic occurs during the
early morning hours between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. Another fleet is run in the
afternoon and evening hours, while mid-day schedules vary daily. Sunday traffic is
light, but rail activity is heavy during the rest of the week.
All rail traffic through Palmdale is used for freight. There is currently no passenger rail
service offered, and a Southern Pacific representative has indicated that there are no
future plans for passenger service. Freight traffic does not run on a regular schedule,
but trains are called up as crews and power become available. Customers are informed
when their goods arrive.
On a recent (May, 1992) check with the Southern Pacific office in Mojave, twelve trains
were scheduled over an eighteen-hour period, carrying between 1,000 and 2,000 cars,
with a freight tonnage of between 50,000 and 60,000 pounds. This volume was said to
be typical.

1/25/93

                                                                                 Circulation
The Palmdale rail facilities are under the supervision of a yardmaster located in Mojave.
Palmdale contains a maintenance office charged with maintenance of the tracks
throughout the City.
Two privately-owned spurs exist within the industrial area of the City, branching off the
Valley Mainline in the vicinity of Avenue P-4 and P-8, and extending east to 15th Street
East. One of these is in use by a lumber company, and the other by a manufacturing
company.
Circulation planning issues relating to rail facilities include the railroad lines' interface
with the existing street system. Currently there are grade separated railroad crossings
at Sierra Highway and at Avenue S, with additional at-grade crossings on section-line
roads. In the future, the City will promote construction of grade separations at arterial
crossings of the railroad, particularly at Palmdale Boulevard. This goal is reflected in
Circulation Policy C1.2.4.a. A crossing will also be needed where 62nd Street East
intersects with the Colton Cutoff rail line.
A land planning issue relating to the railroads is the opportunity to promote additional
rail-supported industry in Palmdale. Palmdale's location at the edge of the Pacific Rim
and between Interstates 5 and 15 provides an opportunity to utilize various
transportation systems to move raw materials and finished products from the Los
Angeles basin to points east and north. In addition, the City's applications for Enterprise
Zone and Free Trade Zone status will provide incentives for industry to locate in rail-
served industrial areas.
Another land use issue of concern is the transition between railroad lines and adjacent
residential uses within certain areas of the City, particularly where the rail lines are
elevated. Care must be taken to protect residences from excessive noise and vibration
caused by train traffic. These issues are addressed in the Land Use and Community
Design Elements.
Future long-range regional plans call for a high-speed rail line connecting the Palmdale
Regional Airport to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). LACTC has included this
line in its 30-year regional transportation plan, and the City of Los Angeles Department
of Airports, which owns Palmdale Regional Airport and the surrounding 17,000 acres of
land, is promoting the concept. Phase 1 of the project calls for extending the high-
speed rail line from LAX to Sylmar, while Phase 2 will complete the line from Sylmar to
Palmdale. Within the Palmdale Planning Area, the line is proposed to extend along the
median strip of Highway 14 to Avenue P-8, then head westerly to the airport complex
within the right-of-way of the future 138 freeway. Stations are proposed to be located at
the interchange of Avenue S and Highway 14, and at the airport. LACTC has issued a
                                             C-71                Adopted by City Council
                                                                                      1/25/93
Circulation
Request for Proposals for design, financing and construction of this line. However, no
firm dates have been established for completion of either phase. Construction will
undoubtedly be closely tied with expansion of the Palmdale airport facilities.
Another future rail service within Palmdale will be Metro-Link, a commuter rail service.
In fall of 1992, service began between the City of Santa Clarita and Union Station in Los
Angeles, and the feasibility of extending service to Palmdale is currently being studied.
Metro-Link uses existing railroad lines and purchases the right to run trains on them.
Cars will be run in peak commute periods.
Until Metro-Link is extended to Palmdale, a trial commuter bus run will be made from
Palmdale to the rail station in Santa Clarita. This demonstrator "feeder line" will be run
for a six to twelve month period, and evaluated for its ability to attract and serve
commuters to Los Angeles employment centers. The likelihood of commuters
transferring from a commuter bus to a commuter train and possibly to a third public
transit mode in Los Angeles is unknown at this time.
D.       Air Service
As noted above, the Los Angeles County Division of Airports owns over 17,000 acres of
land within the community of Palmdale, surrounded on all sides by incorporated City
territory but presently not annexed to the City (see Exhibit C-11). Long-range plans call
for development of a regional airport at the site, which would be linked to LAX by a high
speed rail line and by a new freeway linking Highway 14 to the site along an alignment
following existing Avenue P-8.
Although the Division of Airports has not constructed its own landing facilities at this
time, it has an agreement with Air Force Plant 42 to utilize Air Force landing strips for up
to 50 operations per day. A representative of Skywest, the commercial serving
Palmdale, states that currently seven commercial flights per day use the facilities: six
daily flights to LAX and one daily flight to Palm Springs.
The Division of Airports is under the jurisdiction of an Airport Commission. The Airport
Commission has negotiated an agreement with the Air Force to increase usage up to
200 flights per day; however, the agreement is subject to environmental review and an
Environmental Impact Report must be prepared prior to execution of the agreement.
South Coast Air Quality Management District regulations call for an air quality
certification, requiring purchase of emissions credits and other measures, which may
delay the planned expansion of use.
Current airport use in Palmdale (March, 1992) is summarized as follows:

                                                                                   Circulation
•       Number of passengers served: 2,362
•       Number of air carrier flights (over 12,500 lbs): 216
•       Number of air taxi flights (under 12,500 lbs): 470
•       Number of military flights: 3,990
•       Number of general aviation flights (private jets, small propeller driven aircraft,
        corporate jets): 1,175
Circulation planning issues relating to airport facilities include widening of the Avenue P-
8 corridor to an ultimate freeway right-of-way; the future extension of high-speed rail
service to the airport; and the barrier effect of the airport facility (along with Plant 42) on
through traffic between Sierra Highway and 50th Street East. These issues have been
dealt with in the circulation policies and plan map.
Land use planning issues relating to airport facilities include the effects of noise and
safety in overflight areas. To the extent feasible, these issues have been dealt with on
the Land Use Plan, and in the Safety and Noise Elements. Where existing development
within overflight areas precluded full compliance with airport land use policies, these
uses were recognized on the Land Use Plan; this situation occurred within a narrow
strip of land south of Avenue Q between 10th and 25th Streets East. However, the City
has identified future airport expansion as a unique opportunity for Palmdale, and has
affirmed its intent to protect future airport operations throughout the Elements of this
General Plan.
A significant environmental issue relating to airport operations as preservation of air
quality; policies for protection of air quality from increased airport use are included in the
Environmental Resource Element.
In January, 1992, the County Airport Land Use Commission adopted a County-wide
Comprehensive Airport Land Use Plan. This plan considers the future expansion of
Palmdale Regional Airport, and contains policies for future land uses adjacent to the
airport in order to protect air operations. This General Plan is consistent with the
County's Airport Land Use Plan, as required by state law.

Circulation
E.       Circulation Considerations
Provision of adequate circulation is vital to the long-term planned development of the
City. Additionally, maintaining air, rail and transit links between the City and the
surrounding region is critical for sustaining economic development and developing jobs
for Palmdale residents. Construction of needed circulation facilities will occur over a
long time frame. The primary challenge for the City is to assure that adequate
circulation facilities are properly phased and available for use at the time they are
needed. The rate at which circulation facilities are constructed will be affected by the
following considerations:
1.       Fiscal Constraints
The fundamental element of the City's circulation system is the roadway network, most
of which will be constructed incrementally as the adjacent property develops. Some
portions of the network may need to be constructed prior to the development of the
adjacent property in order to maintain connectivity and levels of service. Other
circulation facilities, such as railroad crossings or bridges, may be regionally beneficial
and require cost of construction to be spread beyond adjacent properties. Potential
funding sources for these special circulation facilities may include traffic impact fees,
special assessment or Mello Roos districts, and transportation improvement funds. The
City will need to continue to use public financing districts where necessary, and explore
other creative ways of obtaining financing to build circulation facilities as needed to
adequately serve ongoing development.
2.       Development Patterns
The City has developed in a dispersed pattern with vacant areas surrounded by new
development. This scattered development pattern makes inefficient use of circulation
facilities and increases the per unit cost of constructing the future roadway network.
General Plan policies encourage infill development to efficiently utilize the existing
roadway network and require new development to support itself, without significantly
impacting existing residents.
3. Environmental Considerations
The construction and future use of the City's planned circulation system could affect the
natural environment in a variety of ways. For example, grading for roadways could
potentially displace plant and animal communities, alter landforms or disturb cultural
resources. Future use of the circulation system will affect air quality, noise and growth
within the region. However, the planned circulation system is not an independent
development project, but rather is intended as a tool which will allow the community to

                                                                              Circulation
develop according to the proposed Land Use Plan and allow the community to realize
many of its economic development goals. The goals of environmental protection and
economic development may at times conflict, requiring the City to consider alternatives
and strike a balance between both needs.
4.      The Need to Retrofit Roadway Improvements into Developed Areas
Several rural areas, which are not currently within the City boundaries but are expected
to be annexed within the life of the General Plan, lack paved roadways and through
streets. The City will need to develop programs to fund and construct needed roadway
improvements, without financially impacting the City or overburdening the affected
property owners in these annexation areas.
5.      Regulation from Other Agencies
Development of the City's planned circulation system will be influenced by a variety of
regulatory entities. Southern Pacific Railroad will influence decisions on where railroad
crossings will occur and whether the crossings are at grade or grade separated.
Caltrans administers the State's highway system and has jurisdiction over state highway
routing, placement of on- and off-ramps, and over and under crossings. The Planning
Area is part of SCAG, which influences circulation decisions through its adopted
Regional Mobility Plan. Circulation planning in the City is also subject to review by the
Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which functions as the Congestion
Management Agency. Additionally, many of the north/south routes through the western
portion of the Antelope Valley connect the cities of Lancaster and Palmdale and much
of our public transit network is interconnected. Substantial coordination between the
two cities and the other regulatory agencies is necessary in order to achieve a cohesive
plan and to coordinate development within the region.
6.      Jobs/Housing Imbalance
The City's current jobs/housing imbalance places a strain on the freeway and regional
arterials, due to large numbers of commuters using these facilities. Among Palmdale
residents who work, about 80 percent must commute to employment in the San
Fernando Valley and Los Angeles metropolitan area. Over the past several years, the
City has actively promoted economic development and the creation of jobs within the
Planning Area. Continued improvement in the jobs/housing ratio is needed to mitigate
commuter impacts on regional roadways and freeways.
                                          C-75                 Adopted by City Council
                                                                                  1/25/93
Circulation
7.      New Technology
Given the long-term nature of the General Plan, new technology may develop which
could alter the way in which people travel. Development of a high speed rail project
linking downtown Los Angeles with the San Fernando Valley and Palmdale could
significantly alter the commuting patterns of thousands of Palmdale residents. At some
point during the build-out period of the General Plan, a rapid transit system could be
developed to serve the needs of Palmdale residents. Advances in transportation
technology such as these could alter the needs, goals and implementation programs of
the City's Circulation Element.
8.      Regional Impacts.
Land use decisions and transportation planning within the City of Palmdale will affect
traffic and circulation in the cities of Lancaster and Santa Clarita, unincorporated county
areas, and even the City of Los Angeles. In turn, land use and transportation decisions
made by these jurisdictions will impact roadways in Palmdale. The need to assess and
mitigate regional impacts (both to and from the City of Palmdale) will remain a challenge
in implementing this Circulation Plan.

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
The Environmental Resources Element addresses the related issues of resource
conservation and open space, and provides a basis to evaluate existing resources and
plan for their protection. The goal of this Element is to improve the long-term quality of
life for Palmdale residents through the rational management of natural resources and
open space lands. The Element establishes policies concerning air, water, land open
space, recreation, and energy resources that relate to their conservation, preservation,
and managed use. The Element has been divided into four major issue areas: open
space, conservation, outdoor amenities, and scenic highways.
Open space refers to land devoted to the conservation of on-site resources, resource
management, or outdoor recreation areas kept undeveloped because of public health
and safety concerns. In order for residents to continuously avail themselves of the
aesthetic, recreational, and public health benefits of open space, the state mandates
that cities include open space and conservation elements in their general plan. These
elements shall provide a comprehensive management program for the environment.
Because the earth’s resources are limited, there must be conservation and managed
use of local resources. Water, soil, and minerals are valuable but finite resources.
Their continued use can only be possible with conservation. The protection of animal
and plant habitats, especially of endangered species, is also necessary to limit
disruption of ecological cycles. Landforms, geologic features, historic and archaeologic
resources all contribute to the unique character of Palmdale.
Scenic highways provide the motorist with visual stimulation and passive recreation.
Official scenic highways are designated by the State Scenic Highway Advisory
Committee after plans have been adopted and submitted by the local jurisdiction.
Highways eligible for such designation are listed in the Streets and Highways Code.
Official county scenic highways are also designated by the State Scenic Highway
Advisory Committee on application from the local jurisdiction. The Environmental
Resources Element provides for the local designation of scenic highways and corridors
and considers both official scenic highways and roadways not yet registered with the
State.
The Environmental Resources Element is related to many of the other elements of the
General Plan. This is due to the fact that most planning issues share components of
more than one element. For example, policies relating to hillside development
standards appear in the Land Use, Safety, and Environmental Resources Elements,
and will appear in the Community Design Element.
                                           ER-1                Adopted by City Council

Environmental Resources
In summary, the Environmental Resources Element serves the following purposes:
•   The Environmental Resources Element combines the state-mandated Open Space
    and Conservation Elements to partially fulfill the requirements of the California
    Surface Mining and Reclamation Act and the regulations in Section 65530 et seq. of
    the Government Code of the State of California.
•   The Element informs the public of the goals and policies of the City concerning
    conservation, open space, outdoor recreation, and scenic highways. It also provides
    an implementation program to serve as a guide for the day-to-day operational
    decisions of City staff.
•   The Element evaluates the state of environmental resources in the City, and
    identifies concerns and opportunities. It addresses the impacts of human activities
    on the environment and provides management measures to prevent the loss,
    destruction, and neglect of the area's significant resources.

GOAL ER6: Ensure an adequate supply of mineral resources to meet long-term
regional construction needs.
Objective ER6.1: Recognize the regional importance of the classified and designated
mineral deposits within Palmdale's Planning Area (as described in Special Report 143,
Part V, Classification of Sand and Gravel Resource Areas, Saugus-Newhall Production-
Consumption Region and Palmdale Production-Consumption Region, and Designation
Report No. 6, Designation of Regionally Significant Construction Aggregate Resource
Areas in the Saugus-Newhall and Palmdale Production-Consumption Regions and as
shown on Exhibits ER-1B and ER-1C) and discourage encroachment of incompatible
land uses which could threaten the long-term viability of sand and gravel mining and
processing operations in the Little Rock Wash area.
       Policy ER6.1.1: Establish a Mineral Resource Extraction (MRE) designation.
       Permitted uses within the MRE designation shall consist of mineral resource
       extraction (quarrying) and quarry related uses. Non-quarry related uses shall be
       permitted within the MRE area only when the Planning Commission has made
       the following findings:
       1.      The proposed use is compatible with and will not be detrimental to existing
               and future quarrying operations; and
       2.      Long-term regional aggregate needs have been evaluated and available
               resources will remain adequate to meet the future needs of the market
               region.
       Policy ER6.1.2: Prohibit incompatible land uses within the MRE designation.

Environmental Resources
      Policy ER6.1.4:       The State designated Mineral Resource Areas within
      Palmdale's jurisdiction shall be included in the City's Mineral Resource Extraction
      (MRE) designation to the maximum extent feasible.               In determining the
      boundaries of the MRE area, or in considering any proposed changes to these
      boundaries, the City shall weigh the following considerations:
      1.    The short term and long term economic importance to the region of
            conserving and developing aggregate resources;
      2.    The economic multiplier effect on industries, such as construction and
            trucking, derived from assuring a long-term low cost source of aggregate
            materials within the Palmdale Production-Consumption Region;
      3.    The location of State Designated Resource Areas;
      4.    The location of existing structures and projects under construction and the
            impact of quarrying operations on these uses;
      5.    The location of previously approved (entitled) projects and the impact of
            quarrying operations on these uses; and,
      6.    The location of property owned by entities not subject to regulation by the
            City.
      Policy ER6.1.5: In order to assure the long term viability of present and future
      quarry operations, the boundaries of the City's MRE designation should be
      designed so as to minimize interface problems between future land uses within
      the MRE area and future land uses outside of the MRE area. The following
      physical issues should be considered in establishing the boundary for the MRE
      designation:
      1.    Noise and dust generation from quarrying operations and from the
            transportation of aggregate materials from the quarry sites;
      2.    Aesthetics/visual impacts;
      3.    Access to future quarry sites;

SECTION 3: IMPLEMENTATION
Environmental resource management in the Planning Area will be accomplished
through interdependent programs and standards. The implementation programs
identified are discussed in detail below.
A.      California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Division 13 of the Public Resources
Code) was passed in 1970 to protect the quality of the environment. The City will
continue to implement CEQA as it is amended from time to time, through adoption of
City CEQA guidelines and procedures.
The program EIR for the City of Palmdale General Plan documents existing
environmental conditions and provides an assessment of citywide and regional impacts
expected to occur as development takes place under the General Plan. The EIR serves
as the mechanism for evaluating proposed discretionary projects that may impact the
area's resources and for providing appropriate mitigation measures.                              New
implementation programs will be incorporated into the City's CEQA guidelines.
The General Plan EIR also contains a mitigation monitoring plan. In compliance with
AB 3180 (Cortese), a mitigation monitoring plan must be adopted prior to project
implementation. This document may be utilized to ensure that mitigation of project-
specific impacts is undertaken in a timely manner. It also provides a feedback
mechanism for determining the success of the City's CEQA guidelines and the
effectiveness of mitigation programs.
B.      Archaeological, Historical and Paleontological Measures                         (General  Plan
        Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
Historical, archaeological, and paleontological resource information maps have been
prepared for use by City staff to identify areas with a high potential for resource
sensitivity. The maps are used to evaluate the need for cultural resource surveys prior
to development. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
Developments in areas which are likely to contain cultural resources will be required to
perform surveys and submit reports. When resources are identified, appropriate testing
and preservation, mitigation, or salvage will be required.
                                                  ER-17                Adopted by City Council
                                                                                            1/25/93
Environmental Resources
C.    Biological Measures
1.    The City will require biological assessments and reports for projects in known or
      suspected natural habitat areas prior to project approval. These reports will be
      used to establish significant natural habitat areas and ecologically sensitive
      zones in order to prevent disturbance and degradation of these areas.
      Recommended mitigation measures as identified in the reports will be required to
      be implemented as development occurs.
2.    The City will participate in a multi-jurisdictional habitat preservation plan for the
      West Mojave Desert area (West Mojave Coordinated Management Plan), and
      will implement the provisions of this Plan after adoption by the City Council.
D.    Air Quality Measures
1.    The City shall comply with the Antelope Valley Air Quality Management District
      requirements to implement the Tier I, II and III control measures described in the
      South Coast Air Quality Management Plan (SCAQMP), to the extent these
      measures apply to Palmdale. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14,
      2004.)
2.    To reduce mobile source emissions the City will implement a trip reduction
      ordinance. The ordinance should consider the number of Vehicle Miles Travelled
      (VMT) estimated to be generated from each new development project in
      accordance with the requirements of AVAQMD, Los Angeles County
      Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and other affected agencies. (General
      Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
3.    Also, the City should support legislation that would provide tax incentives for
      developers to establish work centers in housing-rich Palmdale, and vanpool tax
      credit legislation which includes such provisions as granting tax exempt status to
      compensation received for specific ridesharing programs; allowing tax deductions
      for employees who rideshare; and special tax credits for alternative-fuel vehicles.
      (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
4.    To the extent feasible, the following measures shall be implemented to reduce
      emissions from Palmdale Airport (PMD):
      a.      Reduce vehicle miles travelled to Palmdale Regional Airport through an
              Airport Ground Access Program for airport employers and passengers;
Adopted by City Council                        ER-18
1/25/93

   b.       Reduce emissions by using ground power systems that include centralized
            air conditioning systems, while aircraft are parked at terminal gates;
   c.       Encourage the Airport Operator and AVAQUM to have all carriers use only
            Stage III aircraft in scheduled fleets using PMD; (General Plan Amendment 04-01,
            adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
   d.       Recommend a "gate hold" procedure at PMD;
   e.       Advocate a design for high speed taxiways that most effectively reduces
            emissions and conserves fuel;
   f.       Implement an engine shut down program if the benefit in reduction of
            ROG and CO emissions and energy conservation exceeds the adverse
            impact of increased NOx emissions;
   g.       Develop procedures to reduce fuel use by ground support vehicles, and
            ultimately to rely completely on cleaner alternate fuels.
6. To reduce emissions from natural gas combustion and electricity generation, the
   City will incorporate the most energy-efficient design consistent with a
   reasonable rate of return when retrofitting existing facilities and equipment in City
   buildings. In addition, the City will develop a public information program on
   energy conservation and cooperate with utilities to encourage energy audits of
   existing structures, identifying levels of existing energy uses and potential
   conservation measures.
7. Also, the City will analyze the potential for the alternative use of any public
   facility, which is slated to be closed or consolidated with another facility, as a
   neighborhood work center; this policy should be communicated to affected
   agencies, such as the school board and library commission.
8. Finally, the City will adopt appropriate ordinances relating to trip reduction, non-
   motorized transportation, employer rideshare and transit incentives, parking
   management, merchant transportation incentives, auto use restrictions, and truck
   routing to both achieve compliance with the Antelope Valley Air Quality
   Management Plan and to implement City programs and standards. (General Plan
   Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)

E.      Parks, Recreation and Trails Element
Parks and recreation facilities will be developed according to a master plan as contained
in the City's Parks, Recreation and Trails Element. The provision of parks and
recreation areas in the Planning Area will ensure a full range of active and passive
recreational activities to residents and visitors alike. The City's Parks, Recreation and
Trails Element contains a complete description of existing parks and criteria for siting
new parks in Palmdale.
F.      Trail System
The City will ensure development and maintenance of a multi-purpose (equestrian,
hiking, and bicycle) trail system throughout the Planning Area. The trail system will
ultimately connect existing national forest trails to parks and recreation areas in the
region. This system will provide an alternative means of travel to and through natural
areas and along scenic roads. Plans and implementation measures for trail systems
are contained in the Parks, Recreation and Trails Element. (General Plan Amendment 04-01,
adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
G.      Scenic Roadway Designations
The City shall protect scenic highways in the Planning Area. Scenic highways and
roads have been identified in Policy ER1.2.2 of Section 2. They include the Antelope
Valley Freeway south of Avenue R, Barrel Springs Road, Tierra Subida Avenue, Sierra
Highway (south of Avenue S), and Elizabeth Lake Road, Pearblossom Highway,
Bouquet Canyon Road, and Godde Hill Road. These roadways possess scenic
qualities that have provided outdoor recreation experience to travelers and hikers.
Exhibit ER-1 shows the location of these locally significant scenic streets and highways.
(General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
The City should apply to the State Scenic Highway Advisory Committee for State
designation of these roadways. This designation could afford visitors the enjoyment of
views along the routes and provide extra protection to this resource.
The City will establish a design criteria for designated scenic highways that requires
specific design standards for nearby development. These standards could include the
following: height limits to preserve view corridors, limits or standards for outdoor
advertising and signs, maintenance of roadside landscaping, limits on grading activities
along highways, and the prohibition of overhead utility rights-of-way along scenic
highways. In addition, a visual impact analysis may be required for developments within
the overlay zone in order to preserve the visual qualities of scenic routes.

H.      Mining Standards
In accordance with the provisions of the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA)
and subsequent amendments, the City of Palmdale has adopted an ordinance
implementing mineral resource management policies.                Mining within designated
aggregate resource areas requires approval of a conditional use permit (CUP) before
operations begin. The CUP shall be granted for a period of time as specified by the
Planning Commission with renewals approved by the Planning Commission. In
addition, renewal of the CUP is dependent on the success of proposed mitigation
measures for residual hazards. The ordinance also requires a reclamation plan for
returning the site to reusable condition following cessation of mining operations. State
environmental regulations require ongoing monitoring of operations to ensure adequate
mitigation of adverse impacts.
The City has developed standards for mining activity in the Planning Area in conjunction
with the Mineral Resource Extraction (MRE) land use designation (Exhibit LU-2).
Mineral resource extraction is appropriate in these areas, as along as it complies with
the following conditions:
1.      Approval of a reclamation plan in compliance with the state Surface Mining and
        Reclamation Act (SMARA), as amended, and City regulations.
2.      Standards for development in areas adjacent to the MRE designations require
        that all new residential, commercial or industrial development provide buffering
        from quarrying operations that will conform to policies contained in the General
        Plan relating to noise, dust control, traffic or other impacts identified through the
        environmental review process. Where the Mineral Resource Extraction (MRE)
        land use designation is adjacent to existing or approved but unbuilt development,
        the responsibility for buffering impacts of quarry operations shall be upon the
        quarry operator. Where the MRE designation is adjacent to vacant land which
        has no approvals for development, the responsibility for buffering shall be shared
        by the future developer of the vacant property. In all cases, concentrated noise
        generators shall require buffering from the boundaries of the MRE designation to
        mitigate noise impacts on adjacent uses.
3.      One of the Mineral Resource Extraction areas covers a major groundwater
        recharge area and there exists a potential for groundwater contamination; thus,
        mining is not permitted below the groundwater level or to a level as determined
        through environmental analysis. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April
        14, 2004.)
                                           ER-21                  Adopted by City Council
                                                                                         1/25/93
Environmental Resources
4.     Noise impacts must be minimized by ensuring that the noise level at the property
       line is 65 dBA CNEL or less, when noise-sensitive uses or designations abut the
       quarry.
5.     Mining areas must be fenced with a 6-foot view obstructing fence, wall, or
       landscaped berm along public streets or adjacent to residential areas.
6.     Use of asphalt and petroleum-based materials, or other operations which may
       impair groundwater quality, in the Mineral Resource Extraction designation are
       prohibited, unless substantial evidence is provided to demonstrate that such uses
       will not have significant impact on groundwater or other resources.
7.     Safety measures for routine operations shall be established prior to permit
       approval.
8.     As the Little Rock Wash MRE area may potentially contain sensitive ecological
       habitat, and has been indicated on the General Plan Land Use map as
       Significant Ecological Area (SEA) overlay zone, appropriate steps shall be taken
       to identify, and protect any significant flora and fauna.
9.     All mining operations in the Little Rock Wash area shall incorporate flood plain
       management provisions into their operations.
I.     Native Desert Vegetation Ordinance
The City has adopted Ordinance No. 952, referred to as the Native Desert Vegetation
Ordinance. This ordinance is designed to preserve a number of specimen quality
juniper and Joshua trees which add to community identity, and to encourage the use of
native vegetation in new development landscaping.                All landscaping for new
developments must conform to the requirements set forth in the Native Desert
Vegetation Ordinance. In keeping with the intent of this Ordinance, the City may require
preservation of significant stands through use of the Specific Plan process or equivalent
planning process, and through design review processes on individual projects.
J.     Landscaping Standards
The City has adopted landscaping standards which address the following needs:
1.     Reestablishment of compatible native plant materials on newly graded areas;
2.     Landscaping of exposed slopes and graded areas for erosion control;
Adopted by City Council                     ER-22
1/25/93
                                                                         Environmental Resources
3.       Water and energy conservation techniques, such as drip irrigation, drought
         tolerant species, and alluvial rockscape;
4.       Use of fire resistant vegetation and fuel modification techniques; and
5.       Use of drought-tolerant plants to help in conserving water.
The City's Landscape Architect will review landscape plans for all new development to
ensure compliance with the City's landscape requirements. This process allows the City
an opportunity to promote native vegetation and set guidelines for landscaping and
irrigation. The City has developed a listing of recommended plant species for perimeter
landscaping and for use in the landscaping of new development. In addition, the City
has compiled a separate listing of representative plant species found in the western
Mojave Valley for use in developing "native" landscaping plans. Both listings are
available to the public in the City's Planning and Engineering Departments and will
continue to be utilized to ensure compliance with City landscaping standards.
K.       Hillside Ordinance
The City has adopted a Hillside Management Ordinance to protect the hillsides from
insensitive development. The ordinance contains standards which apply to areas with a
natural slope of 10 percent or more. Development standards for hillsides are further
discussed in the implementation section of the Safety Element. In addition to safety
benefits, these standards will help to preserve open space and visually prominent
landforms. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
L.       Open Space and Conservation Plan
The City's Parks, Recreation and Trails Element includes an open space and
conservation plan to plan the acquisition and maintenance of vital open space areas.
This plan will help coordinate efforts to provide open space and recreation opportunities
to residents, as well as preserving sensitive habitats and species, where present. The
Ritter Ridge, Portal Ridge, Little Rock Wash, Big Rock Wash and Alpine Butte areas,
shown on the Overlay Map and Exhibit ER-5, should be evaluated to determine the
nature and extent of any significant ecological areas, and an appropriate financing
mechanism to acquire those areas of particular importance. All available regional, state
and federal funding will be solicited in order to acquire targeted significant ecological
areas. The plan also includes criteria to identify appropriate new open space areas and
to evaluate potential additions to the open space network. Additionally, the City may
require dedication of open space, when appropriate, as a part of the development
review process. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)

M.      Species of Special Concern
The City shall continue to promote the protection of sensitive, rare, threatened, and
endangered species found in the Planning Area through biological surveys required as
part of the CEQA review process. The City will coordinate with the California
Department of Fish and Game and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service to determine the
best means of providing protection. In addition, the City is participating in the
preparation of the West Mojave Coordinated Management Plan, which will provide
management prescriptions for desert tortoise and Mojave ground squirrel.
The City shall identify and inventory areas of significant sensitive ecological habitat and
shall prohibit disturbance of these areas to the extent feasible.
The City shall establish preventative measures where sensitive ecological areas have
been determined to occur adjacent to equestrian trails. These measures could include
use of interpretive signage to discourage vandalism or relocation of the trail away from
the sensitive zone.
N.      Community Design Element                (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April
        14, 2004.)
The City will review proposed developments to ensure compliance with the policies
adopted in the Community Design Element of the General Plan. The City's Community
Design Element has been developed to guide public and private decisions in the
process of the City's physical development. The standards encompass physical
aspects including architecture, landscaping, roadways, landmarks, signage, open space
and views, and the overall image of the City in relationship to its surroundings. These
standards are implemented through zoning, specific plans or development plan review.
(General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
O.      Agreements with Other Entities
The City of Palmdale will pursue agreements with other jurisdictions or entities, such as
local school districts, utility easement holders, and the County of Los Angeles to
provide more recreational opportunities for Palmdale residents. These agreements can
be formal contracts or memoranda of understanding and can help eliminate the
duplication of services. Agreements can provide for public recreation on school
grounds and allow for the joint use of other public and private facilities.

P.      Development Fees/Park Land or Open Space Dedication
Based upon its adopted Parkland Ordinance, the City of Palmdale will require the
dedication of parkland or the payment of a parks fee by new developments in the City.
The fees or land must be used to provide new land for parks or to subsidize the
acquisition and maintenance of parks. This measure ensures that residents of new
developments will eventually have access to adequate parks and recreation facilities
without overburdening the City's financial resources. Dedication may also be used to
acquire open space areas. Fees and land dedication are further discussed in the Parks,
Recreation and Trails Element.
Q.      Park Needs Surveys
The Parks and Recreation Department will periodically assess the community's park
needs and adjust park programs accordingly, by conducting surveys of park users to
evaluate existing programs and types of park use (active, passive, etc.). Present and
future park needs will be evaluated pursuant to the City's Parks, Recreation and Trails
Element.
R.      Groundwater Recharge Program
The City will cooperate with local water providers and flood control agencies to develop
a groundwater recharge program. The City can contribute to this effort by ensuring that
major recharge areas be kept undeveloped to aid in water recharge.
S.      Water Recycling and Reuse
The City should continue to monitor, along with the Los Angeles County Sanitation
District, the feasibility of expanding water reuse programs. Treated wastewater is
currently used to irrigate some agricultural areas growing non-food crops. With the
growing population, supplies of treated water will increase. Treated wastewater might
be used to irrigate roadside and commercial landscaping, in addition to agricultural
lands, to help conserve Palmdale's limited fresh water resources. The City may offer
incentives to agricultural, commercial, and residential developments that use recycled
water for irrigation. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
T.      Master Drainage Plan
The City's Master Drainage Plan indicates natural drainage courses in Palmdale and
other areas sensitive to flooding. Groundwater recharge areas are noted which could
aid the City in developing water conservation programs. The City will actively pursue
the construction of drainage facilities recommended in the plan and address
                                              ER-25                      Adopted by City Council

development restrictions in floodplain areas.                  The City's Master Drainage Plan is
discussed in the Public Services Element.
U.     Land Use Element
The City shall review proposed developments for compliance with the Land Use
Element. The Land Use Element outlines the desired pattern of development for
Palmdale and its sphere of influence. This land use plan can work in conjunction with
other City programs to guide development to an appropriate pace and pattern. Land
use approvals for individual projects will provide consistency with general development,
conservation, and open space plans.
V.     Cultural Resources
The City will map all known historic, archaeological, and paleontological resources and
ensure the protection of these resources. The City will review plans for development in
potentially sensitive areas. Development in paleontologically and archaeologically
sensitive areas where impacts cannot be mitigated will be discouraged.
W.     Circulation Element
The City shall implement its adopted Transportation Demand Management Plan.
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) plans can reduce the use of private
automobiles in the Palmdale Planning Area. The implementation of ridesharing,
vanpools, and other transportation programs can reduce automobile emissions and help
improve local air quality. TDM plans are discussed in the Circulation Element. (General
Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
X.     Alternate Energy Sources
The City shall support programs designed to reduce energy consumption and to utilize
alternative energy sources.
Y.     Regional Coordination
The City shall coordinate with Los Angeles County, the City of Lancaster and the City of
Santa Clarita in addressing issues which affect the Antelope Valley, such as traffic,
open space, air pollution, and natural resource issues.

SECTION 4: ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
This Element of the Palmdale General Plan considers a wide range of issues, to ensure
that future development in the City of Palmdale and its Planning Area is sensitive to the
environment. This section of the Element describes existing conditions in the Planning
Area and provides the supporting analysis that led to the recommended goals, policies,
and implementation measures contained in previous sections. Additionally, more
detailed information on each issue can be found in the program Environmental Impact
Report for the General Plan.
A.      The Environment
The City of Palmdale is located in the Antelope Valley, in the western portion of the
Mojave Desert. The Planning Area is just north of Soledad Canyon, north of the San
Gabriel Mountains, with sections of the Sierra Pelona Range bordering the Planning
Area on the southwest. The Planning Area ranges in altitude from 2,450 feet to 2,700
feet with the surrounding mountains rising up to 4,000 feet above sea level. The
topography varies from almost flat with occasional drainages and sand dunes on the
valley floor to steep foothill and mountain areas on the south. The San Andreas Fault
traverses the Planning Area parallel to and just north of the mountains. Junipers,
Joshuas trees, and desert chaparral are found in scattered areas throughout the City.
Natural drainage channels, including the Amargosa, and Anaverde Creek and Little
Rock and Big Rock Washes run generally north and northeast across the Planning Area
toward the Rosamond and Rogers dry lakes. The City is bounded on the north by the
City of Lancaster. Rural unincorporated county areas characterized by a number of
desert buttes extend eastward from the Planning Area.
The climate is characteristic of the southern Mojave Desert. The mountain ranges block
cool, moist coastal air and create hot, dry summers and cold winters. Seasonal rains
(thunderstorms) are common but creeks are dry during much of the year. Mean
temperatures range from 18°F in January to 108°F in July, with a daily average range of
46° to 77°F. Annual rainfall ranges from 5 to 11 inches and occasional snow can be
expected during winter.
Recent population growth has been spurred by the availability of relatively affordable
housing and proximity to major employment centers, as well as annexation. In turn, the
housing boom has created a demand for retail goods and service providers and new
industrial development has begun to increase in the past few years. Development
patterns are not concentric from the City center; rather they are generally irregular and
dispersed. Existing development has generally followed an east/west pattern, extending
from about 75th Street West to about 75th Street East (145 miles). This area will likely
experience continued infill development over the next several years due to the approval
                                       ER-28                  Adopted by City Council
                                                                                  1/25/93

Environmental Resources
of several large residential specific plans in the south and southwest portions of the City
as well as a resurgence in development interest posed by land owners following the
recession of the 1990s. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
Relative to environmental resources, population growth means the expansion and
intensification of human activity and ensuing development. The state of the natural
environment changes with the advent of this development. Animal and plant life is
disturbed, land forms may be changed, air quality can deteriorate, and water supply and
natural resources may be depleted. Population growth and development in the
Palmdale area has altered natural habitats, bringing in new forms of animal and plant
life, and limiting access to underlying resources.               These consequences could
permanently modify the ecology of the area.
To ensure that ecological balance is maintained, most projects are required to assess
their environmental impacts before approval and implementation. The City encourages
development to the extent that harmful effects are mitigated. At times, however,
development is incremental and the consequences to the environment may go
undetected. The cumulative effects of many projects magnify environmental changes
considered minor for one project, sometimes resulting in biological degradation.
However, at that point, projects may be in place and mitigation measures no longer
easily implemented. One purpose of this Element is to identify particularly valuable
open space resources and plan for their preservation on a Citywide basis.
The location and amount of open space partly determines the quality of the
environment. Natural and scenic landscapes provide psychological relief to daily
stresses, aside from health and safety functions. Recreation promotes physical and
mental health and, thus, should be encouraged and supported. However, the pressures
for development compete with the need for open spaces. The economic returns
promised by intensive land uses often overshadow the public health and safety benefits
of undeveloped land, particularly for the individual land owner. Yet urbanization does
not necessarily mean the destruction of environmental resources; only the need to
recognize and plan for a balance between development and open space preservation.
The need for environmental resource management stems from these concerns.
Through guidance, regulation, and support, the City intends to promote a balance
between natural and man-made environments.

B.      Environmental Issues
1.      Open Space
Open space is generally defined as areas that are not built upon and may include both
man-made and natural landscapes. The term refers to all land and water in the
Planning Area that has value for recreation, conservation, historic, or scenic purposes,
and is not covered by buildings or streets. Open space can separate or unify urban
functions or areas, depending on its form and location. In addition, open space
provides opportunities for resource production, enjoying scenic views, conservation of
habitat and natural resources, outdoor recreation, public health and safety, and
development management and control.
A wide variety of open spaces currently exist within the Planning Area. The Ritter Ridge
area may contain unique geologic features and plant and animal resources. Mature and
significant stands of native vegetation are also found in scattered undeveloped areas.
There are remnants of Palmdale's agricultural past, such as almond orchards near
Godde Hill. Lake Palmdale is a cold water reservoir that offers recreational uses to
members of the Fin and Feather Club. Perhaps the largest area of open space in the
Planning Area is the surrounding hills and mountains, which provide a scenic backdrop
to Palmdale.
The undeveloped state of private lands does not ensure long term preservation of open
space areas. If a look at Palmdale shows vast open areas, this condition is directly
related to the amount of vacant land and existing low-density development, not because
these areas are designated open space. Much of the land currently vacant is planned
for development. Unless vacant land is designated as open space, it is likely that most
of it may be developed during the life of this plan.
A comprehensive plan for open space will help to retain those areas most suited to
open space and to focus development elsewhere. The plan is expected to deal with
significant ecological areas, park sites, and scenic highway concerns, as well. When
possible, open space corridors will be designed with the intention of preserving selected
riparian areas, canyons, ravines, and ridge lines. The open space network should be
designed in conjunction with equestrian and hiking trails and parks, as well as natural
areas. Open space areas will help to retain natural biotic communities, which contribute
to the natural beauty of the City.
Open space can successfully function under the multiple-use concept. For example,
land that is designated as a flood water retention basin may be used for recreational
purposes such as little league fields. This shows the relationship between the
preservation of open space and other resource issues addressed in this Element.
                                       ER-30                   Adopted by City Council
                                                                                  1/25/93
Environmental Resources
Open space in the Planning Area must be designated early to avoid land cost escalation
and competition for alternative land uses. Some areas, such as the earthquake rift
zones, landslide or rockslide prone areas, and areas with flooding or subsidence
problems have remained undeveloped to date because of the high cost of engineering
needed to meet state and federal safety standards. However, as development
increases and property values appreciate, it may become feasible to develop these
hazard zones as well. Building technology is also improving, allowing construction in
areas where it was previously not possible.
There are two primary ways that the City can preserve open space:
         •  Purchase or acquisition of specific parcels with characteristics that residents
            want to see preserved in open space.
         •  Requiring the design of all new development to include open space areas.
The purchase of vacant land for open space is limited by City funds available for such
purposes. Although the City and most residents agree that one of the most attractive
features of Palmdale has been the vast amount of open space, this open space is
difficult to preserve by regulation of development design. In the past, open spaces
provided by individual developments tended to be smaller, local parks which are
scattered instead of being arranged as a part of an overall system of open spaces.
However, on two large specific plans recently approved by the City, more than 7,000
acres was set aside as permanent, publicly accessible open space. This concept may
be utilized by other large developments as well, particularly in hillside areas.
2.       Conservation
The need for the conservation of natural resources stems from their limited supply.
Also, the benefits of conservation are not confined to the owners of the resource and
the immediate vicinity. Indirect users and the community at large benefit from resource
conservation and stand to lose from its depletion. Thus, it is in the interest of local
government to promote conservation. Depending on the nature of the resource,
conservation could include efficient use, managed production, or preservation.
Agricultural Resources
Currently, agricultural production in the Palmdale Planning Area primarily occurs on land
within the Los Angeles Department of Airports future Regional Airport site, nearly all of
which is under jurisdiction of Los Angeles County. (See Exhibit ER-1A.) According to
the Los Angeles Department of Airports, about 2,250 acres are currently being used for

agriculture use, with an additional 1,800 acres planned in 2004. Most of this land is
leased from the City of Los Angeles by L.A. County Sanitation District. The Sanitation
District will be expanding its production of non-food crops such as alfalfa hay by more
than 1,800 acres starting in the spring of 2004. Over 1,000 acres are also being farmed
between the airport property and Avenue L, which would total more than 5,050 acres
being farmed within Palmdale’s Planning Area. Crops consist of pistachio orchards,
pine and ornamental trees, alfalfa, sod, onion, carrots and tomatoes. This area is not
classified by the State as prime agricultural land. Agricultural production from these
parcels is not considered to be regionally significant, and is planned as an interim use
until such time as the Regional Airport is developed. It is not the City's goal to preserve
this area for permanent agricultural production. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City
Council April 14, 2004.)
Mineral Resources
Mineral resources include nonrenewable deposits of ore, stone, and earth materials.
Gold, copper, lead, silver, zinc, and manganese deposits are believed to be scattered
throughout the San Gabriel Mountains. The largest known resources of titanium in
California are found in the western San Gabriel Mountains. The majority of these
mines, however, have long been inactive.
Nonmetallic minerals of commercially significant quantities in the study area are located
in widely segregated areas. These include anorthosite, apatite, asbestos, barite,
borates, feldspar, fluorspar, graphite, and mica. Although their commercial production
may be doubtful, the presence of these materials should be considered, to the extent
possible, in land use planning as their location becomes known and mapped.
Known and potential major deposits of sand and gravel, crushed rock, clay, limestone,
and dolomite have also been identified in the Palmdale area by the State Division of
Mines and Geology. These mineral resources are used primarily in construction, and
statewide, rank second only to fuels in economic significance. Because transportation
costs are high for these materials, their value depends on proximity to the user. The
area's construction industries rely on local resources for aggregate supply in the region.
Sand and gravel deposits are found extensively in flood plains and stream channels
located north of the San Gabriel Mountains in the Little Rock and Big Rock Wash areas.
While its importance is often overlooked, sand and gravel is an essential commodity in
today's society. As a construction material, sand and gravel is a key component in
products such as portland cement concrete, asphaltic concrete, railroad ballast, stucco,
road base and fill. The availability of aggregate deposits and their proximity to markets
are critical factors in the strength of this region's economy.

Environmental Resources
Urban expansion has been the major cause of a decline in the availability or access to
significant sand and gravel resources. The loss of these deposits has occurred
because land use planning decisions have often been made without reference to
location and importance of these resources.
In an effort to remedy this problem, the State Surface Mining and Reclamation Act
(SMARA) provides for a mineral lands inventory process which the State terms
"Classification - Designation". The Department of Conservation, its Division of Mines
and Geology, and the State Mining and Geology Board are the State agencies
responsible for administering this process. The primary objective is to provide local
agencies -- such as cities and counties -- with information on the location, need and
importance of mineral resources within their jurisdiction. The second objective of this
process is to assure that this information will be considered in local land use planning
decisions. This second objective is implemented through the adoption of local general
plan mineral resource management polices.
The State Division of Mines and Geology has classified urbanizing lands within the
Palmdale Production-Consumption Region by Mineral Resource Zones (MRZs)
according to the presence or absence of significant sand, gravel, or stone deposits that
are suitable as sources of Portland cement concrete (P.C.C.) grade aggregate
(California Department of Conservation - California Division of Mines and Geology.
1987. Mineral Land Classification of the Greater Los Angeles Area. Special Report 143,
Part V - Classification of Sand and Gravel Resource Areas, Saugus-Newhall and
Palmdale Production-Consumption Regions). If a deposit contained more than $5
million worth (in 1978 dollars) of suitable material that could be extracted and marketed
profitably under present technologic conditions, or those which could be estimated to
exist in the foreseeable future, the deposit was classified MRZ-2. Two MRZ-2 areas
were classified within the Palmdale area. These two resource areas are associated
with the Little Rock Wash, the Big Rock Wash, and their respective stream beds, flood
plains and alluvial fans. Additionally, the State formally established the Palmdale
Production-Consumption Region, consisting of much of the western Antelope Valley,
including the Lancaster and Palmdale metropolitan areas. The Palmdale Production-
Consumption Region encompasses an area of about 1,103 square miles and presently
contains a population in excess of 150,000.
On January 3, 1987, the State designated two (MRZ-2) areas as "regionally significant"
mineral resource areas within the Palmdale area (see Exhibit LU-2) (California
Department of Conservation - CDMG and State Mining and Geology Board. Designation
of Regionally Significant Construction Aggregate Resource Areas in the Saugus-
Newhall and Palmdale Production-Consumption Regions. SMARA Designation Report
No. 6. January, 1987). Sector D on the exhibit corresponds with the Little Rock Wash
alluvial fan. The State has estimated that Sector D contains about 1000 million tons of

aggregate resources. Sector E corresponds with the Big Rock Wash alluvial fan and
lies almost entirely outside of Palmdale's Planning Area. (See Exhibit ER-1B and
Exhibit ER-1C.) The State has estimated that the designated resource areas within the
Palmdale Production-Consumption Region contain a total of about 2,155 million tons of
resources. The State has estimated that consumption within the Palmdale Production-
Consumption region within the next 50 years will be 122 million tons given present
growth rates, etc. and barring unforeseen events such as a natural disaster.
Sand and Gravel mining is currently occurring along Avenue S, east of 70th Street East.
The aggregate being extracted there is important to the construction industry in the
Antelope Valley and greater Los Angeles area. In accordance with State policy, the City
of Palmdale has established policies which will assure continued access to these
mineral resources, ensure that development occurring in the vicinity of mining
operations is adequately buffered from any adverse effects of the mining operations,
and that the extraction and processing of these mineral resources occurs without
competition from other incompatible land uses. Within this designation, the mixing of
raw sand and gravel materials with other processed ingredients for use throughout the
region will be allowed, provided safeguards are in place to prevent contamination of the
ground water or damage to sensitive ecological areas within the area. The Mineral
Resource Extraction (MRE) district has been designated on the Land Use Map to
recognize and permit extraction and processing of mineral resources. Generally, this
designation covers the area outlined by the State as the MRZ-2 area with the exception
of those lands that are either already developed or have already been approved for
development in prior years (see Land Use Map). The area designated for mineral
resource extraction on the Land Use Map contains approximately 600 million short tons
of resource reserves.
Water Resources
The Antelope Valley is an inland basin within the southwestern Mojave Desert. The
groundwater system consists of a principal (upper) and a deep (lower) aquifer covering
900 square miles separated vertically by lacustrine deposits (silts and clays deposited
when an inland lake covered the valley). These aquifers were formed by the uplifting of
the San Gabriel and Sierra Pelona Mountain Ranges, the Tehachapi Mountains, and
the Soledad Mountain upland. Subsequent erosion resulted in the deposition of up to
2,000 feet of alluvium and sediments in the Mojave Basin. The principal aquifer overlies
the lacustrine deposits and supplies all water pumped from wells in the Antelope Valley.
The deep aquifer underlies the deposits (see Exhibits ER-2 and ER-3). Water moves
downward from the principal aquifer to the deep aquifer on the western and southern
limits of the lacustrine deposits (Durbin 1978). Upward movement from the deep
aquifer to the principal aquifer occurs in areas of extensive pumping of groundwater.
                                        ER-34                   Adopted by City Council
                                                                                 1/25/93
Environmental Resources
Older alluvium deposits consist of silt, sand, gravel, and boulders characterized by their
ability to store and yield water. The complex interbedding, frequently found at depths
greater than 100 feet, has been exposed in the west Antelope Valley. In certain areas,
the deposition of sediments has resulted in impervious layers which block the downward
movement of irrigation and recharge toward the aquifers. This impervious sedimentary
layer has resulted in a temporary perched water condition around Lancaster, where
irrigation-recharge water is retained above the water table.
Younger alluvium deposits make up the alluvial fans found at the base of the San
Gabriel Mountains. These deposits are up to 100 feet thick but can be found at lesser
thickness, as far into the basin as the "playas". They act as conveyors of water, but
generally do not store a significant quantity. Silts and clays that are not deposited in the
alluvial fans are transported to lower sections of the basin by infrequent major storms.
The result of this deposition is the dry lake bed, or "playa".
The Mojave Basin consists of the Fremont and the Lancaster sub-basins, which are
divided into 15 sub-units. Sub-units have been isolated by differences in groundwater
elevation (caused by faults or consolidated rock masses) and in some instances, by
convenient, arbitrary boundaries. The Lancaster sub-basin contains six sub-units that
are wholly or partly in Los Angeles County.
The Lancaster sub-unit, largest of the sub-units, supplies the majority of groundwater to
the Planning Area. Groundwater movement is generally northeasterly from the foothills
of the San Gabriel and Sierra Pelona Mountains towards the Rosamond and Rodgers
Dry Lakes. Distorted movement occurs due to pumping depressions found at Antelope
Acres, Hi Vista, Quartz Hill, and Edwards Air Force Base. Water levels in these areas
have been observed to decline as much as 80 feet from 1952 to 1980; however,
available studies on groundwater supply within the Antelope Valley contain conflicting
information on groundwater levels. The cities of Palmdale and Lancaster, Los Angeles
County, and local water purveyors are undertaking a comprehensive groundwater study
which will further clarify this issue.
Perched groundwater often occurs at depths of less than 50 feet and may approach
depths of less than 25 feet after heavy rains or intensive irrigation. A perched condition
occurred extensively in the Lancaster area due to the presence of an alluvium-filled lake
bed. At one time, this condition resulted in artesian water in Lancaster. Due to
extensive pumping, however, artesian wells no longer occur.
A second subunit, referred to as the Pearland sub-unit, is located along the base of the
San Gabriel Mountains extending from Palmdale to Llano, with groundwater movement
from southeast to northwest toward the Lancaster sub-unit. There are no known

pumping depressions or perched conditions. Water is from 100 to 250 feet below the
surface.
The Buttes sub-unit is north of the Pearland sub-unit. Groundwater in the unit moves
northwest into the Lancaster sub-unit. Depth to water ranges from 50 to 250 feet. Data
from 1965 to 1982 show declines in water level of as much as 50 feet over this period.
Exhibit ER-4 shows the aquifer boundary and groundwater elevations during the spring
of 1984. The contours indicate the flow of groundwater within the aquifer. Groundwater
in the Buttes and Pearland sub-units migrate generally northwest toward the north-
central part of the Lancaster sub-basin. On the southern part of the Planning Area are
areas which are made up of consolidated bedrock that contain limited groundwater.
There are few wells in these areas and no data on water levels has been collected.
Because these areas are at a relatively higher elevation, they are sources of recharge
to the Lancaster sub-unit.
The chemical quality of the groundwater in the Mojave Basin is generally satisfactory for
domestic use and irrigation, as well as for most commercial and industrial uses. Total
dissolved solids range from 200 to 800 milligrams per liter, with hardness as high as
1950 milligrams per liter near Rogers Dry Lake. Although the present quality is
satisfactory, there is a trend toward poorer groundwater quality, due to urban runoff,
septic tank failures, declining water tables, and the perched condition in Lancaster.
The Antelope Valley is not part of the larger county recharge area. The surrounding
mountains funnel water towards the valley floor, thus providing the valley with a self-
contained water cycle. The total recharge is the quantity of water that goes back to the
underground basin or water source. Natural recharge of groundwater in the area is
through the percolation of surface water. The percolation of storm runoff in the alluvial
fans of the Amargosa and Anaverde Creeks, and Big Rock and Little Rock Washes
provides recharge to the Lancaster sub-basin. Recharge rates in the area are subject
to the fluctuation of winter rains. Occasional severe storms result in high runoff volumes
that flow across the valley floor on impervious soils and are lost to evapotranspiration.
The Little Rock and Lake Palmdale Reservoirs have been constructed to conserve a
portion of this excess runoff.
Overdrafting or pumping in excess of the recharge is prevalent in the Antelope Valley.
Groundwater wells serve 80 percent of Palmdale’s water needs and the California
Aqueduct provides the remaining 20 percent. Groundwater recharge through the
ground seepage of rainwater, however, is limited to an average of 9 inches of annual
rainfall (although local rainfall only averages 5.15 inches annually, rainfall in the higher
portions of the watershed is greater). With evaporation, the actual amount of water that
reaches the basins by percolation is even less.

Environmental Resources
The continued reliance on groundwater to meet current and increasing demands for
water due to rapid urbanization in the Valley has lowered the water table continuously.
Rates of decline ranging from 1-foot per year in non-pumping areas to 12 feet per year
in existing pumping depression drawdowns are not uncommon during the summer
pumping season. Although no current data are available, USGS estimates a 200 foot
decline in the water table in the last 60 years. Some water districts serving the Planning
Area have reported 6 foot declines per year in their wells. To counteract overdrafting,
the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works has established recharge
programs in the region. In 1987-88, 2,927.1 acre feet of local water was spread in the
Big Rock area to reduce the groundwater overdraft. Still, groundwater levels have
declined steadily in the Lancaster Basin.
Although Palmdale is considered dry desert land, there are surface water sources in the
area. Local streams are formed from rain and melting snow on the mountains. Ran
and snow, in the form of run-off, pass through canyon streams and into the valley. The
Amargosa and Anaverde Creeks, and Little Rock Wash are not perennial streams.
Surface flows occur only during occasional storms. Sheet wash is common over flat
areas as new water ways and channels are made when a storm Is unusually heavy.
Water ponds are found in winter, but dry up in summer due to evaporation. The Lake
Palmdale and the Little Rock Reservoirs serve as runoff catchment and storage areas
to help meet local water needs. They provide recreational opportunities to the public as
well. Surface waters in the Planning Area serve as biological habitats, recreational
resources, and a flood hazard.
Localized flooding in Palmdale occurs occasionally due to the runoff velocity from the
steep slopes. The high velocity does not allow substantial ground seepage and causes
intermittent floods in the flat lands. The velocity also makes the runoff erosive and
hazardous. Developed areas and some areas with impervious soils experience
increased runoff which overflow existing flood control facilities. This condition has
raised concerns for public health and safety.
Some areas in Palmdale have been developed using individual septic systems for each
home rather than being connected to a public sewer system. Septic systems are still
used in the non-urbanized portions of the Planning Area and in some of the developed
county island areas.        Septic systems must be maintained in order to avoid
contamination of the water in surrounding areas. Installation of an adequate public
sewer system may be necessary in order to preserve the quality of the groundwater
resource.

Biological Resources
The biological composition of the Palmdale area presents a transition zone from
montane plant communities to communities more commonly found in desert conditions
(see Exhibit ER-5). Naturally occurring wetlands in the area are either associated with
the existing stream courses of the Amargosa and Anaverde Creeks, the Little Rock and
Big Rock Washes, or upwelling groundwater along the San Andreas fault rift zone. For
example, the wetlands near Lake Palmdale were caused because the San Andreas
Fault interrupts underground water flow, diverting water to the surface.
Vegetation in the Planning Area consists of six plant communities: desert scrub,
junipers/Joshua tree woodland, ruderal, chaparral, oak woodlands, and riparian. Desert
scrub consists of widely-spaced evergreen and deciduous scrubs occupying gentle and
steep slopes that have gravelly to sandy soils. Sparse annual grasses and herbaceous
species grow in the understory. The junipers/Joshua tree woodland areas feature
California junipers and Joshua trees 10 to 15 feet in height and accompanied by a
diverse flora. Junipers are found on higher ground and Joshua trees on north-facing
slopes and the lower plains. Rapid development in the Palmdale area has raised
concerns about the destruction of large numbers of Joshua trees.
Ruderal communities are composed of weedy species on areas with loose soils, high
temperatures, intense light, and low moisture. Abandoned agricultural fields and over-
grazed desert scrub areas support ruderal plant species. Chaparral plants can be found
on dry, hot slopes with thin and rocky soil. These woody, thick-leaved shrubs, 4 to 8
feet in height, are adaptive to low moisture and fire. They can be found on the slopes of
the Sierra Pelona Mountains, integrated with the junipers and desert scrub
communities.
Oak woodlands are found in the Ritter Ranch area on higher north-facing slopes. They
are relatively dense and plant species diversity is high. The woodlands are dominated
by blue oaks, canyon live oaks, and desert scrub oaks. Understory plants are
predominantly shrubs associated with chaparral communities.
Riparian plant communities occur around drainage and low areas. Desert alluvial wash,
desert olive arroyo/canyon woodland, willow and cottonwood woodlands, and
freshwater alkali marsh are the major types of riparian communities in the Planning
Area.
Wildlife in Palmdale includes a variety of native and introduced species. Amphibians
are seasonally abundant in willow and cottonwood woodlands and freshwater marsh
habitats. Reptiles, small mammals, and a number of bird species also occur in the
Planning Area. Several sensitive animal species may be present in the area as

indicated by their preferred habitats. These include the Mohave ground squirrel, desert
tortoise, pale big-eared bat, white-eared pocket mouse, Le Conte's thrasher, sharp-
shinned hawk, Cooper's hawk, golden eagle, prairie falcon, and, less commonly, the
burrowing owl, tri-colored blackbird, long-eared owl, northern harrier, black-shouldered
kite, American badger, and San Diego horned lizard.
Although these areas are currently being considered for expansion, Los Angeles County
has identified five sensitive ecological areas (SEA) in the Planning Area (see Exhibit
ER-5). One is Little Rock Wash, which runs from the San Gabriel Mountains to the
Mojave Desert. It contains shadescale scrub, creosote bush scrub and desert riparian
habitats and provides a nesting habitat for birds and a variety of mammals. Little Rock
Wash supports diverse wildlife, serves as a migration corridor, and helps in the seed
dispersal of desert plants. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
Another SEA is Ritter Ridge, found between the Sierra Pelona foothills and the Antelope
Valley. Ritter Ridge has a mix of Joshua trees and California junipers on the northern
slopes; creosote bush scrub in the desert floor; and desert chaparral on the southern
slopes. The area is a refuge for migratory birds and a habitat of 97 vertebrate species.
The combination of desert and foothill plant species makes it a valuable ecological area.
The third SEA is Portal Ridge, which is northwest of Ritter Ridge. The area is relatively
large, supporting diverse plant species from both desert and montane types. Portal
Ridge provides an excellent resource for educational and scientific study.
Another sensitive ecological area is the Alpine Butte. Although it is largely located
outside the Planning Area, a portion covers the easternmost area between Avenues M
and P. The butte has sandy and rocky habitats with Joshua trees and creosote bush
scrubs. Birds roost and nest in the butte and large mammals forage and use the site for
denning. Presence of the Mojave ground squirrel, an endangered species, is possible
at the butte.
The fifth sensitive ecological area is Big Rock Wash, just south of Alpine Butte and also
largely outside the Planning Area. Like Little Rock Wash, it supports a variety of birds
and mammals, serves as a migration corridor, and helps maintain the plant and animal
diversity of the region.
The native plants and wildlife of the Antelope Valley have adapted to the arid climate
and quick-draining, sandy soils. However, the expanding human settlement of the
region has upset this natural balance. Development has resulted in replacement of the
existing desert species with landscaping materials not native to the region that require
regular watering to survive. Development has also blocked access to and eliminated
foraging and nesting areas, and introduced air and water pollution that can adversely

affect habitat quality. Past development patterns have created habitat “islands”,
isolating populations of species, thereby reducing their local long-term viability.
The landscaping style prevalent in the United States is based on British tastes and
climate--a cool region with plentiful rainfall. In order to maintain the green lawns and
shrubbery, irrigation is necessary. Excessive watering literally drowns native plants.
However, alternative landscape styles from drier climates are not common in the United
States--even in drier regions--and as a result may be more expensive to install and less
attractive to buyers. Public education and design assistance about drought tolerant and
native landscaping is needed.
State and federal environmental protection laws require the review of individual projects
to mitigate their potential impacts on existing biological resources. Two approaches are
typically chosen:
•   Attempt to preserve significant natural features and incorporate them in the
    proposed development. (This approach usually fails because of the different cultural
    requirements of the native as opposed to the introduced species.)
•   Preservation of significant resources in "open space area" where development is
    restricted. (This approach results in islands of "undisturbed" areas that are not
    connected in a natural system as they were previously, and are frequently subject to
    vandalism or intrusion of urban activities, such as off-road vehicle use.)
These approaches can only succeed when there is an overall approach to development
that emphasizes native, drought-tolerant landscaping and the establishment and
protection of a system of natural open space areas in the City.
Cultural Resources
Cultural resources in Palmdale are derived from the rich and colorful history of the
Antelope Valley. Evidence from the Barrel Springs site dates human occupation of the
Palmdale area back 5,000 years before present (Love 1989:15). Cultural groups known
to have occupied the area in and around the Antelope Valley in late prehistoric and
early historic times include the Kitanemuk, Kawaiisu, Tatavium and Serrano/Vanyume.
The amount of existing cultural resources directly determines the extent of conservation
that can be realized. While a number of archaeological, historical, and paleontological
sites have been identified, the Planning Area is largely undeveloped and, for the most
part, has not been surveyed for cultural resources. Resources are most often
discovered during the environmental assessment of a proposed development project.
In the last few years, rapid urbanization has resulted in an increased number of site

Environmental Resources
surveys for these resources and a substantial number of newly identified cultural
resources.
Existing state laws dealing with the preservation of archaeological, historical, and
paleontological resources can ensure that identified cultural resources are preserved or
investigated and mitigated through prudent and acceptable means. Public awareness
and involvement often act as catalysts for aggressive resource preservation as historical
and archaeological organizations become vanguards of the community's cultural
resources.
The conservation of the area's cultural resources must be promoted by increasing the
appreciation of residents for the valley's history. Public awareness programs and
conservation ordinances will help bring about community pride and identity.
Historical Resources
A listing of potential historic structures has been compiled by the Antelope Valley
Historical Society. Table ER-1 provides the listing and Exhibit ER-6 shows their general
location. The list is based solely on the structure's existence for at least 50 years.
Historical significance should not be inferred from this listing until such time as these
(and perhaps other) structures are evaluated to determine their importance. In addition
to age, the following factors should be considered when evaluating a structure's
significance:
1.      Architectural features unique to the region, such as:
        a.     Outstanding example within the region of an architectural style or of a
               particular architect's work.
        b.     Use of construction techniques or materials unique to the region.
2.      Importance of the structure in the history of Palmdale.
3.      Existing or restorable condition of the structure.
4.      Physical and economic feasibility of possible relocation.
5.      Physical and economic feasibility of possible restoration.
6.      Potential reuse for the structure following restoration/relocation.

Archaeological Resources
The majority of archaeological investigations in the Antelope Valley have been
conducted in the past 20 years. Results from these investigations point to a lengthy
prehistoric tradition. Archaeologists have learned that the Antelope Valley has been
inhabited for the past 5,000 years, and may have been occupied many thousands of
years before that (Love 1989:15).
The prehistoric cultural tradition in the Antelope Valley most probably follows that of the
Mojave Desert. The earliest cultural period for which there is evidence is the Pinto
Period, which dates back to at least 6,000 years ago. During this period of time, the
climate of the Mojave Desert was becoming arid, and available food resources in the
region were decreasing.
An archival record search in 1989 produced 38 recorded archaeological sites within the
Planning Area. Two of these sites are of a historic date, while the remainder are of
prehistoric time periods. In addition, recent surveys of the City Ranch Specific Plan
area and the Ritter Ranch Specific Plan identified a total of 49 new prehistoric
archaeological sites and 7 historic archaeological sites. The 28 prehistoric sites in the
City Ranch survey include "lithic scatters, hunting blinds, bedrock milling features, and,
in two instances, rock art". The rock art at the City Ranch site is composed of cupule
boulders (Van Horn et al 1989), and a survey of the Amargosa Creek area (Wessel et al
1989) identified one historic trash scatter (LAn-1554H). The Ritter Ranch survey
identified 21 prehistoric sites and 6 historic sites. The prehistoric sites include "10
cupulae (cupules are man-made circular indentations in boulders or rock outcroppings)
petroglyph/bedrock milling sites, 7 isolated finds of stone tools and waste flakes from
tool manufacturing, 1 grouping of rock lined pit ovens, 1 lithic scatter, and 1 hunting
blind constructed of tubular schist slabs" (LSA Associates, Inc. 1989). There are 14
prehistoric sites and 4 historic sites which were identified for preservation.
For purposes of archaeological classification, the Palmdale Planning Area was divided
into three primary physiographic environment types: the rift zone, the foothill areas, and
the desert floor. The grid layout of streets was also extended throughout the Planning
Area to facilitate site location.
Plotting the recorded site locations within the grid system resulted in 7 sites (3 historic
and 4 prehistoric) on the desert floor area, 26 sites in the foothill areas, and 37 sites in
the rift zone area (see Exhibit ER-7). The sites identified in City Ranch add 28
prehistoric and 1 historic archaeological sites to those identified in the foothills and 1
historic site to those identified on the desert floor.

                                                                 Environmental Resources
Given the number of sites recorded in the rift zone, along with the availability of water
and food resources, it can be suggested that this is an area of high archaeological
sensitivity, and there is a high probability of more sites existing in this area.
The foothill areas are located both north of and south of the rift zone, in the
southwestern section of the Planning Area. The recorded sites in the foothill area
include bedrock milling sites, habitation sites, quarries, rock art, hunting blinds, and
numerous lithic scatter sites. Other archaeological sites identified include hunting blinds
and cupule sites. Many of the creeks and streams found in the rift zone begin in the
foothill areas, and provided generally reliable sources of water for the prehistoric
inhabitants of the area. Springs and marsh areas in the rift zone also provide additional
food resources. The probability of more sites existing in the foothill areas is high.
The recorded prehistoric sites found on the desert floor areas of the Planning Area
include a bedrock mortar, lithic scatters, food processing stations, and possible
habitation sites. Sites on the desert floor are widely distributed and are generally
located on the perimeter of the area. The two historic sites are located approximately in
the center of this area. The probability of discovering additional prehistoric and historic
sites appears to be moderately high.
Paleontological Resources
A Paleontologic Sensitivity Study for the Palmdale area was prepared in April 1990 by
Robert E. Reynolds, the curator of Earth Sciences at the San Bernardino County
Museum. Twelve rock units were identified and categorized into three classifications.
The three classifications, high sensitivity/potential, unknown sensitivity/potential, and
low sensitivity/potential for resources were based on the assessment of the identified
and potential paleontological resources in the rock units.
1.      High Potential: The Palmdale Planning Area encompasses five sedimentary rock
        units ranging in age from 12 million to 10,000 years. These rock units have
        produced significant non-renewable plant and vertebrate paleontologic resources
        and have a high potential to produce future resources. These units include,
        chronologically, the Punchbowl, Ana Verde, Harold Formations, the Nadeau
        Gravels/Pleistocene Old Alluvium, and pleistocene Lacustrine and Fluvial
        Sediments. Table ER-2 presents characteristics of each.
2.      Unknown Potential: There are two rock units in Palmdale which have an
        unknown potential for producing paleontological resources, the Vasquez
        Formation and the Pleistocene Alluvium.              The Vasquez Formation is
        approximately 38 million to 22.5 million years old dating it back to the Oligocene
        Age. The Pleistocene alluvium which is of high potential is covered by a thin
                                       ER-44                       Adopted by City Council
                                                                                     1/25/93
Environmental Resources
       layer of recent alluvium.      This layer has an unknown potential for producing
       paleontologic resources.
3.     Low Potential: There are five igneous and metamorphic rock units in Palmdale
       which have a low potential to produce significant paleontologic resources. These
       units include: Precambrian Pelona Schist, mesozoic metavolcanics, Mesozoic
       granite, quartz monzonite, and diorits.
A paleontology records search showed that vertebrate paleontology localities have been
recorded between the intersection of Pearblossom Highway and the California Aqueduct
and Little Rock Wash. The sites produced fossil horse teeth, mammoth tooth
fragments, and rabbit, bird, carnivore, and rodent tooth and bone fragments. The Ana
Verde formation along the San Andreas rift zone was found to be an ancient lake
deposit containing fossil plants. The City's low-lying areas consist of Quaternary
alluvium which is known to contain numerous vertebrate fossils. Although no other
paleontological resources have been recorded in the Planning Area, their existence
should not be precluded or dismissed. Exhibit ER-8 indicates the paleontological
sensitivity of the Palmdale Planning Area.
3.     Air Quality
One of the benefits enjoyed by the citizens of Palmdale is the relatively clean air of the
high desert. Unlike the Los Angeles basin, rarely in the Antelope Valley do pollution
levels reach the point where smog alerts are issued. However, Antelope Valley air often
exceeds the state and federal standards set for two air pollutants: ozone and small
particulates less than 10-microns in size (PM10). The consequences of allowing the
continued degradation of local air quality include the increase of serious health effects,
property damage from oxidizing agents such as ozone, and reduced visibility which
affects the aesthethic value of the area. Therefore, improving local air quality is among
the goals of the community.
To protect public health and well being, the State and Federal governments have
established thresholds for a number of pollutants. Four pollutants most likely to affect
the Antelope Valley are continuously monitored in Lancaster by the Antelope Valley Air
Quality Management District. These pollutants include ozone, carbon monoxide,
nitrogen oxides, and PM10. Table ER-3 shows that federal standards for ozone were
exceed on 22 occasions over the past five years. State standards for ozone are
exceeded on 183 occasions. State standards for PM10 were exceeded 6 days in 2000;
5 days in 2001; and 1 day in 2002. These reflect significant reductions over the prior
five-year period. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)

                                     old. Six sites have been identified. One
                                     major site produced vertebrate fossils
                                     including; mammoth, mastodon, horse,

Environmental Resources
The Antelope Valley lies within the Mojave Desert Air Basin (MDAB). This air basin is
bounded by the Colorado River to the east, the crest of the San Bernardino, San
Gabriel, and San Jacinto Mountains to the south and west, and the northern Kern
County boundary to the north. The MDAB contains both high desert areas such as
Palmdale and Victorville, and low desert regions including the Palm Springs area.
(General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
The MDAB air mass interacts with that of the South Coast Air Basin to the southwest.
The South Coast Air Basin air mass often contains large amounts of emissions and
reacted air pollutants that originate from vehicular, commercial and industrial sources in
Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. Particularly during the
summer, polluted South Coast Basin air often moves north into the Antelope Valley.
This imported air often arrives with a pollutant load that exceeds the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). It has been determined that ozone air quality
standards are exceeded in the Palmdale area by virtue of emissions that are generated
outside of the Antelope Valley. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
Wind blown dust represents a major source of PM10 emissions in the Antelope Valley.
Disturbance by man of the desert environment increases the amount of wind-blown
dust. This dust contributes to unhealthful PM10 levels as well as reducing visual range
and degrading the aesthetic quality of the area.
While much of the area's pollutant load is generated by sources beyond local control, it
is important to point out that the community is also a source of air pollutants. Vehicles
cause the bulk of emissions produced locally. These emissions subsequently react
under the influence of sunlight, other pollutants and moisture to form reactive
contaminants including ozone. While many of these pollutants disperse in the
expansive air basin, as local emissions increase, the effect on downwind communities
will become more pronounced. Residents of Palmdale directly contribute air pollutants
to both the South Coast and the Mojave Desert air basins when they commute between
homes in the high desert and jobs in the Los Angeles area. (General Plan Amendment 04-01,
adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
Mobile sources in the Palmdale area are comprised of conventional vehicles and
aircraft. Present and future airport facilities will produce emissions from aircraft, support
vehicles and from vehicles of the employees and customers of the facilities.

Environmental Resources
The air quality on any given day is the result of complex interactions between air
pollutant emissions and meteorological forces. Therefore, on each day, the local air
quality is different; an emission source may affect residents at one time or day and not
on another. Several physical factors can affect air quality, including prevailing wind
patterns, topography, average wind speeds by time of day and by season, and the
frequency with which temperature inversions occur in the affected area. Air quality in a
given locality also depends both upon emissions in the area and upon the transport of
air pollutants from upwind areas. For this reason, inland areas of Southern California,
such as Palmdale, have the poorest particulate and ozone air quality. Therefore,
Palmdale, like other inland communities, is at a relative disadvantage in terms of the
effort required to achieve good air quality.
At the present time, the Antelope Valley portion of the MDAB is under the regulatory
authority of the Antelope Valley Air Quality Management District (AVAQMD). This
agency establishes rules, regulations, and policies for activities, which impact air quality
throughout the Antelope Valley and Southeast Desert air basins. In compliance with
federal and State law, AVAQMD has prepared an Air Quality Management Plan
(AQMP) for the South Coast Air Basin to meet clean air standards. Since this plan was
adopted in 1989, SCAQMD has applied the document to both the South Coast Air Basin
and the Mojave Desert Air Basin. If, in the future, an attainment plan is prepared
specifically for the Southeast Desert air basin, then the provisions of that plan will be
applicable to Palmdale and the rest of the Antelope Valley. (General Plan Amendment 04-01,
adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
The AQMP, last amended in 2003, contains "control measures" that when implemented,
will improve air quality throughout the region. These measures are organized into three
tiers: Tier I measures can be implemented at the present time with the current
technology available; Tier II measures will be implemented in the near future as
technology allows; and Tier III measures require advancements in technology that will
not be available for many years to come. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council
April 14, 2004.)
At the present time, the AQMP contains approximately 40 Tier I control measures which
affect local governments. These control measures range from eliminating leaf blowers
to implementing trip reduction programs.            Involvement by local government to
implement these measures varies, but includes providing enforcement of future district
rules, adoption of ordinances, and modifications of local general plans.
The AQMP recognizes that there will be population and economic growth in the area
and has recommended that air pollution control strategies take this into account.
Downwind areas, such as Palmdale, should be allowed the same opportunities for
relative growth as other areas in the two air basins. It is also assumed in the AQMP
that equal control efforts will be exerted by all communities. The result of this approach

                                                                         Environmental Resources
is that all areas within the AQMP will need to achieve a higher level of emissions
control, if air quality standards are to be attained.
4. Outdoor Recreation and Amenities
Many types of outdoor recreation take place in a natural setting, and their value
depends primarily on the scenic or natural qualities of the environment. Hiking and
camping are examples of such resource-oriented recreation. At the other end of this
scale are activities requiring user-oriented facilities, such as an urban or local park. Of
primary concern related to urban parks is the equitable distribution of these facilities
throughout the urban area.
The City of Palmdale Parks and Recreation Master Plan discusses existing and
proposed facilities, as well as policies for the enhancement of recreational opportunities.
In more detail, the following sections briefly address other outdoor recreational
amenities. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
Bikeways
Bikeways can serve as corridors connecting parks and natural areas around the
community. They help satisfy the requirements for open space and parks and can
serve as emergency access routes. Bikeways also encourage the use of the bicycle as
an alternative mode of transportation. Well maintained bikeways can provide routes for
both recreational and utility purposes throughout the City. Bikeway plans are discussed
within the Parks, Recreation and Trails Element. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City
Council April 14, 2004.)
Equestrian and Hiking Trails
Equestrian and hiking trails, which are separated from vehicular traffic, ideally lead
through park-like natural areas. In urban areas, many of these trails are combined with
flood control rights-of-way, or buffered from development by landscaped or natural
areas. These trail systems must accommodate a variety of users and provide a variety
of experiences. Safety and health concerns must be addressed during design and
maintenance. Priority funding shall be based on user demand and multi-use facilities.
Handicapped accessibility to trails should also be considered.
The City may offer incentives to developers for dedicating land or allowing public access
to private land to continue and expand the trail network. Possible incentives could
include the reduction or elimination of park fees for the development (if residential),
reduction or elimination of landscaping assessment district fees, and density bonuses.
                                          ER-50                            Adopted by City Council
                                                                                           1/25/93
Environmental Resources
Plans for a multi-use trail system are included in the City's Master Parks and Recreation
Plan. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
Scenic Areas
Scenic areas include open space and landscaped corridors and viewsheds. They
provide visual enhancement and pleasure and are worthy of preservation for aesthetic,
historical, topographical, cultural, or biological reasons.
The Lamont Odett Vista Point, just off the Antelope Valley Freeway, provides a view of
Lake Palmdale and the City. The Godde Hills Road winds up the Portal Ridge
Mountains and overlooks the entire Antelope Valley. Bouquet Canyon Road is well-
known for its tree-lined canyon and winding stream. Juniper Hills Drive is a circular
road lined with junipers and tamarisks and rises up to 4,000 feet above sea level.
These scenic areas are among many in the valley that include the Angeles National
Forest south and west of the Planning Area and wildlife reserves east of the area.
Major Landscapes
Landforms in and around Palmdale form three major, distinct landscape types. Each of
these landscapes represents a combination of potential recreation resources for
residents of the Palmdale area. The location of these landscapes relative to Palmdale
is shown on Exhibit ER-9.
1.      The Mountain Areas. Most of the mountain areas are within the jurisdiction of
        the Angeles National Forest. These areas are managed, wherever possible, to
        include a variety of recreation opportunities compatible with the primary goal of
        watershed protection.
2.      The Desert Slope and San Andreas Rift Zone. At present, landforms of the
        desert slope and the rift zone of the San Andreas Fault provide open space
        resources for the entire region. They form the scenic backdrop for the Antelope
        Valley, and at the same time, they support outdoor recreation use. Resources in
        the area are linked together by the California Aqueduct and the trail that parallels
        it. (The trail is not open to the public at this time.) Increasing recreation uses
        and development pressure near this high amenity area call for careful
        management.
3.      The Desert Plains and Buttes. The Antelope Valley, with its high desert plain,
        buttes, and alkali sinks, offers a great variety of opportunities for recreation. In
        the western portion of the valley, Antelope Buttes and Fairmont Buttes offer
        considerable potential for interweaving compatible recreation and natural

                                                             Environmental Resources
         resource preservation areas. In the east, this potential is presented by the
         unique landform and habitat areas surrounding the Saddleback Buttes State
         Park. The West Alpine and Alpine Butte Wildlife Sanctuaries can also be found
         in this same area.
5.       Scenic Highways
A primary component of many outdoor recreation activities is movement or travel. One
of the most popular forms of outdoor recreation in southern California is driving for
pleasure and the travel to and from recreation areas is considered a major part of the
experience. Thus, the moving landscape, or scenic corridor, is a part of the landscape
system, both as a connecting element and as a landscape in its own right.
A scenic highway presents opportunities for visual stimulation for automobile
passengers. In North Los Angeles County, the view from the road is characterized by
panoramic vistas of rugged mountains, steep canyon slopes covered with native
chaparral, extensive areas of the Mojave Desert, and rural or small-town settings. Thus
far, development has not significantly reduced scenic potential and there is an
opportunity for public investment to ensure the future maintenance of this visual
resource. Although many roadways in the North Los Angeles County area may be
considered scenic, only the Angeles Crest Highway (Route 2) from the La
Canada/Angeles National Forest boundary to the San Bernardino County Line has been
officially designated a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.
Official scenic highways are designated by the State Scenic Highway Advisory
Committee.
There are no hard and fast regulations defining the visual characteristics which qualify a
road as a scenic highway, but the following considerations may be utilized:
•   Visibility. The vehicle occupants should be able to view expansive scenery without
    having to stop.
•   Landforms.       The roadway transverses areas dominated by the physical
    characteristics of the natural corridor, such as gently rolling hills or rugged cliffs,
    streams, geologic formations, and distant ridges.
•   Vegetation. The roadway abuts areas with distinctive vegetation within view, such
    as row crops, orchards, chaparral, or woodlands.
                                      ER-52                   Adopted by City Council
                                                                                  1/25/93

Environmental Resources
•     Structures. Buildings may be included in scenic corridors and may add to scenic
     quality.
•    Panoramas. Scenic overlooks with panoramic views of urban, rural, or natural areas
     should be included when available.
With proper design and management of these corridor landscapes, scenic highways
can not only enhance the quality of the recreation experience, but also provide the kind
of "open space system" that organizes and communicates the coherence and identity of
the region. Scenic natural areas must be preserved where they are found and cannot
be evenly distributed like parks. Their enjoyment may require travel.
Development of this type of area depends on the availability of a quality landscape and
the opportunity to enjoy it. Controlling the visual environment and preventing its
overuse are, therefore, the critical design and management problems. Adopted scenic
roadways are shown in Exhibit ER-1. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April
14, 2004.)
C.       Constraints
Constraints to effective environmental resource management include ecological,
governmental, economic and political factors. The area's finite resources and their
interdependence with other aspects of the ecosystem determine their suitability for
management and control. City regulations may have unintended side effects on the
preservation and prudent use of resources. Economic constraints and pressures are
often felt by private owners in planning the use of development on their land, as well as
by public agencies attempting to preserve open space and develop parks and
recreation facilities. Constraints that may affect environmental resource management in
Palmdale are discussed below.
1.       Development Pressure and Rising Property Values: The preservation of
         open space is constrained by the rising property values and strong development
         pressures that cause rapid development. Construction has boomed in Palmdale;
         an average of approximately 900 housing units were added each year between
         2001 and 2003. As property values have appreciated, development has become
         financially feasible in such hazardous building zones as landslide areas, areas of
         ground subsidence, and flood risk areas, further increasing pressure to reduce
         open space in the Palmdale area. Development pressures also reduce the
         amount of land available for mining and excavation of mineral resources.
         Continuing development may limit these uses to marginal areas where no other
         uses are allowed--airport crash zones, flood plains, and earthquake rift zones.
         (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)

                                                           Environmental Resources
2. Limited City Resources: Limited financial resources also restrict the City's
   ability to purchase land for open space preservation and parks and recreation
   needs. City funds are more likely to be spent first on high priority items, such as
   providing infrastructure and public services to residents. In addition to limited
   funds available for the purchase of land and facilities for parks and recreation
   programs, rising park development and maintenance costs have curtailed
   parkland expansions in recent years. Even if parkland can be acquired, the costs
   of developing and operating the park facilities can be prohibitive.
3. Uncoordinated Development: Uncoordinated development on scattered sites
   or development occurring at various times without a logical phasing sequence
   can contribute to the lack of a unified open space system in the Palmdale area.
   Open space areas provided by individual developments tend to be small, and
   these areas often don't relate to neighboring parks, trails, ridgelines, or other
   open space areas.
4. Existing Development and Zoning: The extraction of mineral resources is
   restricted by existing development on or near prime resource deposits and by
   incompatible zoning designations on adjacent property. The regional market for
   sand and gravel resources may make mining in these areas profitable, but
   mining may not be allowed because of land use restrictions.                   Existing
   development could also restrict access to underlying mineral resources.
5. State and Federal Regulations: State and federal laws relating to flood control,
   water resources, and habitat preservation can act as regulatory constraints to
   mining activities. Sand and gravel resources in Palmdale are located primarily in
   the Little Rock Wash area, which is subject to state and federal wetland resource
   habitat preservation, Fish and Game regulations, as well as surface mining
   regulations.
6. Insufficient Sewer Infrastructure: Some of the older portions of Palmdale have
   been developed using individual septic systems for each house rather than a
   public sewer system. Septic systems must be maintained in order to avoid
   contamination of the surrounding area. Some parts of the Planning Area have
   already experienced septic system failure, possibly contaminating local water
   supplies.
7. Rate of Population Growth: The physical changes brought about by human
   settlement of the region have made it difficult for native plant and wildlife species
   to survive. Development has introduced non-native plant species to the area that
   require regular watering to survive. Development can also block access to or
   eliminate foraging and nesting areas, and introduces air and water pollution that
                                  ER-54                      Adopted by City Council
                                                                                 1/25/93
Environmental Resources
      can damage or destroy wildlife habitats. Many desert plants and animals do not
      adapt well to urban development--for example, Joshua trees cannot tolerate
      much disturbance of their root zones or the irrigation typical of residential
      landscaping.
8.    Lack of Information: One obstacle to the preservation of cultural resources is
      the lack of resource surveys of the Planning Area. Palmdale and its sphere of
      influence are largely undeveloped and have not been surveyed extensively for
      the presence of archaeological, paleontological, and historic resources.
9.    Geographic Setting: Constraints to clean air include the Palmdale area's
      topography and patterns of wind movement. Wind, atmospheric stability, terrain,
      and sunshine contribute to the atmosphere's ability to dilute pollutants.
      Atmospheric stability also suppresses vertical dilution of pollutants. Air pollutants
      generated south of Palmdale in the Los Angeles metropolitan area are
      transported to the Antelope Valley by air currents, adding to the pollutants
      generated within the valley.
10.   Imbalance Between Jobs and Housing:                The Palmdale area's current
      imbalance between employment opportunities and housing increases vehicle
      emissions generated by residents driving to other areas to work.
11.   Governmental Complexity: Finally, the process of preservation or resource
      management itself can deter efforts to protect some resources. For example, the
      local designation of scenic highways must begin with a study of potential
      candidates for designation, and proceed through staff recommendations to City
      Council adoption and to state designation by the State Scenic Highways Advisory
      Committee. The time and commitment requirements of this process can limit the
      protection of scenic resources.

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
The Public Services Element presents a plan for ensuring that public services and
infrastructure are available to permit orderly growth and to promote public health, safety,
and welfare. The Element provides a framework within which individual property
owners can plan the development of their property and be assured that basic
infrastructure and services are adequate. Individual service providers and property
owners may not be aware of citywide or regional issues that affect the ultimate users of
their development. This Element provides an area-wide assessment of various public
services and facilities to promote a broader understanding of service issues.
The Public Services Element sets forth policies and standards for the rational and cost-
efficient provision and extension of public services to support planned development. It
addresses present conditions and concerns and establishes measures to accommodate
future growth and development patterns. The Public Services Element is most closely
interrelated to the Land Use Element. The policies and implementation programs in the
Public Services Element are designed to ensure that adequate infrastructure will be
available to keep pace with the type and extent of development anticipated in the Land
Use Element.
Specifically, the Public Services Element serves the following purposes:
1.      The Public Services Element serves as a guide for decision-making by the
        development community and by public officials in determining future expenditures
        of public funds.
2.      The Public Services Element informs the public of the goals, objectives, and
        policies of the City for maintenance and improvement of public services and
        facilities. It provides implementation measures and programs that will serve as a
        guide for the day-to-day operational decisions of City staff.
3.      The Public Services Element evaluates the existing level of public services and
        utilities in the City including water, sewer, storm drainage, police and fire
        protection, power, natural gas, telephone, solid waste disposal, cable, library,
        hospital and school services. It identifies issues, needs and plans for meeting
        future infrastructure requirements.

                                                                          Public Services
SECTION 2: GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
GOAL PS1: Ensure that adequate public services and facilities are available to
support development in an efficient and orderly manner.
Objective PS1.1: Ensure that all new development in Palmdale provides for the
infrastructure and public services needed to support it.
        Policy PS1.1.1: Require all new development, including major modifications to
        existing development, to construct required on-site infrastructure improvements
        pursuant to City standards.
        Policy PS1.1.2: Require all new development, including major modifications to
        existing development, to construct or provide a fair share contribution towards
        construction of required off-site improvements needed to support the project.
        Policy PS1.1.3: Require that on- and off-site improvements are constructed
        prior to occupancy of a new development project, or phase thereof, unless
        otherwise approved by the City.
        Policy PS1.1.4: Require that adequate provisions are made, as approved by the
        City, for maintenance of public improvements or any facility or land to be
        maintained by the City prior to approval of any new development project.
        Policy PS1.1.5: When new development is proposed in vacant, rural areas
        which have not yet been master-planned for provision of infrastructure, require
        that development proponents provide for or contribute a fair share towards
        development of regional master facility plans for roads, sewer, water, drainage,
        schools, libraries, parks, fire and other community facilities, prior to granting
        conditional approval of development applications.
        Policy PS1.1.6: When reviewing applications for land use designation changes
        (i.e., zone change, General Plan Amendment, specific plan amendment),
        conduct a thorough analysis of the impacts of the proposed change on all
        elements of the City's infrastructure systems, and require mitigation as deemed
        appropriate.
Objective PS1.2: Ensure that new development is coordinated with provision of
backbone infrastructure within the site and with adjacent properties, to promote cost-
efficient construction and maintenance, and ease of access to facilities.
                                             PS-2              Adopted by City Council
                                                                                  1/25/93
Public Services
      Policy PS1.2.1: Require that provision of streets, sewer, water, drainage and
      other needed infrastructure be coordinated in a logical manner between adjacent
      developments, so as to reduce cost of design, construction and maintenance.
      Policy PS1.2.2: Require that individual development projects integrate with
      adjacent development with respect to backbone infrastructure (streets, sewer,
      water and drainage). If adjacent property is undeveloped, a conceptual plan
      should be prepared to show that the pending development will allow for future
      integration and development of adjacent properties in a manner which is
      reasonable from a design, construction and cost standpoint.
      Policy PS1.2.3: Require that the proposed infrastructure design within a
      development project permit economical and efficient development of land, both
      on the subject property and on adjacent properties.
      Policy PS1.2.4: Require that phasing of infrastructure requirements within a
      development consider adjacent properties to the extent feasible.
      Policy PS1.2.5: Require that infrastructure be designed and constructed to meet
      ultimate capacity needs, pursuant to a master plan, so as to avoid the need for
      costly retrofitting.
      Policy PS1.2.6: Where feasible, require that consideration be given to sharing
      drainage facilities between adjacent subdivisions, with the cost shared on a "fair
      share" basis.
      Policy PS1.2.7: Ensure that street rights-of-way, drainage facilities, site grading,
      or other similar public infrastructure are not aligned in a manner that increases
      the developability of a single property at the expense of an adjacent property,
      unless so required by regional infrastructure plans.
      Policy PS1.2.8: Distribute the costs of extending infrastructure equitably among
      those benefiting from the improvements.
Objective PS1.3: Utilize land use strategies to maximize use of infrastructure facilities.
      Policy PS1.3.1: Evaluate annexation of unincorporated developed areas
      adjacent to or surrounded by the City to ensure that greater efficiency in
      provision of services will be achieved.
      Policy PS1.3.2: Direct growth towards areas, which already have backbone
      infrastructure available, by providing incentives for quality infill development.

Policy PS7.1.1: Evaluate proposed dedications of land or easements to the City
for various purposes based on the following criteria:
1.      Natural Open Space/Trails/Parkland: The proposed dedication of land or
        easements for the purpose of natural open space, trails, or parkland to the
        City should be evaluated based on the following criteria:
        a.      The open space, trails and/or parkland dedication should serve the
               open space/recreational needs of the City, rather than the more
               localized benefit of a single neighborhood.
        b.     Other responsible agencies or land trusts should be considered as
               an alternative to outright dedication of open space to the City. In
               these instances, the City should determine whether a blanket
               easement to the City for open space and passive recreation is
               desirable.
        c.     The open space area or trails should be reviewed to determine if
               they are adjacent to other publicly held open space and whether
               they are an integral element in the ultimate development of local or
               regional trails or a local/regional greenbelt. Trails should be
               reviewed to determine consistency with proposed alignments
               contained in the City's Parks, Recreation and Trails Element, North
               County Plan or any other recognized plan.
        d.     An evaluation should be made to ascertain whether the proposed
               area contains biotic, historic, or cultural resources of local or
               regional significance or whether the site represents a natural and
               scenic resource to the City.
        e.     An evaluation of any adjacent proposed development should
               ascertain the impacts of such development on the natural
               resources and aesthetic qualities of the site.
        f.     For natural areas that are in a degraded condition due to human
               activity or natural events such as fire or flood, an evaluation should
               be made of the costs to restore such sites to their natural or a
               useable condition.

                    association.
            h.      The short- and long-term fiscal impacts of accepting, improving and
                    maintaining open space or trails should be evaluated. Such
                    evaluation should include an assessment of existing and potential
                    fire hazards in wildland areas, geologic conditions, hazardous
                    material assessments, or other site conditions that may require
                    significant City expenditure for mitigation.
            i.      Any proposed parkland should be evaluated to determine whether
                    there is: a) an identified need for additional parkland within the
                    area; b) whether the site is of adequate size and shape to
                    accommodate park development; c) whether the site is proposed to
                    incorporate additional facilities such as drainage basins; d) whether
                    the site is compatible with existing and proposed adjacent land
                    uses; e) whether the site is accessible to the general public; and f)
                    whether the proposed dedication would provide greater benefit than

                    dedicated park sites.
      2.    Slopes/Parkways: Where development projects propose the annexation
            of slope areas and/or parkways into the City landscape assessment
            district for maintenance, such areas shall be evaluated utilizing the
            following criteria:
            a.      Any slope proposed for City maintenance should be evaluated to
                    ensure that the slope is: a) adjacent to a designated arterial right-
                    of-way; b) contiguous to district-maintained land; c) accessible to
                    maintenance vehicles; and d) the overall height and slope ratio is
                    acceptable.
            b.      Development proposals that include slopes of excessive height and
                    length, which are proposed for City maintenance, should be
                    evaluated with respect to other design alternatives that could limit
                    these slopes. Publicly maintained slopes should be minimized to
                    the extent feasible.
            c.      The short- and long-term fiscal impacts of accepting maintenance
                    of slopes should be evaluated.

               d.     Any parkways and slopes to be maintained by the City should be
                      found to provide benefit to the general public through provision of
                      safe, efficient and attractive streetscapes and easements. City
                      maintenance should not be expected for areas where slopes or
                      landscaping will provide only a local benefit to a limited area, such
                      as where they have been created to develop view lots or marketing
                      corridors.

SECTION 3: IMPLEMENTATION
This section of the Public Services Element contains specific measures for the City to
follow in order to achieve the goals and objectives contained in Section 2.
A.       Data Collection For Service Providers
The City will cooperate with service providers to provide data needed to analyze
available capacities and to estimate the demands of proposed projects. In order to
ensure adequate provision of public services and utilities, service capacities and future
demand should be identified. With this information, the City and other service providers
can evaluate the impacts of new development on existing facilities. Expansions and
changes in services should be monitored, as should new developments in adjacent
areas that are served by the same service provider.
This program should include the following efforts:    (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City
Council July 26, 2004.)
1.       Current data will be maintained on available capacity of public utilities and
         services to use in evaluating project demands.
2.       When necessary, data will be obtained regarding usage rates of current
         developments and updates on the capacities of services.
3.       Data will be maintained on existing and planned development.
4.       Master plans for sewers, water, schools, libraries and other facilities will be
         retained on file for evaluation and monitoring purposes.
B.       California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Review
Every proposed project will be evaluated according to CEQA prior to approval. The
CEQA process ensures that environmental impacts will be mitigated to a level of non-
significance with regard to groundwater resources, public services (schools, libraries,
police protection and fire protection), and public utilities. The CEQA process is
discussed further in the Environmental Resources Element of the General Plan.
C.       Service Commitment
1.       The City will continue to incorporate service commitment requirements into its
         project review process to ensure the availability of services and utilities to new
         developments. These written commitments are required for the following

planning to provide shared corridors for various facilities, to minimize visual and
environmental impacts and required easements.
G.      Annexation
The City will pursue the logical annexation of territory that is bounded by Palmdale's
City limits, including county islands within the City's developed core and areas within its
sphere of influence. This action will create a uniform level of service for all areas,
reduce the number of responsible agencies and facilitate service provision. Annexed
territories should be encouraged to participate in funding needed to provide adequate
infrastructure. The Land Use Element contains further discussion of this program.
H.       Water Conservation Programs And Reclamation Techniques
The City will establish the following water conservation programs to help preserve
resources in the Planning Area.

SECTION 4: ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
The Public Services Element establishes a framework for provision of infrastructure and
public services to existing and new development in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
The Element provides background information on issues and opportunities relative to
infrastructure planning, as well as goals, objectives and policies to ensure effective
coordination of public service provision with development.
Because of Palmdale's rapid growth and dispersed development pattern, the City faces
significant challenges in providing public improvements such as regional drainage and
traffic facilities. The City has taken several positive steps to meet its goals for provision
of infrastructure, including adoption of traffic and drainage impact fees and establishing
assessment districts for financing public improvements in certain areas. The City is
committed to pursuing all available means of providing adequate services and facilities
to meet the community's needs, so as to maintain and enhance the quality of life for its
residents.
Effective provision of public services requires coordination on many levels. The City
must coordinate master planning efforts with other service providers, including school
districts; County fire, water and sanitation districts; independent water purveyors; utility
companies; solid waste handlers; regional transportation agencies; and adjacent
jurisdictions. In addition, there is a need to provide coordination between various
developments within the City, so as to maximize efficient use of construction dollars and
capital facilities. Finally, there is a need to coordinate policy decisions within various
departments throughout the City and provide consistency between land use planning,
capital facilities planning, maintenance and finance decisions. For this reason, the
Public Services Element is closely tied to policies within the Land Use, Circulation,
Environmental Resources, Safety, and Housing Elements. The Element has been
prepared to be consistent with those other elements.
The following information provides background on existing conditions, opportunities and
constraints that are addressed in the public service policies contained in Section 2 of
this Element.
A.       Public Service And Infrastructure Issues
In the following sections, existing public services in Palmdale are analyzed with respect
to their present conditions, and anticipated needs for future expansion. The City's
infrastructure system includes the following components:
1.       Water treatment and distribution
2.       Sewer collection and treatment

1.      Water Service
a.      Water Supply.
Groundwater is the primary source of water supply in the Palmdale Planning Area, with
supplemental water supplied from the State Water Project (California Aqueduct). Three
groundwater sub-units are located within the Planning Area. Groundwater movement is
generally in a northwesterly direction, from the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains
towards the pumping depression in Lancaster. The location of the three sub-units of the
principal (upper) aquifer and the approximate elevation of groundwater surfaces in the
spring of 1984 are shown in Exhibit PS-1. Table PS-1 shows approximate depth to
groundwater for 10 different locations in the Planning Area, as derived from Exhibit
PS-1. Various studies have been conducted to determine the status of the aquifer. The
results of these studies provide conflicting views of the extent of the occurrence of
overdrafting (or usage of water beyond the rate of natural replenishment). Los Angeles
County Waterworks district has provided information, which would indicate that
groundwater levels are rising; however, other studies identify significant draw downs.

The California State Water Project conveys water from the Feather River and the Lake
Oroville Reservoir in Northern California to areas in Southern California that do not have
adequate local sources. Water is conveyed via closed and open aqueducts throughout
the state. The California Aqueduct traverses the Planning Area from the northwest to
the southeast (see Exhibit PS-1).

The Antelope Valley East Kern (AVEK) Water Agency purchases water from the State
Department of Water Resources and provides treated water on a wholesale basis to
most local water districts in Palmdale. AVEK serves portions of Kern County, Los
Angeles County, and Ventura County. The AVEK service area and transmission lines
are delineated in Exhibit PS-2. The agency has a maximum entitlement of 141,400
acre-feet per year from the California Water Project. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by
City Council July 26, 2004.)
Since its completion, the state project has provided less than half of AVEK's total
entitlement each year. This level of delivery is due to a lack of available water supply,
and the lack of capacity in local treatment facilities. At the present time, no additional
sources of water are being developed by the State. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by
City Council July 26, 2004.)
The California Department of Health requires full treatment of raw water received from
the State Water Project. For this purpose AVEK has constructed the Quartz Hill and the
Eastside Water Treatment Plants. Presently, the Quartz Hill Treatment Plant at 65th
Street West and Avenue N can accommodate 65 million gallons daily (mgd) with a
potential to expand to 73 mgd. The Eastside plant at 116th Street East and Avenue V-8
is currently working at its planned maximum capacity of 10 mgd, with potential for
expansion to 28 mgd in the future when the need arises. The Acton Water Treatment
Plant is located on a 20-acre site where the California Aqueduct crosses Sierra
Highway. The plant can process 4 million gallons of water per day and could upgrade
                                                 PS-28                Adopted by City Council

to 8 million gallons per day within the existing site. Water from the plant will serve the
needs of Acton residents. The site is within the Palmdale Water District (PWD) service
area and PWD has a main feeder one half mile from the site, creating the possibility of
interdistrict links for water exchange if needed in the future. The existing Palmdale
Water District water treatment plant was constructed in 1987 for a production rate of 12
mgd and expanded in the early 1990’s to a capacity of 30 mgd for the exclusive use of
the Palmdale service area. The AVEK plants are committed to service many other
areas besides Palmdale. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
The City of Palmdale uses some imported water from AVEK and some from the
Palmdale Water District. Both have water entitlements from the State Water Project
(California Aqueduct). The Los Angeles County Waterworks Districts, Palmdale Water
District, and independent water companies provide domestic water for residential and
commercial uses in Palmdale. While most companies buy water from AVEK, the
Palmdale Water District (PWD) has a direct entitlement of 21,300 acre-feet from the
State Water Project. Exhibit PS-3 shows the service areas of water purveyors in the
City and Table PS-2 summarizes their characteristics. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted
by City Council July 26, 2004.)
In addition to the above listed water companies, subdivision projects and private
corporations often set up mutual water companies to provide water exclusively to the
lots within each project. As with the larger companies, groundwater wells and AVEK
are the primary sources of water for smaller companies. These companies include:

Private wells are also used by a number of residences and businesses, primarily in
scattered outlying portions of the Planning Area. In addition, there are private haulers
who buy water from the County Waterworks Districts and County of Los Angeles water
companies, and distribute the water to households and other uses that do not have
water system connections or wells. The exact number of business or residences served
by private wells or trucked water is not known, but is estimated to account for less than
1 percent of total water use within the Planning Area.
Buildout of the land use plan will require approximately 129.4 million gallons of water
per day or 144,410 acre-feet per year of water. This figure represents 89 percent of the
total maximum entitlements of AVEK (141,400 acre-feet) and the Palmdale Water
District (21,300 acre-feet). Projected 2010 development will require approximately
45,363 acre-feet of water per year, or 28 percent of total entitlement. Groundwater

resources, which are used primarily to meet the demand, will continue to be over
drafted unless conservation programs are undertaken. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted
by City Council July 26, 2004.)
The reliance on groundwater, which predominates among Palmdale water purveyors,
may result in continued lowering of the water table. Water from the state project is
intended to be supplemental to groundwater sources, and AVEK encourages the use of
imported water to help recharge groundwater in the Planning Area. However, since
imported water is more expensive, most water companies have been reluctant to use it
for either recharge or sale to customers. Groundwater wells continue to be the main
source (50 percent) of water supply in Palmdale.
If long-term availability of imported water from the State is reduced, Palmdale will
become more reliant on local groundwater sources. Continued overdrafting of
groundwater resources could escalate extraction costs for groundwater. Ensuring an
adequate supply of water, given projected growth rates and the potential for drought
conditions, may require the City to adopt and enforce water conservation measures.
b.       Water Quality.
Government regulations deal with the provision of safe drinking water, as well as an
adequate supply. The Lahontan Region of the State Water Quality Board regulates
water quality within the Palmdale Planning Area. Presently, groundwater in the area
generally meets federal and state standards. A few wells in the rural communities
adjacent to Palmdale have been found to contain high amounts of nitrates due to septic
tank leakage in the area. The potential for local groundwater contamination has long
been a concern of residents, and may increase as more development utilizing septic
systems occurs.
Smaller mutual water companies and individual wells are not subject to regular outside
testing to ensure quality. There is a concern for public health if smaller mutual water
companies become more prevalent and if Los Angeles County Health Department is
unable to adequately monitor these wells. Therefore, the City has required connection
to a public water system for new development, and will continue to do so.
Existing water services are not available to some of the City's future developments.
Wells and water lines do not exist in many of the City's vacant areas. The City will work
with developers in exploring available methods of financing water system improvements
to ensure an adequate and safe supply of domestic water for all existing and future
residents.

2.      Sewer Service
The Los Angeles County Sanitation District Nos. 14 and 20 provide sewer service in the
City. District 20 serves the City's urban core and the northeastern portion of the
Planning Area, while District 14 serves the northwestern portion of the Planning Area,
Quartz Hill, Lancaster, and private sewage haulers. The USAF Plant 42 has its own
sewer system. Information and projections from the County Sanitation Districts are
discussed below.
District 20's 200-acre water reclamation plant is located between Avenue O, Avenue Q,
30th Street East, and 50th Street East. It has a 15.5-million gallon capacity and
processes 9.2 million gallons of sewage per day through a surface aeration process.
Exhibit PS-4 shows historical processing rates at the plant. The plant has continuously
upgraded its facilities to meet the demand for sewage processing. Expansion of the
Palmdale plant to handle approximately 20.5 mgd will be needed to accommodate 2020
population levels. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
The existing facility includes storage tanks, digestors, clarifiers, oxidation ponds, and
evaporation-percolation disposal ponds in two adjacent sites. Approximately three dry
tons per day of raw sludge and one dry ton per day of digested sludge is produced.
Sludge is air-dried and composted onsite. The district has a contract with the Mira
Loma detention camp to utilize some of the district's sludge for bio-gas plants in the
camp. The District disposes of processed wastewater through a contract with the
Palmdale Regional Airport to irrigate the surrounding area that is presently used for
agriculture. An alternate method of wastewater disposal will have to be implemented
when the airport site develops. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
District 14's water reclamation plant is located on a 350-acre site at 20th Street West
and Avenue D, between Sierra Highway and the Antelope Valley Freeway in Lancaster.
It processes 13.2 million gallons of sewage per day with capacity to process up to 16
million gallons per day (see Exhibit PS-4). Expansion of the Lancaster plant to handle
approximately 26 mgd is planned. Sewage goes through a surface aeration process,
using oxidation ponds. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
In addition to sewage coming from the district's trunk lines in Lancaster and Quartz Hill,
District 14 accepts effluent from private haulers for treatment. There are 9 private
companies in the Lancaster/Palmdale area who service households and businesses
with private septic tanks and cesspools.

Public Services
 The District 14 plant currently produces 4 dry tons of raw sludge and 2 dry tons of
digested sludge (bio-solids) per day. The digested sludge is air-dried and composted
onsite and is available to agricultural interests. District 14 reuses wastewater for the
irrigation of agricultural fields. The farmer/owner pays for the pumping costs and the
installation of pipelines to connect the district's ponds to his field. (General Plan Amendment
04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
USAF Plant 42, located in the northern portion of Palmdale, has its own sewer system
serving the buildings within the plant. Effluent from Plant 42 is treated at facilities
located at 25th Street East and Avenue M, which process an average of 150,000
gallons per day with a capacity of 700,000 gallons, peaking at 1 million gallons.
Sewage is processed in settling basins for surface aeration and sludge is stockpiled
onsite. The treatment plant capacity was planned for maximum development and sewer
lines are extended according to the needs of new buildings at the facility.
Exhibit PS-5 shows the sewer district service areas in the Palmdale Planning Area. The
areas outside of the Los Angeles County Sanitation District boundaries are not currently
served by a sewer system and thus must rely on septic systems. The County Sanitation
District will annex these areas when demand is great enough to warrant the expansion
of existing district boundaries. The City requires all new multiple family, commercial,
industrial, and single family development on lots of less than one acre to annex to the
District and connect to a public sewer system. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City
Council July 26, 2004.)
Developers are responsible for construction of on-site sewage facilities and for
connection to the Los Angeles County Sanitation District sewer trunk lines. Developers
pay an annexation fee and the costs of lines needed to serve their development. The
connection fees charged for tapping these lines are placed into a special fund, which is
used to finance future treatment plant expansions. This funding makes most districts
self-financing and allows them to expand their services according to the growth
pressures of the area. In addition to fee revenues for plant capacity expansion, the City
has assisted in financing sewer line construction through use of assessment financing.
(General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
Requirements for sewer treatment plant capacity may be calculated at a sewage
generation rate of 88 and 94 gallons per capita per day at Districts 20 and 14,
respectively. Projections of future sewage production is based on SCAG growth
projections, which are thought to be quite aggressive.. Table PS-3 and Exhibit PS-4
show effluent flow projections for the year 2020, assuming that all future development in
the Planning Area is served. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)

   Buildout of the land use plan will generate approximately 123.1 million gallons of
   sewage per day. The Sanitation District considers future expansion to serve buildout of
   the area, but actively plans expansion for the next 10 to 20 year period. Expanded
   capacities will enable the City to meet existing demands for sewage treatment and will
   be adequate for several years. However, significant expansion (new technology,
   additional plants) will be required to handle long-term growth in the Antelope Valley.
   Expansions will proceed according to growth trends, with the connection fee program
   financing the expansions. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)

   The compatibility of adjacent uses to sewage treatment plant sites and distribution
networks could impact expansion plans. The present sewer treatment system is a land
intensive operation, which utilizes oxidation ponds and stockpiles bio-solids onsite. When
the City builds out, this process could raise concerns for public health and land costs. New
technology may provide treatment processes, which afford water reuse, sludge utilization,
and streamlined operations, and will be a higher priority as the City develops. However,
these facilities are critical to Palmdale’s continued growth and viability, and must be
protected from encroachment by incompatible uses, which could impact their operations.

   3.       Storm Drainage
   The major existing drainage courses in the Planning Area are described below.
   •        Amargosa Creek - This creek collects runoff from the northern face of the Sierra
            Pelona Mountains and the southern slope of both Portal and Ritter Ridges. It
            begins at the mouth of the San Francisquito Canyon, travels the length of Leona

        Valley and enters Palmdale along Elizabeth Lake Road, in the vicinity of the
        intersection of 25th Street West and Elizabeth Lake Road.
        The creek travels north to Avenue K, where it is divided into two flows. The
        western flow is concentrated at 20th Street West and Avenue J in a channel
        constructed for the Antelope Valley Freeway. It continues toward the north,
        running parallel to the freeway, to a retention basin located near the intersection
        of Avenue G and 20th Street West in Lancaster. The second flow is diverted to
        the east of Lancaster, generally following a northerly course between the
        Southern Pacific Railroad and 10th Street East. It merges with other flood waters
        at Avenue G.
•       Anaverde Creek - This creek collects runoff from the Sierra Pelona Range, and
        drains easterly through the Anaverde Valley. The creek then flows northerly
        along Sierra Highway into USAF Plant 42, where it is initially collected in the
        Lockheed Drainage Channel and then held in the Air Force Retention Basin.
        Overflow from the retention basin would flow due north along 20th and 30th
        Streets East and merge with other flood waters at Avenue G.
•       Little Rock Wash - Little Rock Wash collects runoff from the San Gabriel
        Mountains in Little Rock Canyon and travels just west of Littlerock through the
        east side of Palmdale and proposed Palmdale Regional Airport in a northerly
        direction to Rosamond Dry Lake.
•       Big Rock Wash - Big Rock Wash collects runoff from the San Gabriel Mountains
        in Pallett and Big Rock creeks. Traveling north from Holcomb Ridge through
        Pearblossom, it is divided by the Alpine, Lovejoy, and Piute Buttes and merges at
        Avenue E, prior to entering Edwards Air Force Base and Rogers Dry Lake.
Most drainage courses in Palmdale are unimproved, thereby allowing storm water to
overflow into adjacent flat areas, contributing to sheet flow. The Rosamond and Rogers
dry lakes serve as final destinations of water runoff in the Antelope Valley. Although
disastrous floods have not occurred in Palmdale, localized flooding has occurred when
rainfall is heavy and prolonged. The City's Master Drainage Plan was adopted in 1989
to provide a long term solution to localized flooding. Retention and detention basins,
pipes, and channels will be constructed throughout the City to protect existing and
future development from flooding.           Approximately $225 million worth of City
improvements are proposed under the Master Drainage Plan. Funding for construction
of Master Drainage Plan facilities will come from a variety of sources as specified by the
City's Capital Improvements Program, including special assessment districts and
drainage impact fees collected from new developments. Depending on the future rate

of development, it could take 10 to 20 years to fully implement the Master Drainage
Plan.
New development increases impervious surface area and decreases the rate at which
runoff percolates into the ground, thus increasing storm runoff to low-lying areas. As an
interim flood control measure, the City requires individual development projects to
provide flood control lots within their projects that serve as detention basins for storm
runoff. During the past several years, the City has required interim flood control basins
for all new developments throughout the City. Culverts that carry surface runoff have
been constructed at road crossings, and road shoulders have been graded to allow
water to flow north toward the valley floor where it can percolate and aid groundwater
recharge. In some areas, lined channels safely carry runoff down hillsides, preventing
erosion by running water. Unlined channels allow runoff flow to percolate, decreasing
the volume of storm water carried to the dry lakebeds north of the Planning Area.
Storm drainage facilities in the City consist of both natural and lined channels. In
addition to allowing groundwater recharge, natural drainage channels can support
significant biological communities. However, these unimproved channels can pose a
threat to life and property by the possibility of intermittent floods. A balance between
resource protection and public safety must be achieved. Factors influencing decisions
on drainage improvements include the cost of improvements and the availability of
funding to implement them; the potential use of land use regulations (low density zoning
and lot coverage limits) to reduce runoff and exposure of residents to hazards; and the
potential use of flood hazard areas for uses compatible with periodic flooding
(recreation).
4.      Law Enforcement
The City of Palmdale receives law enforcement services under contract with the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The unincorporated areas surrounding the City
receive law enforcement services from the Sheriff's Department and traffic enforcement
services from the California Highway Patrol (CHP). Each agency provides emergency
back up for the other. Currently there are two sheriff's stations serving the Antelope
Valley, one in Lancaster and the other in Palmdale, with a total patrol area of 1,370
square miles, as shown on Exhibit PS-7. Together, the stations have 329 sworn
officers, 34 detectives and 105 staff personnel. 154 sworn officers, 15 detectives and
40 staff personnel currently staff the Palmdale station. An independent sheriff sub-
station in Palmdale was completed in early 1992 and has since expanded to full
capacity. A new state-of-the-art sheriff’s station is planned in Palmdale on Sierra
Highway at Avenue Q, which is scheduled to open in December 2005, with
groundbreaking slated for June 2004. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July
26, 2004.)

                                                                                      1/25/93

Public Services
The CHP station has 40 uniformed officers and 4 staff personnel handling traffic related
activities. The CHP is also involved in accident prevention, school bus safety,
motorcycle training, and truck safety. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26,
2004.)
Although the number of major crimes reported in the City of Palmdale during the period
from 1999 to 2002 increased over the prior period of 1988 to 1991, the crime rate
(crimes per capita) decreased during the same period, which is likely due to a 63%
increase in population between 1991 and 2002This may also be attributed to increased
visibility of local law enforcement agencies and greater involvement of community watch
groups. Table PS-4 shows reported crimes from 1999 to 2002. (General Plan Amendment 04-
05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
Law enforcement planning generally assumes 1 to 4 officers per 1,500 population, with
ratios decreasing as the population gets larger. In addition to population, projections for
police protection consider the area's crime rate, size, resources, and desired level of
service. Annual review of the City contract with the Sheriff's Department is conducted to
ensure that services will be adequate for City needs. In 2004, the contracted units and
services roughly equate to 65.7 sworn personnel and 5 non-sworn personnel assigned
to the City of Palmdale. Special service commitments such as foot beats and sting
operations are handled by separate arrangement with the Sheriff's Department. (General
Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)

Fire protection services for Palmdale are provided by the Los Angeles County Fire
Department. Fire protection services are financed through property tax assessments.
Stations 24, 37, and 131 are currently located within the Palmdale Planning Area.
There are five additional stations (Station 84, 114, 129, 92 and 117) that serve the
outlying areas. Although United States Air Force Plant 42 is located within the sphere
of influence, it maintains its own fire protection staff and equipment, and has a mutual
aid agreement with the City. Exhibit PS-8 shows the districts and fire stations, which
serve the Planning Area. Table PS-5 lists available manpower and equipment at each
station.
The Los Angeles County Fire Department also receives mutual aid from the U.S. Forest
Service. As a part of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, all manpower and
resources of the Department back up the fire stations in Palmdale. Fire protection
needs in the Planning Area will be met by the entire department's resources, if needed,
regardless of the number of firefighters and equipment stationed in the Palmdale area.
The fire prevention office located in Lancaster is responsible for reviewing new
development applications and building permits to ensure that new construction projects
adhere to fire code requirements. The requirements for fire safety in construction
include fire retardant materials, water storage tanks, fire hydrants, sprinkler systems,
fire alarms, and fire escapes. Fire code requirements vary according to the type of use
and construction materials employed. Additionally, fire protection requires a ready
source of water for firefighting uses. Fire suppression water flow requirements are
calculated together with domestic requirements, to ensure adequate availability of water
to meet both domestic and emergency needs.

ensure compliance with the fire code. Additionally, the fire protection office conducts
information programs for the community on fire awareness and protection.
In order to adequately serve the growing population, additional fire stations will be
required. New fire stations will be located in the areas with the greatest amount of
development, as the need for additional fire service is determined by the Los Angeles
County Fire Department. There is one fire station proposed for the Ritter Ranch area
and a second station within the City Ranch area, along with fire suppression personnel
and equipment. Other fire stations are planned at Massari and Rancho Vista Park sites.
Future expansions of fire protection facilities will be coordinated with the Los Angeles
County Fire Department.

6.       Electric Power
The Southern California Edison Company (SCE) provides electricity to a 50,000 square
mile region, of which the Antelope Valley is a part. Its service area extends to Bishop
on the north, Nevada on the east, Orange County on the south, and Santa Barbara on
the west. Smaller electric companies exist within these boundaries as well. SCE
provides electric service to 12 million individuals and 835 cities and communities. SCE
serves 4.6 million customer accounts, including 285,000 commercial, industrial, and
non-profit customers in these areas of central and Southern California. (General Plan
Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
Due to the restructuring of California’s electric industry, Southern California Edison
generates only a portion of the power needed for customers. During 2003, company
owned generation accounted for 47.9% of the energy purchased for customers.
Company owned generation includes hydropower facilities in the Sierra Nevadas and
nuclear power facilities near San Diego (San Onofre) as well as a portion of plants in
Utah and Nevada. SCE contracts for energy from other power companies in the region
and outside the state. In addition, SCE contracts for power with a number of renewable
generators including bio-mass, geothermal, small hydro-electric, solar, and wind
facilities. The company expects to meet the mandated 20% use of renewable energy in
accordance with recent legislation. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26,
2004.)
The Palmdale Planning Area is served by SCE from its Vincent Substation. Major
transmission lines traverse the southwestern section of the Planning Area (see Exhibit
PS-9) from the Vincent Substation to the Gorman and Antelope substations. Currently,
usage at the Vincent substation is 1.5 billion kWh annually. The breakdown of usage by
type of user for the Palmdale area in 1991 is presented in Table PS-6. (General Plan
Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
According to Edison, in 2003 the system load grew by 2500 gigawatts or 3.2% due to
weather conditions. 2004 is predicted as a normal weather year and growth will be
close to 0%. 2003 sales were 82,188 millions of kwh or gigawatts; 2003 sales are
projected to be 82,198 gigawatts. 2005 economic growth will kick in and sales are
projected to be 83,964 gigawatts, a 2.1% increase; 2006 projection is 85,217 gigawatt,
or a 1.4% increase; and 2007 is 86,610 gigawatts, a 1.6% increase. (General Plan
Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
Improvement plans to meet this increased demand include the upgrade of substations
and conductors, extension of lines, and replacement of poles. Plans for expansion also
include a possible substation in the Ritter Ranch area and increased transmission
capacity through the west Palmdale area. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council

Additional electric power needs for the immediate future will not significantly affect
Palmdale. SCE will continue to expand in conjunction with increasing electrical
demands. No additional substations or distribution stations, aside from the one planned
for the area, are proposed. Provided that planned facilities expansion are constructed,
Southern California Edison Company will have adequate electrical power available to
meet the community's long term needs.
The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) regulates energy sources, plant sites, line
locations and charges, and assures that developments are not denied electric power
services. Developments proposed far from existing service areas may find the cost of
extending electric service to be costly, particularly for small projects. (General Plan
Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
The compatibility of adjacent uses to utility facilities and transmission lines must be
considered in the development review process because of potential risks to health and
property. The presence of power line easements and rights-of-way pose constraints to
site planning and development. Undergrounding utility lines may be more attractive and
lessen the environmental impacts of development, but costs are higher.
7.       Natural Gas
The Southern California Gas Company provides natural gas to most areas in Southern
California, including the Antelope Valley. The City of Palmdale is within the boundaries
of the Foothill distribution division and the North Basin transmission division. The
Southern California Gas Company serves domestic and commercial uses in the
Planning Area with about 28,000 customers. The average consumption to single-family
units is 1,095 therms per year. Industrial and commercial loads vary depending on the
type of equipment used and the type of business. The Public Utilities Commission

regulates the maintenance and operation of gas distribution facilities with standards for
public safety and fair practices.
In remote areas where gas lines do not exist, the extension of gas mains depended on
the demand and willingness of property owners to pay for the needed connecting lines.
Rules and tariff schedules are set up by the Public Utilities Commission to regulate such
service extensions. In outlying rural areas, propane is used as a substitute until the
demand for natural gas connections is great enough to warrant installation of lines.
Southern California Gas Company will have adequate natural gas available to meet the
community’s long-term needs, as long as main line extensions are constructed
concurrent with development.
8.      Solid Waste Disposal
The City currently issues permits to three disposal companies for commercial/industrial
solid waste disposal. Presently, Waste Management, Larey Rubbish Pick-up Service
and Crown Disposal may set their own rates and compete for commercial/industrial
customers. The commercial/industrial rubbish haulers utilize both the Antelope Valley
Landfill and the Lancaster Landfill (Waste Management). (General Plan Amendment 04-05,
adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
Residential solid waste disposal in Palmdale is provided in the City by franchise contract
with the Waste Management at the Antelope Valley Landfill located at 1200 W. City
Ranch Road in Palmdale. The franchise agreement sets residential pick-up rates and
establishes standards for service. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26,
2004.)
The Antelope Valley Landfill has served residential and commercial establishments in
the City since 1955 (see Exhibit PS-10). The site currently covers approximately 72
acres of land. The northern 65-acre parcel is approved for landfill operations under the
current Solid Waste Facilities Permit (SWFP) No. 19-AA-0009; with approximately 57
acres used for disposal of refuse and the remaining seven acres used for offices and
hauling company operations ancillary to the landfill. Immediately adjacent to the west is
a 98-acre area that was annexed to the City in 2003. Prior to annexation, County
Regional Planning granted a Conditional Use Permit for use of this land also as landfill
(SWFP No. 19-AA-5624. An additional 10 acres was approved for ancillary uses, for a
total landfill area of 180 acres with a capacity of approximately 105 million tons of solid
waste. The landfill accepts some loads from surrounding areas in the Antelope Valley
but does not accept liquid waste and sludge. The Landfill is not approved for disposal
of hazardous materials. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
In Palmdale alone, approximately 32,600 households and 1,750 commercial businesses
are served by the landfill, aside from private haulers who are charged a fee according to
                                           PS-42                      Adopted by City Council

the type and volume of refuse brought in.             (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council
July 26, 2004.)
Solid waste generation forecasts for the City of Palmdale were prepared as part of the
Integrated Waste Management Plan in October 1991. Table PS-7 lists generation
forecasts by year through 2005.
The forecast solid waste generation listed in Table PS-7 is a pre-program projection that
does not assume successful source reduction or recycling. The City's adopted
Integrated Waste Management Plan authorizes a City-wide plan to recycle up to 25
percent of all solid waste generation by 1995 and 50 percent by the year 2000. If the
City were successful in its recycling programs, 2005 waste generation would only be
95,958 tons. Waste Management reports that the recycling program has been
historically successful with diversion in excess of 50%; however, only a 42% diversion
was achieved in 2000. It is anticipated that the two landfills should reach capacity in
2022 at current permit limits. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
Other landfills in the region are starting to reach capacity and thus influencing dumping
activities at the Palmdale site. Waste Management operates a landfill in Lancaster and
recently indicated that the Lancaster landfill has sufficient capacity to accommodate the
City of Lancaster’s growth. In addition, the fee structure for waste disposal influences
the decision of private haulers to dump in Palmdale rather than another site. If the fees
are comparatively lower, more private haulers and disposal companies may use the
Palmdale landfill and fill the site faster. If all other landfills are full, haulers may divert
solid wastes to the Palmdale site as long as it continues to accept private haulers.
(General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
A variety of techniques can be employed to assure the long-term viability of the Landfill.
The City and the landfill operators should monitor such issues as compatibility of
proposed adjacent land uses, environmental impacts, aesthetics and disposal practices.
Unless well managed, landfills can create noise, dust, and odors, and seepage of waste
can contaminate groundwater sources. Prudent solid waste disposal management
techniques at the landfill can improve economic returns, and may increase the capacity
and life of the landfill site.

9.     Telephone Systems
Prior to the mid-1990’s, Pacific Bell provided telephone service to almost 90 percent of
the Palmdale Planning Area, including a majority of the 34,600 residential and 4,378
business customers in the exchange area. General Telephone served approximately
2,500 residential customers in the Quartz Hill area, the Rancho Vista area and the
northern part of the City between Avenue M and Avenue L, and no business customers.
MCI cable lines run parallel to and along the California Aqueduct, south and southwest
of the City. In a sweeping overhaul of the Communications Act of 1934, Congress
enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Its goal was to deregulate the industry
and encourage competition. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
Telephone service is provided based on the availability of existing lines or on the
availability of digital phone service. The Public Utilities Commission no longer regulates
user fees. Developers must pay for the extension of existing landlines to serve their
developments, and the number of lots served determines the cost of line extensions.
Individual extensions are often costly or infeasible. Today, service availability is based
on customer demand. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)

10.     Cable
Cable television is an information and entertainment source. Residential subdivisions
provide cable connections through arrangements with local companies. Presently,
Adelphia services most of the Palmdale area. Aside from such basic cable service as
stations from Los Angeles and the Cable News Network, the company offers digital
cable service, sports and movie channels. There are 28,397 active customers in
Palmdale, and 72,388 in the entire Antelope Valley. Nineteen percent of the cables are
overhead and 81 percent are underground lines. Cable service areas will be expanded
to meet the needs of the community as it develops. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by
City Council July 26, 2004.)
11.     Library Services
The Palmdale City Library, built in 1977, is located at the Civic Center on 700 E.
Palmdale Boulevard. The Youth Library, consisting of approximately 10,000 square feet
was opened in August 1998. The two libraries have a 131,824-book and other
materials collection in buildings with a gross floor area of 22,450 square feet. The
library offers book-lending privileges, audiovisual materials, Internet access, periodicals,
Palmdale historical information, an adult literacy program, typewriters, microfiche, maps,
and videos. It contains 114 reader seats and presently accommodates 33.53 full-time
equivalent staff. Standards for library service have been developed by the Wisconsin
Department of Public Instruction (Wisconsin Public Library Standards 1988), which are
as follows: (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
1.      The library's site should be readily accessible to all residents; travel time to the
        library should not exceed 15 minutes one way by car. Where travel times to the
        library's principal facility exceed these limits, branches or outlets or alternative
        means of providing access (bookmobiles, books by mail) should be considered.
2.      Quantitative criteria for standard space and service are:
        •          2.5 volumes per capita.
        •          8.5 periodicals per 1,000 population.
        •          0.5 staff per 1,000 population.
        •          5.0 reader's seats per 1,000 population.
        •          1.0 parking spaces for every 2 adult seats, supplemented by additional
                   parking space for all meeting rooms and staff.
        •          125 square feet per staff for workroom space.
        •          10 percent of the gross square footage of the library building should be
                   devoted to storage space.

1/25/93

                                                                                  Public Services
There is no national standard for library size. The Wisconsin Public Library Standard
and current library building practice recommends the determination of overall library
size by individual space requirements of the population and book collection. However, a
rule of thumb for library size is 0.80 square feet per capita.
In 2004, Palmdale had a population of 131,295; based upon the service level standards
cited above, Palmdale currently needs 328,237 books and other materials, 1,116
periodicals, 65.64 staff persons, 655 reader seats, 8,205 square feet of workroom
space, and 105,036 square feet of library space to serve the present population. These
figures indicate that the City's library facilities have not kept pace with Palmdale's rapid
growth. If present trends continue, patrons will increasingly find a lack of materials,
seats, and staff. Table PS-8 compares existing facilities with desired service levels and
projected needs for 2010 when population is estimated at 167,264 persons. (General Plan
Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
In addition to the City library, there is a county branch library in Quartz Hill, northwest of
the City and another in Littlerock, southeast of the City, as well as one in Lancaster (see
Exhibit PS-12). All three libraries are part of the county library system and have
reciprocal agreements with the Palmdale Library. Visitors are granted borrowing
privileges as long as they live anywhere within Los Angeles County.
The City has recently purchased a 28-foot long bookmobile and will begin operating at
various locations throughout the City in the summer of 2004. It will hold approximately
3,000 items. Items from both the Main Library and the Youth Library will be rotated on
and off the bookmobile on a regular basis. One County bookmobile operates in the
Antelope Valley to serve outlying areas. In FY2002-03, this program circulated a total of
46,874 items, including adult and children’s books and audio-visual materials. In
addition, there is a books-by-mail program, which serves the Antelope Valley. This
service maintains a 10,000-book collection and has 1 full-time and 2 part-time
employees. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)

Pressures on the City to expand library services and adapt to the changing needs
brought by population growth are partially mitigated by county libraries. Nonetheless,
the City library will need to be expanded to meet the demands of a growing population.
In addition to a larger downtown library, the City should establish a west side branch
and an east side branch by year 2010. Ultimately buildout of development permitted
under the General Plan will require additional branches. The west side branch has
been proposed within the Ritter Ranch Specific Plan area. In locating branch libraries,
consideration should be given to availability of public transportation, and proximity to
other neighborhood service uses such as commercial or civic buildings.

Public Services
The Keppel Union School District serves the eastern and southeastern sections of the
Planning Area and has six schools (Almondale, Alpine, Antelope, Daisy Gibson, Lake
Los Angeles, and Pearblossom). The Almondale, Alpine and Daisy Gibson schools
presently serve the Palmdale Planning Area. The 2004 enrollment in the district was
3,022 students. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
The Eastside School District serves the northeastern portion of the Planning Area with
four schools (Eastside, Tierra Bonita North, Gifford C. Cole Intermediate and Tierra
Bonita South) that serve 2,483 students. The District serves a small area on the
northeast section of Palmdale. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
The Acton-Agua Dulce School District serves the southwest portion of the Planning
Area. It currently has two elementary schools (Acton and Agua Dulce); although, Acton
Elementary is scheduled to close in 2004-05, and one intermediate school (High
Desert), which will accommodate grades 6-8 in 2004-05 in the Acton and Agua Dulce
areas. The district experienced approximately 30 percent reduction in student
population between 1994 and 2004, resulting in the planned school closure. The
enrollment for the fall of 2004 was 1,187 students. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by
City Council July 26, 2004.)
The Hughes/Elizabeth Lakes Union School District serves Lake Hughes, Lake
Elizabeth, and Green Valley. The District maintains one school, Hughes/Elizabeth
Lakes (K-8), which served 430 students as of 2004. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by
City Council July 26, 2004.)
High Schools
The Antelope Valley Union High School District serves the entire Planning Area and has
seven high schools: Antelope Valley, Highland, Quartz Hill, Littlerock, Palmdale,
Lancaster, and Knight. In addition, the District operates a special needs high school
and Desert Winds and Phoenix continuation schools. Exhibit PS-14 shows the sites
and attendance boundaries of the seven high schools. A third continuation high school,
R. Rex Parris, is scheduled to open in Fall 2004. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City
Council July 26, 2004.)
Colleges      (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
The Antelope Valley Community College campus is located in Lancaster. The district
that serves this campus is among the largest in the State from a geographic standpoint
and encompasses about 2,000 square files of territory with borders on Kern, San
Bernardino, and Ventura Counties. The College District has in the past indicated a
desire to establish a Palmdale campus to better serve the southeast portion of the
district. A plan for developing such a campus was approved in 2000 on approximately

80 acres located near Barrel Springs Road and 47th Street East. To date, funding for
construction of that campus has not been available. The College District has in the past
and intends to continue to provide classrooms within existing buildings located in
Palmdale. It is anticipated that if funding becomes available at some time in the future,
a Palmdale campus could be built. The Lancaster campus is expected to reach
capacity some time over the next 15 to 20 years.
California State University, Bakersfield-Antelope Valley is officially recognized by the
California Postsecondary Education Commission as an off-campus center. The
Center’s mission is to provide Antelope Valley residents with access to a four-year state
university and to contribute to the region’s development and quality of life. The Center
has grown to 700 full-time equivalent students. Baccalaureate degrees are offered at
the Center in Communications, Criminal Justice, Economics, English, Liberal Studies,
Psychology, and Sociology through the School of Humanities and Social Sciences;
Nursing through the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics; master’s degrees in
Educational Administration, Curriculum and Instruction and credential programs in
multiple and single subjects and special education through the School of Education.

13.      Hospitals
There are currently no hospitals located within the Planning Area; however, a new 170-
bed hospital is proposed on 37 acres located at the northeast corner of Avenue Q-7 and
Tierra Subida Avenue. The hospital is scheduled to commence construction in mid-2005
with completion expected by the end of 2006. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by City
Council July 26, 2004.)
Other hospitals located in the proximity of the Palmdale Planning Area include
Lancaster Community Hospital and the Antelope Valley Medical Center in Lancaster.
The Lancaster Community Hospital is located at 43830 N. 10th Street West. It has 121
licensed beds with 620 full-time and part-time employees and offers 24-hour emergency
services, general medicine, an intensive care unit, surgery, a specialized heart center,
respiratory therapy, lab services, gastroenterology lab, mammography, CT scanner,
cardiology, physical therapy, radiology, nuclear medicine/ultrasound, occupational
therapy, and a laser surgery center.
Antelope Valley Hospital is located at 1600 W. Avenue J in Lancaster. It is a district
facility serving a 1,586 square mile area. It has 370 beds with approximately 2,300 full-
time and part-time employees and offers many of the same services as Lancaster
Community Hospital, including 24-hour emergency services, a speech care unit, open-
heart surgery and sexual assault response services.
There are three convalescent hospitals located near the Planning Area that can serve
residents of Palmdale: the Antelope Valley and Lancaster Convalescent Hospitals in
Lancaster, and the Mayflower Gardens Convalescent Hospital in Quartz Hill.
The adequacy of hospital services is difficult to determine due to the different range of
services offered. The distance of users to the facility is only one factor influencing use
of a hospital. Doctor referral, price, and quality of service are major considerations for
persons requiring health care services.
Hospitals that serve a small area may not be equipped with all the specialized
equipment and medical staff that larger establishments have. The feasibility of new
hospital ventures depends on the demand for health cares services and the economic
returns of the investment. The City promotes these facilities to ensure that adequate
facilities are available to serve the Planning Area; however, the City has no direct
authority to provide health care services.

B.      Development Considerations
Adequate delivery of public services to present and future residents within the Planning
Area will require careful planning, coordination, and fiscal responsibility. Provision of
infrastructure and services will be constrained to some degree by the following factors:
1.      Development Patterns
Development within the City has dispersed residential neighborhoods over a wide area,
leaving vacant areas surrounded by new development. This scattered development
pattern makes efficient use of regional infrastructure difficult and increases costs of
serving each unit. The policies under Objective PS1.3 encourage infill development that
utilizes existing infrastructure, and discourage continued leapfrog development away
from the City center into outlying rural areas. Development pressures to urbanize in
rural areas are expected to continue, due to lower land costs in these areas. Objective
PS1.1 reflects the City's view that development should support itself, with no negative
impact upon services being provided to existing City residents. The policies under this
objective should apply to long-term maintenance and operation of public facilities, as
well as to capital costs. In addition, Policy LU1.1.2 in the Land Use Element promotes
infill developments; implementation of this policy could reward infill development,
possibly with higher densities or other incentives, to foster a more continuous and
cohesive pattern of urban development within the City core area.
2.      Fiscal Constraints
Availability of funding is the primary constraint to infrastructure construction and
maintenance. Palmdale presently uses a variety of funding methods to finance new
infrastructure, including assessment districts, Mello-Roos community facility districts,
and impact fees. Each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages, and is
useful for different facility types.
The City's drainage, traffic and park impact fees provide a method of charging each new
unit for its impact upon the regional system. A drawback of financing infrastructure
improvements with developer fees is the need for large expenditures of funds at the
time the facility is built, while the fees are collected incrementally over time. It is difficult
to collect enough fees to ensure that infrastructure is constructed when the units are
built. The City will need to continue to use public financing districts where necessary,
and explore other creative ways of obtaining financing to build public improvements
concurrently with new development.
3.      Interjurisdictional Coordination
Adopted by City Council                       PS-55
1/25/93
                                                                            Public Services
The number of agencies, both public and private, which is in the business of providing
public services, presents a challenge in terms of coordination. The City is in an ideal
position to play a role in facilitating this coordination, since it is the lead agency in
approving new development. This type of coordination takes time and City resources;
however, a lack of coordination will ultimately require even more time, money and
resources to remedy.
4.      Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints to provision of infrastructure may be viewed from different
perspectives. On one hand, natural resources needed to support growth must be
protected and managed, and the impacts of that growth to the environment must be
assessed and mitigated. Water supply and air quality are two natural resources, the
availability of which will dictate future development potential in the Antelope Valley.
On the other side, much has been written about the additional time and cost incurred by
development in California due to the procedural requirements mandated by CEQA.
These constraints apply equally to public works projects. For example, while widening
of Highway 14 and realignment of Highway 138 have been identified in the General Plan
as City goals, these projects may have significant environmental impacts which could
delay their construction and add substantial costs. The City will need to carefully weigh
its obligation to protect the environment against the need to expand the infrastructure
systems necessary to support its planned growth. (General Plan Amendment 04-05, adopted by
City Council July 26, 2004.)
5.      The Need to Retrofit Infrastructure into Developed Areas
Most of the existing county island areas will be annexed during the life of the General
Plan. These areas were originally developed according to county standards and lack
many of the infrastructure improvements typically required for urbanized development.
Developing programs to fund and construct needed improvements, without financially
impacting the City or overburdening the affected property owners, will be the major
challenge to provision of adequate infrastructure in these areas.

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
Natural and man-made disasters result in losses of life and property, economic and
social setbacks, and the destruction of the environment. Local governments are
charged with the responsibility of protecting their residents from danger and harm. The
Safety Element is intended to guide development by reducing the levels of risk posed by
natural and man-made hazards within the City and its Planning Area.
Some degree of risk is inevitable since natural disasters cannot be predicted with
certainty, and because the knowledge and technology to control man-made risks is
constantly evolving. Since the total elimination of risk is not possible, public safety is
relative to the degree of risk that people find tolerable. The value of life and property
becomes a yardstick for tolerance and the need for governmental action.
The Safety Element presents a plan for minimizing the hazards to public health and
safety. It outlines natural and man-made hazards that affect existing and future
development, and provides guidelines for protecting residents from injury and death. It
identifies present conditions and public concerns, sets policies and standards for
improved public safety, and plans for protection from potential disasters. It seeks to
minimize physical harm, as well as economic and social disruptions. The goals and
objectives of the Safety Element reflect the community's regard for the health and safety
of its residents. The Element addresses issues which the entire community believes
would require government intervention in order to effectively achieve public safety. The
purposes and goals of the other elements go hand-in-hand with the goals of the Safety
Element. Together, they will serve as a guide for decision-making by public and private
investors and for the future expenditure of public funds.
Specifically, the Safety Element serves the following purposes:
1.      As one of the state-mandated elements, it fulfills the requirements of the State
        Planning and Zoning Law and the regulations in Section 65302(g) of the
        Government Code of the State of California.
2.      The Element informs the public of public safety goals, objectives, and policies of
        the City for development until 2010.          It provides a comprehensive risk
        management program to serve as a guide for the day-to-day operational
        decisions of City staff.
3.      The Element evaluates the seismic, flood, geologic, wildfire, and urban fire
        hazards in the Planning Area, as well as aircraft accident potential, hazardous
        materials, and crime. It seeks to eliminate or reduce the risks to public safety
        through planning for the prevention of hazardous situations and for the provision
        of adequate emergency services.

SECTION 2: GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND POLICIES
GOAL S1: Minimize danger and damage to public health, safety, and welfare
resulting from natural hazards.
Objective S1.1: Review development within or adjacent to geologic hazards, to ensure
adequate provisions for public safety.
       Policy S1.1.1: Provide copies of geotechnical reports for projects located within
       the seismic hazard zone, as shown on latest California Department of
       Conservation Seismic Hazard Zones Map, to the State Division of Mines and
       Geology. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
       Policy S1.1.2: Assist developers in obtaining necessary technical and policy
       information regarding seismic hazards.
       Policy S1.1.3: Require geotechnical studies, to be reviewed and approved by
       the City's geologist, for development proposals in areas where geotechnical
       hazards may be present, and implement the recommendations of those reports
       as deemed necessary by the City.
       Policy S1.1.4: Require appropriate structural setbacks from active fault rupture
       traces in accordance with Alquist-Priolo standards and as required by the City,
       based on geotechnical analysis.
       Policy S1.1.5: Require structural setbacks or special foundations for structures
       within potentially active fault zones as determined by the City, based on
       geotechnical analysis.
       Policy S1.1.6: Require special foundations within inactive fault zones if
       determined necessary by the City.
       Policy S1.1.7: Restrict location of utility lines, whether above or below ground,
       within an appropriate distance from active fault traces, as determined by
       geotechnical investigation and approved by the City. Utility lines crossing active
       fault traces should be specifically designed to withstand the expected movement
       of the earth in these locations. Utility lines as defined here would include, but not
       be limited to, electricity, water, natural gas and sewer.
       Policy S1.1.8: Require that all structures should meet or exceed state required
       earthquake resistant design standards.

SECTION 3: IMPLEMENTATION
Until such time as the accurate prediction of natural phenomena is achieved and human
actions are controllable, hazards are best avoided, mitigated with reinforced protection
measures, prevented from compounding effects, and planned for. The implementation
section of the Safety Element is concerned with strategies, programs, and ordinances
that will be effective in achieving the goals, objectives, and policies contained in the
previous section of this Element. The implementation measures are categorized as
follows:
•   Public Safety Programs
•   Public Safety Standards
•   Land Use Planning
These measures, taken together, will implement the public safety goals of the City.
A.       Public Safety Programs
Public safety programs are aimed at mitigating unacceptable risks where government
action is necessary for public safety. Hazard elimination means the removal of existing
and potential hazards. As this course is not always possible, precaution and
preparedness are necessary. The public safety policies recommend a number of
programs that will reduce the loss of life, injury, and property damage in the event of a
disaster. These programs focus on educating the public concerning the proper
procedures for avoiding hazards; the need for increased emergency preparedness; and
prevention or mitigation of existing and potential hazards.
Emergency preparedness means the awareness of existing and potential hazards and
the adoption of mitigation measures to preserve public health and safety. The City's
policy is to give first priority to saving human lives, and to reduce property damage,
second. The City also seeks to eliminate a hazard, reduce the risks if the hazard
cannot be eliminated or avoided; but above all, to plan for any potential disasters.
Criteria for the allocation of public funds for various safety programs will determine
priorities and facilitate implementation. Both private and public funds and resources will
be solicited for these programs.
1.       Existing Hazardous Buildings
The City will develop an inventory of existing hazardous buildings (structures highly
susceptible to earthquakes, flood, fire, and other hazards). Existing structures may be
required to be improved up to current safety codes before any change of occupancy or
use is allowed.
                                            S-11                Adopted by City Council
                                                                                  1/25/93

Safety
2.      Relocation/Rehabilitation Program
The City will study the need to develop a relocation/demolition/rehabilitation program to
remove or reduce threats to life and safety associated with known hazardous structures.
All available funding resources will be pursued to implement this program. If necessary,
relocation assistance will be provided for dependent populations that may presently
occupy these buildings.
3.      Geologic Investigation
The City Engineering Geologist will evaluate the need for a geologic investigation for
proposed development within areas of potential geologic hazards.                 Geologic
investigations will be required to include assessment of soil stability, susceptibility to
geologic hazards in the area, and any other conditions which, as determined by the City
Geologist/City Engineer, may affect structural foundations.
4.      Construction and Land Use Standards
The City will review all new development for compliance with construction and land use
standards regarding earthquake, fire, aircraft accident, and other hazards. Strict
enforcement of building codes and development standards shall be maintained with
modifications granted only if no risks to life and property are involved.
5.      Special Study Zones
The City has established special study zones in known hazardous areas (earthquake
fault zones, flood hazard areas, and areas of steep slopes) in order to identify the need
for in depth studies before allowing development within these areas (See Exhibit LU-4.)
The construction of high density uses and critical structures on hazardous sites will be
limited as required by California state law and City ordinances.
6.      Volunteers
The City will offer training programs for people interested in volunteering during
emergency preparedness/response activities so that during major disasters, these
volunteers are organized and prepared. This program will allow the City to reach out to
residents and inform them of ways they can prepare and help others during disasters.
The program could also provide additional manpower to City and County agencies in
abating or responding to an emergency.

7.     Emergency Management
Public officials will be encouraged to attend seminars dealing with emergency
management. Better trained leaders will provide the City with the best knowledge to
deal with emergency situations. The City will ensure that emergency service providers
are competently trained and have adequate resources to respond to the demands of a
major disaster.
8.     Public Information and Education
The City will develop programs for public information and the education of residents and
businesses on earthquake safety, hazardous materials, aircraft accident, fire prevention,
flood hazards, crime, dam inundation, geologic hazards, and other issues for which
prevention measures may decrease the potential for personal injury and property
damage.
9.     City Emergency Preparedness Plan
The City has adopted an Emergency Preparedness Plan which identifies emergency
responses and recovery operations for disaster occurrences affecting the City. The City
will update these procedures at least every five years to accommodate growth and
changing situations and to reinform responsible agencies of their specific roles.
Resource listings within the City Emergency Preparedness Plan will be updated
annually. The City's emergency plan includes disaster recovery programs and
reconstruction standards and measures as well as the following information.
•   Evacuation Procedures/Routes--The City will coordinate with the Office of
    Emergency Services, the Sheriff's Department, and local fire stations in establishing
    evacuation procedures in the Planning Area. Exhibit S-1 identifies major streets
    which may serve as evacuation routes.
•   Emergency Drills--The City's Disaster Preparedness Coordinator will conduct drills
    each year. These drills will keep both public and private agencies informed of
    general safety procedures and individual responsibilities. Also, emergency training
    exercises with state and regional agencies shall be conducted.
•   Monitoring and Warning System--The City will continually review its warning and
    public information system, which will facilitate communication during disasters. The
    public shall be informed of these warning systems to allow prompt and timely
    responses.
                                           S-13                Adopted by City Council

Safety
•   Resource Listing--The City will update its list of resources and individual
    responsibilities every year to maintain emergency preparedness.
10.    Emergency Shelters
Various natural and man-made disasters could affect the residents of Palmdale.
Potential disasters include a major earthquake, hazardous materials incident, flooding,
dam failure, national security emergency, transportation incident, and major fires in
either the wildland or urban areas. In the event of a disaster, local officials and the
Emergency Preparedness Coordinator, in conjunction with the Antelope Valley Chapter
of the Red Cross need to assess the requirements for mass shelter and feeding.
The City's Emergency Preparedness Coordinator has the responsibility for organizing
an emergency response plan as required by the State Office of Emergency Services
(OES). This multi-hazard emergency plan addresses the City's preparedness response,
recovery, and mitigation in the event of an emergency. The City's plan designates the
Red Cross as the official disaster relief agency and arranges for other organizations,
such as the Salvation Army to assist in disaster relief efforts.
Besides developing the City's multi-hazard emergency plan, the Emergency
Preparedness Coordinator is also responsible for locating suitable facilities for shelter
and making arrangements with the owners of these facilities for use in the event of a
disaster. Such ideal facilities are schools, as they are public facilities and can
accommodate a large number of people. Additionally, churches and commercial
lodging facilities such as motels and hotels could be employed as needed.
Table S-1 below lists potential care and shelter supporting organizations that might be
employed in the event of a disaster. These facilities are depicted on Exhibit S-2.

property maintenance. The ordinance will require that all properties within the City are
maintained in a condition which is free from potential risks to public health, safety and
welfare.
B.      Public Safety Standards
The City will enforce public safety standards in reviewing development proposals, and in
land use planning. These standards protect future developments from natural and man-
made hazards and provide benchmarks for achieving the goals and objectives listed in
Section 2. Other standards, such as minimum street widths and peak water loads, are
required by the state code. Standards for streets are discussed in the implementation
section of the Circulation Element.
1.      Standards for Construction and Development
Construction and development standards contained in the Zoning and Building codes
include:
•   Engineered construction must comply with Uniform Building Code requirements for
    seismic zone.
•   Emergency facilities and sites with explosives and toxic materials must adhere to
    more restrictive seismic safety construction.
•   Emergency facilities shall be set back from known hazard areas (earthquake fault
    zones, aircraft crash zones, and flood plains).
•   Critical use structures must conduct geologic/seismic hazards studies before
    construction, and implement appropriate construction techniques.
                                           S-19                Adopted by City Council

4.      Floodplain Development Standards
The City has adopted a Master Drainage Plan which establishes a consistent policy and
program for handling stormwater runoff in developed areas. This plan will be
coordinated with the City's capital improvement program. All development in the City
must be consistent with the Master Drainage Plan. In addition, all development in flood
hazard areas will be required to comply with state and federal regulations, including:
•   Executive Order 11988, Flood Plain Management
•   Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 as amended (PL 93-234)
•   National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR Part 59-75)
•   Floodplain Management Guidelines (43 PR 6030)
•   L.A. County Flood Control District regulations
Where development in flood hazard areas cannot be avoided, the proposed project or
activity must be designed or modified so as to minimize the potential adverse impacts
affecting floodplains, restore and preserve the natural and beneficial values served by
floodplains, and to use measures which mitigate or reduce the risk of flood loss.
Mitigation must achieve protection of life, property, and the natural and beneficial values
of the floodplain.
5.      Joint Land Use Committee Policies
New projects and land use requests should be reviewed for conformance with the intent
of the Joint Land Use Committee (JLUC) policies. The JLUC policies related to safety
are as follows:
a.      Land Use Within the Accident Potential Zones.
        (1)    Clear Zone.
All of the Clear Zones are currently within the boundaries of Plant 42 and are not within
the jurisdiction of either city (City of Palmdale or City of Lancaster) or the County.

C.      Land Use Planning
The goals, objectives, and policies included in the Safety and other elements provide
the framework for hazards mitigation through prudent land use planning. One of the
most powerful tools for protecting public safety available in the General Plan process is
the Land Use Map, which designates the appropriate location for the various types of
development permitted in this plan. In areas where a significant hazard is present, the
type of development permitted must reduce risks to an acceptable level.
Land uses which would potentially handle hazardous materials/wastes shall not be
located near residential areas, critical facilities, immobile populations, and other areas
as specified in the City's Hazardous Waste Management Plan.
Flood hazard areas, aircraft crash zones, and the seismic hazard zones are shown on
Exhibits LU-4, S-2 and S-17. Unstable soils are shown in Exhibits S-9, S-10 and S-11.
(General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
New development must be protected from public safety risks and must not add to
existing hazards. Development shall be limited in hazard areas as indicated above.
                                                   S-23                 Adopted by City Council
                                                                                        1/25/93

SECTION 4: ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
Threats to public health and safety are posed by natural and man-made conditions.
Natural hazards result from characteristics of the environment. They are difficult to
control or eliminate and are best avoided in order to reduce their potential for damage.
Human action may magnify the potential impact of natural hazards, but the safety risk is
primarily dependent on environmental conditions, such as the presence of earthquake
faults, flood plains, and steep slopes. Man-made hazards stem from human activity.
They happen as a result of specific practices and actions of man which may create a
potential for fire, aircraft accidents, hazardous materials contamination, and crime. To
eliminate a man-made hazard, the complete suspension of particular activities may be
necessary; however, economic forces may require that the activity continue for the
community's continued viability.
In the Palmdale area, the major natural hazards are seismic activity, flood, geologic
conditions, and wildfire hazards. Aside from these, urban fires, aircraft accidents,
hazardous materials contamination, and crime hazards are present due to ongoing
human activities.
This section of the Safety Element discusses the natural and man-made hazards that
affect the Planning Area and the impacts that they could have on life in the City. It
focuses on seismic hazards, flood-related hazards, geologic hazards associated with
the slope stability and soils, fire hazards, the risk of aircraft accidents at the USAF Plant
42, hazardous materials, and crime. Some of these issues were identified early in the
planning process by City staff, residents, and members of the CAC. In addition, there
are statewide and regional safety issues which affect the City. All of these are
discussed below.
This section documents existing conditions in the Planning Area and provides the
background analysis that led to the recommended goals, policies, and implementation
measures contained in the previous sections. Additionally, more detailed information on
each issue may be found in the Master Environmental Assessment for the General
Plan.
A.      Seismic Hazards
A major earthquake in Southern California is expected to cause loss of life, injury, and
property damage at a scale unprecedented in this nation's history. While it is impossible
to prevent an earthquake from occurring, research is continuing to develop ways of
predicting earthquakes. Still, it will be many years before a program which accurately
and reliably predicts earthquakes can be implemented.
                                             S-24                   Adopted by City Council
                                                                                      1/25/93
Safety
The City of Palmdale and the Planning Area are located in a seismically active region.
The dominant seismic feature affecting the City is the San Andreas Fault which
traverses the southernmost portion of the Planning Area. The San Andreas Fault is the
boundary where the North American plate and the Pacific plate meet. Relative
movement of the plates along this boundary causes earthquakes. This fault is
considered one of the most dangerous in the state in terms of destructive potential. The
San Andreas Fault extends over 600 miles from the Salton Sea, northwest toward the
Pacific Ocean at Point Arena. Two of the three largest (8.0+ Richter) earthquakes in
the state have occurred along the San Andreas Fault: the 1906 San Francisco
earthquake which caused 21-foot offsets and the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake. Table
S-3 lists earthquake activity on the resulting Modified Mercalli intensity from the San
Andreas Fault. Intensity measures the amount of groundshaking caused by an
earthquake. An intensity value is assigned by the amount of damage to structures,
changes in the earth's surface, and personal accounts.
In addition, several fault traces branch off from the primary fault within the San Andreas
Rift Zone. The major fault traces for the San Andreas system in the Palmdale area are
the Cemetery Fault, the Nadeau Fault, and the Littlerock Fault. All three faults are
active splays of the San Andreas Fault. Thus, movement on the San Andreas Fault
may activate one or all of these subsidiary faults. The Nadeau, Cemetery and Littlerock
fault traces are located in Palmdale (see Exhibit S-3). Other splays of the San Andreas
Fault which are found in Palmdale are the Powerline Fault and the eastern end of the
Clearwater Fault.
In addition to the San Andreas Fault system, other principal faults that could produce
damaging earthquakes in the Palmdale area are the Sierra Madre-San Fernando,
Garlock, Owens Valley, and White Wolf faults. Their maximum probable magnitudes
are listed in Table S-4. A maximum probable earthquake is the largest event expected
to occur within 100 years. The Sierra Madre Fault is located at the base of the San
Gabriel Mountains approximately 20 miles south of the Planning Area. The Garlock and
White Wolf faults are northeast-trending faults located 30 to 60 miles, respectively,
northwest of the Planning Area. The Owens Valley fault is 60 miles to the northeast and
runs north-south. A number of other faults located in the Southern California region
could be responsible for earthquakes that would affect the City; although no major
damage is expected to occur. Exhibit S-4 indicates the relative location of the major
faults near Palmdale and Exhibit S-5 shows earthquake faults in the Southern California
region. Section 3.1 of the Master Environmental Assessment for the General Plan
includes a detailed description of seismic characteristics in the region.

Safety
The amount of groundshaking at a site is often expressed in terms of the peak
acceleration relative to acceleration due to gravity. Ground acceleration is the rate of
increase of velocity of the ground, where each incremental change in rate can be
related to increasing force acting on a structure. Thus, the greater the acceleration, the
greater the force acting on a building site. Expected seismic shaking zones for an
earthquake with a magnitude of 8.0 or more are also delineated. Zone 1 are areas most
likely to experience severe accelerations greater than 0.5 gravity; Zone 2, where
acceleration will be from 0.5 to 0.4 gravity; and Zone 3, where acceleration will be 0.28
to 0.4 gravity.       Estimated Modified Mercalli intensities from a locally-occurring
earthquake will be VII to IX. A VII Mercalli intensity will cause slight to moderate
damage to well-built ordinary structures, it will be difficult to stand, and water may
become turbid with mud; while a IX Mercalli intensity will cause the partial collapse of
most structures, general panic will ensue, serious damage to reservoirs and
underground pipes will occur, and there will be visible cracks on the ground.
Aside from groundshaking and ground surface rupture, earthquake hazards include the
fissuring or cracking of bedrock, landslides, liquefaction, and ground settlement.
Structures most likely to be affected by earthquakes are those that are old or near
earthquake faults in areas that may be prone to liquifaction. Dams along earthquake
faults may be subject to failure and may cause flooding of the surrounding area. Critical
damage may also occur to structures that provide emergency services (hospitals, fire
stations, schools, emergency shelters). Roads and utility lines for water, gas, power,
telephone, sewer, and storm drainage may be disjointed and services cut off. These
structures require special attention in the public safety programs of the City.
In case of a major earthquake on the San Andreas Fault within or near the Planning
Area, damage to the following structures is expected:
1.      Palmdale and Littlerock reservoirs could sustain surface rupture and cause area
        flooding. Exhibit S-6 delineates possible inundation areas for both reservoirs.
2.      Rail lines crossing the fault may be displaced from Palmdale to Interstate 5.
3.      The California Aqueduct may rupture causing flooding of the surrounding area
        and loss of water supply to the region (Exhibit S-7).
4.      Telephone lines, sewer pipes, and water lines may be truncated.

The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act, formerly known as the Alquist-Priolo
Special Studies Zones Act, was signed into law on December 22, 1972 and went into
effect on March 7, 1973. Under this act, the State Geologist is required to delineate
"special studies zones" along known active faults (active faults include those where an
earthquake has occurred in Holocene time - from the present time back to 11,000
years). The purpose of this Act is to prohibit the construction of new buildings across
the trace of active faults. Cities and counties affected by the provisions of this act must
regulate development within the seismic hazard zones through zoning controls, geologic
studies, or other measures (Hart 1988). The Alquist-Priolo Act and the seismic hazard
mapping program delineated by the State Geologist address surface rupture hazards,
liquefaction and earthquake-induced landslides and strong groundshaking caused by
earthquakes. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)

Safety
The San Andreas Fault zone is among those active faults identified in the legislation
where special land use planning considerations are required to minimize the loss of life,
injury, and property damage due to surface rupture in the event of a major earthquake.
The zone includes areas located within one-eighth mile of an active fault. Policies and
criteria for dealing with seismic hazards were established to assist cities and counties,
although the act does not preclude local governments from adopting more stringent
requirements. The City of Palmdale implements the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault
Zoning Act by means of the development review process, in which every proposed
development within the seismic hazard zone is required to prepare a detailed
geotechnical report and fault rupture survey. These studies are then reviewed by the
City Geologist and special conditions (i.e., structural setbacks and/or special engineered
foundations) are placed on projects as deemed necessary by the City Geologist. (General
Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
Earthquakes affect areas several miles away from the epicenter and continue to elude
prediction. The only presently known measures to minimize the hazards involve
structural reinforcement, physical separation, and emergency preparedness to deal with
the aftermath of the disaster. The City of Palmdale will utilize every available measure
to protect public safety and minimize property damage from seismic hazard through the
policies and implementations programs contained in this Element.
B.      Geologic Hazards
The area's geology determines its capacity for supporting man-made structures. In
Palmdale, consolidated rocks make up the mountains and rocky buttes while alluvial
soils are found on stream beds and the valley floor. Pelona schist underlies most of the
mountainous portions of the Planning Area. Beneath the alluvial soils are the same
hard rocks as found in the mountain areas. Geologic hazards are present in the form of
unstable soils and certain ground formations which render some areas unsuitable for
intensive human activity.
Hillside Areas
The Planning Area features steep slopes on its southern and western edges. These
areas include unstable slopes, and areas subject to erosion. Areas with slopes less
than 10 percent are generally considered suitable for all types of development. Those
with a 10 to 25 percent slope are typically required to use hillside construction
techniques to achieve substantial foundation support and stable soil conditions. Areas
with slopes greater than 25 percent are subject to instability and erosion and are
generally not recommended for development. Exhibit S-9 shows the slope categories
within the Planning Area. Increasing urbanization on the hillsides could expose the
Adopted by City Council                              S-29
1/25/93
                                                                                    Safety
community to possible landslides and rockslides which may result in human injury and
property damage.
Extensive grading will be required to create a developable surface on hillside areas.
However, grading is also a form of land disturbance which may promote land failure. To
ensure public safety on hillside developments, the Hillside Management Ordinance was
adopted to address the issues listed in Section 3 of this Element.
Soils Within Fault Rupture Areas
Lands adjacent to fault zones are exposed to geologic hazards as a result of repeated
fault movement. Earthquakes give rise to broken subsurface rocks, ground surface
fracture, and clay gouge. Broken subsurface rocks may not be readily apparent but the
ground would no longer have its original cohesive and shear strength to carry building
loads. Surface cracks and dips increase the potential for erosion and landslides. Clay
gouge occurs as a result of faulting and may cause differential ground settlement.
Repeated ground movement from earthquake and grading will cause more settlement in
areas with granular soils than in other places. Liquefaction potential is determined
based upon soil type and distance to groundwater.
Expansive Soils
A soil's potential to expand when wet and shrink when dry depends on the type and
amount of clay in the soil. Soils with certain types of clay tend to swell or expand when
its water content is increased. They also shrink disproportionately when dry. Highly
expansive soils can cause structural damage to foundations and roads. Landscape
irrigation could concentrate subsurface water and subsequent soil expansion could
cause land slippage and structural damage. Soils with low shrink/swell potentials are
suitable for building, with other factors considered. A high shrink/swell potential makes
the site less suitable. Detailed investigations may be necessary for areas with
moderate to high expansion potentials. Development on expansive soils requires
special grading and construction techniques which increases development costs.
Exhibit S-10 shows the expansion potential of soils in the Planning Area.
Soil Erosion/Sedimentation
The propensity for soil erosion by wind or water runoff is dependent on soil type and its
consolidation, vegetative cover, slope, and runoff velocity. Erosive soils are noted in
Exhibit S-11 and are often found in steep slopes where runoff velocity is also greatest
and vegetative cover least. Eroded materials end up on the valley floor with coarse
materials near the hillsides and finer ones in areas farther from the slopes. Erosion can

Safety
usually be controlled with slope planting, the control of drainage flows, terracing, and
retaining walls.
Soil Infiltration Capacity
The water percolation quality of soil or its permeability depends on grain size, the
amount of compaction, and soil depth, among other things. Coarse-grained soils such
as sand and gravel are more permeable than silt or clay. The ability of soil to percolate
water determines which areas are best for groundwater recharge, where septic tanks
are appropriate, and what proportion of storm water will be absorbed by the ground.
Exhibit S-12 characterizes the infiltration capacity of soils in the Planning Area. Soils
with very slow infiltration when thoroughly wetted have high runoff potential. They are
usually highly expansive clay soils, soils with high water tables, and soils with clay
layers or impervious material near the surface. Soils with slow infiltration when
thoroughly wetted are fine-textured and have a layer that impedes the downward flow of
water. High runoff and slow water transmission is associated with these soils.
Moderate infiltration means a moderate runoff potential, with medium-textured and well
drained soils. High infiltration characterizes deep, excessively drained soils with low
runoff potentials. They consist mainly of sand and gravel materials. Sites with very
poor percolation may be difficult and expensive to develop due to sewer and storm
drainage requirements. Normally, each development is required to detain project
related storm run-off on site. In areas of soils with very poor infiltration capacity, storm
water must be conveyed via storm drain to an acceptable off-site detention site;
sometimes a considerable distance away.
Septic Tank Limitations
Exhibit S-13 shows areas with septic tank limitations. Soils with a permeability of more
than 1 inch per hour, excessive or good drainage, no flood hazard, and a permanent
water table more than 6 feet deep are considered to have slight limitations for the use of
septic tanks. Moderate limitation is characterized by soils of a permeability of 1.0 to
0.63 inch per hour or less, somewhat poor drainage, flooding length is less than 48
hours and the permanent water table is from 4 to 6 feet. Severe limitations for septic
tanks are due to a permeability of 0.63 inch per hour or less, very poor drainage, a
chance of flooding 1 year in 5, and a water table less than 4 feet. Sewer systems are
needed in these areas to reduce the hazards to residents and the environment. Drywell
disposal of nuisance water may be ineffective in these areas and alternative disposal
methods need to be provided. The City's current policy is to require connection to a
public sewer for all new single family development on lots of less than one acre, all
multi-family development and all commercial or industrial projects. Where septic
systems are permitted, they are governed by regulation of the State Water Quality
Control Board, Lahanton Region.

                                                                                     Safety
Subsidence
Ground subsidence is caused by decreasing subsurface pressure and can be traced to
the pumping of groundwater, natural gas, or oil. The substantial loss of ground fluid
creates a vacuum that gradually causes the sinking of the ground. Subsidence may
adversely impact development, as well as cause damage to underground utility lines.
Rates of subsidence are plotted in Exhibit S-14. Although the southwestern portions of
the City are not classified, this does not mean that no subsidence has occurred, only
that no survey has precisely measured subsidence in the area.
Hydrocompaction
Collapsible (hydrocompactive) soils are low density, fine-grained, granular soils
containing minute pores and voids. They possess some cementation in dry condition
but when saturated, these soils undergo a rearrangement of the grains and a loss of
cementation. This rearrangement results in the collapse of the soil structure at depth
and differential settlement at the surface, even with relatively low loads. Collapsible
soils are extremely sensitive to increased moisture due to a rise in the water table or
over irrigation.
Collapsible soils result from deposition where materials have not had enough contact
with moisture to form a compact soil. These soils are abundant in arid environments on
recently deposited Holocene alluvium and older unconsolidated sediments. Two
principal depositional regimes that result in collapsible soils are eolian sands and silt
and mudflow sediments. The arid environment with Quaternary deposits that are
susceptible to collapsible soils are found in the Planning Area.
Only isolated investigations have occurred in the Antelope Valley that do not make it
feasible to map out areas where collapsible soils may present hazards to development.
Water channels and alluvium fans are especially susceptible to collapsible soils. All
desert soil may be considered collapsible in the first few feet because the alluvium is so
dry that it causes settlement when wetted. Soils investigations should be performed
prior to any construction activity to determine the presence of collapsible soils. Areas
with collapsible soils should not be developed unless the hazard is remedied through
acceptable engineering practices for achieving soil stability.
Complete elimination of geologic hazards is not possible due to the expense and the
potential damage to the environment from massive alteration of the terrain. Danger can
be avoided by regulating or restricting construction in areas with soil stability problems.
It can also be reduced to some extent by grading and other engineering methods which
remedy soil instability and provide a stable foundation for building construction.

                                                                                    1/25/93
Safety
Differences in soil stability can be handled by engineering methods to offset any
potential damage to the foundation which would reduce structural strength of buildings.
C.     Flood Hazards
Rainfall in the Antelope Valley is relatively sparse due to its location on the leeward side
of the Sierra Pelona and San Gabriel Mountains. Only a small section on the southwest
of the Planning Area features south-facing slopes of the Sierra Pelona Mountains. The
average annual rainfall is 5.15 inches in Palmdale and approximately 20 inches in the
mountains. However, throughout most of the year, very little surface runoff from the
upper watersheds ever reaches the City.
Sheetwash occurs along major drainages and adjoining areas on scattered sites. Areas
with flood hazards are the natural drainage channels of Amargosa Creek, Anaverde
Creek, Little Rock Wash, and Big Rock Wash (see Exhibit S-15). Flat plains and natural
depressions are also subject to possible flooding.
Urban development reduces the total ground absorption area by creating impermeable
surfaces (structures, pavement, streets). Storm runoff, increased by the presence of
impermeable surfaces, flows from developed areas, contributing to street flooding.
Moreover, developed areas generate irrigation water runoff from landscaping which may
channel nuisance water flow into nearby undeveloped areas and street gutters.
The amount and frequency of rain is variable, and although flood waters may be
diverted, the lack of a completed regional drainage system will continue to result in local
flooding problems. The City has an adopted Drainage Master Plan. It will take
approximately 20 years to complete construction of the entire system. The plan
addresses storm water runoff from higher slopes and existing and future developments.
The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works has completed and adopted the
Antelope Valley Comprehensive Plan of Flood Control and Water Conservation (June
1987), which is currently being implemented in the unincorporated portions of the
Antelope Valley. The storm drainage section of the Public Services Element discusses
flood hazards in more detail. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
Earthquake faults create vertical barriers to groundwater which may result in shallow
groundwater conditions. They may also limit the amount of water which can percolate
into the subsurface, thus increasing the amount, velocity, and erosive capacity of
stormwater runoff on hillsides.
Surface rupture and groundshaking from earthquakes may result in rupture of the
Palmdale and Littlerock Dams, causing flooding as shown in Exhibit S-6. Flood waters
could be as deep as 50 feet immediately downstream of the Littlerock Dam. Failure of

1/25/93
                                                                                   Safety
the Littlerock Dam would result in the inundation of a 300-foot wide area for 0.25 mile
north of the dam. Along this length, the water depth would vary from 50 to 15 feet. Ten
minutes after failure, the flood water would veer eastward for 800 feet to Avenue U
where the depth would be reduced to 10 feet. Trending north from Avenue U, the water
would eventually dissipate so that the depth is no longer a risk to downstream
developments.
In addition to dam failure and subsequent flooding, a seismic event could cause a water
wave, or seiche to occur at Lake Palmdale, which could potentially overtop the dam.
The design report for the dam considers a reflection of the wave on return unlikely.
Also, wave volume above the dam would not be substantial (approximately 1 acre-foot),
and would not result in damaging floods. Overpour on the downstream side of the dam
will not cause any damage by erosion as the existing rockfill was designed to withstand
it. The Sheriff's Department has been assigned with the coordination of notification
efforts and local evacuation in the event of dam failure.
In the event of a large magnitude local earthquake on the San Andreas Fault, some
portions of the California Aqueduct are likely to fail. The east branch of the aqueduct is
highly vulnerable to widespread damage from groundshaking hazards because it closely
parallels the San Andreas Fault for over 100 kilometers. Moreover, the east branch
crosses the fault at several locations near Palmdale (Leona Siphon and Barrel Springs)
which are susceptible to surface rupture hazards. The Department of Water Resources
(DWR) has installed flood control gates to mitigate any structural failure. By closing the
gates upstream, the section of the Aqueduct in the Planning Area will be isolated and
will not receive water. Aqueduct water present during failure will be diverted to pools
which serve as detention basins. The eight pools within the Planning Area have varying
storage capacities and locations as indicated by Table S-5.
Exhibit S-7 depicts the direction of flow from the pools and the locations where the
Aqueduct crosses the fault at Leona Siphon and Barrel Springs. The extent and rate of
inundation is speculative since the amount of water in the Aqueduct varies between
seasons and years. Various factors which affect the size and extent of flooding include
structural failure of the Aqueduct and pools while the Aqueduct is operating at full
capacity, adjacent pools outside the Planning Area draining, and emergency power
failure which could result in the Aqueduct gates not closing fast enough.
D.      Fire Hazards
Wild Fires
Wildfires occur on mountains, hillsides, and grasslands. The speed and extent of their
spread depends on the area's vegetation, climate, and slope. In the Planning Area,
                                           S-34                 Adopted by City Council

Safety
native vegetation types such as chaparral and grassland provide the fuel that allows fire
to spread easily across large tracts of land. These plant species are capable of
regeneration after a fire, making periodic wildfires a natural part of the ecology of these
areas. The hot, dry climate of the Antelope Valley keeps the grass dry and readily
combustible. The Santa Ana winds can spread fires into adjacent areas. Steep slopes
bring grass and brush within reach of upward flames while impeding the access of
firefighting equipment. Within Palmdale, wildfire hazards areas exist within the southern
and western portions of the Planning Area. Exhibit S-16 shows wildfire hazard areas.

The fire season in the Palmdale Planning Area occurs roughly from September to
November when the Santa Ana winds blow. If rains are minimal, grass may dry as early
as May and brush as early as July. From December to April, in the rainy season,
wildfires rarely occur.
Wildfires may be started by various methods including: carelessly used matches,
cigarettes discarded in the brush, the lack of spark arrestors in offroad vehicles, target

shooting ricochets and arson. In turn, firefighters are hampered by motorists who do
not yield to fire vehicles or who do not know how to provide clear passage in
emergencies, as well as the steep terrain in areas where wildfires typically occur.
The fire protection services section of the Public Services Element discusses fire
services in the Planning Area. Also, the valley has three fire suppression camps where
jail inmates work as labor crews during major brush fires.
Urban Fires
Urban fires pose a public safety threat within developed environments, destroying
buildings and other man-made structures. These disasters are often due to faulty wiring
or mechanical equipment, combustible construction materials, and the absence of fire
alarms and sprinkler systems. Human accidents with appliances and equipment, and
the careless use of cigarettes and matches also cause urban fires. Older buildings are
considered more likely to have fires since they often do not comply with present
standards for fire safety construction. To minimize fire damage and loss, the Fire
Department sets standards for building design and construction requiring the provision
of adequate water supply for firefighting, fire retardant construction, and minimum street
clearances, among other things. Fire prevention awareness programs are conducted to
train residents to respond quickly and correctly in order to reduce injury and losses
during fires.
In the Planning Area, fires have been largely caused due to human accidents. Fire
hazards are continuously present in the form of older buildings in the City center,
although high density development pockets do not exist to compound the danger.
Industrial areas, gas transmission and distribution lines, and higher voltage power lines
represent potential sources of fire. The USAF Plant 42 is particularly susceptible to fire
due to the nature of the industry. It has its own fire department to deal with fire hazards
at the plant. Exhibit S-16 shows the location of fire hazards in Palmdale. (General Plan
Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
In order to minimize hazards associated with both wildfire and urban fires, the City
and/or the Los Angeles County Fire Department will require fire protection plans,
greenbelts, special access roads, fuel modification zones and non-combustible
construction techniques as necessary on a case-by-case basis. The fire protection
services section of the Public Services Element describes current fire services in
Palmdale.

Safety
E.       Aircraft Accident Potential
Seventy-five percent of reported aircraft accidents have occurred on or near airport
runways. These accidents may cause injury, death, fire, explosion, damage to property,
straining hospital facilities, disrupting traffic and utilities, and causing crowd control
problems.
The presence of USAF Plant 42 in the Planning Area carries with it the potential for
aircraft accidents within Air Force property and in surrounding areas. This potential will
be compounded by the operation of the proposed Palmdale Regional Airport, east of the
USAF Plant. The number of flights at the USAF Plant 42 fluctuate widely with an
average of 250 to 300 landings per day. Almost 30 percent of these are test flights and
70 percent are training flights. Thirteen accidents have occurred at the plant since
1954, when flight records began. Five of the accidents involved civilian aircraft, four of
which were mid-air collisions. The other was a result of mechanical failure. The
remaining eight accidents occurred during takeoff and landing of military aircraft. Five
occurred onsite, three others within a 2-mile radius of the plant.
The USAF minimizes disaster potential by following strict safety precautions and by
having its own emergency personnel for crash and rescue operations. Development
proposals around the plant are subject to review by the USAF to ensure compatibility
with plant operations. In 1991, the City of Palmdale, City of Lancaster and the U.S. Air
Force formed Joint Land Use Committee (JLUC) to discuss airport land use
compatibility issues. The JLUC produced a number of policies affecting land use
decisions for projects in the general vicinity of Plant 42. These policies are included
within the Noise Element of the General Plan. In 2002, the Air Force updated its Air
Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study. In addition to identifying aircraft clear
zones and accident potential zones, the study identifies noise contours ranging from
DNL 60 dB to DNL 80 dB (Day-Night Average A-Weighted Sound Level) based on the
average busy day aircraft operations data collected in 2001. The noise levels depicted
in the 2002 AICUZ study differ somewhat in both shape and extent from the noise
contours in the 1990 AICUZ study, with current levels less than 1990 levels. The
reduction in noise levels is due to a different mix of aircraft at the airfield and the testing
of more modern aircraft with quieter engines. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City
Council April 14, 2004.)
The increasing pressure for development in the Palmdale area will find more people
living around the USAF plant in the future than at present. The JLUC policies were
designed to ensure that the community would be protected from risk of aircraft accident.
(General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
Exhibit S-17 delineates aircraft crash zones for the USAF Plant 42 and the proposed
regional airport. The potential for accidents is highest at the end of the runway (30

percent) and decreases with distance from the end of the runway. The Clear Zone is a
3,000-foot by 3,000-foot area at the end of the runway, within which any development
would pose a major risk of life and property. The USAF Plant 42 owns this land and
prohibits any form of development. Accident Potential Zone (APZ) I is 3,000 feet wide
and 5,000 feet long and contains a significant risk (8 percent) and APZ II is 3,000 feet
wide and 7,000 feet long with measurable potential (5 percent) for accidents.
F.     Hazardous Materials/Wastes
Trace metals and chemical compounds used in industry have caused toxic pollution of
the environment and harmful effects on man. The concern for the production, storage,
transport, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes arises in the wake of widely
publicized health and safety problems due to improper handling.
In response to public concerns, the State has adopted legislation requiring local
government agencies to prepare plans to address the handling and disposal of
hazardous materials and wastes within local jurisdictions. The City has adopted a
hazardous waste management plan and will continue to comply with and support efforts
to enforce these regulations. (General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
AB 2185 and 2187 (Waters, 1985 and 1986) were intended to protect public health,
safety, and the environment by establishing business and area plans relating to the
handling, and release or threatened release of hazardous materials/wastes. The area
plan for Los Angeles County has been developed and is implemented by the Los
Angeles County Fire Department. The area plan covers all of Los Angeles County and
includes an inventory of hazardous materials/wastes facilities in the County, procedures
for emergency notification response, pre-emergency planning measures, and public
safety information. Facilities with more than a specified amount of hazardous
materials/wastes onsite, must submit a business plan to the Los Angeles County Fire
Department. The information in the above plans is available for public review.
No hazardous waste landfills are currently located in the Planning Area. The Antelope
Valley Landfill (Palmdale Disposal) is a non-hazardous Class II landfill. Groundwater
and surface waters are protected from contamination by wastes deposited at the landfill
through required waste management practices in place at the landfill.
The U.S. EPA Superfund program is responsible for identifying potential hazardous
waste sites and appropriate cleanup funds. The USAF Plant 42 is listed on the EPA's
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Information
System (CERCLIS) database as a potential contamination site. The California
Department of Heath Services (DHS) has also identified USAF Plant 42 as a hazardous
waste site targeted for clean up. Twenty eight contaminated areas have been identified.
                                             S-38                    Adopted by City Council
                                                                                               1/25/93
Safety
Information available to date indicates that no hazardous waste exposure to public
health or the environment exists at this time. The DHS will oversee subsequent
investigation and clean-up actions and the Department of Defense will provide
necessary funding. Completion of remedial actions is targeted by the State for 2006.
(General Plan Amendment 04-01, adopted by City Council April 14, 2004.)
Several State agencies monitor hazardous materials/waste facilities. Potential and
known contamination sites are monitored and documented by the DHS and the
Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB). A review of the leaking underground
storage tank list produced by the RWQCB, and the Hazardous Waste and Substances
Sites List produced by the Office of Planning and Research, indicates that four
hazardous waste sites are located in Palmdale or in the surrounding communities (see
Table S-6).
If an imminent public health threat is posed by USAF Plant 42 or the sites listed in Table
S-6, the City will support local regulating agencies in notifying the public.

Hazardous Sites
Transport of hazardous materials/wastes and explosives through the Planning Area is
regulated by the California Department of Transportation (DOT). The Antelope Valley
Freeway and Highway 138 are State routes and are open to vehicles carrying

1/25/93
                                                                                     Safety
hazardous materials/wastes. City streets and unincorporated County areas are
generally not designated as hazardous materials/wastes transportation routes, but a
permit may be granted on a case-by-case basis. Transporters of hazardous wastes are
required to be certified by the DOT and manifests are required to track the hazardous
waste during transport. Although no spills have been reported, the danger of hazardous
materials/waste spills during transport exists and will potentially increase as industrial
development in the Planning Area increases. At present, the Los Angeles County Fire
Department is responsible for hazardous materials accidents at all locations within the
City, except at USAF Plant 42, where the Air Force Fire Department is the responsible
agency.
Development of industrial land in the Planning Area could increase risks associated with
hazardous materials/wastes use. Programs for proper storage, handling, and disposal
need to be developed according to State, Federal, and local guidelines to reduce those
risks. The City will support, assist in, and undertake such programs to the extent
provided by law.
G.      Crime
Crime and other acts of violence undermine the community's sense of security and
threaten public safety. As Palmdale develops, the increasing concentration of
population will bring increasing criminal activities, even if the crime rate (number of
crimes per 1,000 population) remains constant. While it is expected that individuals will
take normal precautions to protect themselves from danger, the City provides additional
protection from harm brought on by the malicious intent of others by contracting with the
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for law enforcement and crime deterrence
within the City boundaries. Additionally, as part of the development review process, all
new projects will be reviewed for ease of patrol, accessibility and visibility in order to
assist law enforcement efforts. For certain projects, the City may require provision of
on-site security services. The police protection services section of the Public Services
Element contains additional discussion of crime and police protection in the Planning
Area.
H.      Constraints
The constraints to protection of public safety are directly related to the causes of natural
and man-made hazards. Natural hazards include wildfires and geologic hazards which
have known causes, but precautionary measures are not always observed. Other
natural hazards, flooding and earthquakes, are less predictable and can only be
avoided to the extent they can be predicted. Man-made hazards resulting from human
activity include aircraft crash potential, crime, hazardous material/wastes use, and
urban fires.
                                           S-40                   Adopted by City Council
                                                                                    1/25/93
Safety
The following constraints limit the ability of the City to plan for and protect its residents
from the effects of these hazards:
1.     Unpredictability of the Event: The unpredictability of natural disasters is often
       rooted in the limited understanding of nature and its ways. Earthquakes continue
       to elude prediction because of an incomplete knowledge of natural forces and
       their interrelationship. If an effective safety strategy is to be developed, the
       causes of disasters and value of losses should be known. This is difficult to
       ascertain for natural hazards. Considerable research is still needed to determine
       why, when, and where disasters will occur. This knowledge is critical in planning
       effective public safety programs but is unavailable.
2.     Land Development Patterns Which Impede Timely Response: As Palmdale
       develops, land prices increase and land use patterns are established, making it
       difficult to correct for safety hazards.         High density development areas
       necessitate additional safety precautions for fire protection and emergency
       access. Evacuation coordination and control is more difficult, and losses of life
       and property are likely to be greater in densely developed areas. It is important
       to reserve access routes and sites for emergency facilities as development
       occurs.
3.     Limited Resources Available for Protection: Public safety may be described as
       the preservation of human life and the protection of property. While the
       quantification of property damage is made in dollar amounts, the value of life and
       social disruption is harder to evaluate. The priority ranking of safety programs is
       even more difficult because of limited funds and the subjective value of safety.
       Still, monetary calculations seem to be the best available method of judging
       public safety. Government intervention is often based on total potential damage
       in dollars of a disaster versus the potential cost of providing preventive safety
       measures up front. As part of its safety planning, the City must decide how much
       risk it is willing to accept, and design safety measures, emergency services, and
       land use patterns accordingly.
4.     Human Carelessness: The imperfection of humans will continue to create and
       cause hazards in the Planning Area. Carelessness in construction or in the
       evaluation of hazards will mean less than adequate structures to withstand
       disaster.       Carelessness can lead to fires and accidents (plane crashes,
       hazardous material spills, and misuse), or may unnecessarily expose individuals
       to harm.
Adopted by City Council                      S-41
1/25/93
                                                                               Safety
5. Lack Of Individual Precaution: If citizens do not take the necessary precaution
   and preparation to protect themselves from disaster and harm, no amount of City
   effort or regulation will reduce the potential for harm. Public awareness and
   preparation programs will show the people the best ways to avoid disaster, to
   protect themselves, and to prepare for a disaster.
6. Economic Necessity for Certain Activities: The elimination of hazards caused by
   human activities is directly dependent on the suspension of that activity or set of
   activities. This is often impossible because of higher goals and needs that
   override the danger posed by such activities. Aircraft flight at the USAF Plant 42
   or the use of hazardous materials in industry, are two examples of hazards that
   are potentially avoidable but are considered necessary for the economic viability
   of the community.

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
Noise has become a key factor in our perception of the quality of our environment.
Noise affects both the home and work environment, and the enjoyment of recreational
activity. For these reasons, noise is an important issue in the community planning
process.
The State of California has mandated that each county and city prepare a noise element
as part of its general plan. California Government Code, Division 1, Planning and
Zoning, Chapter 3, Local Planning, Article 5, Section 65302(f) requires a plan including:
"A noise element which shall identify and appraise noise problems in the community.
The noise element shall recognize the guidelines established by the Office of Noise
Control in the State Department of Health Service and shall analyze and quantify, to the
extent practicable, current and projected noise levels for all of the following sources:
1.      Highways and freeways.
2.      Primary arterials and major local streets.
3.      Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid transit
        systems.
4.      Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, and military airport operations,
        aircraft overflights, jet engine test stands, and all other ground facilities and
        maintenance functions related to airport operation.
5.      Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classification yards.
6.      Other ground stationary noise sources identified by local agencies as contributing
        to the community noise environment.
The noise contours shall be used as a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses in
the Land Use Element that minimizes the exposure of community residents to excessive
noise. The Noise Element shall include implementation measures of possible solutions
that address existing and foreseeable noise problems, if any. The adopted Noise
Element shall serve as a guideline for compliance with the state's Noise Insulation
Standards."
The purpose of this document is to comply with the state mandate, to provide an easily
understood discussion of noise and its impacts, and to set guidelines to prevent noise
and land use conflicts. A further discussion of the means by which this mandate is to be

SECTION 2: GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND POLICIES
GOAL N1: Minimize the exposure of residents to excessive noise to the extent
possible, through the land planning and the development review process.
Objective N1.1: Utilize appropriate land use planning as the primary method of
achieving noise compatibility among adjacent land uses.
       Policy N1.1.1: Locate noise compatible land uses near existing and future air,
       rail and highway transportation noise sources.
       Policy N1.1.2: Restrict noise sensitive land uses near existing or future air, rail
       or highway transportation noise sources unless mitigation measures have been
       incorporated into the design of the project to reduce the noise levels at the noise
       sensitive land use to less than 65 dBA CNEL at all exterior living spaces
       including but not limited to, single-family yards and multi-family patios, balconies,
       pool areas, cook-out areas and related private recreation areas.
       Policy N1.1.3: When proposed stationary noise sources could exceed an
       exterior noise level of 65 dBA CNEL at present, or could impact future noise
       sensitive land uses, require preparation of an acoustical analysis and mitigation
       measures to reduce noise levels to no more than 65 dBA CNEL exterior and 45
       dBA CNEL interior; if the noise level cannot be reduced to these thresholds
       through mitigation, the new noise source should not be permitted.
       Policy N1.1.4: Consider the noise environment when making land use decisions
       with respect to the guidelines contained in Table N-1, and require noise
       standards consistent with the criteria listed on Table N-3.               The State
       Recommended Acceptable Noise Guidelines, listed in Table N-1, are provided as
       guidelines only, and are not represented as standards.
Objective N1.2:       Protect and maintain those areas having acceptable noise
environments.
       Policy N1.2.1: Locate new major noise sources in areas containing existing
       noise sources, and avoid their location adjacent to noise sensitive land uses
       unless a finding can be made, based on evidence in the record, that the
       placement of the new noise source will not result in adverse impacts to the
       existing noise sensitive land use.

      Policy N1.2.2: Restrict construction hours during the evening, early morning and
      Sundays.
      Policy N1.2.3: Utilize any or all of the following measures in order to maintain
      acceptable noise environments throughout the City:
      1.      Control of noise at its source, including noise barriers and other muffling
              devices built into the noise source.
      2.      The provision of buffer areas and/or wide setbacks between the noise
              source and other development.
      3.      The reduction of densities, where practical, adjacent to the noise source
              (freeway, airport, railroad).
      4.      The use of sound insulation, blank walls, double paned windows and other
              design or architectural techniques to reduce interior noise levels.
      5.      Designation of appropriate land uses adjacent to known noise sources.
      Policy N1.2.4: Where deemed appropriate based upon available information,
      acoustical analysis and appropriate mitigation for noise-sensitive land uses
      should be required in areas which may be adversely impacted by significant
      intermittent noise sources. Such noise sources may include but not be limited to
      railroads, racetracks, stadiums, aircraft overflights and similar uses.

SECTION 3: IMPLEMENTATION
Noise control programs involve federal, state, county and city agencies. Table N-2
highlights noise control responsibilities by agency. Other agencies are also involved with
noise control; however, those identified in Table N-2 cover the major noise issues found
in the City. Through these programs, the City will limit and regulate intrusive noises that
accompany development and population growth.
A.      Land Use Compatibility
Introduction
The City of Palmdale can achieve a noise compatible environment through
comprehensive land use planning. Proposed developments are evaluated in terms of
the projected impact from future noise sources and the application of the City's
objectives and policies. The City's noise compatibility criteria by land use are
summarized in Table N-4 and are consistent with both federal and state standards and
guidelines. Proposed residential and other noise-sensitive projects impacted by a 65
dBA CNEL or greater would require additional acoustical analysis to achieve acceptable
exterior noise levels. Acceptable interior noise levels of 45 dBA CNEL or less must also
be achieved.
Noise-Sensitive Land Uses Defined
"Noise-sensitive land uses" include residential (single and multi-family dwellings, mobile
home parks, dormitories, and similar uses); transient lodging (including hotels, motels,
and similar uses); hospitals, nursing homes, convalescent hospitals, and other facilities
for long-term medical care; public or private educational facilities, libraries, churches,
and places of public assembly. Each of these land uses is particularly susceptible to
noise intrusions because of the nature of the use being made of the land, the
expectation of the occupants regarding an appropriate noise environment, and because
of the fact that, in most cases, these uses involve long-term exposure to the noise
environment affecting the property. In other words, residential uses (both single-family
and multi-family) involve situations where the residents have an expectation that their
daily lives will not be exposed to excessive noise levels which interfere with normal
residential activities, such as family conversations, entertaining, telephone use,
watching television, and the ability to sleep uninterrupted by outside noise sources.
Residential uses also are affected by long-term exposure to a localized noise
environment, which can cause a cumulative level of "annoyance" among the residents
because their continued exposure to the noise source(s) interferes with their normal
expectations regarding an appropriate residential environment. These considerations
                                             N-7                Adopted by City Council
                                                                                   1/25/93
Noise
also apply to such uses as nursing homes, convalescent hospitals or other long-term
medical care facilities.
Similarly, schools (public and private) are typically categorized as "noise sensitive uses"
both because the students at a noise affected facility are exposed to continuing noise
environment and because the noise is particularly inconsistent with the expected activity
of the school - study and instructional conversation.
Some "noise sensitive uses" do not necessarily involve long-term exposure to a noise
environment but are sensitive uses nevertheless because of the intended use of the
facility and the expectation (or need) of the users for a quiet environment. Libraries and
churches, for example, do not involve long-term exposure, since they are typically used
only on a periodic basis by any given individual. Still, people using both libraries and
places of worship have a reasonable expectation that they will be able to engage in the
contemplative activities normally associated with these facilities free from excessive
interruptions by external noise sources.
Other Land Uses
Other land uses are not "noise sensitive," or are substantially less sensitive to noise
events than residential or other similar uses. This designation does not mean that some
protection against noise intrusions is unnecessary or inappropriate for these uses; but
these land uses differ from sensitive uses in many respects, and consequently in how
they are affected by noise impact. In large part, there are differences in public
expectations regarding the urban noise environment. For example, in commercial
settings where noise is a factor, the public is present only for limited periods of time, and
they have a choice as to whether to patronize any particular establishment. In industrial
settings, interior noise levels from industrial or manufacturing operations are often high
enough that exterior noise sources are not intrusive. Certain types of recreational uses
are also substantially less "noise sensitive" (e.g., golf courses) because of the relative
infrequency of use and the voluntary nature of public use of such facilities.

Noise
In certain cases, there are potential land uses which are directly supportive of the
activities of the facility which is the principal source of noise affecting the property. For
example, there are many potential industrial, commercial, service and direct aviation
support uses which could support not only the continued mission of Air Force Plant 42,
but which would support and enhance the further development of that facility as a
scheduled commercial air carrier facility. By directing these uses toward areas most
seriously affected by noise from Air Force Plant 42, the City can allow reasonable
economic use of property in the vicinity of the facility while simultaneously providing a
buffer against noise intrusions into more noise sensitive areas and land uses.
Encouraging development of these types of land uses in areas affected by significant
and continuing noise sources, such as major arterial roadways, Air Force Plant 42, and
rail yards, therefore offers the City significant planning opportunities and advantages.
For the City to achieve noise and land use compatibility, mitigation measures and/or
restrictions should be imposed on future noise sensitive developments proposed within
65 dBA CNEL contours from transportation sources. The 45 dBA CNEL or less interior
criteria for noise sensitive land uses must also be achieved. In addition, noise sensitive
developments, proposed near existing stationary noise sources generating noise levels
exceeding 65 dBA CNEL, should be discouraged.
These goals are also served by encouraging the development of compatible land uses
in areas subject to continuing noise exposure from stationary or transportation sources.
It is not the goal of the City to render the development of any private property
economically infeasible, but to ensure that land uses are located appropriately in terms
of noise sensitivity and the surrounding noise environment. Therefore, appropriate
levels of protection for normally compatible uses have been established in consideration
of the health and well-being of employees and the general public, as well as the need
for the City to promote development uses on noise-affected properties which support
the economic health and infrastructure of the entire community.
B.      Acoustical Analysis Reports
The City will require acoustical analysis reports for those projects located within existing
or future 60 dBA CNEL impact areas, areas subject to single-event noise episodes or as
deemed necessary by the City. All acoustical analysis reports shall consider existing
and future ambient and project related noise levels and shall be prepared by a qualified
acoustical engineer with experience in environmental noise assessment and noise
control design. Specifically, acoustical analysis reports shall include:

•   Existing ambient and roadway noise levels recorded by a calibrated noise monitor.
•   Roadway traffic noise level analysis models determining existing and future noise
    levels anticipated from proposed projects and related cumulative noise sources.
•   Noise contour maps.
•   Surrounding land uses with identification of sensitive noise receptors and noise
    sources.
•   Impacts of the project to the existing ambient noise environment.
•   Noise control measures where needed.
•   Cumulative impacts due to related projects.
•   Unavoidable adverse impacts to the project area.
•   Assessment of Impacts from Single-Event Noise Episodes.
Acoustical analysis reports shall evaluate the impacts of the existing noise levels on the
proposed project as well as the impact of the project on the existing noise environment.
The Planning Department will evaluate projects to ensure that noise sensitive land uses,
such as schools, hospitals, and residential developments, will not be located adjacent to
sources of noise, when exceeding acceptable levels.
Where appropriate, the City will require acoustical analysis reports to include acoustical
design for residential development adjacent to freeways or major arterials to achieve the
appropriate interior and exterior noise levels through sound insulation, or other means,
as indicated in Table N-3.

                   hour period (such as 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.). Typically, time period “h” is defined to match the
                   hours of operation of a given type of use.
The Planning Department may require developments which will generate large
congregations of people or maintain late nighttime hours to provide special mitigation
measures, as indicated by the acoustical analysis.
C.        Noise Ordinance
The City Municipal Code, Chapter 8.28 Building Construction Hours and Operation and
Noise Control contains provisions that restrict construction between the hours of 8:00
p.m. and 6:30 a.m. and regulates the impact of offensive noise from sources such as
loud parties. The City may elect to adopt a noise ordinance if deemed necessary in
order to reduce potential health hazards associated with other high noise levels. Any
such ordinance would establish noise impact thresholds for noise abatement and
attenuation and would be compatible with state and federal standards. Noise

                                                                                          Noise
ordinances are typically directed at controlling noise from stationary sources and its
intrusion onto adjacent properties. Enforcement of the noise ordinance would be an
effective tool in controlling non-transportation noise sources. Federal and state laws
regulate noise from transportation sources. (General Plan Amendment 04-04, adopted by City Council
July 26, 2004.)
The Department of Building and Safety, the Planning Department, and the Sheriff's
Department will work cooperatively to enforce the noise ordinance. The noise
ordinance may include policies addressing the following issues:
•    Land use compatibility.
•    Restriction of hours of operation for construction equipment, power mowers,
     garbage collection, street sweeping, truck deliveries, leaf blowers, and other noise
     activities within the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., unless the work is made in
     response to an emergency or special purpose.
•    Periodic investigation of noise sources throughout the City, with citations issued for
     offender, in addition to investigations conducted due to such complaints.
The Noise Ordinance shall set standards and penalties for violating the provisions
contained therein. Penalties may range from warnings and monetary penalties to
revocation of operating licenses for businesses.
D.        General Plan Elements
The City will review other General Plan Elements for policies and programs relating to
noise. Other General Plan Elements may provide important policy guidance to assist in
decisions to ensure noise and land use compatibility. While all of the elements of the
General Plan are related and interdependent to some degree, the Noise Element is
most closely related to the Land Use, Housing, Circulation, and Environmental
Resources Elements as shown in Exhibit N-1.
The objective of the Noise Element is to provide guidelines to achieve compatible land
uses. The Land Use and Noise Elements are, therefore, closely related. The Noise
Element, by identifying noise-sensitive land uses and establishing compatibility
guidelines for land use and noise, will influence the general distribution, location, and
intensity of future land use. Effective land use planning can alleviate noise problems.
                                              N-13               Adopted by City Council
                                                                                        1/25/93

Noise
Residential areas are one of the most noise-sensitive land uses. Therefore, the
Housing Element is directly affected by the Noise Element. Enforcement of land use
and noise compatibility guidelines can reduce noise impacts in residential locations. In
addition, effective noise insulation in housing construction can mitigate exterior to
interior noise intrusion.
The circulation system within a city is one of the major sources of noise. Therefore, the
existing and future circulation system identified in the Circulation Element will greatly
influence the noise environment. The circulation routes such as the freeway, highways,
truck routes and the railroad should be located to minimize noise impacts upon noise-
sensitive land use. The location and design of new transportation facilities and
mitigation of noise from existing and planned facilities should be assessed in order to
minimize noise impacts to the extent feasible.
Since noise can adversely affect the enjoyment of quiet outdoor activities, the Noise
Element is also closely related to the Environmental Resources Element. Conversely,
open space, or appropriate recreational uses, can be used as a noise buffer between
incompatible land uses.         Generally, the identification of development which is
compatible with the local noise environment, and which allows property owners to
realize beneficial use of their properties, is a preferred solution in the development of
noise buffers between noise sources and land uses which are incompatible with the
noise source. These techniques can reduce community noise impacts and also provide
usable open space for recreation, or otherwise provide useful economic infrastructure
and development without the need to acquire the property from the private land owner.
E.      Joint Land Use Committee Policy Review
The City will review all new development applications for conformance with the Joint
Land Use Committee (JLUC) policies relating to noise, as adopted by the Palmdale City
Council on March 6, 1991. The JLUC policies were developed through the joint efforts
of the City of Palmdale, the City of Lancaster and the United States (U. S.) Air Force to
address basic air installation land use compatibility issues. These policies relate to both
noise and safety issues; the safety related policies appear in the Safety Element of the
General Plan. The General Plan Overlay Map shall identify the location of the 65 CNEL
Contour and the Frequent Overflight Area for U. S. Air Force Plant 42.
Adopted by City Council                    N-14
1/25/93
                                                                                Noise
1. Policies to govern land use within the 65 CNEL contour are as follows:
   a.    Land which currently has an industrial or commercial general plan
         designation shall not be changed to a residential or other incompatible use.
   b.    Applications (zone change, General Plan Amendment, etc.) for land use
         changes which increase residential density shall not be approved.
   c.    Existing residential land use designations shall be examined for potential
         redesignation to airport compatible designations. It should also be noted
         that this policy does not require that we re-designate any area, only that we
         look at the potential.
   d.    Any developed or undeveloped property which is seeking a land use action
         from the City shall be conditioned to provide an avigation easement to the
         Los Angeles Department of Airports, the U. S. Air Force, and the City.
   e.    Research and develop a means of obtaining avigation easements from all
         properties.
     f.   A Joint Air Force Plant 42/City of Los Angeles Department of Airports/City
          of Palmdale/City of Lancaster Part 150 Study shall be conducted to
          determine the need for soundproofing of existing residential development,
          to make Plant 42 and the surrounding communities mutually more
          compatible through use of FAA funding.
   g.     Currently existing residential areas shall be examined to determine the
          potential of the redevelopment process to convert those land uses to
          airport compatible uses.
   h.     Noise sensitive receptors shall be excluded (examples of noise sensitive
          receptors are hospitals and schools).
   i.     The development and zoning of residentially designated property shall be
          at the minimum density of the General Plan designation.
                                       N-15                 Adopted by City Council
                                                                               1/25/93

                                                                                Noise
2. Policies to govern the land use for areas which are outside of the 65 CNEL
   contour but are frequently overflown by aircraft at low altitudes for take-off,
   landing, and closed pattern flight activity. Typically, this line would extend
   as far north as Avenue K-4 and as far south as Avenue Q-4. The easterly
   boundary of the area would extend to 85th Street East and westerly
   boundary would be Sierra Highway as shown on Exhibit S-17 of the Safety
   Element. These recommendations recognize that existing land uses within
   overflight areas may be inconsistent with the guidelines; however, the
   recommendations reflect long-range goals of the City and the Air Force for
   that area. The recommendations are as follows: (General Plan Amendment 04-04,
   adopted by City Council July 26, 2004.)
   a.      Higher density residential uses shall be discouraged and that - in order of
           priority - industrial, commercial, and low density residential land use
           designations (i.e., 1 du/ac or larger lots) shall be encouraged.
   b.      Noise sensitive receptors shall be excluded (i.e. hospitals and schools).
   c.      Currently existing areas which are occupied by incompatible uses shall be
           examined to determine the potential of the redevelopment process to
           convert those land uses to airport compatible uses.
   d.      The General Plan shall designate this low altitude overflight area on the
           General Plan Overlay Map.
   e.      Land which currently has an industrial or commercial general plan
           designation shall not be changed to a residential or other airport
           incompatible use.
   f.      Any developed or undeveloped property which is seeking a land use
           action from the City shall be conditioned to provide an avigation easement
           to the Los Angeles City Department of Airports, the U.S. Air Force, and
           the City.
   g.      Research and develop a means of obtaining avigation easements from all
           properties within this area.
                                           N-17                Adopted by City Council
                                                                               1/25/93
Noise
JLUC Examples
Customer Intensive Uses - Customer intensive retail operations would include grocery
stores, drug stores, convenience stores, theaters, shopping centers, department stores,
and similar uses.
Low Customer Intensive Uses - Low customer intensive uses would include nurseries,
lumber yards, contractor yards, warehousing, mini storage and similar uses.
F.      Airport Land Use Commission
The City shall support the Airport Land Use Commission of Los Angeles County in
planning for appropriate land uses around USAF Plant 42 through consistency of the
City's General Plan with the County's Comprehensive Airport Land Use Plan. This
implementation measure is further discussed in Section 3 of the Safety Element.
G.      Noise Sensitive Land Uses
The City shall coordinate with appropriate agencies and developers to reduce
unnecessary noise in the vicinity of noise-sensitive locations through the following
actions:
•   Maintain liaison with transportation agencies, such as Caltrans, regarding the
    reduction of noise from existing facilities and roadways. The design and location of
    facilities and roadways shall also be considered.
•   Maintain liaison with Los Angeles County Health Department to update information
    on the effects and impacts of noise pollution on humans.
•   Consider noise as a priority factor in evaluating residential or other noise-sensitive
    projects. Building orientation and configuration should be utilized to minimize or
    eliminate noise problems for a sites adjacent to the freeway, arterials, or rail lines.
    Additional effective noise reduction tools include the use of earthen berms, sound
    reducing walls, and generous setbacks.
•   Maintain a liaison with the Southern Pacific rail line to reduce the level of noise
    produced by train movement within the City, through the regular maintenance of the
    tracks and trains. Monitor the existing operations on the rail line, as well as any
    plans for future development so as to predict future noise levels.

•  Enforce regulations, such as the State Vehicle Code noise standards, for City owned
   and City operated vehicles.
H.     Noise Sources and Receptors
The City will maintain a map of receptors and sources in the Planning Area for new
development in order to anticipate and/or avoid incompatible land uses. Acoustical
analysis reports will be required to incorporate the receptor and source map in the
report on a smaller scale.
I.     Acoustical Design
The City will require developments to implement noise control measures during
construction. Acoustical design shall include measures to control noise at the source,
along the transmission path or at the receptor.

SECTION 4: ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
A.     Noise Measurement
Community noise is generally not a steady state and varies with time. Under conditions
of non-steady state noise, some type of statistical scale of measurement is necessary in
order to quantify noise exposure over a long period of time. Several rating scales have
been developed for describing the effects of noise on people. They are designed to
account for the known effects of noise on people.
A variety of different noise measurement scales or "metrics" are used for measuring
noise sources with differing characteristics. The metrics typically employed for
measuring community stationary and mobile noise sources are the Equivalent Noise
Level (LEQ), the Day/Night Noise Level (LDN) and the Community Noise Equivalent
Level (CNEL). These metrics are defined as follows:
LEQ is the "energy" average noise level during the time period of the sample. It is a
number that represents a decibel sound level. This constant sound level would contain
an equal amount of energy as a fluctuating sound level over a given period of time.
LEQ can be measured for any time period, but is typically measured for 15 minutes, 1
hour or 24 hours.
LDN is a 24 hour, time-weighted annual average noise level. Time-weighted refers to
the fact that noise which occurs during certain sensitive time periods is penalized for
occurring at these times. In the LDN scale, those events that take place during the
night (10 pm to 7 am) are penalized by 10 dBA. This penalty was selected to attempt to
account for increased human sensitivity to noise during the quieter period of a day,
where sleep is the most probable activity.
CNEL is similar to the LDN scale except that it includes an additional 5 dBA penalty for
events that occur during the evening (7 pm to 10 pm) time period. Either LDN or CNEL
may be used to identify community noise impacts within the Noise Element.
Intermittent or occasional noise such as that associated with stationary noise sources is
not of sufficient volume to exceed community noise standards that are based on a time
averaged scale such as the CNEL scale. To account for intermittent noise, another
method to characterize noise is the Percent Noise Level (L%). The Percent Noise Level
is the level exceeded X% of the time during the measurement period. Percent Noise
Levels are another method of characterizing ambient noise where, for example, L90 is
the noise level exceeded 90 percent of the time, L50 is the level exceeded 50 percent of
the time, and L10 is the level exceeded 10 percent of the time. L90 represents the
                                           N-20                Adopted by City Council
                                                                                 1/25/93
Noise
background or minimum noise level, L50 represents the average noise level, and L10
the peak or intrusive noise level.
B.      Existing Noise Environment
The existing noise environment in the Planning Area was documented through both a
community noise survey and computer generated noise contours. The noise survey
identified existing noise levels at specific locations within the City while the computer
analysis predicted existing and future roadway noise levels.
Community Noise Survey
A community noise survey was conducted on November 2, 1987 to document the
existing noise environment within the City of Palmdale. Noise measurements were
conducted at 12 sites between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4:10 p.m. The noise
monitoring locations are identified in Exhibit N-2 and were selected with the assistance
of the Planning Department.         The locations were representative of residential,
commercial, industrial, public use areas, and undeveloped property.
The noise measurements indicated that the City of Palmdale has noise levels typical of
urban residential communities. However, unlike other urban communities, the City of
Palmdale has two unique noise sources: military aircraft and major freight rail
operations. Noise from military aircraft operations was recorded at 6 of the 12
measurement locations, with the maximum aircraft departure noise levels reaching 92 to
95 dBA at Site 4. Site 4 is located within the 70 dBA CNEL noise contour from USAF
Plant 42. Approaching aircraft noise levels at Site 3, which is located approximately on
the 65 dBA CNEL noise contour from USAF Plant 42, were somewhat lower at 85 to 92
dBA. Aircraft noise varied throughout flyovers, with high frequencies predominating
while an aircraft approached and low frequencies predominating after the aircraft had
passed overhead.
Freight rail movements were measured at Sites 2 and 9. Rail noise was characterized
as being of extremely long duration (several minutes) with 100 rail cars plus freight
movements. The maximum locomotive noise level recorded was 99 dBA with rail cars
generating noise levels of 64 to 73 dBA.
The noise measurement results are summarized in Table N-4 and should be used as a
guide or indication of noise levels throughout the community. Maximum noise levels
ranged from 53.5 to 99.0 dBA with the highest level generated by a locomotive. The
second and third highest noise levels were military aircraft operations at 95 and 92 dBA.
Site 12 was at a new residential development on the western boundary of the City. This
Adopted by City Council                     N-21
1/25/93
                                                                                     Noise
site, because of its remote location and light traffic, had substantially lower noise levels
than any other site.
Table N-4 also provides the sound level exceeded 10 percent (L10), 33 percent (L33),
50 percent (L50) and 90 percent (L90) of the measurement duration. While the Lmax
provides the highest level measured, the L10 provides a better indication of peak noise
levels that would typically be expected at the specific location. Disregarding the quiet
environment, L10 of 53.0 dBA at Site 12 and the substantial number of aircraft
approaches at Site 3 resulting in an L10 of 85.5 dBA, the L10 values only ranged from
63.0 to 75.5 dBA for the remaining 10 locations. The L50 values also were relatively
consistent and only varied from 51.0 to 68.5 dBA. These values indicate a typical urban
environment with a variety of noise sources, including roadway traffic, rail operations,
aircraft and other non-transportation related activities.
L90 values are commonly termed the background noise level. Background noise levels
throughout the City ranged from 45.5 dBA to 62.0 dBA. The background noise levels
were less than 60 dBA for all locations except Sites 3 and 4 near Air Force Plant 42.
The lowest background noise level was at Site 7, a quiet residential neighborhood. The
L33 sound level is provided in Table N-5 since it is used by various federal agencies to
evaluate transportation noise impacts.
The 12 sites fall into four general land use categories: residential, commercial, public
use, and undeveloped property. Each of these categories is discussed below.
Residential: Sites 1, 5, 7, and 12 can all be considered residential locations.
Measurements at all four residential locations included roadway traffic at slower speeds.
Site 12 was a new residential development on the far west end of the City and away
from major noise sources. It, therefore, had the lowest noise levels of any of the 12
sites. The four residential sites had L50 values ranging from 51.0 to 63.0 dBA. Both
Sites 1 and 5 had higher noise values for two reasons: measurements included State
Route 14 truck traffic noise and military aircraft flyover noise.

Commercial: Noise measurements at commercial locations included Sites 2 and 10.
Commercial locations generally have slightly higher noise levels than residential
locations because of the greater volumes of traffic and higher percentage of truck traffic.
The L50 for these two sites ranged from 59.5 to 63.5 dBA.
Public Use: Site 6, McAdam Park, and Site 8, Sage Intermediate School, are public use
facilities. McAdam Park was a quiet location as demonstrated by an L50 of 57.5 dBA.

                                                                                   Noise
Noise levels were somewhat higher at Sage Intermediate School due to substantial
traffic on Avenue R and 20th Street. The L50 at this site was 61.5 dBA.
Undeveloped Property: Sites 3, 4, 9 and 11 were representative of undeveloped
locations within the City. The L50 values were as follows: Site 3, 68.0 dBA; Site 4, 68.5
dBA; Site 9, 61.5 dBA; and Site 11, 60.5 dBA. Sites 3 and 4 were on the arrival and
departure ends of the primary runway at Air Force Plant 42. At Site 3, aircraft approach
noise levels ranged from 68 to 92 dBA. Site 4 was approximately 4,000 feet from the
primary runway at Air Force Plant 42 and aircraft departure noise ranged from 85 to 94
dBA. For comparison, traffic noise on Sierra Highway was 68 to 74 dBA at 150 feet.
Sites 9 and 11 were at undeveloped locations to the southeast of the City. While Site 9
was near a residential community, a train pass-by during noise measurements resulted
in higher noise levels. The L50 of 61.5 dBA was a combination of train (72 to 78 dBA)
and truck (64 to 68 dBA) noise levels. Site 11, along Avenue T, had an L50 of 60.5 dBA
with heavy trucks serving sand and gravel operations dominating the noise
environment. Truck traffic noise levels at 150 feet ranged form 68 to 72 dBA.
Noise Contours
The Noise Element identifies both 60 and 65 dBA CNEL contours for transportation
noise sources including the Antelope Valley Freeway (SR-14), Pearblossom Highway,
two Southern Pacific Railroad lines (The Valley Mainline and the Colton/Palmdale
Cutoff), U.S. Air Force Plant 42, and major roadways on Exhibits N-4 and N-5.
A 65 dBA CNEL level describes an area as having a time-average constant sound level
of roughly 65 dBA even though the area would experience individual sound events
higher and lower than 65 dBA. CNEL provides a common measure for a variety of
differing noise environments. Thus, the same CNEL can describe both an area with
very few high noise events and an area with many low level events.
CNEL values can be useful in comparing noise environments and indicating the
potential degree of adverse noise impacts. However, the CNEL scale has limitations in
its usefulness through averaging the sound event levels over a 24-hour period and
possibly obscuring the periodic high noise levels of individual events and their possible
adverse effects. In recognition of this limitation, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) has adopted maximum single event noise impacts levels for sources such as
buses, garbage trucks, and railroad equipment.
Note that CNEL is not a measure but a computation of measured sound levels. People
do not "hear" CNEL, but respond to the sound levels of individual events or noise
sources. People may integrate their response to noise over long-term intervals (daily,
weekly, etc.) and make subjective judgments about the "quality" of the noise

                                                                                  1/25/93
Noise
environment. This is one reason why CNEL may not be the most appropriate noise
descriptor for land uses which do not involve continuous "long-term" exposure to the
noise source occurring regularly over a 24 hour period.
The noise contours represent lines of equal noise exposure (see Exhibit N-3), just as
the lines on a weather map indicate equal temperature or atmospheric pressure. The
contours provide a visualization of estimates of sound level. Land forms and man-made
structures have very complex effects on sound transmission and on noise contours.
Generally, barriers between a source and receiver absorb and/or reflect noise resulting
in a quieter environment. Where barriers or land forms do not interrupt the noise
transmission path from source to receiver, the contours prove to be good estimates of
the average noise level. In areas where barriers or land forms interrupt the sound
transmission, the noise contours overestimate the extent to which a source intrudes into
the community. Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible for the Noise Element to analyze
each roadway segment of the City for barrier noise attenuation. Therefore, where
specific projects are proposed within noise impacted areas, an acoustical analysis
should be completed to evaluate the noise reduction provided by any barriers to the
noise path.
CNEL values have been shown to be closely related to, and often within, 1dB of LDN
values, a noise metric commonly used by federal agencies.
The noise contour analysis focused on transportation noise generators, which typically
cause a constant increase in ambient noise levels. Specific findings of these studies
are as follows:
Aircraft Noise: The U. S. Air Force Plant 42 is located in the City of Palmdale, east of
the Sierra Highway and north of Avenue P. Aircraft noise contours (65, 70 and 80 dBA
CNEL contours) for the U. S. Air Force Plant 42 were provided by the Department of the
Air Force (AFSC Master Plan Air Installation Compatible Use Zone Map, August 1990).
The noise contours reflect both aircraft operations and engine run-ups.
Railroad Noise: The Southern Pacific Railroad Company operates two rail lines through
the City of Palmdale. The Valley Mainline runs north/south and operates adjacent to
Sierra Highway. The Colton/Palmdale Cutoff branches from the Valley Mainland south
of Avenue R and runs east. Railroad noise levels were calculated using the U. S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development Noise Assessment guidelines. The
following assumptions (based on information provided by S.P.R.R.) were made in the
analysis of the Valley Mainline operations: 20 diesel trains per 24-hour period, 15
percent of the operations occurring at night; 4 diesel locomotives per train; 120 rail cars
per train; average speed of 55 mph; welded tracks; and whistles required for grade
crossings. The above assumptions also hold for the Colton/Palmdale Cutoff, with the
Adopted by City Council                    N-25
1/25/93
                                                                                   Noise
exception that 10 trains operate on the line in a 24-hour period. The 60 and 65 dBA
CNEL contours for the two rail lines were generated from this analysis.
Roadway Noise: The City of Palmdale roadway noise contours were generated with the
Federal Highway Administration's Highway (FHWA) Traffic Noise Prediction model, U.S.
Department of Transportation (1978). This model was modified to generate CNEL
values. Model input data included existing and projected average daily traffic volumes
(provided by DKS Associates, 1989); day/evening/night percentages of autos, and
medium and heavy trucks; vehicle speeds; ground attenuation factors (soft sight
conditions were assumed); and roadway widths.
The results of the FHWA model analysis are summarized in Table N-5 which gives the
distance from the roadway center line at the 60, 65 and 70 dBA CNEL contours, and the
CNEL level at 50 feet away from the roadway centerline.
A graphic display of the noise contours for the existing major transportation noise
sources is provided in Exhibit N-4. The 60, 65, 70 and 80 dBA CNEL contours are
provided, showing the integrated effect from all transportation noise sources (aircraft,
railway, and roadways where the CNEL contour is greater that 200 feet from the
roadway centerline). The noise contours represent unmitigated conditions. Therefore,
on roadways where walls, berms, or structures block the noise path, the contours
overestimate the noise impact.
The population within each CNEL zone has been estimated in order to identify the
number of persons that are impacted by transportation noise. There are approximately
10,000 residents within the City that are exposed to noise levels exceeding 65 dBA
CNEL, and approximately 20,000 residents that are exposed to noise levels between 60
and 65 dBA CNEL.
Interpretation of Transportation Noise Contours
Exhibit N-4 displays the 80, 70, 65 and 60 dBA CNEL noise contours that were
generated using the FHWA noise model for existing transportation noise sources in the
City of Palmdale. The contours portray areas of equal noise level within that contour.
The dominant feature on this exhibit is the 65 dBA CNEL contour generated by the U. S.
Air Force Plant 42. The contour is roughly oval in shape and covers an area from
Avenue L-8 on the north to Avenue P on the south, and from 20th Street West to 130th
Street East. The existing land uses in the area encompassed by the 65 dBA CNEL
contour are the U.S. Air Force Plant 42, open space, industrial, and a few rural
residential homes to the north of the plant.
                                           N-26               Adopted by City Council
                                                                                 1/25/93





                                                                                   Noise
State Route 14 transects the City from north to south and generates a 60 dBA CNEL
contour that extends approximately 1,500 feet from the roadway centerline. A
substantial number of both single- and multiple-family residential dwellings are located
within this 60 dBA CNEL contour.
The Sierra Highway and the Valley Mainline Railroad run north/south and parallel to one
another approximately 6,000 feet to the east of State Route 14. The combined noise
levels of the Sierra Highway and the Valley Mainline generate a 60 dBA CNEL contour
that extends approximately 1,800 feet from their centerpoints. The majority of the land
uses in the area impacted by the 60 dBA CNEL contour are commercial and industrial.
However, single and multiple-family residential dwellings are located within the 60 dBA
CNEL contour, as well.
The Colton/Palmdale Cutoff railroad line, which branches off from the Valley Mainline
Railroad at Avenue R and extends to the east, generates a 60 dBA CNEL contour that
extends 1,000 feet from the railway centerline and affects single-family residential
dwellings.
From 30th Street East to 60th Street East, Pearblossom Highway/Avenue T and the
Colton Cutoff railroad line run parallel from east to west. Their noise levels combine to
generate a 60 dBA CNEL that extends approximately 2,000 feet from their centerpoint.
Rural residential dwellings lie within this 60 dBA CNEL contour.
The section of Palmdale Boulevard from the Antelope Valley Freeway to 47th Street
East generates a 60 dBA CNEL contour that extends approximately 1,000 feet from the
roadway centerline. Land use types within this contour are mostly commercial, but also
impacted are single-family residential dwellings.
C.      Future Noise Environment
Future average daily traffic volumes (provided by DKS Associates, 1989) were used in
the FHWA Traffic Noise Prediction Model to generate future CNEL noise contours. The
results of the analysis for future conditions are summarized in Table N-6, which gives
the distance from the roadway centerline to the 60, 65 and 70 dBA CNEL contours, and
the CNEL level at 50 feet from the roadway centerline. Airport noise contours taken
from AFSC Master Plan, Air Installation Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ), August 1990,
were incorporated into this report.
Future noise contours from the railroad and Plant 42 are depicted in Exhibit N-5 (Exhibit
N-5 is provided as a separate large blue-line map). The 60, 65, 70 and 80 dBA CNEL
contours are provided, showing the integrated effect from all transportation noise
sources (railway, airport and roadways where the 60 dBA CNEL contour is greater than
                                             N-32              Adopted by City Council
                                                                                  1/25/93
Noise
200 feet from the roadway centerline). The roadway noise contours represent
unmitigated conditions. Therefore, on roadways where walls, berms, or structures block
the noise path, the contours overestimate the noise impacts. Exhibit N-5 shows the air
installation compatible use zone noise contours developed by Force Plant 42 in 1990.
The City of Los Angeles and the U. S. Air Force have reached a joint-use agreement
allowing up to 400 commercial operations (take-offs or landings) per day on the
northeast/southwest runway of the plant. Exhibit N-5 includes the addition of
commercial flights which increased the size of the noise contours.
The population within each CNEL zone has been estimated in order to identify the
number of persons that will be impacted by transportation noise. At the time of General
Plan build-out, approximately 21,000 residents within the City will be exposed to noise
levels exceeding 65 dBA CNEL, and approximately 28,000 residents will be exposed to
noise levels between 60 and 65 dBA CNEL.
A comparison of Exhibit N-4 (existing noise contours) with Exhibit N-5 (future noise
contours) shows that the transportation noise levels are expected to increase in the
future. The discussion of land uses impacted within specified noise levels holds for the
future also, with the exception that the noise contours are pushed outward from the
roadways to encompass a larger area due to increased noise levels and, thus, will
impact a greater area. A summary of noise impacts by source is provided in Table N-7.
Noise Impacts
The effects of 60 and 65 dBA CNEL on residents is summarized in Table N-8. The
existing and future noise contours identify areas where outdoor speech interference can
occur and a small percentage of the population will be highly annoyed. However, noise
mitigation measures, such as berms and walls located between a noise source and
receiver would reduce noise impacts.

U.S. Air Force Plant 42                          CNEL noise contours extend substantial distances
                                                 into the community. The 70 dBA CNEL extends
                                                 beyond SR-14 on the west.
Antelope Valley Freeway                          CNEL noise levels are significant and the 60 dBA
                                                 CNEL demonstrates that freeway noise extends a

                                                 overlapping noise contours resulting in substantial
                                                 noise impacts. Major rail freight movements result
                                                 in single events of long duration.

                                                 substantial distances into the community.
Major Roadways                                   Noise-sensitive land uses along major roadways
                                                 are impacted by traffic noise.
Commercial/Industrial                            In general, commercial/industrial operations and
                                                 activities are not considered a City-wide noise
                                                 problem. Isolated noise problems occur where
                                                 commercial/industrial uses are located near a
                                                 noise-sensitive land use.         Sand and gravel
                                                 operations are presently far removed from noise
                                                 sensitive land uses. However, sensitive residential
                                                 uses are being developed closer to those
                                                 operations and traffic along Avenue T will impact
                                                 more residential uses as development spreads
                                                 outward from the existing developed areas.

          disease, high-blood pressure and stroke, and ulcers and other digestive disorders. The
          relationships between noise and these effects, however, have not as yet been quantified.

Purpose of the Housing Element
This update of the City of Palmdale’s Housing Element of the General Plan has been
prepared pursuant to California Government Code Article 10.6, Sections 65580 through
65589.9. As part of its general plan, each city and county in the state is required to
prepare a Housing Element. In creating the Housing Element law, the Legislature’s
purpose was to ensure that local governments would marshal available resources,
develop appropriate local programs and cooperate with one another in order to address
local and regional housing needs and the State’s housing goals.
The Housing Element must identify and analyze the community’s housing needs and
provide a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, financial resources and
scheduled programs for the preservation, improvement and development of housing.
The element must identify adequate sites to meet the housing needs of all economic
sectors of the community and permit a variety of housing types including rental housing,
factory-built housing and mobile homes.
I.      Public Participation
The Housing Element was prepared by the consulting firm of Karin Pally Associates
under the direction of the Planning Department of the City of Palmdale. Housing
Element law requires that the local government make a diligent effort to involve all
economic segments of the community in the development of the Housing Element. This
participation must be described in the element.
On January 9, 2012, the City published a Notice of Preparation in the local newspaper
of general circulation detailing the City’s intention to prepare a Housing Element update
and inviting interested parties to a scoping meeting. This meeting was held on January
30, 2012. Approximately 45 members of the public, including existing homeowners,
renters and developers, attended this meeting.
A Draft Housing Element, dated March 12, 2012, was distributed for public review to
nine local social service organizations dealing with housing issues (Homeless Solutions
Access Center, Lancaster Community Shelter, Antelope Valley Domestic Violence
Shelter, Grace Resource Center, Salvation Army, St Vincent De Paul Our Lady of
Charity, Antelope Valley Committee on Aging, Independent Living Center of Southern
California, Mental Health America of Los Angeles – Antelope Valley Enrichment
Services), the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), the Building
Industry Association and the City’s Housing Division. The cities of Lancaster and Santa
Clarita and the County of Los Angeles, which are all within SCAG’s North Los Angles
County subregion, were also provided copies of the Draft Housing Element for review.
Copies of the Draft Housing Element were also made available at Palmdale City Hall,
the City’s Main Library and lobby of the Development Services Building. Additionally, a
copy was posted on the City’s website, www.cityofpalmdale.org.

Housing
Interested parties were provided 30 days, until April 10, 2012, in which to review the
Draft Housing Element and provide any comments to the City. All comments received
will be considered as part of the revision of the Housing Element. Additionally, a public
meeting will be held on March 28, 2012, to provide an opportunity for all interested
parties with an opportunity to be heard on issues relevant to the Draft Housing Element.
Following the public meeting, the Draft Housing Element will be submitted to the
California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for review and
comment. Once the HCD review is complete and any required revisions have been
made, the Draft Housing Element will be submitted to the Planning Commission for
review and City Council for review and approval.
Organization of the Element

II.     PERFORMANCE ON PREVIOUS ELEMENT (REVIEW AND REVISE)
Government Code Section 65588 requires that: “Each local government shall review its
Housing Element as frequently as appropriate to evaluate all of the following: (1) the
appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives and policies in contributing to the
attainment of the state housing goals; (2) the effectiveness of the Housing Element in
attainment of the community housing goals and objectives; (3) the progress of the city,
county or city and county implementation of the Housing Element.”
The previous three planning periods for the Housing Element in the SCAG region were
1989 to 1994, 1994 to 1998 and 1998 to 2005. The element for 1998 to 2005 was
completed and approved in 2000. This document reviews the accomplishments of the
programs set forth in Palmdale’s 2000 Housing Element. Housing units produced
between 1998 and 2005 are included in the report on accomplishments of the 2000
Element. Housing units constructed between 2006 and 2011 are included in the section
on programs and quantified objectives for the new 2006-2014 Housing Element
Success in Meeting Quantified Objectives
Table H-1 summarizes the quantified objectives for new housing production and other
housing programs in the City of Palmdale set forth in the City’s 2000 Housing Element.
Table H-2 summarizes actual accomplishments for new construction and other
programs. Table H-3 provides a review of the housing programs section of the 2000
Housing Element with both quantitative and qualitative accomplishments, and an
evaluation of existing programs and information on whether or not the program will be
continued into the 2006-2014 Housing Element period along with the reference number
for the new or continued program.
REVIEW AND REVISE
A.      City Performance on Quantified Objectives, 1998-2005
A comparison of H-1 and Table H-2 below shows that between 1998 and 2005,
Palmdale met 96% of its own projection for housing production and fulfilled nearly 75%
of its overall RHNA allocation despite the severe recession that almost stopped housing
construction in the late 1990s. The income level of all the new homes cannot be
determined, however, during the 1990s and beyond, land prices in Palmdale were low
enough to ensure that developers could continue to provide new single-family homes
that were affordable to median income families in Los Angeles County. Unfortunately,
during this period, almost no new multifamily rental housing was constructed and only
one subsidized housing project affordable to very low-income families was constructed.
No affordable senior housing was constructed. The City did, however, acquire land to
build 295 units of senior housing affordable to households of moderate, low and very
low-income.

                                                                               09/05/12

Housing
One of the chief objectives of the City’s housing program between 1998 and 2005 was
to improve housing conditions in the City’s older, low-income single-family
neighborhoods. City programs coordinated the work of multiple agencies to identify
deteriorated conditions, providing grants to repair or replace roofs, fences, landscaping,
garage doors, stucco and trim. The City also repaired or installed sidewalks, curbs,
streetlights and other infrastructure upgrades.

majority of programs proposed in its Housing Element.
•      Three neighborhood improvement programs were initiated, coordinating the
       efforts of both City and County agencies to achieve housing, infrastructure and
       public safety improvements in the City’s older neighborhoods.
•      The City’s South Antelope Valley Emergency Services program (SAVES)
       provided vouchers for emergency housing to homeless individuals and families.
•      The City assumed ownership of three mobile home parks, providing spaces at
       rents affordable to very low and low-income mobile home owners. The City
       continued to regulate rents in privately owned mobile home parks.
•      The City’s Community Redevelopment Agency acquired land in the Courson area
       to build 295 units of senior housing.
•      The City provided emergency grants for home repairs to 209 very low-income
       Palmdale households and made neighborhood improvement grants to 666 low
       and moderate-income households in the focus neighborhoods.

III.    EXISTING HOUSING NEEDS
A.      Introduction: Definitions
Income Definitions
In this section several different sets of terms and categories are used to describe
household income levels.
     Federal Definitions
Each year the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) determines and
publishes income limits for federal housing programs on its HUD User website. These
data include median income and household income limits by County or Metropolitan
Statistical Area for households at three different income levels, extremely low-income,
very low-income, and low-income. In 2012, the area median income for Los Angeles
County set by HUD is $64,800.
Extremely Low-Income: An extremely low-income household is one earning 30% or
less of area median income. In 2012, the upper income limit for a family of four is
$25,300.
Very Low-Income: A very low-income household earns between 31% and 50% of area
median income; the income limit for a family of four in 2012 is $42,150.
60% of median: In projects financed by Low-income Housing Tax Credits, very low-
income is set at 60% or less than rather than 50% or less of median income. The
California Department of Housing and Community Development publishes an annual list
of income limits by county for projects financed by the Community Development Block
Grant (CDBG) or the federal HOME program. In 2012, the 60% limit for a family of four
is $45,540.
Low-Income: A low-income household is one earning between 51% and 80% of median
income. The income limit for a low-income four-person family in 2012 is $67,450.
Median Income: This is the point at which half of all households earn less and half earn
more. In 2012, HUD has set the median income for Los Angeles County at $64,800.
Other: Households earning more than 95% of median income are described as “other.”
The Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles reserves 75% of its Housing
Choice Section 8 vouchers for extremely low-income households, that is, those earning
30% or less of median income.
                                           H-18
Adopted by City Council
09/05/12

                                                                                 Housing
The federal low-income housing tax credit program administered by the state’s Tax
Credit Allocation Committee sets affordable rents at 60% of median but gives additional
application points to projects that target rents to households of even lower income.
     State Definitions
The State of California uses several sets of definitions. For the Housing Element,
regional councils of government, including the Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG), calculate future housing needs at four income levels--very low
(50% or less of median income), low (51% to 80% of median income), moderate (81%
to 120% of median income) and high (more than 120% of median income)--but use the
five above-listed federal categories in their calculations of existing need.
Redevelopment law also uses the income categories used by SCAG. The state density
bonus law makes provisions for housing affordable to households earning either 50% or
60% of median income. The housing programs administered by the California
Department of Housing and Community Development use the categories created by the
federal government. In the following discussion, both the percent of median income and
the income category will be provided to avoid confusion.
     Cost Burden
The federal government also sets standards for the amount a household should pay for
housing. According to current standards, households should pay no more than 30% of
their gross income for rent or mortgage including utility costs. Households paying more
than 30% of income for housing are considered cost burdened and households paying
50% or more for housing are considered extremely cost burdened.
B.      Population, Employment and Housing
Government Code Section 65583(a) requires “An assessment of housing needs and an
inventory of resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of these needs.” This
assessment includes an analysis of population and employment trends (GC 65583
(a)(1) and household characteristics (GC 65583 (a)(2).
Palmdale is located at the south end of the Antelope Valley, about an hour’s drive north
from downtown Los Angeles. In 1980 it was a small desert community of 12,277 people
serving the surrounding aerospace and agricultural industries. The City of Palmdale
has continued to grow with development of large single-family subdivisions offering
affordable home ownership for working families from throughout Los Angeles County.
Rapid population growth was fueled not just by housing production but also by
annexation of surrounding land. The City grew from 45 square miles in 1983 to
approximately 104 square miles in 2000.

1.      Population
Population Growth 1990-2000: According to data from the California Department of
Finance (DOF), Palmdale's population nearly doubled between 1990 and 2000,
burgeoning from a community of 68,946 people to one with a population of 116,670.
Toward the end of the 1990s, Palmdale's annual population growth began to slow,
dropping from a 6.1% increase in 1996 to an annual increase of a little more than 2% in
the year 2000. Nevertheless, the population of Palmdale increased by 76% while
population in the County as a whole grew by only 11.5%.
Population Growth 2000-2010: Table 4 below shows Palmdale’s population growth
between 2000 and 2010. The population grew from 116,670 to 152,750 persons, an
increase of 36,080 (30.9%). This growth was considerably less dramatic than that
during the previous decade but still substantial. Between 2001 and 2005, growth was
between 2.7% and 3.1% per year then growth peaked at 3.7% in 2005. In the next
three years growth dropped each year to a low of 1.9% in 2008, bouncing back to 3.3%1

in 2009 and then plummeting down to 1.3% in 2010. Palmdale was hard hit by the
subprime crisis so population growth will probably stay low for a few years.

Although most population growth in Los Angeles County is due to natural increase2 (the
excess of births over deaths, excluding migration), affordable housing prices that draw
working families in search of affordable single-family homes have been the engine
driving population increase in Palmdale.

Table H-5 shows the age distribution of Palmdale in 2000 and 2010 and compares the
age distribution of Palmdale’s residents in 2010 to that of the County as a whole in
2010. All three sets of data come from the U.S. Census. Between 2000 and 2010 as
Palmdale’s population increased by more than 30%, the distribution by age group
shifted somewhat with substantial changes in just a few age groups. The number of
persons age 35 to 44 was almost the same in 2000 and 2010 but their proportion of the
population dropped by 24%. The proportion of persons age 65 and older grew by
17.8% but the number of persons in that age group increased by 50.8% with an
increase of 64.6% in with the number aged 75 and older. The number of children age
14 and younger grew by 8.8% but their share of the population declined by 16.7%.
These changes may have implications for service delivery.
The age dependency ratio, which is the ratio of the non-working population, both those
under age 15 and those over age 65 to the population aged 15-64, can indicate the
potential effects of changes in population structure for economic development, schools
and/or social service delivery. In Palmdale the child dependency ratio declined from
50.8 in 2000 to 40 in 2010, a decrease of 21.2% while the old age dependency ratio
increased by 11%.

Data on median age show that the median age of Palmdale’s population declined
slightly from 28.2 in 200 to 27.9. Palmdale’s population is younger than that of the
County overall, which has a median age of 34.8
3.      Race and Ethnicity
The Census asks about race and Hispanic or Latino origin in two separate questions
because federal standards consider that race and Hispanic origin (ethnicity) are
different concepts. According to a Census Brief issued in March 2011 entitled Overview
of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010 the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
requires that federal agencies ask questions about at least two ethnicities: Hispanic or
Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino. Hispanic origin can include heritage, nationality
group, lineage or country of birth of the person, or the person’s parents or ancestors.
Persons who identify themselves as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race.
According to the Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010, data on Hispanic origin
and race are important to government and the community as a whole to “implement and
evaluate programs, or enforce laws such as the Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, Fair
housing Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the 2010 Census Redistricting
Data Program.
The 2010 Census combines the results of its questions about race and ethnicity in
variety of ways in Census tables. Table H-6 shows how Palmdale residents reported
their race in 2000 and 2010 (Census Table QT-P4). Table H-7 shows Hispanics or
Latino as a group and the population that did not identify itself as Hispanic or Latino by
race (Census Table QT-P3). Comparing these two tables shows that when the question
is asked about race without giving the option of Hispanic or Latino as a race, about half
of the 2010 population identified themselves as White. But when data on Hispanic/Not
Hispanic and Race are combined, only 24.5% of respondents identified themselves as
White but not Hispanic or Latino. According to US Census in the question when asked
about race, many Latinos identify themselves as “Some other race.” In Table H-6
20.4% of the population in 2000 and 25.4% of the population in 2010 chose this option.
Yet when the data are reorganized to show race by Hispanic or Latino or Not Hispanic
or Latino the proportion of persons identifying as Latino rises to 54.4% of the population.

                                                                                Housing
In 2000, 37.7% of Palmdale residents identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino while
62.5% identified themselves as not Hispanic or Latino. The distribution of race for those
not identifying as Hispanic or Latino was 40.8% White, 13.9% Black or African
American, 0.4% American Indian and Alaskan Native, 3.6% Asian, 0.3% Native
Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 0.3% Some other race alone and 3.2% Two or
more races.
Between 2000 and 2010 there were large increases in the Latino population, 39,372 or
90% and a smaller but still substantial increases in the African American population,
5,264 or 32.6%, and the Asian population,1,978 or 46.5%. Only the population
identifying itself as White alone declined by 10,022 persons, a decrease of 21%.
The changes in Palmdale’s racial and ethnic distribution make it more like that of Los
Angeles County in the proportion of persons identifying themselves as Hispanic or
Latino or White alone. Palmdale has a higher proportion of African Americans and a
lower proportion of Asians than the County as a whole. Table H-7 shows that in
Palmdale 54.4% of the population identifies itself as Hispanic or Latino; the proportion
countywide is 47.7%. Whites make up 24.5% of Palmdale's population and 27.8% of
Los Angeles County. The Black or African American community in Palmdale constitutes
14.1% of the population; countywide only 8.3% of the population identifies itself as
Black or African American. American Indians and Alaska Natives are 0.2% of both
Palmdale's population and the County as a whole. Asians make up a smaller proportion
of Palmdale's population, 4.1%, compared to a countywide Asian population of 13.5%.
In Palmdale 2.2% of the population identify themselves as being of two or more races;
countywide, that proportion is 2.0%. In both Palmdale and countywide, 0.3% of the
population considered itself to be “some other race.”
The population distribution changes are magnified when we look at children from age 0
to 14. In those two groups combined, children identified as Hispanic or Latino make up
59.6% of the total age group and Black or African American children make up 19.3% of
that age group.
4.      Income
Table H-8 below compares the distribution of household income in 2000 with that in
Palmdale and the County as a whole in 2010. Median income in Palmdale increased by
13% during this period with a decline in the proportion and number of households
earning less than $10,000 per year and an increase in the proportion of households
earning $100,000 or more. Although the County has a smaller proportion of households
in the very lowest income groups and a larger proportion in the highest groups, median
income countywide in 2010 is slightly lower than that in Palmdale. The poverty level for
a three-person family in California in 2012 is $22,800. According to the 2010 ACS,

The Census provides information on the industries in which Palmdale residents work but
not on employment by industries located in Palmdale or the surrounding Antelope
Valley. Since 45.4% of all Palmdale workers travel at least 45 minutes to their jobs, it
makes sense to look at the employment available in the wider Antelope Valley.
According to the 2008 Economic Roundtable Report entitled Discovering the
Opportunities, prepared for the Greater Antelope Valley Economic Alliance (GAVEA),

The Antelope Valley lies in two different counties--Los Angeles County and Kern
County. According to data from the second quarter of 2010 in the GAVEA report, there
are a total of 95,523 jobs in the Antelope Valley as a whole, with 73,222 of these within
Los Angeles County. The largest single employment sector is government employment
with 16,647 jobs in Los Angeles County followed by retail trade with 10,819 jobs.
6.      Commuting
Table B080123 on travel time to work shows that 12.4% of Palmdale’s workers travel 90
minutes or more to work, another 19.3% need between an hour and an hour and half for
their daily commute and 11.1% must travel for 45 to 60 minutes to their jobs. These
workers make up 43% of all workers living in Palmdale. About two thirds of these long-
distance commuters are men while one third are women.
Most commuters are still traveling alone in their cars. According to Table B08006, 78%
of Palmdale workers drove alone to work while 12% carpooled. Only 4.3% used public
transportation while 1.1% walked or used another means of transport. Home-based
workers made up 3.8% of the workforce.

7.     Unemployment and Other Economic Indicators
According to data provided on the website of the California Employment Development
Department, the December 2011 unemployment rate in Los Angeles County was 11.6%
compared to a statewide rate of 11.1%. However, the clearest indicator of an economic
setback in Palmdale is the precipitous decline in housing production from a high of
1,536 units in 2005 to 108 units in 2011. This issue will be discussed more fully below in
the sections on Housing Characteristics and on Market Constraints.
Like many other California communities, Palmdale’s municipal government has been
hard hit by the collapse of the housing market. Property tax revenues, state revenue
sharing, permit fees and even excise taxes from retail have declined so substantially
that Palmdale has had to reduce city staff by 152 positions, a decline of 42.4%. The City
Planning Department reduced its planning staff from nine to four, a decline of 56%.
C.     Overpayment and Overcrowding
Overcrowding
The Census defines overcrowding as 1.01 or more persons per room excluding the
kitchen and bathroom. A unit is considered severely overcrowded if there are 1.51 or
more persons per room. Overcrowding indicates a problem with housing affordability.
Typically, overcrowding results when, in order to cope with high housing costs,
households that need three or four bedrooms squeeze into a smaller apartment or two
families reduce expenses by sharing an apartment or single-family home.
According to the 2010 ACS data, 6.4% of Palmdale’s owner-occupied units were
overcrowded and another 0.7% very overcrowded. However, overcrowding was more
frequent among tenant households with 10.5% reporting more than 1.01 persons per
room and another 4.8% severely overcrowded with 1.5 or more persons per room.
Overcrowding among Palmdale’s owner-occupied households is similar to that
countywide, where in 2010 4.9% of owner-occupied units were overcrowded and
another 1.8% were very overcrowded.              However, Palmdale’s renter-occupied
households are less overcrowded than those in Los Angeles County as a whole where,
in 2010, 9.5% of renter-occupied units were overcrowded and 8.7% were severely
overcrowded.

Housing
Overpayment
Table H-11 shows the housing cost burdens of Palmdale renters and owners according
to Comprehensive Housing Affordability (CHAS) tables prepared by HUD for use in
Consolidated Plans. These tables are a special run of data from the 2000 Census.
Federal standards set the amount that lower income households should pay for rent at
about 30% of their income. Federal Housing Administration (HFA) guidelines for
owners set the proportion of gross income paid for mortgage costs alone at 29% of
income with an allowance of 41% of gross income for all debt.
Extremely low-income owners and renters in Palmdale, those earning 30% or less of
median income, have very high cost burdens—renters are paying three quarters of their
incomes for rent and owners are paying two thirds. Even when household earn
between 30% and 50% of the median income, 79% of renters and 75% of owners are
paying more than 30% of income for rent. About 30% of renters and 45% of owners are
paying more than 50% of their incomes for housing. Among renters and owners who
earn between 51% and 80% of median income, 58% of renters and two thirds of owners
pay more than 30% of income for housing but only 5% of renters and 21% of owners
pay more than 50%. It is interesting to note that except for the lowest income group, a
higher proportion of owners than renters have the highest cost burden.
Clearly, very high housing costs impose a severe burden on those households with the
lowest incomes.

D.       Extremely Low-Income Housing Needs
Data from the American Community Survey show that 29,163 persons or 19.4% of
Palmdale's population lived below the poverty level in 2010. The rate of poverty
countywide was slightly lower--17.5%. However, these rates may be an underestimate.
Deborah Reed, in a May 2006 report for the Public Policy Institute of California,
analyzed the cost of living nationwide and concluded that because California has a
substantially higher cost of living than many other areas in the U.S., the California
poverty rate is actually higher—a rate of 15% would really be a rate of 18% in terms of
the buying power of California incomes.4
The poverty level for a three-person family in California 2012 is $22,800. In contrast, the
2010 HUD-established income limit for a family of three at 30% of median (extremely
low-income) is $20,500.
Of those below the poverty level in Palmdale, 41% (11,953 persons) were under the
age of 18. These children comprised 24.2% of all children under age 18 in Palmdale.
Among those age 65 or older, 1,141 persons lived below poverty, 12% of all those age
65 or older.
Poverty persists, even among working families, because much of the job growth has
been in the low-wage service and retail sectors. These jobs, paying less than $10 per
hour, don’t provide full-time workers with enough income to lift their families out of
poverty. For example, a full-time worker earning the California minimum wage of $8.00
per hour earns only $16,640 per year.
Table H-12 provides additional data from the 2000 Comprehensive Housing Affordability
(CHAS) tables prepared by HUD for use in Consolidated Plans. The table below
summarizes data for extremely low-income nonelderly households. Data for one and
two-person elderly households is in the Special Needs Section under Elderly.
The table shows that large proportions of Palmdale’s extremely low-income households
have crushing housing cost burdens—overall 82.2% of all renter and owner households
earning less than 30% of median income in 2000 were paying more than half their
incomes for housing.
The proportions and number of extremely low-income households paying more than
50% of their incomes for rent is reflected in the number of households on the waiting list
for Section 8 Vouchers. The database of the Los Angeles County Housing Authority
shows that in 2012 there are 3,746 Palmdale households on the Section 8 waiting list of
the Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles. Since there are about 46,000

California Housing Element Law Section 65583 a (1) requires the jurisdiction to estimate
the future needs of extremely low income households. This number may either be
estimated from census data or the jurisdiction may presume that 50% of its allocation of
very low income households will qualify as extremely low income. Since not all
information from the 2010 census is currently available, the City of Palmdale will
presume that the estimated need for extremely low income units will include 2,241 units
(50% of very low income units).

The California Department of Finance (DOF) compiles an annual estimate of units
constructed by type based on data submitted by each City and County in the State.
Population, vacancy and persons per household are all estimates based on 2000
benchmarks and changes in national data. The data in Table H-13 below are from
DOF’s Table E-5 published annually in May but dated January 1 of the publication year.
The data is for the previous year so data in 2000 represents activity in 1999.

Between 1980 and 2000 Palmdale's housing stock increased from 4,658 housing units
to 37,009 an increase of nearly 700% (694%). Growth slowed in the last decade but
still outstripped countywide growth rates by a considerable amount. California
Department of Finance (DOF) data shows an increase of 9,596 units between January
1, 2000 and January 1, 2010, an increase of 25.9%. In comparison, DOF data for Los
Angeles County as a whole during the period 2000 to 2010 shows an increase of only
4.9%
The 2010 Census (SF1-100% count) shows a slightly lower total for Palmdale units,
46,544, a difference of 51. This is the number given in the DOF Report E-5 issued
January 1, 2011. According to DOF staff, the 2000-2010 is benchmarked to the 2000
Census. Later in 2012 DOF will issue a revised 2000 to 2010 report benchmarked to
the 2010 Census. 5
Nearly all the new units in Palmdale were single-family units; only 733 new multifamily
units were constructed. This can be accounted for by several factors: 1) there was a
moratorium imposed on new multifamily housing construction in place between 1999

Palmdale’s highest residential density, R-3, allows a maximum of 16 units per acre and
imposes very restrictive and inflexible development standards, pushing the price of
development up. In 2012 the City plans to approve a rezoning plan that creates two
high-density zoning designations: R-4 (30) with a minimum of 30 units per acre and R-4
(50) with a minimum of 50 units per acre. (See Section on Adequate Sites.)

Table H-14 shows the distribution of Palmdale’s 46,605 residential structures by type
and number of units on January 1, 2010 according to the California Department of
Finance. Most dwelling units, 37,030 or 79.5%, are single-family homes. Only 905 or
2% of all units are attached condos or townhomes with 940 units (2%) in properties or
buildings with two to four units, 5,402 or 12.8% of units in properties or buildings with
five or more buildings and 1,782 (3.8%) mobile homes. Over the decade there were
increases in only two of the housing types in Palmdale, single-family homes, which
increased by 30% and multifamily housing of 5 or more units, which increased by 14%.
Despite the mortgage crisis and economic downturn, there was a 26.5% increase in
Palmdale’s housing stock, dominated by single-family homes.
The predominance of single-family homes in Palmdale contrasts sharply with the
housing stock countywide, where 48.5% of units are single-family homes, 7.2% are
attached or townhomes, 8.6% are structures of two to four units and 33.9% of units are
in structures of five or more units. Mobile homes make up only 1.7% of all units in the
County.

3.     Vacancy
The DOF vacancy rates are estimates based on the 2000 Census data and adjusted
upward for new construction. They have remained virtually the same since 2000 so
probably don’t reflect year-to-year changes in vacancy. The 2010 Census sets overall
vacancy at 7.7%, with homeowner vacancy at 3.2% and rental vacancy at 9.4%.
Countywide vacancy in 2010 was only 5.9%, with a miniscule 1.7% of homeowner units
vacant and a rental vacancy rate of 5.8%.
4.     Tenure
There have been some changes in tenure since 2000 when 80% of Palmdale units were
owner-occupied and only 20% of households were renter-occupied. By 2010, according
to the Census, 67.9% of housing units were owner-occupied and 32.1% were renter-
occupied. Tenure countywide in 2010 was 47.7% owner-occupied and 52.3% renter-
occupied.
Since only 733 new multifamily units were constructed between 2000 and 2010, it is
clear that that more of the City's single-family units are now renter-occupied. Data from
the 2010 ACS for “Tenure by Units in Structure,” shows 7,067 single-family units or
21.3% of all occupied single-family units were occupied by renters.
5.     Persons Per Household
Estimated persons per household in Palmdale according to ACS data increased
between 2000 and 2010 from 3.4 persons per household to 3.8 persons per household
with 3.74 persons per household in owner-occupied units and 3.95 persons per unit in
renter-occupied units. The increase cannot be attributed to increased births because
the proportion of the population in the 0-14 age group declined from 32.2% to 26.8%
between 2000 and 2010. So it is likely that households are growing through the
inclusion of additional extended family members, occupancy by two (or more) families,
or even adding non-family members to the household.

6.      Housing Age
Table H-15 shows Palmdale’s housing stock by year built through 1999 according to the
2000 Census and DOF data for 2000-2010. It shows that more than three quarters
(80.9%) of the City’s housing units were built after 1980. Different sources have slightly
different total unit counts. The 2010 Census has a total of 46,544 units while the DOF
data in Table 13 show a total of 46,605. The DOF data is an estimate, benchmarked to
the 2000 Census.
The City has serious concerns about the condition and appearance of the approximately
9,578 dwelling units built in 1979 and earlier. Therefore, many of the City’s housing
programs focus on improving housing condition and neighborhood infrastructure in older
Palmdale neighborhoods. Palmdale regards housing condition as a matrix of issues
and has designed several City programs that coordinate the activities of key public
agencies to improve older neighborhoods plagued by inadequate infrastructure,
deteriorating housing, and poor maintenance and management practices.
7.      Housing Condition Survey
The City has identified a number of “focus neighborhoods” where the Neighborhood
Improvement Program marshals resources of key enforcement and funding agencies for
infrastructure and housing repairs. Three such programs were implemented between
2000 and 2005 with improvements to 666 homes of eligible households.
The program is implemented by a team made up of City staff from the various
departments, including Planning, Building and Safety, Public Works, Community
                                                H-36
Adopted by City Council

                                                                                  Housing
Redevelopment Agency, the Los Angeles County Fire Department, and the Los Angeles
County Sheriff’s Department. The program sponsors neighborhood clean-ups, installs
sidewalks, streetlights and curb cuts for handicapped access. Staff members who work
for this program refer homeowners to the Palmdale Housing Division for Neighborhood
Improvement grants or rehabilitation loans as appropriate.
Table H-16, Windshield Survey, is a survey designed and conducted in 2008 by
Palmdale’s Code Enforcement staff. The survey provides vital information on housing
condition in Focus Neighborhoods #4 and #5 where the Neighborhood Improvement
Program was concentrating its efforts in 2008. These two areas are located in the
center of Palmdale. A random sample of the parcel numbers for these properties shows
that the majority were built between 1952 and 1957 and are now more than 50 years
old. A few units were constructed in 1960 and in 1993. In 2001, infill construction
began around the existing housing stock. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the location of
the focus neighborhoods in central Palmdale.
In all, 1,561 single-family homes, 12 apartment buildings, three duplexes, one boarded
up home and 54 vacant lots were included in the survey. The staff who conducted the
survey identified nine types of repairs needed, including roof, stucco, paint and
fascia/trim repairs, yard maintenance, and replacement of components including garage
doors, yards, driveways and fences.
The survey does not indicate how many conditions were identified on each property so
it is possible that one third of the units had problem conditions and the rest were fine.
Or most units had one or two problems. Table H-16 shows that about one third of
structures surveyed needed roof, stucco, paint or yard repairs or all four, 41% need
fascia or trim repair and 20% of units needed a new garage door. Some properties had
components that were seriously deteriorated and needed replacement: 16% needed
yards replaced, 28% needed to have the driveway replaced and 13% needed fencing
replaced. Again, it is likely that some of the units needed replacements of multiple
components.
Previous phases of this program worked in areas where there is a preponderance of
multifamily housing. The City now has a systematic code inspection program that
inspects all single and multifamily rental units on a cycle that varies in length from one
to five years, depending on various factors.

8.      Rental Housing Costs
In 2000, rents in Palmdale were relatively affordable compared to the City of Los
Angeles. In 2012, median and average rents for one, two and three bedroom apartment
units in Palmdale still fall within the limits of “fair market rents” set by the federal
government. However, rental units are not affordable for households with limited
incomes from Social Security, Disability, CalWorks or minimum wage employment.
Those households would all have to pay much more than 30% of income for rent.
Nevertheless, a very low-income (31% to 50% of median) family of four earning $42,150
could pay the rent for a two or three bedroom Palmdale apartment or house and stay
within the limits of 30% of income for rent and a low-income (51% to 80% of median)
family of four with $67,450 per year could easily afford the median price for any of the
apartments and homes in Table H-17 below.
Table H-17 below tabulates the asked-for rents for 99 units in Palmdale listed on
Craigslist Antelope Valley between February 11 and February 13, 2011. This
information is more representative than that available from surveys that focus only on
large properties, as there are few rental projects with more than 100 units in Palmdale.
Rents are usually considered affordable if they cost no more than 30% of household
income. Table H-17 shows that the median one-bedroom rent is affordable to
households earning $21,600 or more per year ($10.38 per hour), families needing two
bedrooms or more have to earn at least $32,400 a year ($15.57 per hour) and the
median-priced three-bedroom unit requires an income of at least $41,940 a year
($20.16 per hour). For each of the five unit sizes listed, there is a wide range of rents.
These rents are either equal to or less than rents surveyed in 2008, and are attractive to
holders of Section 8 vouchers because they are well within the allowable cost or “fair
market rent” set by HUD for Los Angeles County in 20126 (see Table H-18 below).

Housing
However, without a Housing Choice Section 8 Voucher, even a one-bedroom unit is too
expensive for individuals or families living on the incomes provided by CalWORKs,
Supplemental Security Income, or Disability. Most of these households have incomes
ranging from $648 to $859 per month or less in 2012. These individuals and families
must spend nearly all of their income for rent or double up with another family and are
vulnerable to losing their housing altogether if the property owner raises the rents or if
there is a medical or other family emergency.
Nearly all of Palmdale’s rental housing is also too expensive for workers who earn less
than $10.38 per hour ($21,600 per year). Many full-time workers in restaurant,
janitorial, retail and childcare jobs earn only the California minimum wage of $8.00 an
hour. Their annual income is $16,640 a year, often without benefits. For a family living
on this wage, a median priced one-bedroom from Table H-17 would absorb 43% of
annual income. Families with incomes at or below $25,300 for a family of four
(extremely low-income) are eligible for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program,
a program that charges recipients 30% of their income and pays any difference between
that amount and the approved “fair market” rent (see Table H-18). According to the
Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles, Assisted Housing Division, in February
2012 there are 1,406 households with Section 8 vouchers living in the four zip codes in
Palmdale with another 3,746 households on the Section 8 waiting list. According to
Housing Authority staff, there are nearly 200,000 households on the countywide Section
8 waiting list, but only 50 vouchers turn over each month. So at about 600 new
households a year, it would take 333 years to serve everyone on the current waiting list.
Section 8 vouchers are portable and may be used anywhere in Los Angeles County.
Table H-18 shows the 2012 “fair market” rents approved by HUD for Los Angeles
County. While these “fair market rents” are now lower than the majority of market rents
in the City of Los Angeles, they are comparable to market rents for many apartments
and single-family homes in Palmdale.

9.      Ownership Costs
Palmdale’s phenomenal growth over the last 20 years was the result of its ability to
provide affordable ownership housing to the County’s moderate-income households. In
1990, the median price of a home in Palmdale according to the Census was $149,700.
Prices rose over the decade and continued to rise until about 2007 when they began to
fall precipitously due to the mortgage crisis, declining between 25% and 46% depending
on zip code in the 12 months between February 2007 and February 2008 (Table 19A).
In December 2011, according to information from DataQuick published in the Los
Angeles Times Sunday Edition and made available on www.DQNews.com, median
home prices in Palmdale ranged from $186,000 in zip code 93551, to $140,000 in zip
code 93552 and $111,000 in zip code 93550. Table H-19B shows the average sales
price and number of sales for homes by zip code in Palmdale and the change in price
since December 2010. The countywide median in December 2011 was considerably
higher, $310,000 with an overall drop of 7.7% in the price of single-family homes.
2011 prices represented a decline of 38% (93550), 39.6% (93551) and 57.3% (93552)

With 2012 median income in Los Angeles County at $64,800 and the countywide
median home price at $310,000, the sales price, loan amounts, monthly payment and
qualifying income data in Table H-20 confirm that Palmdale can once again offer ample
homeownership opportunities to the County’s very low, low and median income families.
However, census data show a substantial decline in Palmdale homeownership with an
increase in renter-occupied units from 20% of all units in 2000 to 32.1% of all units in
2010. Given that home prices have continued to decline, the choice to rent rather than
purchase is an eminently rational one as a decline in home prices may leave the
household owing more than the home is worth. Lenders have also tightened their
lending criteria, making it more difficult for borrowers to qualify for loans, particularly
with high levels of debt.

  Assumptions: Monthly payment at 30% of income. Monthly payment includes taxes and insurance.
PMI also included because down payment is less than 20% of sales price. Debt estimated at $300 per
month. High and low incomes are based on different amounts of monthly debt. Calculations from

Palmdale was hard hit by the foreclosure crisis that began in 2007 and continues into
2012. According to the Antelope Valley Housing News compiled by Fidelity Title, and
distributed on December 13, 2011, there were 2,698 Palmdale homes in default,
foreclosure or bank ownership (REO) in November 2011. This number was lower than
the same measure in November 2010, a decline of 822 homes or 23.3% and,
represents a substantial decline in foreclosures when compared with the 700
foreclosures in the first quarter of 2008.8
A City ordinance (Ordinance No. 1345) requires banks and other financial institutions to
register and maintain vacant foreclosed homes. As of 2012, approximately 1,500 units
are registered. Although the City believes this is less than half the actual number of
vacant units, the City does not have enough Code Enforcement staff to proactively
inspect for vacant housing units.
The City has estimated new construction over the next two years until 2014 by looking
at production since 2006 and permits pulled in subsequent years. Including 2006 when
1,280 units were built, 2007 with 1,070 units, 2008 with 690 units, 2009 with 339 units
and 2010 with 153 units and 108 units in 2011, it seems likely that approximately 4,000
new units will be built in Palmdale in the 2006-2014 Housing Element period. In fact,
3,640 of those units have already been built and permits for at least an additional 156
will be issued in 2012.

10.     Mobile Home Parks
Mobile homes are an important housing type in Palmdale, comprising 5% of the housing
stock. There are 11 mobile home parks in Palmdale with a total of 2,241 mobile home
units. Three of the parks are owned and operated by the Palmdale Housing Authority,
which purchased the parks with funding from the City’s Redevelopment Husing Set-
Aside. The parks were rehabilitated and all of the 786 spaces in the three parks are
reserved for low and moderate-income households. In addition, assistance for
purchase of mobile homes has been provided to 74 low and moderate-income
households.

E. Assisted Housing Developments “At-Risk” of Losing Their Subsidies
Section 65583(a)(8) of California Housing Element law requires each city and county to
identify the assisted housing units in its jurisdiction that are at risk of conversion to
market rates within ten years. The element must conduct an analysis that includes an
inventory of all such units, an estimate of the cost of preserving the existing units or
producing comparable new units and the availability of nonprofit corporations capable of
acquiring and operating these units. Possible financing sources for preservation or
replacement must also be identified. Finally the analysis must state the community’s
goals, quantified objectives, policies and programs for housing preservation and
production (see Section VIII, Policies and Programs).
This analysis covers the eight and a half-year period between January 1, 2006 and
June 30, 2014.
1.      Identification of At-Risk Units
Overview of At-Risk HUD-Assisted Multifamily Housing
Section 221 and 236 Mortgages
In the 1960s and 1970s the federal government provided a number of different types of
subsidies to private developers to build housing with rents affordable to low-income
households. Two of these programs, Section 221 (d)(3) Below Market Interest Rates
(BMIR) and Section 236 were targeted to households whose incomes were too high for
public housing but who could not afford market rents. Reduced interest rates of only
1% to 3% were granted to property owners in exchange for agreements that made rents
affordable for at least 20 years. After 20 years, owners could pre-pay their 40-year
HUD mortgages and raise their rents to market rates. In the 1970s and later, when it
became necessary to more deeply subsidize units and offset operating cost deficits,
HUD added a new subsidy program, Section 8 Loan Management Set-Aside (LMSA).
Nearly half of the units in the 221(d)(3) BMIR and 236 programs also have the Section 8
Set-Aside.

Housing
Section 8 Project-Based Units
Congress created the Section 8 New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation
Program in 1973. Unlike the Section 8 tenant assistance program that provides
vouchers to individual households, these project-based subsidies were attached to the
units. However, the subsidies did not run for the life of the project, instead HUD
provided a 15 or 20-year commitment for rental subsidies. Tenants were required to
pay 25% (now 30%) of their incomes for rent. HUD sets a “contract rent” for the units
and then pays the difference between that rent and the tenant’s payment. Families and
individuals earning no more than 30%, 50% or 80% of area median income are eligible
for these units.
According to the California Housing Partnership Corporation, in 1997 Congress
changed the rules governing Section 8 contracts when it adopted the Multifamily
Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act (MAHRAA). This legislation provides
funding for expiring Section 8 units. Owners are not obligated to renew expiring Section
8 contracts or to maintain the affordability of their units. Instead, if they choose, they
can decline to renew the Section 8 contracts and raise their rents to market rates.
Owners of many buildings subsidized by Section 221 (d)(3) and 236 are now eligible to
pre-pay their mortgages. In order to do so, the owner must file a notice of intent and
provide a year’s notice to HUD and to tenants. In properties that also have Section 8
Loan Management Set-Aside (LMSA) contracts, the owner’s decision to pre-pay the
underlying loan and opt out of the Section 8 contract will probably be influenced by
whether the Section 8 rents are higher or lower than the market rents in the surrounding
area. In areas where market rates are higher, the owner may want to pay off his HUD
obligation so that he/she can charge market rates as soon as the Section 8 contract
expires. California Government Code Section 65863.11 requires owners of HUD-
subsidized buildings who put these buildings on the market to give nonprofit
organizations the first right of refusal.
Pursuant to California Government Code Section 65863.10, owners must also file a
notice of intent with the State when they decide to prepay a federally–assisted
mortgage, terminate mortgage insurance or opt out of rent subsidy contracts These
notices must be filed one year and six months before the date of prepayment or
termination and must also be sent to all affected tenants. The State Department of
Housing and Community Development provides the notification forms and a list of
owner         prepayment            notifications     on        its        website      at
http://www.hcd.ca.gov/hpd/hrc/tech/presrv/
Mark-Down to Market
When the Section 8 contracts expire in buildings with HUD mortgages or HUD mortgage
insurance, owners have to apply for annual renewals of the Section 8 contracts. At the

time of the initial renewal, HUD surveys market rents in the project area and adjusts
building rents accordingly. In projects where contract rents are above market rates in
the area the owner is likely to have very large mortgage payments. HUD will bring the
rents to within 110% or 120% of the market rents by restructuring the mortgage.
Owners of these buildings will probably want to sell or restructure; if the rents are
considerably above the market, there won’t be any incentive to convert to market rates.
Mark-Up To Market
In buildings where HUD’s renewal market study shows that rents are below market
rates, HUD will probably raise the contract rents.     Nevertheless, owners of these
buildings are the most likely to convert to market rates and, if they have Section 236
financing, to prepay their mortgages. However, the ability to prepay the HUD mortgage
depends on whether market rents in the area are high enough to refinance the
mortgage and pay for whatever renovations are necessary in a 20 or 30-year old
building.

2.      Assisted Housing Developments at Risk of Converting to Market Rates
Bond Financed Units and Subsidized Mobile Home Spaces
None of the locally financed units listed in Tables H-23 will lose their affordability
restrictions during the next ten years. The seven properties with a combined 883 units
of which 403 are affordable to households earning 80% or less of median income (low
and moderate income) are financed with mortgage revenue bonds that come due
between 2023 and 2035. In four of the properties, those that are owned by National
Community Renaissance, there are 282 units reserved for families earning 50% or less
of median income.
One of the seven mortgage revenue bond projects, Manzanita Villas, had a bond due
date of 2007 but in 2001 the bond was renewed until 2035. The 157 mobile home park
spaces in Table H-24 that are affordable to very low and low-income households were
financed with tax-exempt bonds that are not due until 2027. These spaces are in three
mobile home parks owned by the Palmdale Housing Authority.
Federally Subsidized Units at Risk
Table H-25 is a list of rental properties in Palmdale with federal subsidies. All of the
projects maintain affordability with annually renewing Section 8 Project Based contracts.
Of the eight multifamily properties and 17 scattered-site single-family homes in Table H-
25, six multifamily properties with 366 units and all 17 scattered site homes are at high
risk of converting to market rates in the next ten years. Together, these projects provide
383 units affordable to households with very low and low incomes. Two properties are
not at risk in the next 10 years. Palmdale East Q was purchased as a tax-credit project
but also retained the Section 8 contract. East 35th Street Apartments, owned by
Goldrich and Kest, has a long-term Section 8 contract that does not expire until 2025.
One eight-unit property, Queen’s Twelve, has been sold. The same group owns the
Stanridge homes and intends to sell all 17 houses at the earliest opportunity. According
to the owner, all tenants will receive Section 8 vouchers when the property changes
hands. The property is not listed on the State’s prepayment notification list although it is
subject to the State’s notification requirements.
During the last Housing Element period, two properties were purchased with
conventional finance and are now maintaining affordability with year-to-year Section 8
contracts. Two other properties, both owned by Eugene Berger Management still have
Section 236 (J) finance along with annually renewing Section 8 contracts. Berger’s third
property has only a Section 8 contract. Berger Management filed 12 month and six
month notices for both its Palmdale Park and Palmdalia Apartments properties. A sale
agreement between the current owner of Palmdalia Apartments and Roem Corporation

is schedule to close in March or April 2012. According to the realtor, the new owners
intend to continue to the Section 8 project-based contract.
Section 8 Fair Market rents in 2008 compare very favorably with market rents in the
Palmdale area. If the rents provided by the project-based contracts are similar to the
fair market rents then it is likely that owners of units with project-based Section 8 will
continue to renew their Section 8 contracts.

If the owners decide not to renew the Section 8 contract, the tenants will all receive
Section 8 housing choice vouchers. The vouchers are portable and area rents are
within Section 8 guidelines so it’s very likely that tenants with vouchers would be able to
rent a house or another apartment.
3.      Cost and Resources for Replacement or Preservation
Replacement Cost
Replacement costs are provided in Table H-27. These costs range between $273,873
per unit and $274,959 per unit depending on whether the financing relies on 9% or 4%
tax credits. In total the cost to replace the 383 at-risk units in Palmdale would be
between $105.3 and $104.9 million. Although projects with affordable units would be
eligible for a density bonus and parking reductions, because land costs are low, the
increased density will only make a small difference—about $2,000 per unit—in the total
cost.
9
  Table H-18 shows that average and median market rents in 2012 are somewhat lower than those in
2008 for one-bedroom and three-bedroom units and nearly the same for two-bedroom units.

Housing
Sources
Sources of finance for replacing the 383 units at risk in Palmdale are 9% or 4% tax
credit equity investment, local equity from the Palmdale Community Redevelopment
Agency Housing Set-Aside Fund10 or another source to be identified, grants from the
State’s Multifamily Housing Program (MHP) and a conventional low interest mortgage
from a bank that makes community reinvestment loans. Tax credit and State MHP
applications are competitive, and developers in Palmdale have successfully applied for
tax credits in the past few years. According to its 2005-2009 Implementation Plan-
Midpoint Review issued in November 2007, Palmdale’s Redevelopment Agency is
obligated to spend $57.9 million on low and moderate-income housing by 2014. The
Agency estimates that it will have $77.7 million available in its Housing Set-Aside fund
between 2007 and 2014. The status of Redevelopment Set-Aside funds and obligations
is undetermined as of February 2012.

   The California legislature abolished all redevelopment agencies effective February 1, 2012. Funds
from those agencies, with the exception of monies already contractually committed, will be shifted to the
state's budget. Cities were allowed to identify successor agencies to manage any existing assets and
carry out existing contractual obligations such as contracts for construction of affordable housing as
reviewed and approved by the County Auditor-Controller. The City of Palmdale has designated the City
Council as the successor agency to the Community Redevelopment Agency. As of February 2012, many
issues arising from the dissolution of the redevelopment agencies remain unresolved including future
sources of funds for affordable housing.

Cost of Purchase
If the owners of the six buildings at high risk decide to sell, these units might sell for
between $89,000 and $114,000 per unit, depending on condition.11 At $89,999 per unit,
the cost to purchase the units would be $34.08 million. At $114,000 per unit, the cost
would be $43.66 million. However, the units probably need rehabilitation. Rehabilitation
costs for projects with 4% tax credits are estimated at $25,000 per unit. Adding $25,000
puts the price range between $114,000 and $139,000 and the total cost for 383 units
between $43.66 million and $139,000 per unit. The cost to purchase and rehabilitate
383 units would therefore be between $43.66 million and $53.24 million.
Sources for Purchase
Purchase of the six at-risk buildings and the 17 scattered site homes could be carried
out with a combination of a conventional mortgage financed by the rents from the year
to year Project Based Section 8 contract and a 25% equity investment from Palmdale’s
Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside fund. One of the buildings has already been
purchased by a private owner using private equity, conventional finance and the Section
8 contract.

Housing
2011 was $111,000. (See Housing Characteristics Table H-19B, Home Sales in
Palmdale December 2011 above). If all 17 houses were sold now at 2011 prices, the
cost would be $1,887,000.
4.      Organizational Resources for Preservation or Replacement
Public Agencies and Nonprofit Corporations
Federal and state law require that when owners of buildings with expiring federal
subsidies decide to sell those buildings, they must offer the right of first refusal to
nonprofit corporations capable of operating multifamily housing.               Palmdale Park
Apartments has already filed a third prepayment notice but has not yet indicated any
interest in selling.
There are no nonprofit housing development corporations located in Palmdale.
However, National Community Renaissance now owns and operates four multifamily
buildings in Palmdale that were purchased and rehabilitated with loans from the City’s
Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside fund. Table H-29 provides a list of nonprofit entities
in Southern California that are interested in the right of first refusal program.

F.      ENERGY AND WATER CONSERVATION
In response to State mandates and local concerns for resource conservation, the City
has taken a number of steps to ensure that energy and water conservation are
considered in approvals of new residential development. In the General Plan, the City
has adopted wide-ranging policies to encourage environmentally responsible
development (Environmental Resources Element).
In 2011, the City adopted a climate action plan, called the Palmdale Energy Action Plan,
identifying how the City will use energy efficiency, independence and conservation to
achieve a greenhouse gas emission reduction targets of 15% by the year 2020 and
reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2035. Measures identified include: encouraging
new development to exceed Title 24 Energy Use Requirements by 15%, energy
efficiency improvements in the City’s housing stock through programs such as California
Energy Upgrade and smart meters, encouraging residential on-site renewable energy
sources such as solar, promote accessible housing near transit and services.
Conserve Palmdale is a series of videos created by the City to provide information on
various conservation programs available to the community. Conserve Palmdale is
available on the City’s website and is also shown on the City’s local television station,
Palmdale 27, and covers topics such as water conservation, recycling, transportation
options, used oils and greases and the Energy Upgrade California program

Housing
Water Conservation
The City of Palmdale addresses energy conservation in new housing through the
provisions of Title 24 of the California Building Code. In accordance with California
Government Code Section 65591, the Water Conservation and Landscaping Act, the
City has a Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance (Ordinance No. 1262, adopted October
2008) that includes a point system for water conservation techniques.
These techniques include:
•     No turf is permitted in any single-family residential front yard and is permitted only
      in designated active recreational areas in multifamily projects
•     No turf is permitted on commercial or industrial projects, except in designated
      recreational areas
•     Decorative water features must use recirculating water
•     Use of low water use plant material that does not exceed the Maximum Applied
      Water Allowance
•     Plants grouped in hydrozones (by water requirements)
•     Soil management plan (laboratory soil analysis, on-site assessment including
      identification of amendment needed
•     A minimum 2-inch layer of mulch on all shrub and ground cover areas
•     Climatic conditions considered in plant selection (i.e. north vs. south facing slopes,
      wind conditions, shading requirements)
•     All projects must utilize an active evapotranspiration (ET)-based irrigation
      controller
Each project must provide a water budget calculation worksheet that includes:
•     Irrigation system design and efficiency
•     Automatic ET-based controller (commercial grade or designed for homeowners)
•     Water supply type (reclaimed or recycled water, potable, blended or gray water).
•     Compliance with Maximum Applied Water Allowance
•     Slope factors and climatic conditions considered in design
•     Hydrozone information
The City also has a Landscape Ordinance and lists of approved plants and trees. The
water and landscape ordinances and the approved plant and tree lists are published on
the City’s website
Energy and water provisions of proposed new development are reviewed as part of the
landscape plan review. The water conservation ordinance is applicable for City and
private development projects requiring a permit, plan check or design review. It also
applies to all new single families residences, and any property that has a recorded
Declaration of Substandard Property due to landscape deficiencies.

In 2009, the City of Palmdale became the retail recycled water supplier for that portion
of the City of Palmdale not served by Los Angeles County Waterworks, District No. 40.
The Recycled Water section is sanctioned to install and maintain the backbone and
distribution system for the City's recycled water region to provide recycled water to city
facilities such as parks and landscape maintenance districts. The City's goal is to
provide 2,000 acre-feet of water to city facilities and schools upon build out of the
recycled water system and to reduce the City's dependence on imported water as
mandated by the State. Any increase in the utilization of recycled water will result in
more potable water available for residential development. This is significant for the City
as adjudication of the water basin is currently being undertaken.
Programs for Existing Development
The City of Palmdale currently offers the following program for enhancing the water
efficiency of existing residential structures:
•   EPA WaterSense
    The City of Palmdale is committed to protecting the future of our national and local
    water supply through water-efficient practices, products, and services. That is why
    the City is partnering with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to
    implement WaterSense, a national program that offers people a simple way to make
    product choices that use less water-and perform as well or better than your existing
    products.
Energy Conservation
Recommended or required construction methods for energy and water conservation
include the following:
•   All windows double glazed
•   Increase south facing glazing
•   Reduce west facing glazing
•   Landscape to shade windows
•   Deciduous plants for winter solar gain/summer shade
•   Roof overhangs on southerly windows

Programs for Existing Development
The City of Palmdale currently offers the following programs for enhancing the energy
efficiency of existing residential structures:
•   AB 811
    In Partnership with the County of Los Angeles, the City of Palmdale is participating
    in the development of a program to use Assembly Bill 811 funds for a program that
    would provide energy audits, energy efficiency upgrades as well as installation of
    photovoltaic solar power systems on residential units for little or no out-of-pocket
    cost to the property owner.
•   Energy Upgrade California in Los Angeles Program
    Energy Upgrade California is designed for home improvement projects that lower
    energy use, conserve water and natural resources, and make homes healthier and
    more comfortable. Program participants receive an assessment of their homes'
    energy use and specific recommendations to make their homes more energy
    efficient. Assistance from Specially Trained Contractors will ensure the highest level
    of service from nationally recognized home performance and green building
    organizations. In 2012, the City will hold 7 workshops where the public could learn
    more about the program.
Community-Based Energy Conservation Programs
The State of California funds a free weatherization program for low-income households
throughout the state with services provided by agencies that contract with The Gas
Company. Maravilla Foundation, with an office in Lancaster, is the weatherization
provider for residents in the Antelope Valley. Weatherization services can include attic
insulation, water heater blankets, weather stripping for doors, window caulking, faucet
aerators and low-flow showerheads. The Gas Company provides furnace repair for
low-income homeowners if the furnace is hazardous or inoperative.
On its website, the Southern California Gas Company, which provides services to
Palmdale residential and commercial customers, offers a number of programs aimed at
increasing energy efficiency. These include an energy and efficiency online survey and
residential rebates for upgrading to energy efficient appliances or making energy
efficient home improvements. Rebates are also available to owners of multi-family
properties if they install certain energy efficient systems. Incentives for building new
homes that exceed California Title 24 by 15% are offered to residential and commercial
builders. Southern California Gas Company’s website is www.socalgas.com.
Southern California Edison (SCE) offers a wide variety of energy conservation
programs. These programs include information on energy efficiency including free
home energy audits online. SCE offers rebates on energy efficient appliances and has

sources and sustainable development practices.
Residences in the City of Palmdale are served two primary water purveyors; Palmdale
Water District and Los Angeles County Waterworks District No. 40. Both water
purveyors have conservation information on their websites and urge customers to
conserve water. Palmdale Water District offers a cash rebate for the installation of water
efficient appliances and fixtures, smart controllers and a ‘cash for grass’ program.

Housing
IV.     SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
Government Code Section 65583(a)(7) requires “An analysis of any special housing
needs, such as those of the elderly, persons with disabilities, large families,
farmworkers, families with female heads of households and families and persons in
need of emergency shelter.”
A.      Female-Headed Households
Need
Female-headed households are identified as special needs households by California
Housing Element law. A study published by the Public Policy Institute of California in
2006 found that while the cost adjusted poverty rate in California is 20%, single-mother
families have a poverty rate of 37%.12 Single mothers are often impoverished because
child support payments are either never made or fail to compensate the real costs of
raising children, including childcare, and because women often earn lower wages than
men, particularly if they work part-time or have been out of the workforce.
In 2010 there were 4,784 female-headed families with children under age 18 in
Palmdale of which 45% (2,161) were living below the poverty level. They made up
23.4% of all Palmdale families with children. In the County as a whole there are
371,889 female-headed households with children who constitute 26.8% of all County
households with children. The proportion of female-head households in poverty is lower
countywide with 35.7% living below the poverty level.
Impoverished female-head Palmdale families with children are likely to need subsidized
housing. Those without subsidized housing could be at risk of becoming homeless.
Domestic violence is one of the factors that leads to homelessness for women and
children who often must leave home in order to be safe from a battering spouse or
domestic partner.
Palmdale’s female–headed households with adequate incomes do not have special
housing problems that need attention. However, female-headed households living on
the CalWORKs monthly income of $648 (plus about $200 for CalFresh, formerly the
food stamp program) for a family of three or earning minimum wage of $8.00 per hour
($16,640 per year) have incomes below the poverty level. Without a Section 8 voucher
or another type of subsidized housing, these families will have serious problems with
housing costs.

Table H-18, Market Rents in Palmdale shows average and median rents for apartments
and houses in Palmdale in February 2012. A one-bedroom rents for between $650 and
$775 while a two-bedroom is between $775 and $1,295. A CalWorks family of three
would have to pay more than 100% of income for housing. Clearly, this is impossible.
In addition, very low-income households sometimes find it difficult to rent an available
unit because the family does not have the funds to provide a security deposit or is not
considered an acceptable tenant. Many property managers require tenants to have
incomes that are three times the rent. Almost no one will rent to a family with a prior
eviction or with credit problems that might have arisen from a divorce, job loss or
foreclosure. So Palmdale’s extremely low-income households need a voucher or an
apartment with state or federal subsidies in order to afford even the lowest price
apartment and may have to share housing.
Resources and Solutions
There are 1,406 Section 8 vouchers in use in Palmdale. There are 3,746 Palmdale
residents on the Section 8 waiting list of the Housing Authority of the County of Los
Angeles. According to Housing Authority staff, the agency has 21,900 Section 8
Vouchers and a waiting list of 200,000 County residents.
There are 1,111 family units in Palmdale with federal or local subsidies. These
subsidized units are a substantial resource for Palmdale’s lowest income households,
but are not enough to meet the need for very low cost housing.
Conversations with staff in several different organizations including social service,
schools, and real estate agents, indicate that some homeowners and very low-income
individuals and families are coping with high housing costs by renting rooms in private
homes, very much like lodgers in a previous era. This helps the homeowner with
mortgage payments and provides an affordable, if cramped place to live for an
individual or family with limited income.
Domestic Violence Programs
The Antelope Valley Domestic Violence Center operates the walk-in Homeless
Solutions Access Center in Lancaster and an emergency housing program located in or
near Palmdale (location information for domestic violence shelters is confidential.) Table
H-36 provides information on this and other homeless services and housing programs in
the Antelope Valley.

Housing
B.     Large Households
Need
Large households are defined as those with five or more members. Table H-30 below
shows that in 2010 31.2% of all owner-occupied households and 22.9% of all renter-
occupied households had five or more persons. Overall, 23.3% of all Palmdale
households had five or more persons. The housing stock in 2010 was well suited to
large households. According to ACS Table B25042, Tenure by Bedrooms, 93% of
owner-occupied units and 57% of renter-occupied units had three or more bedrooms. In
fact, 21.3% of the renter-occupied units in Palmdale are single-family homes. The
remaining rental housing stock had zero, one or two bedrooms.

      Source: 2010 ACS
Table H-12 in the Section on Extremely Low-Income shows that in 2000 among large
households earning 30% or less of median income 67.4% of the 645 large renter
households and 88% of the 335 large owner families were paying half or more of their
incomes for housing costs. Additional data from the 2000 CHAS Databook show that
among large households earning between 31% and 50% of median income, 36.4% of
renters and 32.1% of owners were paying 50% or more of income for housing.
Table H-17, Market Rents, shows that there are some three-bedroom houses in
Palmdale that rent for as little as $795 per month and the median price for units
advertised over three days in February 2012 is $1,221. However, such units may be
rare and it is likely that large families with low incomes will have a difficult time finding
affordable homes to rent. The 2010 ACS found that overcrowding was more frequent
among Palmdale renters than owners with 6.4% of Palmdale’s owner-occupied units
overcrowded and another 0.7% very overcrowded, while 10.5% of tenant households
overcrowded and another 4.8% severely overcrowded.

Resources and Solutions
As noted above under Needs, Palmdale’s housing stock in 2010 was well suited to large
households. According to ACS Table B25042, Tenure by Bedrooms, 93% of owner-
occupied units and 57% of renter-occupied units had three or more bedrooms.
Furthermore, Table 17, Market Rents, shows that the median rent for three-bedroom
homes is affordable to very low-income large families and four and even five bedrooms
homes are affordable to low-income families. However large families earning 30% or
less of median income need subsidized housing. One 200-unit affordable development
with 100 three–bedroom apartments were constructed in 2000 and two subsidized
family developments have been built since 2006, one with 48 units for low-income
families units and one with 49 units for low-income families. In February 2012,
construction began on 277 units for low and very low-income families in the City’s
Transit Village area. A second 70-unit family project with 15 very low and 54 low-
income units was approved but never built.
The City of Palmdale’s Community Redevelopment Agency noted the need to change
the focus of its housing set-aside expenditures to family housing in its 2005 - 2009
Implementation Plan Midpoint Review. On page 40-41, the Agency notes that it is
“required to expend over the duration of each Implementation Plan, L/M housing funds
to assist persons regardless of age in at least the same proportion as the population
under 65 years of age bears to the total population.” In Palmdale, 93.4% of the
population is under age 65 and only 6.6% is age 65 or older. The Agency notes on
page 41 that “because the Project Areas were established before December 31, 1993,
the Agency will have an additional five years (until December 31, 2014) to satisfy the
proportionality requirement.”
The continued applicability of the Redevelopment Agency’s Implementation Plan cannot
be determined, as all Community Redevelopment Agencies (CRA) have been
disbanded by the State as of February 1, 2012. If, when, and how much of Palmdale’s
remaining affordable housing funds will be available for expenditure by the CRA’s
successor, the Palmdale City Council acting in its capacity as the Successor Agency to
the Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Palmdale, and what plans or
regulations will govern the use of such funds remains to be determined.

C.      Elderly
Need
In 2010 the Census counted 9,837 persons age 65 and older in Palmdale who together
comprised 6.6% of the population (see Table H-5). The proportion of persons in this
age group increased by 17.8% but the number of persons age 65 and older increased
by 50.8% with an increase of 64.6% in the number aged 75 and older. The increase in
older persons was much larger than that of the City as a whole, which grew by 30.9%
between 2000 and 2010.
In 2010, more than one third (34.2%) of the population age 65 and older had at least
one disability.
In 2010, most (71.8%) Palmdale households headed by a person 65 or older were
homeowners; only 28.7% of households headed by a person 65 or older were renters.
According to the 2008-2010 ACS 3-year estimates, median household income for
householders age 65 and older was $27,101, considerably less than the citywide
median of $53,048. However, the income data for those over 65 has an error potential
of +/- $3,108 so should be viewed with a degree of caution. Data from the ACS show
only 576 Palmdale households with a household head age 65 or older living below the
federal poverty level; however, the error potential for this small number is very high.
Data from the 2008-2010 ACS 3-year estimates show that 57.3% of Palmdale’s 3,895
householders age 65 and older pay less than 35% of income while 43.7% of older
homeowners are paying 35% or more of income for rent. Although people in this age
group are often considered more capable of paying high housing costs, increasing costs
of transportation, utilities, medical care and other basic needs could put severe strains
on the fixed incomes of older householders.
As Palmdale residents continue to age they may become disabled and need help with
tasks such as grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, yard work, and simple household
repairs. Table H-34, Disability by Type shows that 11.7% of persons age 65 and older
have a disability that affects self-care. It often isn’t possible to depend on children or
other relatives for this assistance and paid household help is expensive for those on
fixed incomes. Transportation may also become a problem for the frail elderly who
have to give up driving due to eyesight or other factors. The community needs to plan
for both home-based assistance and assisted living facilities for its aging population.
Table H-31 shows housing cost burden by income level for elderly households in
Palmdale in 2000. Most elderly renter households earning 50% or less of median
income were paying more than 30% of their incomes for rent and a significant
proportion were paying more than half their income for rent. The proportion with high

cost burden is lower among those earning between 50% and 80% of median income.
Similar data based on the 2010 Census were not available for this analysis. However,
economic changes since 2008 may have adversely affected the income of households
on fixed incomes while during the same period costs for food, medical care, utilities,
gasoline and insurance all rose. Data on housing cost burden clearly indicate a need for
subsidized housing in Palmdale to meet the needs of households earning less than 50%
of median income.

Table H-32 lists housing limited to senior occupancy in Palmdale. There are eight
existing projects with 675 units. An additional two projects with 142 units have been
approved but not yet built.
Despite the data above      on cost burden, only 92 or 12.3% of the senior units are
affordable to households    earning 50% or less of median income. Another 47.1% are
affordable to households    earning between 51% and 80% of median income while the
balance are designed for    moderate income households earning up to 120% of median
income.

Since 2005, nearly all affordable housing developments constructed or approved have
been senior housing. The number of senior units now is equal to 58.2% of all renter
households occupied by a householder age 65 or older according to the 2010 ACS (see
Table H-5). However, very few senior units, only 11%, are reserved for the lowest
income seniors, although these are the households most likely to need a housing
subsidy.
In addition to senior rental housing, there are 22 four to six-bed residential care homes
serving the elderly. Together these 22 facilities provide 111 beds for elderly persons
who need assisted living. Additionally, one 118 unit assisted living facility opened in
2008 and a 268 bed continuum of care facility (204 beds in assisted and senior living,
40 beds in skilled nursing and 24 beds in memory care) was approved in 2009.

D.      Disabled
Need
According to the 2010 ACS 13,352 people or 8.7% of Palmdale’s population have at
least one disabling condition, some have several. Table H-33 shows the distribution of
disabilities by age while Table H-34 shows the distribution by age and type of disability.
Because there are many different types of disabilities, it is not possible to address the
housing needs of disabled persons with a single program type. Among persons who
receive some kind of disability income are those with developmental disabilities, chronic
mental illness and sensory and physical handicaps ranging from blindness to
quadriplegia. Some persons with disabilities work and simply need reasonable
accommodation such as wheelchair ramps for their housing. Others need supportive
housing programs in order to live independently. Still others need group homes with 24-
hour staff.      Group homes are usually four to six-bed facilities in residential
neighborhoods with 24-hour staff. There are a number of these homes in Palmdale.
The chief types of housing problems for disabled persons are likely to be:
     Cost for those receiving disability income such as Supplemental Security Income or
     who are retired and living on Social Security. Because there is such a limited
     supply of low-cost rental housing in Palmdale, disabled persons with very low
     incomes will have difficulty finding housing they can afford.
     Assistance with activities of daily living. Although many disabled persons can live
     independently, some disabled persons, particularly those with physical disabilities
     may require help with tasks of daily living. This type of help is costly, and may
     create a barrier to independent living for those with very low incomes.
It was not possible to obtain an estimate of how many disabled persons in Palmdale
need housing assistance. The Palmdale Discovery Resource Center, a client-run center
for mentally ill persons served 94 individuals in 2010-2011. These clients were not
homeless but may need affordable housing in order to remain independent.
Developmental Disabilities
In 2012 the North Los Angeles County Regional Center (NLACRC), which provides life-
long services to persons born with developmental disabilities, had 1,829 clients (whom
they call consumers) in the City of Palmdale. Among these consumers were 840 adults
and 989 children.

Disabled persons with low fixed incomes face the same affordability problems as other
extremely low-income households in Palmdale. Their incomes are so low that the price
of a one-bedroom apartment can absorb three-quarters or more of their income. As an
example, the Supplemental Security Income benefit for developmentally disabled
individuals is $859 per month.

According to NLACRC, there are 24 small family homes in Palmdale licensed by the
Department of Social Services to provide housing and care for NLACRC consumers.
These homes include 18 homes for adults with a total capacity of 88, and six homes for
children, with a total capacity of 24. Capacity of adult homes varies from two to six,
while children’s homes are limited to a maximum capacity of four.
The Independent Living Center located in Lancaster helps disabled clients find housing.
Accessibility is an issue for disabled persons in wheelchairs as well as for those with
other types of motor disabilities. Although many accessibility adaptations can be made
in compliance with development standards set by zoning codes, sometimes owners of
existing properties require a reasonable accommodation that allows them to install
handicapped ramps or other types of adaptations that might otherwise not conform to
City standards. State law requires cities to provide a process that property owners can
use to request a reasonable accommodation and Palmdale has amended its Zoning
Ordinance to provide that process.
The City’s Emergency Grant Program can be used to make the homes of disabled low-
income homeowners more accessible. It would be helpful if the City, through its website
and in information provided by its Fair Housing Contractor, made information on the
rules regarding reasonable accommodation available to tenants and to rental property
owners.

The 2011 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count13 conducted a one-night survey to
collect data on the number of homeless persons in the County at a point in time. The
2011 Homeless Count Report also provided an estimate for the number of persons
homeless over the period of a year. In 2011 there were 51,340 homeless persons on a
single night and an estimated 120,070 over the course of a year or about 2.3 times the
one-time count. In the Antelope Valley, the homeless count found 1,412 homeless
persons on the night of the count of whom 889 (63%) were single adults and 517 (37%)
were family members. Using the multiplier of 2.3 an estimate of about 3,247 homeless
persons over the course of year can be calculated. While the Antelope Valley had the
smallest number of homeless persons among the eight Service Planning Areas (SPAs)
in Los Angeles County, it had the highest proportion of homeless family members.
Table H-35 shows the distribution of key subpopulations among homeless persons in
the Antelope Valley.14
When compared with the other SPAs, the homeless population of Antelope Valley had
the second highest proportion of survivors of domestic violence, the second lowest
proportion of mentally ill and the smallest proportion of veterans.

According to Diane Grooms, former manager of the Access Center in Lancaster and in
2012 Chief of Community Development for the Antelope Valley Domestic Violence
Center as well as Program Manager for the Strengthening Homeless Mothers Initiative,
there are a number of homeless encampments in unincorporated areas of the Antelope
Valley. According to Ms. Grooms, a number of homeless people who are mentally ill
live in these encampments.16 It is likely that some of the 209 people identified as
chronically homeless in the 2011 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count are
encampment residents.
Palmdale does not have an emergency shelter or any transitional housing programs.
Homeless families and individuals have to call 211 to obtain motel vouchers for a night
or weekend and then must to go to the Homeless Solutions Access Center in Lancaster
to obtain assistance with additional motel vouchers, and/or placement in emergency,
transitional or permanent housing, as well as case management to obtain supportive
services, help applying for public benefits and a range of other needs. There is an
emergency shelter in Lancaster, the Lancaster Community Shelter, operated by Grace
Resource Center.
In 2011 the Homeless Solutions Access Center provided services and shelter referrals
to 635 individuals and 394 families with 1,460 family members. The Access Center also
provided residency information from their records. In 2011, the Access Center provided
services and shelter referrals to 43 individuals and families who were Palmdale
residents. According to Patty Rivetti, Chief of Community Services for AVDVC and
Program Manager of the Homeless Access Center, about three quarters of homeless
individuals and families who come to the Center are from the local area (Palmdale,
Lancaster, other Antelope Valley locations).
The City of Palmdale funds and operates the South Antelope Valley Emergency
Services program (SAVES), which provides a food bank, motel vouchers and clothing
distribution for extremely low-income and homeless individuals and families and makes
referrals to 211 and the homeless services available in the City of Lancaster. SAVES
does not keep records of the number of inquiries, requests for assistance or referrals
provided to homeless families and individuals.
The Antelope Valley office of Mental Health America (MHA) reports that it served 562
homeless mentally ill persons in 2010-2011 including 42 homeless veterans. The
director of MHA Antelope Valley pointed out that although there are small board and
care facilities licensed to serve mentally ill adults, there is no transitional housing for
homeless mentally ill persons so homeless clients of MHA have to be accommodated in
sober living or board and care facilities while searching for affordable permanent
housing.

Housing
The Antelope Valley Domestic Violence Center (AVDVC) operates the Homeless
Solutions Access Center in Lancaster, California. The Access Center provides case
management, supportive services, shelter and permanent housing placement and a
wide variety of other services for homeless individuals and families. AVDVC also
operates a 60-day emergency shelter and two transitional housing programs for victims
of domestic violence.
The foreclosure crisis in recent years created a new type of homelessness: tenants
who became homeless instantly when the houses they were renting were foreclosed
and the locks are changed. Apparently, many renters don’t know that their rented
homes are in foreclosure. In foreclosures, evicted tenants don’t just lose their housing
but also their deposits. Evictions without notice are illegal under California law, which
requires that renters receive 60 days notice of eviction if they have lived in a property for
more than a year and 30 days if less than a year. The federal "Protecting Tenants at
Foreclosure Act of 2009" is more generous, requiring 90 days notice for month-to-month
tenants and providing that tenants with leases can stay at least until the end of a lease.
Buyers who intend to live on the property are exempted from the lease provision and
may terminate a lease with 90 days notice. The federal legislation does not pre-empt
state laws that are more generous to tenants. These protections also apply to Section 8
tenants.17
Resources and Solutions
Services for homeless individuals and families in Los Angeles County are organized in a
“continuum of care” a planning strategy developed by HUD and implemented as a
condition of receiving funding from federal McKinney-Vento funds. In Los Angeles
County agencies obtain these funds through applications to the Los Angeles Homeless
Services Authority (LAHSA). HUD defines a continuum of care plan as “a community
plan to organize and deliver housing and services to meet the specific needs of people
who are homeless as they move to stable housing and maximum self-sufficiency.”
Although the Antelope Valley is only one of eight Service Planning Areas (SPAs) in Los
Angeles County, it is a two-hour drive from the major centers of service provision in the
City of Los Angeles and other major cities such as Pasadena and Long Beach and has
had to organize its own continuum of care. This includes emergency shelter,
transitional housing, supportive services and case management along with motel
vouchers, and a range of special housing and services for the mentally ill, victims of
domestic violence, and emancipated foster youth. Table H-36 below provides
information on programs that provide emergency and transitional facilities and
supportive services for homeless individuals and families in the Antelope Valley.

Emergency shelter for adult men and women and for families is provided at the
Lancaster Community Shelter, operated by Grace Resource Center and located in the
City of Lancaster. The Lancaster Shelter is the only emergency shelter in the Antelope
Valley serving the general population of homeless single adults and families. This all-
year emergency shelter facility can accommodate about 40 people during the non-
winter months. It has two rooms for men with 24 cots total and one room for women
with 16 cots. In the winter months cots can be set up in the dining room so that the
shelter can house up to 120 persons each night. The Antelope Valley Domestic
Violence Council (AVDVC) operates a 56-bed emergency shelter for victims of domestic
violence. The location of this shelter is confidential.
Motel vouchers are an important resource for emergency shelter. Homeless persons
throughout Los Angeles County have to call 211 to obtain a motel voucher for a single
night or over a weekend. In order to obtain additional vouchers, the recipient must meet
with an Access Center case manager; in the Antelope Valley this is the Homeless
Solutions Access Center.
The Homeless Solutions Access Center, located on Sierra Highway in Lancaster, next
door to the Lancaster Community Shelter, provides case management, service
referrals, motel vouchers, and placement in transitional and permanent housing.
The Access Center, which is operated by the Antelope Valley Domestic Violence
Council (AVDVC), has improved coordination and continuity of services to homeless
persons in the Antelope Valley. A number of the principal components of this system
are located along a single arterial, Sierra Highway, which connects Palmdale and
Lancaster. This approximately 15-mile stretch of roadway is served by bus, allowing
referrals from SAVES to the Department of Public Social Services, the Access Center
and the Lancaster Emergency Shelter in Lancaster. However, according to AVDVC
staff, transportation can be a significant barrier for homeless and very low-income
individuals and families without cars whose travel to Lancaster for services means a trip
that may require a long walk to bus stops and an hour and a half or more of travel time
in each direction. The City of Palmdale has offered space within the SAVES building to
the Access Center, so that staff from may process clients from the Palmdale area
without the need for travel to Lancaster.
The City of Palmdale operates an emergency food and service referral program called
SAVES. There are no emergency shelters, or transitional housing programs in
Palmdale.
Transitional Housing
Grace Resource Center is developing a transitional housing for up to 10 families in an
adjacent facility that has two-room units with an attached bathroom that can
accommodate up to six family members. AVDVC operates two transitional housing

Resources to help homeless individuals and families in the Antelope Valley have
increased considerably since 2006 but barriers to finding permanent housing for
homeless individuals and families remain. According to a staff member at the Access
Center, it is difficult for homeless persons to accumulate the security deposit needed for
permanent housing and there are few rental units affordable to extremely low-income
households (an individual with $17,750 or less per year or a three-person family with
$22,800 per year). In 2011, 37% of the 1,412 homeless persons surveyed on a single
night by the Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count were members of homeless families.

Homeless heads of households are referred to the Department of Public Social Services
(DPSS) in Lancaster, 15 miles from the SAVES office, to apply for homeless assistance.
The benefits and services provided under the DPSS Housing Program are: temporary
shelter payments, additional temporary shelter payments, permanent housing
payments, moving assistance, assistance to prevent eviction, rental subsidy and

relocation assistance. Recipients can apply for these benefits only once in a lifetime
except under special circumstances such as a natural disaster or domestic violence.
DPSS also has a homeless program for general relief recipients. Unemployed adults
under the age of 62 who are not eligible for Social Security, Disability or Supplemental
Security Income may be eligible for general relief. A new program provides small rent
subsidies and move-in costs for eligible homeless general relief recipients.
The Palmdale Zoning Ordinance currently permits emergency shelters in the C-3
(General Commercial) and PF (Public Facilities) zones with an approved conditional use
permit. Since Senate Bill 2 requires cities to identify zoning designations where
emergency shelters are permitted by right, the City is preparing an amendment to the
Zoning Ordinance to permit emergency shelters within the R-3 (Multiple Residential)
and C-2 (Office Commercial) zones by right.
Permanent Housing for Homeless Families
Many homeless families and individuals may have no income at all or incomes at or
below the poverty level. While there are a number of subsidized family rental units in
Palmdale, these units rarely have vacancies. Without a Section 8 voucher to help pay
rent, families may only be able to afford to rent a single room in house. Reports from
staff members at several agencies suggest that a number of Palmdale homeowners are
taking in lodgers to make ends meet and that some families are living in rented rooms in
private homes. In February 2012, the Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles
reported that there are 3,746 Palmdale households on the waiting for the Section 8
Housing Choice Voucher program.
Rehousing homeless families and individuals in Palmdale is very difficult according to
staff at the Access Center. Not only do homeless families and individuals have
extremely low incomes, but they may also have poor credit histories or a record of
eviction. Property managers often require incomes that are three times the rent and
reject applicants with poor credit histories or records of eviction even if the evictions
were the result of actions by a spouse or domestic partner. While these are generally
sound property management practices, it is also important to house victims of domestic
violence and other homeless persons and families. Without a program for permanently
housing homeless families and individuals, there is no solution to the problem of
homelessness.
The Homeless Solutions Access Center reports that in 2011 a total of 53 families and
individuals were placed in permanent housing and 35 in transitional housing. However
it is not possible to determine whether any of these families were placed in Palmdale.

The 2010 American Community Survey counted 618 persons employed in agriculture,
forestry, fishing and hunting and mining in Palmdale in a wide variety of occupations.
The number of farmworkers currently residing in Palmdale cannot be estimated from
this information. The persons employed in agriculture and mining could have a variety
of occupations that include farm owners or managers, orchard consultants, mining
engineers, equipment operators, truck drivers and so on. Also, as there are seven
active mining operations within the City of Palmdale, the number of farm workers is
likely to be significantly lower than 618 persons.
Most farm work is seasonal and large numbers of farm workers are needed only during
the harvest. Some farmworkers migrate from area to area during the harvest season,
others are local residents who take other seasonal work or receive unemployment once
the harvests are finished. Farm work usually pays very low wages and farmworkers in
rural areas are often poorly housed, living in substandard dwellings in fields that are
sprayed with pesticides or in deteriorated migrant camps. Farmworkers who live in
Palmdale have the same housing needs as other very low-income families and
individuals and are likely to encounter the same barriers–there are not enough units
affordable to families or individuals earning minimum wage or less.
Resources and Solutions
An increase in the number of units affordable to households earning 30% or less of area
median income and an increase in the number of available Section 8 vouchers would
benefit Palmdale farmworkers and their families as well as other low-income Palmdale
families. Additionally, the City currently allows for second dwelling units through an
administrative review process, providing for additional opportunities to provide units
suitable for very-low and low income residential.

V.      PROJECTED HOUSING NEEDS
A.      Regional Housing Needs Assessment
Future Needs
California Housing Element Law requires regional councils of governments throughout
the State to periodically make projections of anticipated growth in employment and
population within the area they serve. Based on this projection, the councils calculate a
fair share of the need for new housing in each jurisdiction of their member counties. In
2007 the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) calculated the
Regional Housing Needs Assessment, (RHNA) for its five-county region, assigning a
portion of future housing units at four income levels to the City of Palmdale.
Government Code 65583(a)(3) requires local governments to identify sufficient land,
appropriately zoned, to accommodate the housing growth estimated by the regional
council of government.
Table H-37 shows Palmdale’s fair share of new housing construction for the 8 .5 years
between January 2006 and June 2014.

Area median income in Los Angeles County in 2012 according as determined by the
federal government is $64,800. According to guidelines published annually by HUD, in
Los Angeles County, a very low-income family of four is one that earns no more than
$42,150 while a low-income family of the same size earns up to $67,450.
When the planning period for the previous Housing Element began in 1998, new
housing construction in Palmdale was at its lowest point in many years. That year, only
374 new units were built. However, by the end of the planning period in 2005, housing
construction had more than tripled to 1,571 units and, while Palmdale did not construct
its entire 1998-2005 RHNA allocation of 9,878, it did build a total of 7,509 units.

However, the current housing crisis has brought new housing construction almost to a
standstill with developers putting holds on approved subdivisions. Monthly sales have
increased since 2008 but prices continue to fall. In November 2011, there were 2,958
Palmdale dwelling units in default, foreclosure or REO. Given these conditions, it is not
likely that Palmdale will be able to meet its new RHNA allocation, which nearly doubles
the previous allocation.

VI.     SITE INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS
A.      Methodology for Analyzing Vacant Land
The available vacant land sites were identified through the City of Palmdale Geographic
Information System (GIS). The Geographic Information Systems Division generated a
report and 3,851 vacant parcels were identified and inserted into a log by Assessor’s
Identification Number (AIN), Land Use, Zone, Allowable Density, Area in Acres, Area in
Square Feet, Existing use, with Realistic Units Capacity, Infrastructure Capacity and
On-site Constraints left blank. The log was sorted first by Zone and then by Land Use,
grouping together like land use and zones for ease of evaluation and tabulation. The
locations of existing sewer and water lines, topography, and fault areas were identified
in relation to each parcel.
Using the GIS system, Palmdale planning staff visually identified each parcel to
determine the realistic unit capacity, infrastructure capacity and on-site constraints.
Three hundred seventy two (372) vacant parcels were eliminated because the parcels
were identified as existing private road, landscape and water easements. The A-1, R-1,
R-2 and R-3 zones and varying densities within each zone were aggregated in two to
four categories including the number of acres, number of parcels, real capacity,
absence or presence of infrastructure, on-site constraints or no-onsite constraints. A
total of 11,498 acres of vacant land comprising 3,427 vacant parcels was identified as
available for residential uses. These vacant parcels provide capacity for construction of
30,223 dwelling units.
B.      Adequate Sites For All Income Levels
Palmdale has identified sites that will accommodate 30,223 dwelling units. The current
zoning of vacant parcels will allow Palmdale to easily meet its RHNA allocation of
10,667 units for moderate and above moderate-income households. However, in
February 2012, Palmdale has only 20 acres zoned for the higher densities required to
meet its low and very low-income housing need of 7,303 units. Palmdale’s Transit
Village Specific Plan area downtown provides approximately 10 acres zoned for
between 25 and 40 dwelling units per acre and approximately 10 acres zoned for up to
58 units per acre. These 20 acres will accommodate a total of 577 units; however, as
no building permits for these units have currently been issued, they are not being
counted toward constructed units.
Between 2006 and 2008, 382 units affordable to low and very low-income households
were constructed in Palmdale. These permanently affordable units can be subtracted
from the total number of sites that Palmdale must provide for the two lowest income
groups. Palmdale’s total obligation for sites zoned at a minimum 30 dwelling units per
acre is therefore 6,921 units. In order to provide sites for the 6,921 units, Palmdale will
have to amend its Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map to rezone approximately 188

acres of vacant land in the central areas of the City and establish zoning standards for
housing developed at that density.
Adequate Sites Analysis
California Government Code Section 65883(a)(3) requires that Housing Elements
include an inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites
and sites having the potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the zoning and
infrastructure available to serve these sites. This inventory is used to identify sites that
can be feasibly developed for housing within the planning period in order to meet the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). This section of the Housing Element
contains the required inventory of adequate sites for new housing that can be
developed to meet the City’s housing needs within the planning period.
As noted above, the planning period for this Housing Element update is the period from
January 1, 2006 through June 30, 2014. At the time this Housing Element update was
prepared, some of the new housing units required during this planning period by the
RHNA had already been constructed. Table H-38 summarizes the City’s RHNA
numbers, the units that have already been constructed, and the remaining housing units
that must be accommodated in the suitable sites analysis through the end of the
planning period. Table H-39 summarizes units completed between 2006 and 2012 and
provides detail as to the affordability covenants associated with each project.
     Table H-38 - City of Palmdale RHNA and Completed Units as of 12/31/2011

Based on this table, the City’s General Plan Land Use map must indicate that at least
14,421 new dwelling units may be feasibly developed through year 2014, based on site
conditions and availability of public services and infrastructure.

Available Land Inventory for Housing within the City of Palmdale
In evaluating sites suitable for new housing units, potential development constraints
such as slopes, ridgelines, fault and flood hazards, environmental resources, access,
availability of infrastructure, and other property characteristics were evaluated to ensure
that each site could feasibly support the number of potential dwelling units allocated to
it. Potential residential sites include vacant and underutilized land that is currently
zoned for residential uses, and land within existing specific plans that are currently
designated for residential uses.
The number of units associated with each parcel was based on the minimum permitted
density within the existing or proposed new underlying zone. Typical construction

densities within the City are approximately 80% of the maximum permitted density.
Where units are to be developed under a density bonus agreement, the maximum
number of permitted units may be up to 80% higher than the maximum permitted
density. Therefore, it is likely that the number of units constructed will be higher than
that identified within the Site Analysis and that required under the City’s RHNA
allocation.
The sites identified for new housing are shown in Figure 4; they include 45 separate
areas that are labeled by number. A brief description of each site suitable for future
housing development is provided below along with its proposed General Plan Land Use
designation and minimum required density. Additional information and attributes
regarding each of the described parcels, including a map of each site, is contained
within the Appendix of this Housing Element. The City is currently in the process of
preparing a General Plan Amendment and Zone Change to amend the zoning on
approximately 250 acres to R-4 (30) and on approximately 96 acres to R-4 (50). The
new R-4 (30) zone will allow for medium-high density residential development at a
density of between 30 and 50 dwelling units per acre. The new R-4 (50) zone will allow
high-density residential development at a density of 50-60 dwelling units per acre. A
Zoning Ordinance Amendment is also currently being prepared developing the uses
permitted and standards of development for the new R-4 zone. All of the amendments
to the existing General Plan Land Use and Zoning Maps and the Zoning Ordinance will
be completed by September 30, 2012. Additionally, the City is amending the Palmdale
Transit Village Specific Plan for Neighborhood Zone C to increase the density range
from 25-40 dwelling units per acre to 30-40 dwelling units per acre.

Housing
Housing Site 4 comprises 793 acres located between the California Aqueduct and
Elizabeth Lake Road, west of 30th Street West and is know as the Joshua Ranch
Development. A total of 539 single-family units were approved under tentative map
52200; three of six phases of the project have recorded. The first three phases of the
development were under construction when the developer lost the site to foreclosure in
approximately 2007. Existing infrastructure is available to the first three phases while
the remainder of the site is vacant. Due to previously constructed infrastructure
improvements associated with the project, the site is readily developable.
Environmental constraints identified on the site, including biological and topography,
have been mitigated pursuant to an approved environmental document. The site is
suitable for moderate and above moderate units.

Site 15 is considered suitable for transition to high density residential as a result of the
ago of the properties, which were built between 1952 and 1968, the close proximity to
the Palmdale Transportation Center and public transportation route along Palmdale
Boulevard. Additionally, six property investors own multiple adjacent properties within
Site 15 allowing for easy consolidation of parcels to allow higher density housing
development. All but three of the occupied properties contain single-family residences
and the other properties contain two triplexes and one duplex on sites that will be zoned
for a minimum of 9 units each. As an infill site, all infrastructures are available to the
property and the site is readily developable. The site is suitable for very low and low
units.

vacant land and 19.29 acres of occupied land. There are six existing apartment
buildings within Site 16 that are between 30 and 41 dwelling units per acre and another
two with 27-29 du/acre.
Site 16 is currently being rezoned to allow a density of 30-50 du/ac. The 50.2 acres of
vacant land would therefore provide a minimum of 1,508 very low and low units. Of the
19.29 acres of occupied land, 2.51 acres has been identified as suitable for conversion
to high density residential, allowing for a minimum of 76 units. The remaining 16.79
acres was not included in the site analysis due to the age, existing density and quality of
the housing. Of the identified occupied properties, one is a single-family residence of
less than 650 square feet constructed in 1947 on a half acre. Four others contain
multiple units, but those were constructed between 1949 and 1966, have not been
maintained in a good condition and have existing densities of between 8-16 du/acre.
The total minimum number of units within Site 16 would be 1,581. As an infill site, all

Although there are 70.12 acres of occupied land within Site 18, only 24.94 acres have
been identified as having the potential to transition to high density residential. The
remaining 45.18 acres was not included in the site analysis due to the age, existing
density and quality of the housing. A breakdown of the acreage of occupied land
included within the site analysis that is currently being rezoned to allow a density of 30-
50 du/ac and 50-60 du/ac, along with the minimum number of permitted units is
provided below:
        Occupied Land                  Acres           Minimum # of Units
        30-50 du/ac                    22.45                    701

There are 10 existing apartment complexes with a density over 30 du/ac and another 10
with densities over 23 du/ac. Existing public transportation routes are located along
Palmdale Boulevard and Avenue R. Of the 77 existing units on the site, 60% are not
owner-occupied and 59 of the units are single-family detached structures. Units were
generally constructed in the 1930’s through 1960’s. All properties are close to public
transportation and commercial centers. The only known environmental constraint
impacting some of the properties is 0.2-1% annual chance of flooding; a constraint
which can be mitigated at the time of design of a project. As an infill site, all
infrastructure is available to the property and the site is readily developable. The site is
suitable for very low and low units.

C.       Underutilized Land and Infill Developments
Within the central portion of the City, there are a number of vacant, underdeveloped,
deteriorated, and/or dilapidated properties that present the potential for infill
development. The development of these sites, verses sites on the periphery of existing
development, is consistent with the logical expansion of community facilities and more
economical from the City’s perspective. For a developer, the presence of existing
infrastructure, one of the most expensive factors in the cost of development, presents a
distinct advantage. However, there are times when even with the existence of
infrastructure, it is often economically unfeasible for developers to build on small
parcels. It may take city involvement, through redevelopment efforts or other methods,
to develop such infill projects.
A recently example of lot consolidation undertaken by the City is the Courson
Connection project. This is a redevelopment project by the City of Palmdale and the
City of Palmdale Community Redevelopment Agency to develop approximately 16 acres
into a 295 unit senior housing project, a 14,890 square foot senior center, and open
space park area. The project as proposed will include the following components: a)
acquisition of approximately 46 properties; b) relocation of approximately 110
households; c) demolition of existing structures; d) right-of-way dedications and
vacations; e) construction of the senior housing units, senior center, and park and open
space areas; and f) site and street improvements including infrastructure improvements

                                                                  Adopted by City Council
                                                                                  09/05/12

and pedestrian access across 10th Street East. The project is to be developed in
multiple phases over several years. Funding for the project will be from a variety of
sources including redevelopment housing set-aside funds, CDBG funds, bonds, HOME
funds, and other state and federal funding sources.
In order to facilitate the development of small vacant, underdeveloped, deteriorated,
and/or dilapidated properties that present the potential for infill development, a new
program (Program H1.H Small Lot Consolidation) has been included within this Housing
Element. The program will offer incentives, such as priority processing, financial
assistance based upon availability of finds, density bonuses and modification of
development standards for qualifying projects.
Additionally, there are several sites identified within the Site Analysis which are larger
than a typical project (2-10 acres) in light of Federal, State and local financing
programs. Therefore, a new program (Program H1.I Large Site Development Program)
to facilitate the development of housing for lower income households on larger sites.
Incentives, such as an expedited review and approval process, ministerial review of lot
line adjustments, provision of technical assistance to acquire funding, density bonuses
and modification of development standards for qualifying projects will be offered.
D.      Infrastructure for Housing Development
In the City’s downtown area, most of the land has been divided into buildable lots.
These areas are served by streets but water and sewer service are unevenly
distributed; in some areas a builder can easily connect to these services, in other areas
the builder may have to go up a street or two to connect.
On Palmdale’s southwest side, most of the land is located within large, master-planned
developments. Within both the Ritter Ranch and City Ranch specific plan areas, the
master developer has installed trunk water and sewer lines and arterial roadways;
however, the merchant builder might have to install streets, sidewalks, power, local
water and sewer services. This makes development of unimproved land more
expensive. While land costs are low, the schedules of fees and development costs in
the Constraints Section (Tables H-47 and H-48) indicate that fees and construction
costs have risen, putting newly constructed units out of the reach of families who earn
the County median income.
Gas is provided by The Gas Company and power by Southern California Edison. Trash
service is provided by a private hauler through a franchise agreement with the City.
Recycling services are provided by the trash hauler and local recycling centers. The
City has 20 water districts and three sewer districts. A citywide master drainage system
is being installed by the City through the City’s Capital Improvement Plan; however
drainage may still an issue on some sites and may be provided by the developer in
exchange for credit on drainage impact fees.
                                          H-106
Adopted by City Council
09/05/12

                                                                                  Housing
The City has a capital improvement plan for upgrading the circulation system. Traffic
mitigation fees on new development help to offset the cost of improvements.
The parcels identified within the Site Analysis have sufficient infrastructure to
accommodate the RHNA within the planning period. Although some parcels are
identified within the “Infrastructure Capacity” column as requiring ‘Extension of existing
lines to site required’ this may simply indicate that the main public sewer or water line is
not located directly adjacent to the parcel. However, all parcels are located within a
service area where infrastructure can easily be extended. Each residential subdivision
or development project is required to ensure that necessary infrastructure is in place or
can be extended to serve the project prior to approval and development.
E.      Environmental Constraints
Palmdale is located in the Antelope Valley in the western corner of the Mojave Desert.
The overall topography is generally flat, with hillsides area located within the south and
southwest portions of the City. The dominant natural vegetation is desert shrub.
Numerous residential sites within Palmdale contain native vegetation, including Joshua
Trees, a locally protected species. The presence of native vegetation on a site is not
necessarily an impediment to development. Prior to approval of any new development,
a biological report will be required to ensure no protected species are present and any
necessary permits from the State of California Department of Fish and Game are
obtained. In addition to biological issues, several drainage features are located within
the City, including the Amargosa and Anaverde Creeks. As a result, there are portions
of the City identified as having a 0.2 - 1% annual chance of flooding. This is not a major
constraint to development, as the City has included flood plain management in its
Master Plan of Drainage. Individual projects are required to prepare a hydrology study
and may require on- or off-site detention basins to mitigate drainage impacts. In
addition, site-specific mitigation measures can be taken to address construction in areas
with flooding potential, such as elevation of the structure.
Existing environmental settings in Palmdale do not present a major constraint to
affordable housing development. The majority of the residential sites in Palmdale would
be subject to a (Mitigated) Negative Declaration. Some infill parcels adjacent to existing
development may be determined to be Categorically Exempt under the CEQA
Guidelines. Sites within the Palmdale Transit Village Specific Plan have been
previously assessed within the Environmental Impact Report prepared for the Specific
Plan; however, they will still be subject to site-specific review.
Suitable Sites Summary
Based on the above analysis of suitable sites for new housing and the detailed site
information contained within the Appendix, it is estimated that over 15,200 new dwelling

units may be accommodated by the amended General Plan Land Use Map, which will
be sufficient to meet the RHNA requirement for 17,910 units during the planning period.
As noted above, 3,489 of these required units have already been constructed since
January 1, 2006. In addition, suitable sites have been identified for households of
various income levels, as summarized below:
    • Number of very low and low income households (at 30 du/acre or more): 7,658
    • Number of moderate or above moderate households: 7,544

VII.   CONSTRAINTS
A.     Governmental Constraints
Government Code Section 65583(a) requires “An analysis of potential and actual
government constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of
housing for all income levels…including land use controls, building codes and their
enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers and
local processing permit procedures…”
Principal Government Constraints:
     The highest zoning designation in Palmdale in 2012 is R-3, at 16 units per acre. In
     order to comply with the State requirement that land sufficient to accommodate
     Palmdale’s regional housing need allocation for lower income households be zoned
     at a minimum of 30 dwelling units (DU) per acre, Palmdale will have to amend the
     Zoning Ordinance (See Program H-1A)
     Current development standards for R-3 (Multifamily) housing preclude the
     development of housing at 30 dwelling units per acre. In order to comply with State
     law, Palmdale will have to amend the Zoning Ordinance. (See Program H-1A)
     Palmdale requires a Conditional Use Permit for transitional housing, assisted
     housing, residential care, and board and care in the R-2 and R-3 zones. SB 2
     (Government Code 6855839(a)(5)) clearly prohibits treating supportive housing
     developments differently from other multifamily housing in the same zoning
     designation. A Zoning Ordinance Amendment will be initiated to comply with State
     law. (see Programs H-5E and H-5F)
Reduction in Public Revenue for Key Government Functions:
Loss of public revenues leading to substantial reduction in City staff including 57%
reduction in planning staff (planner positions reduced from nine to four).
The following revenue reductions were affecting key government function in the City of

1.      Land Use Controls
Following a two-year moratorium on multifamily construction between 1999 and 2001 no
new multifamily projects were built in Palmdale until 2007 when the 48-unit Twin Palms
project was completed.
i.      Zoning and Density
Excluding specific plan areas, as of January 2012, there are seven residential land use
designations in Palmdale, beginning with Equestrian Residential. Table H-41 shows the
permitted density for each of these zoning designations. Development standards for the
residential zoning designations that begin with R-1 are shown in Table H-42.

Equestrian Residential permits one dwelling unit per 2.5 acre; Low Density Residential
permits one dwelling unit per acre; Single-Family Residential 1 (SFR-1) permits up to
two units per acre, Single-Family Residential 2 (SFR-2) permits up to three units per
acre; Single-Family Residential 3 (SFR-3) permits between 3.1 and 6 units per acre;
Medium Residential (R-2) permits between 6.1 and 10 units per acre and Multiple
Residential (R-3) permits between 10.1 and 16 units per acre.
The Zoning Ordinance controls how many units can be built per acre of land. The City’s
development standards establish how the structure is built, including setbacks from the
front, sides and back, how much of the lot the structure can cover, how much parking is
required, how tall the building can be and other requirements. Table H-42 summaries
the principal development standards governing residential development.
Single-Family Residential
The minimum lot size in the R-1 zone (Single-Family Residential) is 7,000 square feet,
with permitted density from 3.1 units to 6 units per acre. A front setback of 15 feet and
a rear yard of no less than 20% of lot depth or 20 feet are required. Side yards must be
at least five feet on one side and 10 feet on the other side. Building heights cannot
exceed two stories or 35 feet while accessory building heights cannot exceed one story
or 17 feet. Lot coverage of all principal buildings and accessory structures cannot
exceed 40%.
Zoning Ordinance Section 41.09.G.13 specifically allows for the installation or
construction of a manufactured home where the code allows for the construction of a
detached single-family structure. Manufactured homes must comply with all standards
of development for stick built structures and where the manufactured home is being

In the R-2 zone (Medium Residential), the minimum lot size for two-family dwellings is
8,000 square feet and for a single-family house, 7,000 square feet. For two or more
unit developments, 4,000 square feet of lot area per unit is required. Permitted density
in this zone ranges from 6.1 to 10 units per acre. Permitted building types include
single-family detached and attached, zero lot line and wide-shallow subdivisions;
duplexes, triplexes, condominium and townhouse developments and moderate density
apartment and manufactured housing developments. Single-family dwelling units in
this zone must conform to the standards for single-family units in the R-1 zone. For two
or more unit developments, the front yard setback is 20 feet and the side yard must be
not less than five feet for each story. The rear yard must be not less than 15 feet.
Building heights cannot exceed two stories or 35 feet and lot coverage cannot exceed

A slight smaller livable area may be approved for a housing project for seniors.
In addition to height, set-backs, density, lot coverage and minimum lot area,
development standards for multiple family developments in the R-2 with four or more
dwelling units include the following amenities: 30% usable common open space shall
be provided for passive and active recreation; each dwelling unit shall have a private
(walled) patio or balcony with a minimum of seven feet of depth.
A project with four or more units must provide recreational amenities such as a
swimming pool, spa, clubhouse, tot lot with play equipment, picnic shelter, barbecue
area and so on. The City is in the process of amending both the R-2 and R-3 zones to
require only projects with five or more units to contain amenities. Each dwelling unit
must be provided with a minimum of 150 cubic feet of enclosed storage space, each
dwelling unit must provide sufficient space for and be plumbed and wired for a standard
size washing machine and dryer, even if the project provides common laundry facilities.
These development standards may raise the per unit cost of construction by as much as
8% according to a multifamily developer working in Palmdale, and thus could be
considered a constraint on housing affordability. On the other hand, high design
standards help make multifamily projects more acceptable to Palmdale residents, an
important consideration in a community where there has been considerable opposition
from neighboring residents to the construction of affordable multifamily units. The poor
design and poor quality of many multifamily units built in the 1970s and 1980s has
contributed to community opposition to multifamily construction. Additionally, the types
of amenities listed above are considered standard for apartments constructed over the
past 20 years and are considered essential for attracting discriminating renters.

Housing
Manufactured home subdivisions are permitted within the R-2 (Medium Residential) and
R-3 (Multiple Residential) zones subject to the approval of a Conditional Use Permit by
the Planning Commission. This is consistent with the requirements for a subdivision of
stick built residential units, which requires a public hearing before the Planning
Commission.
Multifamily Residential
According to the Palmdale Zoning Ordinance, the R-3 zone (Multiple Residential) is
intended to promote the development of grouped housing such as townhouses,
condominiums and apartment at a density of between 10.1 and 16 units per acre. The
minimum lot size for multifamily residential parcels created after December 14, 1994 is
20,000 square feet, with a minimum lot area for each unit of 2,500 square feet, or, in the
case of manufactured home parks or subdivisions a minimum lot area of five acres with
a minimum lot area per unit of 2,200 square feet. The minimum lot width for multifamily
residential development in the R-3 zone is 100 feet with front yard building setbacks at
20 feet, a 15-foot rear setback and side setbacks of not less than five feet for each
story. Building heights cannot exceed three stories or 45 feet and maximum lot
coverage cannot exceed 50%. The minimum dwelling unit areas are the same as those
for R-2 Medium Residential development and required amenities within each unit and
within each development are the same as those for Medium Residential development.
Required common area amenities as described above in the paragraph on the R-2 zone
must follow a schedule established by the City as set forth below in Table H-44.
The development standards for multiple family units affect housing affordability by
increasing costs and reducing the number of units that builders can put on their parcels.
Due to the lot coverage, minimum lot per unit, amenities and private open space
requirements, builders are not always able to achieve 16 units per acre.
The City is in the process of creating a new R-4 zone to allow high-density residential
development. The R-4 (30) zone will allow a density of between 30-50 dwelling units
per acre and the R-4 (50) zone will allow 50-60 dwelling units per acre. The new R-4
zone will increase the height limit to five stories, increase the maximum allowable lot
coverage to 80% and will reduce the front yard setback to 5 feet. With the standards
listed above and a reduction in the number of required parking spaces (see subsection
ii. Parking below), the City believes that the maximum permitted density allowed by the
underlying zone can be achieved.

Density Bonus
Developers who include affordable units in their projects qualify for a by right 25%
density bonus along with additional incentives such as parking reductions or fee
reductions. To qualify for a density bonus, a developer must agree to construction one
of the following:
1.      10% of units affordable to households earning 80% or less of median income
        qualifies for a 20% density bonus. For each 1% increase over 10%, the density
        bonus shall be increased by 1.5% to a maximum of 35%.
2.      5% of the units affordable to households earning 50% or less of median income

Housing
Single Room Occupancy Units
There is no current provision within the Zoning Ordinance for Single Room Occupancy
(SRO). These are typically a small unit with shared kitchen and bathroom facilities.
There are currently no SRO’s within Palmdale. Historically there has not been a market
demand for the development of SRO’s due to the affordability of larger rental properties
within the City. The Zoning Ordinance does currently include provisions for Boarding
and Rooming Houses within the R-3 (Multiple Residential) zone. Additionally, at the
present time, the Zoning Ordinance does not regulate a single-family residential unit
where four or fewer individuals rent individual rooms. A business license for a single-
family rental is only required where the property owner is not living within the residence.
Farmworker Housing
The City currently provides for Agricultural workers' living quarters within the A-1 (Light
Agriculture) zone with the approval of a Conditional Use Permit. As part of the Zoning
Ordinance Amendment currently being processed, the requirement for approval of a
Conditional Use Permit for this land use category will be removed to facilitate additional
opportunities for additional types of housing within the City.
Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing
The current ordinance limiting such facilities to the R-3 zone and requiring a Conditional
Use Permit violates State law. The City is in the process of amending the Zoning
Ordinance to comply with SB 520 and SB 2. The city is currently amending the Zoning
Ordinance to allow: Transitional Housing, Supportive Housing and Residential Care
Facilities within a single-family dwelling unit within the A-1 and R-1 zones as an
administrative use; Transitional Housing, Supportive Housing and Residential Care
Facilities within four or fewer units within the R-2, R-3 and R-4 zones will be permitted
with administrative approval, those located within five or more units will require Site Plan
Review approval, consistent with the requirements for all residential uses.
Emergency Housing
Currently, the City’s Zoning Ordinance allows Homeless Shelters within the PF (Public
Facilities), C-3 (General Commercial), C-5 (Service Commercial) and M-1 (Light
Industrial) zones with a Conditional Use Permit. The City is in the process of amending
the Zoning Ordinance to allow Homeless Shelters within the C-2 zone without a
Conditional Use Permit and to allow Homeless Shelters within the R-3 (Multiple
Residential), PF, and C-3 zones with a Conditional Use Permit. Section 94.04 of the
Zoning Ordinance would be amended to reduce the distance separation requirement
between Homeless Shelters to 300 feet and remove the distance separation
requirements to Transitional or Supportive Housing, schools and single family
residential uses.

ii.     Parking
Single-family houses must provide a fully enclosed two-car garage with dimensions of at
least 20 feet by 22 feet. Multifamily rental developments must provide 2.25 parking
spaces per unit. One space must be covered and designated for a specific unit. In
condominium projects, 2.25 parking spaces per unit are also required but two spaces
must be designated for a specific unit and one must be within an enclosed garage.
Assisted living developments must provide one parking space for each three residents
and one space for each employee. With the creation of the new R-4 zone, the City is
intending to reduce the parking requirement for multifamily development. It is the
intention to reduce parking to: 1.0 spaces per studio unit, 1.25 spaces per one bedroom
unit, 1.75 spaces per 2 bedroom unit, 2.0 spaces per three or more bedroom unit, plus
0.25 spaces per unit for guest parking (for complexes with 5 or more units). The
change in parking requirement is anticipated to result in fewer required spaces and
improved project layout and design.
Transit Village Development Standards
Transit Village development standards are discussed in a separate section because
they are organized by neighborhood type for characteristics such as setbacks and
heights and by number of bedrooms for parking requirements.

administrative review; however in the R-2 zone, both single and two-family homes may
be built with administrative review by the Planning Director or his/her designee.
Multifamily housing or projects with three or more units require a Site Plan Review.
There are a number of housing types that provide housing and supportive services to
children and adults who are disabled or homeless. Transitional housing provides
housing and supportive services such as case management, life skills training, and help
with employment and permanent housing to homeless individuals and families.
Residents usually stay in transitional housing for between six months and two years.
Disabled persons and older adults who need some assistance with the tasks of daily
living may reside in licensed facilities such as community care, adult residential care,
and other types of social living facilities. When provided in the R-1, R-2 and R-3 zone
for six or fewer persons, no special permit is needed for this type of residential care.
Older adults often reside in apartment buildings that provide common eating facilities
and may provide other services such as housekeeping and transportation. Assisted
living facilities with seven or more residents do require a Conditional Use Permit.
Licensed alcohol and drug treatment facilities serving 6 or fewer persons are permitted
within the R-1, R-2 and R-3 zones with an administrative approval; when such a facility
serves 7 or more persons, they are permitted within the R-3 zone with a Conditional
Use Permit. Unlicensed sober living homes for 6 or fewer persons are permitted within
the R-1 and R-2 zones with administrative approval.
As previously stated, the City is in the process of amending the Zoning Ordinance to
comply with SB 520 and SB 2. Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing with six or
fewer residents will be permitted within the R-1 zone without the requirement for a CUP;
Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing with seven or more residents will be
permitted within the R-2, R-3 and new R-4 zone without the requirement for a CUP.
Small residential care facilities (six or fewer residents) will be permitted within the R-1
zone without the requirement for a CUP; Large Residential Care Facilities (seven or
more residents) will be permitted within the R-2, R-3 and new R-4 zone without the
requirement for a CUP.
iv.     Transit Village
The Palmdale Transit Village Specific Plan is an area of about 100 acres in Palmdale’s
Downtown adjacent to the Metrolink Station. The Specific Plan for this area was
developed through a public urban design process with the hope that it would increase
transit ridership. The Transit Village will be a transit-oriented, pedestrian-friendly
community with bicycle paths, mixed use buildings and townhomes. It will allow much
denser residential development than is permitted in the rest of Palmdale. This is an
important step for the Palmdale community where there is a need for additional, more
densely built multifamily housing in a pedestrian environment that cannot be built under
current standards.

Housing
The City is likely to direct affordable housing developers to the Transit Village where
higher densities should help reduce per unit development costs somewhat. The
Economic Development Department, Housing Division, is redesigning its
homeownership assistance programs for use in the Transit Village.
The Transit Village is divided into neighborhoods and use types are allocated by
neighborhood rather than zoning. The three types of permitted residential development
are single-family, multifamily and mixed use. Multifamily may take the form of
townhomes and/or apartments. There are parking reductions for multifamily and mixed
use but not for townhomes or single-family dwellings.          Table H-46 attempts to
summarize the various densities and development standards allocated by neighborhood
in the Transit Village.
Of the nine Neighborhood Zones within the Palmdale Transit Village Specific Plan, only
Neighborhood Zones C and D have sufficient density to be suitable for development of
very-low and low-income units. Residential units constructed within the remaining
Neighborhood Zones would be credited to moderate and above moderate units.

2.       Codes and Enforcement
In 2011 the City of Palmdale adopted the 2010 California Building Code and CalGreen.
The City has also adopted landscaping and water conservation ordinances to ensure
that development in Palmdale is appropriate for the City’s high desert ecology and
constraints on water resources. The City puts a high priority on building code
enforcement. It has created a Neighborhood Improvement Program in which the
Building and Safety Division works with law enforcement, the fire department, the Los
Angeles County Department of Heath Services, the Department of Public Works and
other agencies to coordinate clean up, infrastructure improvements, housing
rehabilitation, crime reduction and improvements in property management practices in
selected areas of the City. A program of the Department of Public Safety and
Community Relations, called Partners Against Crime (PAC), offers an eight-hour
property management program for Palmdale property owners, managers and
maintenance personnel.

Housing
3.      Construction of Improvements
i.      Dedication Requirements
In addition to impact fees, new development is required to dedicate land where needed
to construct infrastructure improvements to support the residents it generates. These
requirements are most commonly applied to dedication of land along street frontages for
additional right-of-way needed to widen roads in order to carry additional traffic. All new
housing projects are required to dedicate full street right-of-way and construct
improvements within the interior of the project. Where the project boundary abuts a
public street, right-of-way dedication is required along the project frontage, and street
improvements are required to be constructed. Street right-of-way may also be used for
placement of sewers, storm drains, and utility easements. The requirements placed on
the project must be directly related to the project’s impacts on infrastructure systems,
and must represent a fair share contribution based on the project’s share of the facility
needs in order to meet the tests of nexus and proportionality.
The requirement to dedicate right-of-way and/or easements for public improvements to
support development is typical of all California cities and is specified as a subdivision
requirement by the State Subdivision Map Act. There are no unusual requirements in
the City of Palmdale for dedication of land to construct infrastructure.
ii.     Improvement Requirements
In areas of existing development, the street system is complete and developers only
have to install sidewalks, driveways and curbs for their own developments. In the
downtown area and near other developments, water, sewer and power may extend to
vacant infill lots in one area, but in another area developers of vacant lots may have to
bring services to the lots from a distance down the streets. The same is true of larger
parcels in the City’s older areas. Some may already have services close to the site; for
other sites a developer may have to make a larger infrastructure investment. If
infrastructure is not available to a new development, the developer is required to install
the required infrastructure to service the project, with the potential for impact fees
credits and reimbursement. The Southern California Gas Company and Southern
California Edison provide gas and electricity respectively.
Examples of types of improvements required of developers include the following, along
with the relevant section of the Zoning Ordinance:
    •   Street improvements, including curb, gutter and sidewalks; street lights and traffic
        control devices, bus turnouts & shelters (21.04.C.2.b and 22.04.C.2.b)
    •   Grading, drainage and drainage structures (21.04.C.2.a and 22.04.C.2.a)

    •    Sanitary sewers (21.04.C.2.d and 22.04.C.2.)
    •    Water mains and fire hydrants (21.04.C.2.c and 22.04.C.2.c)

Traffic studies are not generally required for infill developments; only a project that
would generate more than 2,000 trips per day is required to prepare such a study. A
traffic mitigation fee is paid on a per unit basis to offset the costs of transportation
related capital improvements.           The City has a Capital Improvements Plan for
improvements to the circulation system and the mitigation fee is combined with other
funds to pay for street, traffic light and other improvements that are made according to a
prioritized schedule.
Some of Palmdale’s residentially zoned land lies in areas that are still largely
unimproved. Developers are required to submit a master plan that includes streets,
drainage, sewers, power, and water before raw land developments can be approved.
There are six master planned subdivisions in Palmdale with specific plans. Five are
located in areas at the City’s periphery, while one, the Transit Village is in the downtown
area. Hillside Specific Plan is built out. Two of the specific plan areas, Rancho Vista
and Joshua Hills, are well developed with infrastructure in place with little vacant
residential land. City Ranch, also known as Anaverde, contains more than 1,000
existing residential units and major infrastructure has been installed. Ritter Ranch has
installed infrastructure but has not yet been developed due to the slowing of the
residential market. The Joshua Ranch development, which is zoned for low density
residential at 0 to 2 du/acre, has some infrastructure in place. Foothill Ranch Specific
Plan, formerly known as College Park, is the only one of the specific plan areas where
infrastructure is not yet in place. It is in a fault zone and has Flood Zone, Hillside and
Biological constraints.
On the land designated Equestrian Residential, water and sewer may not be available
and development is subject to rural standards such as septic tanks. In the Low Density
Residential designation, which is suitable in hillside areas, the developer has to provide
water and sewer in most areas but rural street and lighting standards may apply.
Residential development at Single-Family Residential-1 and higher requires full urban
services.
The City is trying to encourage infill development in the central areas of Palmdale where
infrastructure is already in place and large vacant parcels are available.

The cost of on- and off-site improvements doesn’t appear to be a constraint on new
development in the City’s older areas. The higher costs of infrastructure development
plus construction and impacts fees are reflected in the higher prices of new units.
iii.    Water
The City of Palmdale is primarily served by Palmdale Water District and Los Angeles
County Waterworks District (LACWWD) 40, with numerous small water companies
providing service to smaller areas.
PWD receives water from Littlerock Creek Dam and Reservoir, the State Water Project
(SWP) and groundwater. Groundwater is obtained from underground aquifers via active
wells scattered throughout PWD and chlorinated prior to distribution. LACWWD 40
receives water from the SWP, purchased through the Antelope Valley East Kern Water
Agency (AVEK), and local groundwater.
The Antelope Valley groundwater basin is in overdraft, which is the condition where
annual extraction exceeds the safe-yield. According to AVEK and LACWWD, the basin
has been in a state of overdraft for eight to nine years. The basin is not adjudicated;
therefore, the water rights from and management of the basin have not been court
appointed. Initial steps have been taken to adjudicate the basin in order to protect its
long-term capacity and beneficial use. Pumping of groundwater by all uses, collectively,
has significantly exceeded the natural recharge to the Basin. In the long term, the Basin
cannot sustain current pumping levels.
With regards to SWP supplies, recent concerns for the protection of the Delta Smelt, an
endangered fish, have resulted in a judicial ruling that the volume of water pumped
through the California Aqueduct must be reduced. The projected water allocation for the
Antelope Valley from the State Water Project has been reduced from approximately
75% to 44% of the annual entitlement of a given year.
Several actions have been taken to address future water availability. In 2006, the Los
Angeles County Department of Public Works, County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles
County, the cities of Palmdale and Lancaster and several water purveyors established
the Regional Water Management Group. This group was created to coordinate efforts
in drafting the Antelope Valley Integrated Regional Water Management Plan (IRWMP).
The IRWMP serves to identify inter-agency objectives, priorities, projects, and
management strategies to address the regional water supply issues. The document
was finalized in early 2008 for submittal to the State of California’s Department of Water
Resources for consideration of Proposition 50 funding.
Maximizing the use of recycled water that will be available from the Palmdale Water
Reclamation Plant (Palmdale WRP) and the Lancaster WRP will help the City and the
Antelope Valley address its water supply uncertainties by capitalizing on a local, reliable
                                           H-124
Adopted by City Council
09/05/12

                                                                                   Housing
source of water. The City adopted the Palmdale Recycled Water Facilities Plan in
March 2009, which defines a set of alternatives for construction of a new distribution
system that would deliver recycled water from the Palmdale WRP to municipal and
industrial customers in the City as well as serve as a portion of the regional backbone
by connecting to the regional recycled water pipeline from Lancaster WRP.
The City of Palmdale has initiated the Upper Amargosa Creek Recharge Project (UAP)
on approximately 87 acres located within the City limits. The UAP will include two in-
channel basins and six off-channel basins. The in-channel basins will slow the flow of
natural runoff to enhance infiltration into stream channel bed, promoting recharge to the
aquifer. The off-channel basins will allow diverted water to infiltrate areas outside the
streambed. The purpose of this facility is to provide increased groundwater recharge
primarily from water imported from the California State Water Project (SWP) and
secondarily from storm flows within Amargosa Creek.
Based upon the Antelope Valley Integrated Regional Water Management, there is not
currently sufficient total water capacity available based on current consumption patterns
for anticipated growth with the City of Palmdale. Resolving this will require a
combination of increased conservation, use of recycled water, storage/banking of
increased supplies when available, as well as other strategies discussed above. Water
availability is a regional issue and the City is pursuing its part of a cooperative effort to
address it on a regional scale.
iv.     Sewer
The City of Palmdale owns the wastewater collection system that collects wastewater
from all properties on the sewer system pipelines within the City’s municipal boundaries
and transfers it to large trunk sewers that in turn empty into the Palmdale or Lancaster
Water Reclamation Plant.
The majority of City’s sewage collected by the Districts is sent to Palmdale Water
Reclamation Plant (PWRP) (District No. 20) with some flows sent to Lancaster Water
Reclamation Plant (LWRP) (District No. 14). PWRP has a design capacity of 15 million
gallons per day (mgd). According to the Final Palmdale Water Reclamation Plant 2025
Facilities Plan and EIR (September 2005), the District currently treats 9.4 mgd.
However, based upon forecasts of the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) within the 2004 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), LACSD has determined
that by 2025 the District’s population will be approximately 225,000 and the volume of
wastewater will be 22.4 mgd. Under the growth model developed by SCAG, the current
capacity of the Palmdale Water Reclamation Plant will be reached by 2013. The LWRP
has a design capacity of 16 mgd and currently processes an average flow of 14.0 mgd.
The Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts has prepared a Final Lancaster Water
Reclamation Plant 2020 Facilities Plan and EIR (May 2004) for the expansion of the
Lancaster Water Reclamation Plant, which was expected to reach capacity in 2007-

                                                                 Adopted by City Council
                                                                                   09/05/12

Housing
2008 according to information contained within the FEIR. Based upon the Sanitation
District’s plan to expand capacity, as described within the Final Palmdale Water
Reclamation Plant 2025 Facilities Plan and EIR and the Final Lancaster Water
Reclamation Plant 2020 Facilities Plan and EIR, it is anticipated that the District will
have adequate capacity to serve the existing housing and new units constructed as part
of the City’s housing allocation within the planning period.
The City analyzed new regulations adopted by the California State Water Resource
Board and as of July 1, 2009, the Palmdale Sewer Maintenance District assumed direct
control over the wastewater collection system, which had previously been operated by
the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works Sewer Maintenance District. In
June 2008, prior to assuming responsibility for the Sewer Maintenance District, the City
held hearings on fee increases resulting from City management. At that time, the City
Council set the annual sewer unit charge for fiscal year 2008-2009 at $38.64 increasing
to 92.56 in fiscal year 2009-2010 and to 103.63 in fiscal year 2010-2011. City operation
of the wastewater system is expected to improve wastewater management but has also
nearly tripled the annual sewer fee charged to property owners.
4.      Fees and Permits
Tables H-47 and H-48 below show typical fees and construction costs for single and
multiple family developments in Palmdale.
Fees imposed by the City and the various school districts now add substantially to the
cost of new housing in Palmdale. Between 2000 and 2008, the cost of these fees
increased by 75.2% overall and the proportion they contribute to develop cost for
multifamily housing increased from 15% to 20% of project cost.
Fees that increased more than 200% over the eight year period include traffic impact
fees, park impact fees and fire facility impact fees. School impact fees rose by only
29.8% but are the most expensive of all the fees.
In addition to permit costs, utility hook-ups and school impact fees, the City also
assesses large fees for traffic impacts and park impacts. Because the City does not
have a fully developed drainage system, drainage impact fees are charged to pay for
regional drainage improvements. The cost of all fees and permits is now $55,162 per
unit for single-family dwellings and $31,188 per unit for multifamily dwellings. These
fees may seem high but the City must develop infrastructure and schools to serve its
growing population. It may not be possible to reduce fees without severely impacting
the community’s ability to provide basic infrastructure and services.

i.      Comparison of Fees with Other Jurisdictions
Fees in the City of Santa Clarita are even higher than in Palmdale at $61,117 per unit
for single-family and $44,542 per unit for multifamily. By contrast, the fees charged by
Los Angeles County in unincorporated areas of the Antelope Valley are significantly
lower at $17,226 per unit for multifamily. A single-family comparison for Los Angeles
County is unavailable.18

ii.     Permit Processing
Figure 5 on the following page provides a flow chart of the development approval
process. The development review process is an efficient one that uses a multi-
departmental Development Advisory Board (DAB) to review proposed developments.
The DAB process expedites the review process and provides an opportunity for
communication between departments in order to minimize contradictory requirements.
The City has a 45 to 60-day schedule for getting a development application through to
Planning Commission or Site Plan Review hearing, provided the application is complete
when it is submitted. Building and Safety typically requires one week for each check on
a permit plan check. The Engineering Department has a 3-2-1 processing timeline for
grading plans: three weeks for the first plan check, two weeks for the second, and one
week for the third.
Multifamily developments of three units or more are developed by right and are not
subject to a Conditional Use Permit; however these developments are subject to Site
Plan Review. The Site Plan Review process is conducted by the Director of Planning
sitting as the Hearing Officer in a public hearing. The Site Plan Review is not
considered a constraint on the development of multifamily housing because approval is
only subject to conformity with all adopted development standards of the zone and the
goals, policies and objectives of the General Plan, including this Housing Element. For
a project subject to Site Plan Review approval, the land use itself is permitted as of
right; the only discretion the Hearing Officer has is to ensure the site plan and
building(s) are consistent with the Zoning Ordinance with respect to development
standards such as setbacks, height, maximum site coverage, parking and landscaping.
One of the findings that must be made in order to approve a Site Plan Review is that the
design of the project is compatible and harmonious with the uses and structures on
adjacent properties. In the past, residents opposing new low-income multifamily
developments were not able to prove that proposed multifamily developments would
have adverse impacts and it is not anticipated that opponents to future development will
be successful in meeting the “substantial evidence” threshold for a finding of adverse
impact. Therefore, the City does not believe that Site Plan Review process constraints

Figure 5      Development Processing Schedule
Tables H-49 and H-50 below provide timelines for the development approval process.
The development review process is an efficient one that uses a multi-departmental
Development Advisory Board (DAB) to review proposed developments.             The DAB
process expedites the review process and provides an opportunity for communication
between departments in order to minimize contradictory requirements.
The City has a 45 to 60-day schedule for getting a development application through to
Planning Commission or Site Plan Review hearing, provided the application is complete
when it is submitted. Building and Safety typically requires one week for each check on
a permit plan check. The Engineering Department has a 3-2-1 processing timeline for
grading plans: three weeks for the first plan check, two weeks for the second, and one
week for the third.
Multifamily developments of three units or more are developed by right and are not
subject to a conditional use permit, however these developments are subject to site plan

review. The Site Plan Review is conducted by the Director of Planning as the Hearing
Officer in a public hearing. The site plan review is not considered a constraint on the
development of multifamily housing because approval is only subject to conformity with
all adopted development standards of the zone and the goals, policies and objectives of
the General Plan, including this Housing Element.
One of the findings that must be made in order to approve a site plan review is that the
design of the project is compatible and harmonious with the uses and structures on
adjacent properties. In the past, residents opposing new low-income multifamily
developments were not able to prove that proposed multifamily developments would
have adverse impacts and it is not anticipated that opponents to future development will
be successful in meeting the “substantial evidence” threshold for a finding of adverse
impact. Therefore, the City does not believe that site plan review process constrains the
supply and affordability of multifamily housing.

5.      Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Government Code Section 65583(a)(4) requires: “an analysis of potential and actual
government constraints upon the maintenance, improvement or development of
housing…for persons with disabilities as identified in the analysis pursuant to paragraph
(4) of subdivision (a) including land use controls, building codes and their endorsement,
site improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers and local
processing and permit procedures. The analysis shall also demonstrate local efforts to
remove governmental constrains that hinder the locality from meeting…the need for
housing for persons with disabilities. “
The intent of the statute is to ensure that persons with physical or mental disabilities can
live in the community without discrimination against them because of their disability,
their income or their need for assistance in tasks of daily living. In single-family districts,
Palmdale does not impose any restrictions on housing for six or fewer persons based
on the type of services provided or the population housed. There are currently 24
“small family homes” licensed by the Department of Social Services. However, in the
existing multifamily zones, all kinds of licensed and unlicensed supportive housing is
currently subject to a Conditional Use Permit (see Table H-51). The City is amending
its Zoning Ordinance to permit Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing within the
R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4 zones without a CUP (see Program H5.D). Program H5.C will
promote the development of housing for developmentally disabled residents. Program
H5.F will allow Homeless Shelters within the C-2 zone without a CUP and Program
H5.H will allow Large Residential Care Facilities in the R-2 and R-3 zones with Site Plan
Review approval, consistent with the approval process for multifamily developments of
five units or more.

Palmdale currently requires a Conditional Use Permit for all the following types of group
homes that often serve persons with disabilities:

                                        per 3 bed
Parking
Palmdale’s Zoning Ordinance sets parking standards for various types of assisted
housing but does not reference the standard used for setting the parking standards.
Spaces are required for each employee and except for convalescent care, for every
three beds. Parking for staff certainly adds costs to the building but the requirement for
staff parking appears to be a reasonable requirement and is not therefore considered a
constraint.
The Zoning Ordinance does not explain why the City determined that this type of
housing should be subject to a Conditional Use Permit process rather than Site Plan
Review as required for other types of multifamily housing. Some of the uses may be
licensed uses, others do not require a license. Senate Bill 2 makes it clear that
multifamily housing with supportive services on or off site must be treated no differently
than any other multifamily housing in that zoning designation. However, it is silent on
the issue of licensed group housing facilities.
According to City of Palmdale Planning staff, the process for a Conditional Use Permit is
similar to that for the Site Plan Review, the type of permit that is required for approval of
multifamily housing. However, the Site Plan Review is approved by the Planning
Director serving as the Hearing officer in a public hearing while the Conditional Use
Permit requires a public hearing before the Planning Commission. Theoretically, the
Planning Commission cannot deny the Conditional Use Permit if the facility meets all
requirements, however, the process is less predictable and more time consuming as
well as more likely to encounter a public battle with neighboring property owners. For

Housing
these reasons, the requirement for a Conditional Use Permit is a constraint on housing
for persons with disabilities.
A key word search of the development standards in Chapter 9 of the Zoning Ordinance
did not find any requirements that any of the special needs housing types listed in Table
H-45 be sited a certain distance from one another. There is a requirement that
Transitional Housing facilities be sited at least one quarter mile away from one another.
It is recommended that this requirement be deleted when the standards for transitional
housing are revised. The same requirement and same recommendation applies to
approval of emergency housing. (See Program H 3.B in the Programs Section).
Year of Building Code
The City of Palmdale adopted the 2010 California Building Code that includes the 2010
Title 24 amendments.
Reasonable Accommodation Procedures
The City of Palmdale has adopted a reasonable accommodation procedure, Section
26.10 of the Zoning Ordinance.
B.       Nongovernmental Constraints
1.       Housing Market
The principal constraint on housing development in Palmdale in 2012 is the collapse of
the housing market. Thousands of Palmdale homes have been foreclosed since 2007
and even in 2011 there were with 2,958 in default, foreclosure or REO.19 In 2008, so
many houses were vacant and abandoned that the Palmdale City Council passed an
ordinance requiring that owners of vacant units register and maintain the units. This
ordinance became effective in March 2008.
A comparison between housing sales in Table H-19A and H-19B in the Housing
Characteristics section shows a substantial increase in the number sold in February
2008 and in December 2011. The same tables show a sharp and continuing price
decrease between February 2008 and December 2011 with a decline of 38% in zip
code 93550, 39.6% in zip code 93551 and 57.3% in zip code 93552. Table 19A shows
that the 2008 prices had already declined sharply from the 2007 level.
Housing construction has slowed to 1997-1998 levels. According to DOF, 1,130 new
housing units were built in 2006 and 876 units in 2007. In 2008 a total of 534 units were
permitted, 261 units were constructed in 2009, 153 units in 2010 and 108 units in 2011.

Applications for tentative subdivision tract maps also dropped between 2007 and 2008.
In the six months between October 2006 and March 2007, there were 14 applications
totaling 204.31 acres and 1,443 single-family lots. Between October 2007 and March
2008, the number of applications dropped to six, comprising 127 acres and 579 single-
family lots. Only one application was submitted between January and March of 2008.
Developers with approved subdivision tract maps in Palmdale have been requesting
and receiving extensions. Additionally, in July 2008, SB1185 was adopted providing a
12-month legislative time extension to qualifying maps; in July 2009, AB333 provided a
24-month legislative time extension and in July 2011, AB 208 provided a second 24-
month legislative time extension to qualifying maps. There have also been several
applications for new tract map approvals in 2011, indicating that at least a few
developers believe that markets will recover within the three years they have to act on
an approved tract map.
2.      Public Opposition to Multifamily Housing
According to City staff, a vocal section of Palmdale’s public objects not just to low-
income multifamily construction but also to all multifamily construction. The fear is that
such buildings could affect the value of nearby single-family homes. Public opposition
to multifamily construction is a powerful constraint on housing provision in Palmdale; not
only did it lead to a two-year moratorium on multifamily development between 1999 and
2001 but it also resulted in rezoning of land in some areas designated for multifamily
use from 16 units to 10 units per acre and redesignation of areas zoned for multifamily
development into single-family designations.
City Efforts to Mitigate Constraint
Public opposition to multifamily housing development in Palmdale mobilizes around site-
specific development. Staff reports on new development projects therefore go into
great detail on the need for affordable housing as identified in the Housing Element and
on current housing law that requires the community to plan and provide housing for all
sectors of the community. These staff reports are made available to the public on the
City’s website in the posted agendas for Planning Commission and City Council
meetings. The public is further advised by staff presentations at public hearings.
I3.     Land Cost
A staff review of vacant land prices over six years found prices in 2006 and 2007
ranged between $120,000 to $263,000 per acre or between $2.75 and $6.04 per
square foot. These are very low prices compared to prices in the City of Santa Clarita
where land costs vary from $10 to $30 per square foot according to City of Santa Clarita
planning staff. No comparable data on land cost is available for 2011.

Housing
4.       Cost of Construction
Tables H-47 and H-48 show the cost to construct single and multifamily housing in
2011. A combination of changes in land, labor and materials cost along with high fees
and low-density zoning have driven construction costs for multifamily housing so high
that new rental housing probably couldn’t be supported by market rents at 10 to 16 units
per acre. With a minimum density of 30 dwelling units per acre, it is much more likely
that a market rental project, now estimated at $152,888 per unit, would be feasible.
Even though their costs are much higher, builders with low-income housing tax credits
can still make a profit from building affordable units because their projects are financed
with large equity investments, deferred loans and low-cost debt. Market rate developers
with expensive conventional mortgages and the expectation of substantial cash flow
would need high rent payments to support their buildings.
With the cost of a new single-family home now estimated at $288,372 before builder’s
profit, Palmdale has lost one of its unique advantages, the ability to provide affordable
new homes to the county’s moderate-income families. But the high fees that are part of
the cost of new units reflect the real cost of growth in Palmdale: the need to provide new
schools, parks and infrastructure. Palmdale doesn’t yet have a citywide drainage
system to prevent flooding so some developers must dedicate a portion of their
properties to drainage. In undeveloped areas developers must pay to bring water,
sewer and power to their raw land developments.
5.       Finance
Construction and Permanent Financing for Subdivisions and Multifamily Housing
Given that the inventory of unsold foreclosed, short-listed and general resale homes is
still high locally and nationwide and a continued decline in Palmdale and Los Angeles
County home prices, the availability of finance for new market rate single and multi-
family construction is difficult to assess. Constraints on development are not primarily
due to lack of construction finance but due to lack of a market for new or resale homes.
Given the housing market decline, it is very unlikely that builders will construct market
rate multifamily housing in the next few years. Constraints on multifamily construction
are probably due both to low densities (between 2000 and 2008 the highest density
available for multifamily construction was 16 DU per acre) and to competition from
vacant single-family homes. Nearly half of renter-occupied units in Palmdale are single-
family homes. No new market rate multifamily rentals were built in Palmdale between
2000 and 2008. Single-family construction has also declined steeply and most
approved subdivision tract map applications have been put on hold or have requested
time extensions.
                                            H-136
Adopted by City Council
09/05/12

                                                                                          Housing
In the next two years, Palmdale will build additional low and moderate multifamily units
funded by tax-credits, Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside funds and a variety of other
public sources. A number of these projects have already been approved. According to
several experts in tax credit finance20, in 2008 tax credit investments were yielding
about 70 cents on the dollar; in 2011 the yield is probably one dollar of equity for every
dollar of tax credit.
Since 2006, the Palmdale Community Redevelopment Agency has received approval
for 591 multi-family units; 314 units for seniors and 277 family units. Land has been
purchased and consolidated for an additional 142 senior units. Of the approved units,
all 314 senior units have been constructed. The remainder of the family units are
anticipated to be built between 2012 and 2014 to comply with the objectives of the City’s
Redevelopment Implementation Plan. Ground breaking on 156 apartments and 121
townhomes took place in February 2012. There are no other approved multifamily
developments.
The State of California Department of Housing and Community Development issued
Notices of Funding Availability (NOFA) for a variety of bond program including the
Multifamily Housing Program (MHP) funded by Proposition C in 2011. The total amount
available for the MHP Program was $80 million. NOFAs have not yet been issued for
2012.
6.       Single-Family Mortgages
Help for Foreclosures
In 2012, help for families in Palmdale facing foreclosure is as important as the
availability of mortgages for home purchase. In the past, numerous newspaper articles
and blogs such as the L.A. Land blog on the Los Angeles Times website have pointed
out that for homeowners with resetting ARM mortgages who are upside down (owe
more than the home is worth), the best option may be to simply walk away. The penalty
for foreclosure isn’t overly severe, FHA eligibility criteria only require two years since a
foreclosure and three years since a bankruptcy.
However, those who want to save their homes from foreclosure need information and
competent mortgage counseling. Resources for free mortgage counseling on line and
by phone include:
       The "HOPE Hotline" (1-888-995-HOPE or www.995HOPE.org), which provides
       free mortgage counseling 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

      websites that provide information both for prospective homebuyers and for
      homeowners facing difficulties: www.yourhome.ca.gov and www.sucasa.ca.gov.
Current Mortgage Lending Standards
Surprisingly, FHA insured loans still provide very low (3%) or even no downpayment
loans. Borrowers only have to be two years from a foreclosure and three years from a
bankruptcy.     The income to mortgage payment ratio is now 29% of gross income
without consumer debt included and 41% of gross income including all other debt
payments.
Many buyers now search for mortgage loans on line and current interest rates are
published on a variety of mortgage lending sites. The latest entry into the online
mortgage business is Zillow, a free web-based service that provides geo-coded real
estate information. Zillow has added a new service that allows buyers to request loan
offers from lenders who are part of Zillow's service. Potential borrowers enter their data
and get back loan terms from lenders. Interest rates for a 30-year fixed-rate loan
quoted on Zillow’s website on March 7, 2012 ranged from 3.375% to 4.0%.
Although some buyers may have trouble finding an affordable loan, uncertainty about
the direction of housing prices in a period when headlines in the newspapers and
broadcast news programs regularly predict further price decreases is probably having a
greater effect on home purchase than problems with obtaining a loan.

VIII.  GOALS, OBJECTIVES, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
A.      Appropriateness of Goals, Objectives and Policies
In the following sections, the City sets forth its goals, objectives, policies and programs
for 2006-2014. As always, the City is able to provide sufficient sites for its fair share of
new housing development.
Palmdale will provide adequate sites to meet its Regional Housing Needs Assessment
allocation, amending its Zoning Ordinance to comply with requirements to rezone sites
for the lower income housing allocation at a minimum of 30 dwelling units per acre.
Palmdale’s new Transit Village Specific Plan already allows this higher density for
townhouse and mixed-use development. New construction of affordable units will be
directed to the Transit Village and to infill sites in existing developed areas.
Housing production follows a somewhat seesaw pattern in Palmdale as in much of the
SCAG region. This Housing Element has been drafted during a time when both
housing production and housing sales are very low, the unsold housing inventory is at
record highs region wide, and Palmdale homeowners are still experiencing mortgage
defaults and foreclosures. Despite a very low level of current market rate development,
Palmdale has a substantial pipeline of approved subdivisions and, based on information
from real estate publications and websites, expects that housing production may
increase beginning in 2014.
The City has responded to the problem of vacant foreclosed homes with an ordinance
requiring owners of foreclosed properties to register and maintain their properties.
Grant funding provided by the Neighborhood Stabilization Program will enable the City
of Palmdale to offer residents homebuyer education workshops given by housing
specialists from ClearPoint Credit Counseling Solutions. The grant will cover the
delivery of three workshops each year for three years, along with the accompanying
individualized,     home       pre-purchase          counseling       sessions.   ClearPoint
www.ClearPointCCS.org. is a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD)-approved housing counseling agency.
In the eight and a half years covered by this Housing Element, the City will continue to
focus resources on housing rehabilitation and infrastructure improvements in targeted
older neighborhoods. A new program, Partners for a Better Palmdale, will work on
youth outreach and community building in distressed neighborhoods.
The City will develop affordable multifamily rental housing for families and seniors in
accordance with current funded commitments.

Housing Division will implement the following programs on an ongoing basis to conserve
its affordable housing stock. The efforts listed below represent a varied strategy to
mitigate potential loss of “at-risk” units due to conversion to market-rate units. These
local efforts utilize existing City and local resources. They include efforts to secure
additional resources from the public and private sector should they become available.

Program H5.D: Transitional and Supportive Housing Facilities
Pursuant to California SB 2, amend the Zoning Ordinance to permit the development of
Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing facilities in all residential zones by right.
The current ordinance limiting such facilities to the R-3 zone and requiring a Conditional
Use Permit violates State law. The Zoning Ordinance will be revised for compliance
with State Law (SB 2). Currently the City has no definition of or provision for Supportive
Housing. The Zoning Ordinance Amendment will allow both Transitional Housing and
Supportive Housing within all zones that permit residential uses (A-1 (Light Agriculture),
R-1 (Single Family Residential), R-2 (Medium Residential), R-3 (Multiple Residential)
and R-4). Within the A-1 and R-1 zones, Transitional and Supportive Housing will be a
permitted use within a single-family dwelling unit. Within the R-2, R-3 and R-4 zones,
Transitional and Supportive Housing located within four or fewer units will be permitted
with an Administrative approval and within 5 or more units with Site Plan Review
approval. The approval process for Transitional and Supportive Housing will be
therefore be consistent with the requirements for any other type of residential use within
the respective zones.

Program H5.F: Homeless Persons Facilities Designation
Pursuant to California SB 2, amend the Zoning Ordinance to identify zoning
designations where emergency shelters for the homeless may be built by right.
Currently, the City’s Zoning Ordinance allows Homeless Shelters within the PF (Public
Facilities), C-3 (General Commercial), C-5 (Service Commercial) and M-1 (Light
Industrial) zones with a Conditional Use Permit. The City will amend the Zoning
Ordinance to allow Homeless Shelters within the C-2 (Office Commercial) zone without
a Conditional Use Permit and allow Homeless Shelters within the R-3 (Multiple
Residential) with a Conditional Use Permit. Section 94.04 of the Zoning Ordinance
would be amended to reduce the distance separation requirement between Homeless
Shelters to 300 feet and remove the distance separation requirements to Transitional or
Supportive Housing, schools and single family residential uses.

        public structures.
        Policy H5.4.2: Provide assistance to lower income households in retrofitting their
        homes for handicapped access.

Program H5.G: Handicap Access to Housing
A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a disability
when the application of a zoning law or other land use regulation, policy or practice acts
as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. Section 26.10 of the Zoning Ordinance,
adopted in 2004, establishes a formal procedure for persons with disabilities seeking
equal access to housing to request reasonable accommodation in the application of the
City’s Zoning Ordinance and to establish relevant criteria to be used when considering
such requests.

Program H5.H: Residential Care Facilities
Large Residential Care Facilities, also known as assisted living facilities, are currently
permitted within the R-2 and R-3 zones with approval of a Conditional Use Permit.
Senate Bill 520 requires local jurisdictions to identify constraints upon the development
of housing for persons with disabilities and demonstrate local efforts to remove such
constraints. As multifamily housing for five or more units within the R-2 and R-3 are
permitted with Site Plan Review approval, the Zoning Ordinance will be amended to
permit Large Residential Care Facilities without the approval of a Conditional Use
Permit.

IX.     OTHER HOUSING ELEMENT REQUIREMENTS
A.      Redevelopment Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund (Housing Set-
        Aside)
Government Code Section 65583(c) requires “A program which sets forth a five-year
schedule of actions the local government is undertaking or intends to undertake to
implement the policies and achieve the goals and objectives of the Housing Element.
The policies, goals, and objectives of the Housing Element can be addressed through
the administration of land use and development controls, provision of regulatory
concessions and incentives, and the utilization of appropriate federal and state financing
and subsidy programs when available and the utilization of moneys in the low-and
moderate–income housing fund of an agency, if the locality has established a
redevelopment project area pursuant to Community Redevelopment Law (Division 24
commencing with Section 33000 of the Health and Safety Code).
As of June 30, 2009, the Agency had an estimated $17,071,000 available in its
Low/Mod housing fund. Table H-54 below provides estimated expenditures from 2010-
2014 for very low, low and moderate income units:

Implementation of the affordable housing goal will be accomplished through the
development of the affordable housing within the Redevelopment Area as a whole and
the following specific projects:
1.      Courson Connection - 2 parcels remain under Agency control for the
        development of an additional 144 units of affordable housing.
                                            H-166
Adopted by City Council
09/05/12

                                                                                  Housing
2.      Palmdale Medical Center - the Summer Terrace Apartments component of the
        project has been completed, with 80 affordable units reserved for very low- and
        low-income seniors.
3.      Palmdale Transit Village – development of 156 apartment units and 121
        townhomes for purchase by very low, low and moderate income.
The City's Redevelopment Implementation Plan (Plan) is a document adopted by the
City of Palmdale Redevelopment Agency, whose members also serve as the City
Council. It is prepared and adopted every five years to set forth a plan for revenues and
expenditures of the Redevelopment Agency, based on a list of needs and
improvements as specified in the plan. The current plan is an amended plan adopted on
May 4, 2011 for the period of 2010 to 2014 and includes housing compliance objectives.
The project area, which consists of about 7,787 acres of the City, includes retail,
industrial, public and residential properties. The Plan describes a list of improvements
for the Redevelopment Project Area, and projected affordable housing development.
As required by State law, the Plan also reflects that twenty percent of the revenue
generated by tax increment within the Redevelopment Project Area be set aside for
housing projects and programs benefiting low-income residents. These funds are often
called "set-aside" funds in discussion of revenue sources for housing projects. Other
State requirements are that any housing units within the Redevelopment Project Area
that are removed for redevelopment projects must be replaced, and that set-aside funds
be expended for housing projects and programs in proportion to the demographic
characteristics in the community. For example, not all the Redevelopment Set-Aside
funds may be used for one age group, such as seniors, or moderate income, but must
be allocated in a way that reflects the make-up of the general population.
The Palmdale CRA is required to expend over the duration of each Implementation
Plan, Low/Mod housing funds to assist housing that is available to all persons
regardless of age in at least the same proportion as the population under age 65 years
bears to the total population. Because the Project Areas were established before
December 31, 1993, the Agency will have an additional five years (until December 31,
2014) to satisfy this proportionality requirement. Table H-54 provides the senior/non-
senior population distribution within the City as of the 2000 Census, as utilized within the
Redevelopment Implementation Plan. Table H-55 shows the distribution of actual
housing expenditures by age group (senior and non-senior households).

The Housing Element is consistent with the RDA Five Year Plan because many of the
programs and policies contained in the element reflect the provisions of the Amended
Redevelopment Implementation Plan. Specifically, Courson Connection, senior housing
at the Palmdale Medical Center and the Palmdale Transit Village Specific Plan
anticipates the creation of 277 affordable housing units.
B.      Consistency with Other General Plan Elements
As required by state law, the Housing Element has been prepared to be consistent with
other elements of the General Plan. The analysis of adequate sites set forth in the
element is based on the City’s General Plan Land Use map, the goals, objectives and
policies of the Land Use Element and recent revisions to the Land Use map and Zoning
Ordinance approved by City Council along with proposed amendments to the Zoning
Ordinance that are required to ensure compliance with State laws.
Although the Land Use Plan provides a range of land uses to accommodate the needs
of the City’s growing population, recent changes in State law require that the City
provide land zoned at 30 dwelling units per acre to accommodate all of the lower
                                           H-168
Adopted by City Council

                                                                                Housing
income units in the City’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). The City has
identified areas that can be rezoned to accommodate the required number of units at
the required density and will amend its Zoning Ordinance by September 2012, in order
to do so.
The Public Services Element ensures that adequate services will support land uses.
Additionally, the Circulation Element provides for development of adequate
transportation systems for future housing development and the Environmental
Resources Element addresses the related issues of resource conservation and open
space, providing a basis for evaluating existing resources and planning for their
protection. The Public Services Element sets forth policies to ensure adequate services
for schools, libraries, health care and the electric, water, gas, sewer, fire and police
services needed to support development. The Safety Element is concerned with
preparations for man-made and natural disasters including earthquake, flood,
hazardous materials, and fire in order to minimize impacts on City residents. The
Parks, Recreation and Trails Element will guide future development of Palmdale’s
considerable recreational resources. The Noise Element sets guidelines to prevent
noise and land use conflicts. The Community Design Element provides design
guidelines for both residential and commercial development to shape the City’s overall
form and appearance.
New development is evaluated for consistency with all of the elements of the General
Plan. Modifications to any of the elements themselves are evaluated for consistency
with the other remaining elements to ensure that all long-term community goals can be
achieved as the City is built out.
The California legislature abolished all local redevelopment agencies in 2011 and
mandated that their accumulated funds go to the State. Most cities, including Palmdale,
named a successor agency to carry out existing contracts. The Palmdale City Council
is the successor agency to the Palmdale Community Redevelopment Agency. It is
unclear at this time to what extent the successor agency will be responsible for the
housing goals of the disbanded Palmdale Community Redevelopment Agency.
Consistency with Objectives of the City’s Land Use Element:
        Updating the Housing Element responds to the changing needs of the City and
        incorporates revisions to SCAG’s Regional Housing Needs Assessment Land
        Use Policy L1.1.3.
        Programs are included to provide down payment assistance and low-interest
        mortgage loans to qualifying low-income households; promote the use of
        alternative housing concepts; offer density bonuses to housing developers in
        exchange for long-term housing affordability; acquire land for production of new
                                          H-169
                                                               Adopted by City Council
                                                                                09/05/12

Housing
       senior housing; and to promote affordable housing for existing and future City
       residents in accordance with Land Use Objective L3.1.
       The Senior Housing Construction Program promotes development of senior
       housing near Courson Park in close proximity to the senior center and public
       transportation in accordance with Land Use Element Policy L3.2.2.
       The Neighborhood Improvement Program provides incentives that promote infill
       development by acquiring lots and extending infrastructure for new units
       constructed by nonprofit housing advocates in accordance with Land Use Policy
       L2.3.1.b.
       The Mobile Home Park and Homeownership and Rehabilitation Program protects
       affordability levels at existing mobile home parks by providing operating subsidies
       in three mobile home parks owned by the Palmdale Housing Authority in
       accordance with Land Use Objective L3.3.
       The Housing Element identifies housing that is supported by adequate public
       services and facilities as promoted under Goal PS1 of the Public Services
       Element.
       The Housing Element provides for mixed use in the Transit Village Specific Plan,
       maximizing use of infrastructure systems in accordance with Public Services
       Policy PS1.3.6.
       The Partners Against Crime and Neighborhood Improvement Programs promote
       the upkeep and proper maintenance of the City’s housing stock in accordance
       with Safety Element Policy S4.1.3.
       The Neighborhood Improvement Program promotes Community Design Element
       Goal CD1 by improving the quality of selected low and moderate-income single-
       family neighborhoods. This contributes to the City’s economic vitality and
       enhances the quality of life for all residents.
C.     Priority for Water and Sewer
To facilitate effective coordination between the City of Palmdale and water and sewer
service agencies, the City provided notice of its intent to update the Housing Element to
the Palmdale Water District and the County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County.
As the higher density zones required to accommodate the City’s RHNA assessment for
very low and low income units is entirely located within the boundaries of the Palmdale
Water District (PWD), additional consultation with PWD was conducted. Additionally, a
                                             H-170

water supply assessment was requested from PWD in relation to the Environmental
Impact Report that is being prepared for the Housing Element Update.
GC Section 65589.7(a) requires that: “The Housing Element adopted by the legislative
body and any amendments made to that element shall be immediately delivered to all
public agencies or private entities that provide water or sewer services for municipal and
industrial uses, including residential, within the territory of the legislative body.” Within
30-days of the adoption of the updating Housing Element, the City of Palmdale will
ensure of copy of the Housing Element is provided to all water and sewer providers.
The provision of the updated Housing Element will help ensure that Urban Water
Management Plans prepared by water providers will include projected water use for
both single-family and multifamily housing needed for lower-income households.

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
The Parks, Recreation and Trails Element of the General Plan will serve to guide future
development of parks, recreational facilities, multi-use trails, bikeways and open space
areas to serve the recreation needs of existing and future city residents. This element is
an optional General Plan Element, authorized by Section 65303 of the California
Government Code represents the eighth element of the City's General Plan. The goals,
objectives and policies of each of the other elements of the General Plan have been
integrated here to the extent that they affect parks, recreation, trails and open space.
Specifically, the Parks, Recreation and Trails Element serves the following purposes:
1.     The Parks, Recreation and Trails Element informs the public of the City's goals,
       objectives, and policies for development of future parks, recreational facilities and
       the like, and it will provide a basis for funding prioritization and program
       development.
2.     The Parks, Recreation and Trails Element includes the City's Local Open Space
       Plan as required by Section 65560 of the California Government Code.
3.     The Element provides standards for the development of multi-use trails and
       bikeways and establishes the general alignment of these facilities. With this
       information, the City can better compete for State and Federal grants which fund
       construction of these recreation features.
4.     The element serves as an informational document for city residents and other
       interested groups and individuals in determining how future parks and
       recreational facilities will be designed and constructed.
                                             PRT-1               Adopted by City Council
                                                                                     9/24/03
                                                                        Parks, Recreation,
                                                                                  and Trails
SECTION 2: GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
GOAL PRT1: Provide adequate parks to meet the needs of existing and future
residents. (Objective PS5.4)
Objective PRT1.1: Adopt and implement a standard of 5 acres of parkland per 1,000
population for the City (Policy PS5.4.1).
        Policy PRT1.1.1: Of the 5 acres/1,000 population, active park land must
        comprise no less than 3 acres per 1,000 population; open space may comprise 1
        acre per 1,000 population; and the remainder can be composed of other public
        recreational facilities including Desert Aire Golf Course, portions of school sites
        which provide recreation facilities or play fields accessible to the public, or other
        comparable facilities. Of the 3 acre/1,000 population standard for active park
        land, develop 2 acres as community or specialty parks and 1 acre as
        neighborhood parks.
        Policy PRT1.1.2: Ensure that park sites are located equitably, throughout the
        City, to maximize access to parks for all residents.
        Policy PRT1.1.3: Provide a variety of parks throughout the City, including
        community and neighborhood parks, to meet the needs of all residents.
        Policy PRT1.1.4: Adopt the park standards, described in Table PRT-1, which
        establish the type of parks and adopt the guidelines for the facilities to be
        developed in future parks.
Objective PRT1.2: Explore various means of acquiring parkland and seek creative and
flexible techniques to accomplish City park goals.
        Policy PRT1.2.1: Collect park fees and review this fee annually, to provide
        financing for improvement of parkland in Palmdale (Policy PS5.4.4).
        Policy PRT1.2.2: Consider formation of a city-wide public financing district to
        provide funding for design, acquisition, construction and maintenance of parks
        throughout the City.
        Policy PRT1.2.3: Continue to use the City's Capital Improvement Program as
        the mechanism for short-term planning for acquisition of park land and
        construction of park facilities.
                                            PRT-2                Adopted by City Council
                                                                                     9/24/03
Parks, Recreation,
and Trails
      Policy PRT1.2.4: Where appropriate, remodel or recycle existing vacant
      buildings, such as large retail or industrial buildings, for recreation uses.
      Policy PRT1.2.5: When reviewing reclamation plans for quarries, incorporate
      provisions which allow reclaimed quarries to be used for appropriate recreational
      purposes.
      Policy PRT1.2.6: Consider the following criteria when evaluating future park
      sites for acquisition or dedication. In the event that a park site is proposed for
      dedication in lieu of payment of park fees, the proponent of the project shall
      provide information, to the satisfaction of the Director of Parks and Recreation
      and the Director of Planning, in order that the criteria listed below may be
      evaluated.
      1.     Physical Considerations. The physical aspects of a proposed park site
             shall be suitable for development as a park. Access, infrastructure and
             topography will be evaluated pursuant to the following criteria:
             a.     Street Access: Community parks should have access from major or
                    secondary arterial roadways. Neighborhood parks should have
                    access from secondary arterial or collector roadways. Mini-parks
                    may be accessed from local streets or cul-de-sacs. Park sites shall
                    also be located to provide maximum accessibility from the areas to
                    be served, meaning that they shall not be inaccessible to adjacent
                    neighborhoods by virtue of development patterns, street layouts,
                    block walls or other obstructions to accessibility.
             b.     Availability of Infrastructure: Park sites should be located in
                    proximity to utility connections and along existing dedicated
                    roadways. Where infrastructure is not available, the cost of
                    providing adequate infrastructure to the site shall be considered in
                    evaluating the suitability of the site.
             c.     Size of the Proposed Site: The park site should be of adequate
                    size to accommodate the facilities needed within the area to be
                    served, including but not limited to active and passive play areas,
                    picnic areas, parking areas, structures, and adequate setbacks or
                    buffers from neighboring land uses.
Adopted by City Council                    PRT-3
9/24/03
                                                            Parks, Recreation,
                                                                     and Trails
   d.     Suitability of the Natural Terrain: The natural terrain of the
          proposed park site should be such that the site can be developed
          without requiring extensive grading or recontouring of the natural
          topography.
2. Land Use Considerations. Future park sites shall be compatible with
   surrounding land uses and shall be in conformance with adopted local and
   regional plans. Prior to acceptance or acquisition of future park sites, the
   sites will be evaluated to determine their appropriateness from a land use
   perspective, based on the following criteria:
   a.     Compliance with applicable plans: Proposed park sites shall be in
          conformance with any adopted Master Facilities Plan for Parks,
          applicable Specific Plan City's General Plan, and any adopted
          regional or subregional plan.
   b.     Capacity to Serve Multiple Functions: Where feasible, the park site
          should be located and/or designed to accommodate other public
          services/facilities such as drainage basins, fire stations,
          maintenance yards, trail staging areas, etc.
   c.     Local Population Density: The location of future park sites should
          consider the surrounding population density. More park acreage is
          needed to serve recreation demand in areas of high density
          residential development. In areas with relatively low density
          development, fewer park sites are required.
   d.     Location of Other Parks, Availability of Other Recreational
          Amenities: Consideration shall be given to the proximity of school
          sites or other parks, including parks under the jurisdiction of other
          local agencies. The availability of other recreational amenities such
          as private facilities and recreational amenities within common open
          space in multi-family developments should also be considered in
          selecting or accepting a park site.
   e.     Neighborhood Acceptance: The proposed park site shall be
          compatible with the existing neighborhood in that it should provide
          recreational amenities which are suitable to and acceptable to a
          consensus of the neighborhood.
                                 PRT-4               Adopted by City Council
                                                                        9/24/03
Parks, Recreation,
and Trails
            f.     Consideration of Alternative Sites:          Prior to acceptance or
                   acquisition of a site, an alternatives analysis shall be performed by
                   the proponent of the site to determine if there are other more
                   suitable locations within the applicable Park Planning Area which
                   are better suited to be developed as a park. In the event that the
                   alternatives analysis demonstrates that there are better alternative
                   locations for park land development, those locations will be
                   disclosed by the Director of Parks and Recreation to the City
                   Council, prior to any action on the site in question.
            g.     Logical Progression of Development:           In the event that the
                   proposed park site is to be acquired and held for a period of time
                   prior to development (land banking), the site shall be evaluated to
                   determine when, according to a logical progression of development,
                   the demand will exist for development of the site.
      3.    Cost Considerations. The cost of acquisition and development of the site
            shall be determined. In addition, a reasonable assessment of the
            opportunities which will be foregone by committing to the proposed action
            shall be made.
            a.     Cost/Method of Acquisition: The cost of any proposed park site, as
                   well as the proposed method of acquisition, shall be evaluated to
                   determine whether acquisition of a proposed site is fiscally sound.
                   The cost for acquisition of park sites shall be based on fair market
                   value as determined by a qualified appraiser.
            b.     Proportion of Developed Parkland vs. Banked Land: Prior to
                   acquisition or acceptance of dedication of park land which will be
                   banked to fill future recreation needs, an evaluation shall be made
                   to determine the proportion of existing banked park acreage
                   compared to existing developed park land. Where the proportion of
                   banked land is higher than the proportion of developed land, that
                   information shall be disclosed by the Director of Parks and
                   Recreation to the City Council prior to acceptance of the site in
                   question.
            c.     Use of Undevelopable Property:             Where property which is
                   constrained from development because of topography, geological
                   hazards, flood hazards, excessive noise levels, or other similar
                   environmental conditions is proposed as a park site, the purchase

                                                                                 and Trails
SECTION 3: IMPLEMENTATION MEASURES
The following section contains specific implementation measures for the City to follow in
order to achieve the goals and objectives related to land use as established in this
Element.
A.     Funding Sources
Implementation of many of the goals, objectives and policies described in Section 2 will
require funding for acquisition of land, construction of facilities, maintenance of facilities
or administration of programs. Funding can come from a variety of sources: the City's
General Fund, park land in-lieu fees, other impact fees, public financing districts, and
grants. Several of these funding mechanisms are described below.
       1.     Review of the Park Land In-lieu Fee: The City has in place a requirement
              that new development contribute to providing park land for its residents
              (Ordinance 505). To meet this requirement, developers may either
              dedicate park land or pay an in-lieu fee to the City for acquisition or
              construction of park sites. At the present time, this fee is $1,019 per
              bedroom for single family residences, $1,115 per bedroom for duplex or
              triplex units and $1,052 per bedroom for apartments. At the present time,
              the fee amount can be adjusted on an annual basis according to change
              in the Consumer Price Index.
              State law requires that impact fees assessed against new development
              must show a "nexus," or a connection, between the actual impact of the
              development and the remedy for that impact. In this case, the impact of
              new development is to cause the need for new parks in the amount of not
              less than 3 acres of active park land per 1,000 residents, according to
              Policy PRT1.1.1. The remedy for this impact is to dedicate and improve 3
              acres of park land per each 1,000 residents who will reside in the
              development or to pay a fee which will result in the provision of 3 acres of
              park land per each 1,000 new residents. The existing park land in-lieu fee
              should be reviewed to ensure that it adequately reflects this standard. If
              appropriate, adjustments to the fee should be made to ensure that it
              represents the nexus, as required by law, between the impact of new
              development and the remedy of that impact.
       2.     Use of Grants: Another method of acquiring funding for development of
              recreational amenities is the use of grant monies. There are a variety of
              grant programs, enabled through legislation such as the Interstate
                                          PRT-17                   Adopted by City Council
                                                                                     9/24/03
Parks, Recreation,
and Trails
             Transportation Enhancement Act (ISTEA) and the Land and Water
             Conservation Fund Act. These programs specifically set aside money to
             acquire and/or develop open space areas, trails or bikeways. The City
             should actively seek out these grant programs and submit appropriate
             projects for funding consideration. Although competition for these dollars
             can be high, the use of grants may be the only mechanism available to
             fund certain projects where the priority for funding through other sources is
             low.
      3.     Use of Public Financing Mechanisms: Public financing districts, such as
             assessment districts and Mello-Roos districts, can be a source of revenue
             for acquisition and construction of parks, recreation facilities, trails and
             open space. These districts place a special tax or assessment on
             properties which benefit from these facilities. The tax or assessment is
             paid by the property owner over a number of years until the bonds which
             were used to finance the improvements are paid. In 2002, Palmdale
             voters approved a citywide assessment to finance construction of two
             parks, one 31-acre park near 40th Street East and Avenue S, and the
             other a 40-acre expansion of Marie Kerr Park at 30th Street West and
             Rancho Vista Boulevard. A public financing district is proposed on the
             Ritter Ranch Specific Plan site to fund a range of infrastructure
             improvements including parks and trails.
      4.     Use of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds: Community
             Development Block Grants are issued under a federal grant program
             administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
             (HUD). These grants can be used to provide infrastructure improvements
             such as streets and sidewalks, assistance to local business and service
             organizations, or a variety of other projects which provide direct benefits to
             low income residents within eligible census tracts, as determined by HUD.
             Accordingly, CDBG funds can be used to construct parks or provide
             recreation programs in certain portions of the City. The City qualifies as
             an "entitlement" city under HUD regulations, which provides more control
             over the local expenditure of CDBG funds. In the future, these funds may
             be an important source of revenue for parks and/or park programs.
B.    Implementation of the Park Acquisition and Improvement Plan, the Trails
      Plan, the Bikeway Plan and the Open Space Plan:
      1.     Park Acquisition and Improvement Plan: Exhibit PRT-1 shows how the
             residentially designated areas within the City have been delineated into
Adopted by City Council                  PRT-18
9/24/03
                                                             Parks, Recreation,
                                                                     and Trails
   Park Planning Areas. The boundaries of the Park Planning Areas were
   determined by factors such as physical barriers, development demand
   and differences in land use intensity. The delineation of park planning
   areas will assist in determining priorities for development of active park
   lands. The Park Planning Areas will form the basis for implementing the
   Park Acquisition and Improvement Plan as it relates to location of park
   land throughout the City. Determination of the type of park and the degree
   of improvements on a specific site should be based on the park standards
   shown on Table PRT-1.
2. Multi-use Trails Plan: Exhibit PRT-2 depicts the Multi-use Trails Plan for
   the City. This Plan will be the basis for constructing a trail system
   throughout the City which links to existing and currently planned trails in
   unincorporated portions of Los Angeles County and the City of Lancaster.
   Exhibit PRT-2 shows general trail alignments; specific locations of
   easements will need to be determined through subsequent planning
   efforts. The trails plan includes trails within the Planning Area which have
   been esignated by Los Angeles County, trails planned for the Ritter
   Ranch and City Ranch Specific Plan areas, and trails proposed by the
   City. All trails shown in the Planning Area, including those designated by
   Los Angeles County, are subject to the goals, objectives and policies
   contained in Section 2.
3. Bikeway Plan: The City's backbone bikeway network is also shown on
   Exhibit PRT-2. This network is linked to the City's Multi-use Trails System
   and bikeways from Lancaster. In addition, local bikeway network planning
   areas have been identified on Exhibit PRT-2. In these areas, local
   bikeway networks can be established, connecting neighborhood parks,
   schools and shopping areas. Local bikeway networks can be delineated
   through comprehensive development plans or specific planning efforts
   such as the case of the Ritter Ranch and City Ranch Specific Plan areas.
   By planning bikeways on a local scale, more attention can be paid to
   constraints such as existing development patterns, roadways with rights-
   of-way widths which are insufficient to allow the safe passage of bicycles,
   and any physical barriers which would restrict safe access.
   Adopted bikeway standards will be those recommended in the State of
   California Highway Design Manual, Chapter 1000.
4. Local Open Space Plan: The Local Open Space Plan, attached as
   Appendix A, provides a compilation of existing General Plan policies which
                                PRT-19                 Adopted by City Council
                                                                        9/24/03
Parks, Recreation,
and Trails
            direct development in areas where opportunities to preserve open space
            may exist. For example, hillside areas, the rift zone and flood hazard
            areas contain development constraints which could translate into open
            space corridors.       The Local Open Space Plan will serve as a
            comprehensive reference guide for City staff, developers and members of
            the community when assessing development projects proposed
            throughout the City. This plan will help coordinate efforts to provide open
            space and recreation opportunities to residents, as well as preserving
            sensitive habitats and species, where present. Open space opportunities
            exist in the Ritter Ridge, Portal Ridge, Little Rock Wash, Big Rock Wash
            and Alpine Butte areas and along the San Andreas Rift Zone and hillside
            areas. All available regional, state and federal funding will be solicited in
            order to acquire targeted significant ecological areas. Additionally, the
            City may require dedication of open space, when appropriate, as a part of
            the development review process.
C.    Reservation of Land for Park Sites, Trails and Open Space
      1.    Development Review Process: Prior to approval of any land use
            entitlement application, City staff reviews the application for compliance
            with existing city regulations, standards and policies. During this process,
            the City can apply conditions of approval which act to implement the City's
            regulations, standards and policies, including the policies contained
            herein. Through a development's conditions of approval, the City can
            ensure that adequate easements are reserved for trails, that sufficient land
            is set aside for parks (or that sufficient in-lieu fees are paid to provide for
            off-site parks), and that development is configured in such a way as to
            maintain areas which should be left as open space. To the extent
            permissible by State law and City regulation or policy, the development
            review process serves as an essential tool in implementation of this
            element.
      2.    CEQA: The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Division 13 of
            the Public Resources Code) was passed in 1970 to protect the quality of
            the environment. The City will continue to implement CEQA as it is
            amended from time to time, through adoption of City CEQA guidelines and
            procedures. As part of the City's CEQA procedure, site-specific special
            reports may be required prior to approval of development applications to
            determine areas of sensitive environmental resources where acquisition of
            open space may be warranted. The City requires biological assessments
            and reports for projects in known or suspected natural habitat areas prior
Adopted by City Council                  PRT-20
9/24/03
                                                                  Parks, Recreation,
                                                                           and Trails
         to project approval. These reports will be used to establish significant
         natural habitat areas and ecologically sensitive zones in order to prevent
         disturbance and degradation of these areas. Recommended mitigation
         measures as identified in the reports will be required to be implemented as
         development occurs.
         In addition, the CEQA process assesses the impacts of proposed projects
         on parks and recreational facilities, and conformance of projects with
         approved plans, such as the Multi-use Trails and Bikeways Plans.
         Therefore, the CEQA process can act to trigger dedication of parkland or
         reservation of trail easements.
   3.    Hillside Ordinance: The City has developed a Hillside Ordinance to
         protect the hillsides from insensitive development.           The ordinance
         contains standards which will apply to areas with a natural slope of 10
         percent or more. In addition to safety benefits, these standards will help to
         preserve open space, natural grades, scenic views and visually prominent
         landforms, and prevent landslide and erosion hazards. The ordinance
         also encourages density clustering to allow contiguous open space areas
         to remain undisturbed.
   4.    Circulation Element: Bikeways located adjacent to public streets can be
         shown on the right-of-way cross-sections established in the Circulation
         Element for arterial roadways. Once shown on the Circulation Element
         cross-section, acquisition or dedication of adequate right-of-way for
         construction of bikeways will be facilitated. However, modification of these
         roadway cross-sections will require a General Plan amendment.
D. Other Implementation Methods
   1.    Memoranda of Understanding with Local School Districts: Memoranda of
         Understanding (MOU) provide a formal basis for shared use of
         recreational facilities between the City and the various school districts.
         This formal arrangement provides a mechanism for obligating funding for
         joint use facilities in exchange for agreements providing access to those
         facilities to either the general public, in the case where the City provides
         facilities on school sites, or for district students, should school districts
         construct recreational facilities on adjacent park sites, or provide school
         property for development as a park. Use of MOUs can ensure that the
         City and the school districts achieve their recreation goals at a reduced
         cost to both parties.
                                      PRT-21                Adopted by City Council
                                                                              9/24/03
Parks, Recreation,
and Trails
      2.     Encourage Implementation by Volunteers:            The bulk of the goals,
             objectives and policies contained in this element can be implemented
             through volunteer efforts of the City's residents. Volunteers can, among
             other things, supervise recreation programs, construct and maintain trails,
             direct organized youth and adult sports programs, and raise funds for
             acquisition and/or construction of a variety of recreational facilities.
             Although volunteers currently play an important role in the City in providing
             recreation programs, that role can be greatly expanded to affect a wide
             range of other recreationally-related programs and needs. The City must
             make a conscious effort to more fully utilize its most valuable resource, the
             energy and ability of its residents, in order to implement this element in a
             timely manner.
      3.     Implementation of Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) Requirements:
             The ADA, adopted in 1991 by Congress, requires that all public facilities
             be accessible to all members of society, including those people with
             physical handicaps. The public facilities, including parks, which are
             administered by the City of Palmdale fall within the requirements of this
             legislation. Therefore, the City is in the process of determining which
             facilities must be retrofitted to be in compliance with ADA requirements.
             With regard to parks, most existing facilities require some modifications to
             the parking area, and in some cases, replacement of playground
             equipment is necessary. The priority and timing of these modifications
             has not yet been established. To a certain degree, the priorities will be
             established through the goals, objectives and policies contained in this
             element.
E.    Standards for Park Development
      The standards and guidelines contained in Table PRT-1 should be considered for
      acquisition of park sites and construction of park improvements. These
      standards should be reviewed by staff and local decision-makers periodically
      (every three to five years), to ensure that the standards are in line with current
      community needs.

F.       Prioritization Criteria
The Park, Recreation and Trails Element's Goals, objectives and policies call for the
construction of a wide range of facilities throughout the community. Since funding
levels will probably not allow construction of the entire bikeway networks or all proposed
parks at any one time, these facilities will be constructed in phases. Therefore, since

4.       Other Public Recreational Facilities
In addition to the recreational opportunities provided by the City, there are other public
facilities and public lands which provide recreational benefits to Palmdale residents, as
described below and depicted on Exhibit PRT-1.
         Schools: Currently there are twenty-four public schools in the City of Palmdale:
         seventeen elementary schools, five middle schools, and two high schools.
         These schools, as well as the schools located in Lancaster and unincorporated
         portions of the County, offer areas for active recreation for school students.
         However, access to some schools and/or school recreation facilities is limited
         during hours when schools are closed, and restricted to enrolled students during
         school hours. The City maintains agreements with the High School District and
         the Westside Union School District for joint use of school and park facilities.
         Although no formal agreement exists with the Palmdale School District, the City
         and the District do cooperate to provide joint use of facilities.
         AVUHSD owns the seven-acre Palmdale Youth Pony League Field located on
         20th Street East, south of Palmdale Boulevard. The League and the City are co-
         lessees. The City maintains the turf and assists with general upkeep and repair
         of the facility.
         County Parks: Los Angeles County maintains a number of neighborhood and
         community parks in the incorporated portions of the Antelope Valley. These
         parks are designed to serve the communities surrounding the City; however, City
         residents can enjoy these facilities as well. At the present time, several of these
         parks are facing reductions in services or closure due to County budget
         constraints.
                 George Lane Park is located at 5520 West Avenue L-8 in Quartz Hill and
                 covers 15 acres. The facility includes a recreation building, game courts,
                 a picnic area, a play lot and a swimming pool.

                                                                            and Trails
        Jackie Robinson Park, located at 8773 East Avenue R in Littlerock,
        covers a 9.2 acre site. The park provides a community building, picnic
        area, and game courts.
        Everett Martin Park provides a swimming pool and pool building on a 6.7
        acre site located at 35548 North 92nd Street East, in Littlerock.
        Pearblossom Park is located at 33922 121st Street East. The 7.8 acre
        park site provides a recreation building, game courts, picnic areas, play
        lots and an outdoor stage.
Regional Parks: Nearby County regional parks include Vasquez Rocks County
Regional Park and Devil's Punchbowl County Regional Park. These facilities
provide passive recreation opportunities such as hiking and nature study. Apollo
Park in Lancaster provides picnicking and fishing. However, like the County
parks described above, reduced hours, reduced services or possible closure
threaten these County regional parks because of cutbacks to the County's
budget.
State Parks: Antelope Valley Indian Museum State Park, Saddleback Butte
State Park and the California Poppy Preserve are three state facilities located
near Palmdale. These parks allow passive recreation opportunities, including
hiking, wildflower viewing, and picnicking. The Antelope Valley Indian Museum
offers interpretive displays of the valley's prehistoric culture and natural history.
Forest Service Open Space: Angeles National Forest covers over 600,000
acres of public lands in the Transverse Range, including portions of the San
Gabriel and Sierra Pelona Mountains, located south of Palmdale. Recreational
opportunities on Forest Service lands includes camping, hiking, boating and
swimming, picnicking, skiing, and target shooting. According to the Angeles
National Forest Land and Resources Management Plan, 5 million visitors
annually use the forest for recreational pursuits.
Alpine Butte Wildlife Preserve: This 180-acre site is owned by Los Angeles
County. The site is presently undeveloped, and access is limited. Hiking and
nature study are the primary recreational opportunities at this site.
California Aqueduct: The California Aqueduct traverses the southern portion of
the Palmdale Planning Area. The Aqueduct is open at certain locations for
fishing. However, at the present time, the bikeway along the portion of the
Aqueduct within the Antelope Valley is closed to public access. Since portions of

       this bikeway are being opened elsewhere for bicycling, this facility may eventually
       be available to local residents for recreational use.
       Other Public Agencies: Palmdale Water District owns a five-acre site located
       on Technology Drive between the Antelope Valley Freeway and Desert Sands
       Park. The League and the City are co-lessees. The City maintains the turf and
       assists with general upkeep and repair of the facility.
5.     Private Recreational Facilities
In addition to the public recreation facilities described above, there are a number of
private recreation options in and around Palmdale. These private recreational facilities,
shown on Exhibit PRT-1, include the following:
       Desert Aire Golf Course is a 45-acre, nine-hole regulation golf course located at
       3620 East Avenue P, and is privately operated by means of a lease agreement
       with the City of Los Angeles Department of Airports. The golf course includes a
       pro-shop, restaurant and bar, a lighted driving range and golf cart rentals. This
       golf course was formerly operated as a City recreational facility between 1982
       and 1998.
       The Antelope Valley Country Club is located at 39800 Country Club Drive. This
       private facility includes an 18-hole golf course, swimming, and tennis. Access is
       restricted to country club members and guests.
       The Rancho Vista Golf Course is located within the Rancho Vista Specific Plan
       near the intersection of 30th Street West and Avenue N-8. This is an 18-hole golf
       course with clubhouse and restaurant.
       Lake Palmdale is a 300-acre water reservoir owned by Palmdale Water District.
       This lake, which provides recreational boating and fishing, is controlled by the Fin
       and Feather Club and is available for use by members only.
       Los Angeles County Raceway is located south of Avenue T, between 65th and
       70th Street East. Raceway events, such as drag racing and motorcycle events,
       usually occur during summer months.
       Palmdale also supports the following types of private business: batting cages,
       stables, gyms/health clubs, video arcades, bowling alley, movie theaters,
       miniature golf, bumper boards, indoor soccer and billiards. Several of the local
       service organizations sponsor bingo games, either on a regular basis or from

                                                                                and Trails
        time to time as a fund raising activity. Also, the YMCA of the Antelope Valley,
        located on Avenue J-8 in Lancaster, offers a variety of recreational programs.
        Palmdale youth participate in various organized sports programs such as Little
        League baseball, AYSO, and youth football, among others.
        Additional planned facilities in Palmdale include golf courses within the College
        Park, Palmdale Business Park, and Ritter Ranch Specific Plan areas. These
        courses, once developed, may be private or semi-private. The Ritter Ranch
        Specific Plan also proposes to develop an equestrian center and swim club.
6.      Trails
During the 1990’s, the City of Palmdale received grants for the construction of two multi-
purpose trails. The first was the 1.3-mile Barrel Springs Trail located along the existing
adopted alignment of Barrel Springs Road South between Tejon Park and the Daniel A.
Mahoney Trailhead at 25th Street East near Pearblossom Highway. In 1998, the 3.2
mile Joshua Ranch Trail was developed which extends west from Avenue P-12 and the
California Aqueduct through the planned Joshua Ranch development connecting with
trails within the City’s Warnack Nature Park east of Godde Hill Road. The City’s multi-
use trails link with an extensive trail system planned by L.A. County and the City of
Lancaster. Existing and planned trails in Palmdale are shown on Exhibit PRT-2 and are
described below.
        Bike Paths: At the present time, approximately 24.2 miles of on- and –off street
        (Class 1 and II) bike paths have been developed throughout the City. This
        represents approximately 18.7% of the 129 miles of bike paths that are currently
        designated in the General Plan.
        Trails Proposed in Approved Specific Plans: Extensive trails systems have
        been proposed throughout the Ritter Ranch and City Ranch Specific Plans.
        Bikeways, pedestrian paths and equestrian trails will provide for access
        throughout these planned communities. Construction of these trails will be
        phased with development of these specific plan areas.
        Trails from Lancaster: The City of Lancaster General Plan contains a Master
        Trails Plan showing numerous trail connections at the Lancaster/Palmdale
        boundary. These proposed trails include L.A. County North County Trail System
        segments, bikeways, urban trails and rural trails. The Lancaster General Plan
        also gives cross-sections for the various trail types. These cross-sections will be
        an important consideration in trail design at the interface between Palmdale and
        Lancaster.

Park, Recreation,
and Trails
       North Los Angeles County Trails System:                Los Angeles County has
       designated an extensive system of multi-use trails throughout the North County
       area. Many of the proposed trail alignments connect to existing trails in the
       Angeles National Forest. Once it is fully constructed, this system of trails will
       provide an extensive network for recreational opportunities.
       Trails Proposed by the Antelope Valley Trails, Recreation, and
       Environmental Council (AVTREC): AVTREC has worked diligently with Los
       Angeles County, and the Cities of Palmdale and Lancaster, to ensure the
       development of a cohesive multi-use trails network throughout the Antelope
       Valley. This group has identified a number of gaps within the existing trails plans
       and has suggested possible trail alignments to improve the connectivity of the
       proposed regional system. Several of these linkages traverse the City of
       Palmdale, connecting proposed County trails to trails in Lancaster or to
       destinations in Palmdale.
7.     Implementation of Park Programs
Park acquisition and development costs are partially offset by payment of park impact
fees by new development. Currently, park impact fees are: single family dwelling units,
$1,019 per bedroom; duplex or triplex dwelling units, $1,115 per bedroom; and
apartment dwelling units, $1,052 per bedroom. These fees are adjusted annually
according to the Consumer Price Index. The Director of Parks and Recreation has
estimated that in the past these fees provide approximately 50% of the funds needed to
develop new park facilities in the City. The remaining funds for park acquisition and
construction came from the City's General Fund, grants and drainage and impact fees.
These funds are allocated through the City's Capital Improvement Program.
More recently, the City was successful in establishing a citywide assessment district for
the construction of two additional parks, as discussed below. On average, Palmdale
property owners will pay an assessment of $36 per year over a 30-year time period to
pay for these improvements. Additionally, large-scale residential developments, such
as City Ranch and Ritter Ranch, will be required to construct on-site parks, trails and
other recreational facilities to serve their residents under the terms of development
agreements with the City. In addition to construction and acquisition of park lands, the
City is also responsible for maintenance of existing parks and funding recreational
programs.
Costs for City-sponsored recreation programs are partially recovered by charging
nominal fees for the use of facilities, or for enrollment in programs. According to the
Adopted by City Council                  PRT-40
9/24/03
                                                                      Parks, Recreation,
                                                                                and Trails
City's fee schedule, the Director of Parks and Recreation is authorized to charge a
reasonable fee for recreation programs while all other fees, i.e., rental of facilities, are
included in the City’s fee resolution. Sponsorships also subsidize City recreational
programs.
B.     OPPORTUNITIES/CONSTRAINTS
1.     Existing Opportunities
       Vacant Land/Land Constrained From Development: Presently, much of
       Palmdale's Planning Area consists of vacant land. This presents a tremendous
       opportunity to reserve land for parks, and/or open space. The majority of this
       land is either owned by the City of Los Angeles for possible future airport and/or
       industrial development, or it is included within the adopted Ritter Ranch and City
       Ranch Specific Plans. Some of this vacant land is constrained from future
       development by seismic hazards, flooding, or steep topography. The San
       Andreas rift zone and flood zones associated with Little Rock and Big Rock
       Wash provide corridors through which trails and an open space networks can be
       established.
       Potential Funding Sources:
              Public Financing Districts: There are several types of public financing
              districts available for use by the City to fund improvement of parks, trails
              and recreational facilities. To create a public financing district, the City
              would identify an area which would benefit from construction of an
              improvement such as a park. This area would form the district. The
              property owners within the district would then pay for infrastructure
              improvements such as parks. To pay for these improvements, the City
              would issue bonds which would be repaid by liens placed on the property
              included in the financing district. The bonds, and hence the cost of the
              improvements, are paid off over a period of years by the landowners
              within the district.
              Assessment Districts are one form of public financing. In an assessment
              district, a fixed amount is placed as a lien against each parcel of land
              within the district. The amount of the lien is determined by the degree that
              parcel would benefit from the proposed improvements. In July 2002,
              Palmdale property owners approved a per parcel assessment to fund the
              major portion of the $45 million amount for construction of two parks. The
              facilities to be developed are: Eastside (40th Street East and Avenue S),
                                          PRT-41                 Adopted by City Council
                                                                                    9/24/03

Park, Recreation,
and Trails
            swimming pool, recreation center, family aquatic park and event/playfields;
            Westside (30th Street West and Rancho Vista Boulevard), swimming pool,
            recreation center, amphitheater and softball fields.
            Community Facilities Districts (CFD) are a second form of public financing.
            In a CFD, a special tax called a Mello-Roos tax is used to pay for public
            improvements, including parks. Mello-Roos taxes can also finance the
            maintenance costs of parks, parkways and open space, as opposed to
            Assessment District's which can only be used to finance acquisition and
            construction of improvements. The City has not used CFD's for park
            construction. However, it is likely that the parks within the Ritter Ranch
            project will be constructed using this financing mechanism.
            Financing Allowed by the Quimby Act: The Quimby Act (Section
            66477 of the Government Code) was adopted by the State Legislature in
            1965 to expressly authorize cities to require dedication of land for parks as
            a condition of approval for residential development. The act is one of
            several provisions of state law that empower cities to acquire park land
            through dedication or payment of in lieu fees. In summary, the Quimby
            Act allows cities to collect fees or require dedication of land up to 3 acres
            per 1,000 population from new residential development for parks and
            recreation purposes. These provisions are similar to the Ordinance 505,
            the Park Land Dedication Ordinance, currently in place in Palmdale.
            Vendor Agreements: The City currently contracts with over 70 vendors
            for a variety of services in support of its recreation programs. These
            contracts range from food and beverage vending machines or cart
            operators to newspaper and radio advertisements.
            Joint Use of Facilities: Marie Kerr Park, located at 30th Street West and
            Avenue P, is the first park facility in the City to be used both for active
            recreational uses and as a storm water detention basin. This type of joint
            use allows the City to spread the cost of the land over several programs,
            which in turn allows the construction of more public facilities, city-wide.
            For instance, instead of purchasing land for a park, and purchasing
            additional land for a detention basin, the City purchases a single site which
            provides both public services. This type of joint use of facilities may
            facilitate acquisition of park land in other locations of the City as well.
            Joint use of other recreational facilities is an option which should be

                                                                                and Trails
          parks, locating fire stations in parks, and using utility corridors for drainage
          facilities and trails.
          Community Support: At the present time, community support for parks,
          trails, open space and recreational programs appears to be on the rise.
          Continued support from the community for recreational amenities will
          ensure that provision of these services continues to be one of the City's
          priorities.
          Land Use Interface: There are locations around the City where adjacent
          land use designations may create future land use interface conflicts.
          These conditions exist where land use designations allow certain uses
          which may not be compatible. For example, on the City's east side along
          Little Rock Wash, the General Plan allows sand and gravel quarries;
          however, adjacent to this use, single family residential development will be
          allowed. Where this situation occurs, it may be advisable to provide a
          setback or buffer to reduce the noise and dust which could result from a
          quarry.      In these buffers, certain recreational amenities may be
          constructed, such as green belts, trails and par courses.
          Acquisition of Public Lands Not Owned by the City: Located
          throughout the City are vacant parcels owned by various public agencies.
          These sites include undeveloped school sites, parcels owned by Los
          Angeles County for a variety of purposes, and a few acres of public lands
          under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. There
          may be opportunities for the City to acquire some of these parcels for use
          as park sites. On occasion, a public agency will determine that the need
          to develop a site for a particular purpose no longer exists and the site is
          deemed as surplus. Should this occur, the City could then negotiate with
          that agency for acquisition of the surplus parcel for use as a park.
2. Existing Constraints
   Cost to Acquire Park Land and Build Parks: The costs to acquire and build
   parks is the single most serious constraint to expanding the recreational
   opportunities offered by the City. Presently, park impact fees provide only 50%
   of the funds needed to acquire and build parks. The remaining funding must
   come from the City's General Fund, grants or assessment districts. The City has
   been very successful in obtaining and developing parks over the past ten years.
   According to the standard set in Objective PRT1.1, and reiterated in the Public
   Services Element, of three acres per thousand population, the City currently
                                       PRT-43                Adopted by City Council
                                                                                   9/24/03
Park, Recreation,
and Trails
      needs 381 acres of active park land, of which 193 acres are developed at this
      time. When the expansion of Marie Kerr Park and construction of the east side
      park is completed, the deficit will have been reduced by 71 acres. As shown on
      Exhibit PRT-1, the City currently owns 101.5 acres of undeveloped park land in
      addition to recreational facilities planned within the Ritter Ranch and City Ranch
      Specific Plan. However, it should be noted that as the City's population
      increases, so will the need for active park acreage.
      Cost to Maintain Parks: Once parks are acquired and constructed, the City is
      responsible for park maintenance. Park maintenance represents a significant
      expense to the City in terms of both manpower and hard costs. As park acreage
      increases, maintenance expenses will increase as well. There is currently no
      funding mechanism, outside of the City's General fund, to cover park
      maintenance costs. Other funding alternatives, such as user fees, may need to
      be explored in the future.
      Land Use Interface:         While land use interface issues often represent
      opportunities to develop greenbelts or park sites, they can sometimes represent
      constraints as well. Large, regional park facilities could include uses such as
      amphitheaters or lighted fields which could generate noise, light and traffic which
      could impact quiet residential neighborhoods. Therefore, adjacent land uses are
      a consideration when establishing locations and facilities for parks.

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
The Community Design Element of the General Plan establishes policies to shape the
City’s overall form and appearance. The standards and guidelines contained in this
Element are intended to improve the functional and aesthetic quality of the built
environment for City residents and businesses.
The process of designing our community is a continuous one, with each development
decision contributing to the City’s urban form and quality of life. To successfully achieve
good community design requires involvement of both public and private development
interests, and presents aesthetic, economic, political, and administrative challenges.
The policies must accommodate design features unique to each individual project, while
maintaining a consistent standard of design and construction quality throughout the
City. They must be applied equitably to each project, but they should not unduly limit
opportunities for affordable business and housing development. They must be clearly
stated and simple to apply, while avoiding rigid dictums in favor of flexibility.
Despite the difficulties inherent in drafting and implementing community design policies,
however, the benefits to the City of doing so outweigh the obstacles. If they are
carefully crafted and applied equitably, such standards can help create a desirable
community where people want to live, work and recreate a community attractive to
businesses, where property values consistent with a high standard of living are
established and maintained.
It should be emphasized at the outset that the intent of the Community Design Element
is not to establish uniform architectural standards for any land use category within the
City of Palmdale. Rather, the element is intended to establish guidelines for
developers, staff, and decision makers to use in evaluating whether development
projects meet the design goals of the City for functional, efficient, and attractive
development.
This element is organized into four sections, in keeping with the format established for
the other elements of the Palmdale General Plan. Section 2 of the element contains a
discussion of issues and opportunities for Palmdale with respect to community design
on a city-wide basis as well as for specific use types. Section 3 contains goals,
objectives, and policies for the City to follow in making land use decisions, and Section
4 contains implementation measures.

Community Design Element
The Community Design Element is an optional element of the City’s General Plan, as
authorized by Section 65303 of the California Government Code. Policies within the
Community Design Element may relate to land use, circulation, environmental
resources, housing, or other issues which are addressed throughout the General Plan;
the element is consistent with the other General Plan elements, and should be used in
conjunction with them in formulating future land use decisions affecting the City.
A total of six public workshops and hearings were held to take input on the Community
Design Element between September 15, 1994 and December 14, 1994. The Element
was adopted by the City Council on December 14, 1994, by adoption of Resolution 94-
142, which also contained a finding that the Element was determined to be consistent
with the Environmental Impact Report prepared for the General Plan which was certified
by the City Council on January 25, 1993.

SECTION 2: ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES
Although the design of a development project is often considered to be only an
aesthetic concern, the implications of design decisions often have more far-reaching
impacts on a community. Effective design can maximize use of a site and decrease
construction costs, provide convenience to users and ensure compatibility with adjacent
uses, and protect natural resources while allowing managed growth to occur. More
importantly, the cumulative impacts of design decisions applied over time will influence
whether a city develops as a attractive, functional, thriving community, or whether it
presents a sterile, blighted or neglected appearance to potential business investors and
residents.
Community design issues affecting planning decisions may be grouped into two
categories: design issues affecting the overall form, character and identity of the city;
and issues relating to a specific land use type, such as commercial, residential or
industrial uses. This section of the Community Design Element provides background
information and identifies issues and opportunities for these two types of design issues,
as they affect planning decisions in the City of Palmdale.
A.      Community-Wide Design Issues
1.      General Design Principles
When people think of memorable cities where they have lived or visited, they may recall
the public places where people gathered, the community life on the streets, the variety
of architecture, the things to do, the places to go, or just the "atmosphere." Great cities
and towns have a "sense of place" that is distinctive and memorable. These
communities are attractive to businesses and investors as well as residents, because of
the value placed on quality of life.
Urban planners have long tried to define the characteristics that contribute to the
creation of a place where people want to be. Numerous studies to identify what
qualities draw people into certain urban places have reached similar conclusions.
People seem to like places that are orderly and understandable, rather than confusing;
where building placement and massing creates a sense of unity and balance at a
human scale; where links exist between places, providing connections rather than dead
ends; where diversity of architecture, uses and activities creates interest rather than
monotony; where people feel comfortable, protected from the elements, and provided
with places to sit and talk; where they feel safe, with various access points and other
people nearby, rather than isolated; where building materials and construction feel
authentic, substantial and timeless, rather than cheap, trendy or false; where people
can conduct business, or simply enjoy the place and meet other people, without major
                                            CD-3                  Adopted by City Council
                                                                                 12/14/94
Community Design Element
inconvenience, time or effort. In short, people like places that are well-designed. The
experience of many other cities has demonstrated that an attractive, functional and well-
designed urban environment will draw a mix of users and create a synergy contributing
to a successful community that flourishes both economically and socially.
General design principles for guiding Palmdale's development in a positive manner are
contained in Goal CD 1 and the accompanying objectives and policies (see Section 3).
The most important of these is Objective CD 1.1, which requires that the relationship of
each development project to its setting be considered. In his 1993 book Rebuilding,
Daniel Solomon writes that "buildings alone don't matter; it is only the ensemble of
streets, lots and buildings, and the way they fit together, that comprise the basis of town
making." The building blocks of structures, sites, streets, neighborhoods and districts
must be considered in design decisions, rather than focusing on the architectural
treatment of any single building. A site can function well within its neighborhood
context, even if it is not architecturally remarkable; conversely, an architectural
masterpiece may feel out of place if it does not reflect the scale and character of the
surrounding neighborhood. The Community Design Element is intended to provide a
basis for evaluating land use decisions at a level between land use map designations
and architectural building details, in order to ensure that new development functions
well in its environment.
The policies contained under Goal CD 1 should be considered in each development
decision, for residential, commercial or industrial uses, for capital improvements by the
City, and in all geographic areas of the City. If applied equitably and consistently, these
principles will assure that new development contributes to rather than detracts from
Palmdale's community character.
2.      Citywide Design Opportunities for Palmdale
Gertrude Stein once wrote of a California city that when you arrive there, there's no
"there" there. Features within a city which make it unique and identifiable as a separate
community must be created and enhanced, in order to avoid eliciting a similar reaction
from visitors and residents.
Palmdale's natural setting offers many opportunities to create a sense of place. Its
foothill location affords views of the Antelope Valley, the Tehachapi and San Gabriel
Mountains, and desert buttes and playas. Its topography offers rolling hillsides, steep
slopes, and flatland. Its vegetation includes juniper/joshua woodlands, remnant
orchards and riparian habitat, while its clean air and wide vistas offer a sense of space
and openness. In addition to its natural advantages, Palmdale has enjoyed a unique
history, evolving from an Indian gathering place to agricultural center to aerospace
pioneer. Palmdale can capitalize on these attributes to enhance its community identity.

                                                            Community Design Element
Design opportunities which can be developed for the Palmdale community as a whole
include streetscapes, entry points, views toward and from hillside areas, significant focal
points, landscaping and signage, and treatment of the freeway corridor. Together,
these elements can combine to influence the image of the city presented to people
visiting Palmdale. These design features can be used to differentiate Palmdale from
other suburban communities in southern California, and create a distinctive identity for
the City.
Goal CD 2 and the accompanying objectives and policies are intended to provide a
basis for creation of community-wide design elements which will contribute to
Palmdale's sense of place.
B.      Design Considerations for Specific Land Use Types
1.      Residential
Rural Residential Development
The Palmdale community contains several residential areas which are characterized by
large lots, agricultural accessory uses such as horses and farm animals, and rural
standards for streets and other public improvements. The predominant lot size in some
of these areas is one acre, while others consist of 2 1/2 acre or larger parcels. In
general, rural residential neighborhoods are located in the southern portion of the
planning area (south of Pearblossom Highway along the foothills), and the northwestern
portion of the planning area (between 20th and 50th Streets West, extending between
Avenues M and P). Although the majority of these lots are not within the City's
incorporated boundaries at this time, they are within the adopted sphere of influence
and the City is required to plan for them. The land use map designates these areas for
low density residential uses, in order to preserve their rural character. The Community
Design Element addresses rural residential development by establishing design
standards appropriate for these areas.
Rural residential development in the Palmdale planning area occurred under standards
established by Los Angeles County in its A-1 (Light Agriculture) Zone. Those rural
residential areas which are now within the City of Palmdale were substantially
developed prior to annexation; other rural areas are still under the County's jurisdiction.
Over the past several years, many discussions have occurred between representatives
of the City and homeowners associations in these areas regarding the residents' desire
to maintain a rural lifestyle. In 1990, the City adopted Memoranda of Understanding
with two separate property owners organizations representing unincorporated rural
residential areas, under which the City agreed to respect existing development patterns
                                           CD-5                 Adopted by City Council
                                                                                  12/14/94
Community Design Element
and standards in these areas, to limit encroachment of incompatible urban uses, and to
establish rural development standards for the areas if they are annexed to the City.
In 1994 the City revised its A-1 (Light Agricultural) zone based upon input from and
coordination with representatives of the Southside Homeowners Association and other
rural neighborhoods. Uses and regulatory standards outlined in the revised zone reflect
existing development patterns in rural residential areas.
With respect to design guidelines, one issue of concern in rural areas is the desire to
create and maintain a spacious, open setting for each lot. This can be done through
standards for lot dimensions and setbacks, so as to discourage development which
appears to be dense at the street frontage but meets minimum area standards through
long, narrow lot configurations. Another issue is defining roadway design standards
appropriate for rural areas; these streets are not intended for large traffic volumes and
high speeds, and can therefore be narrower than other city streets. Residents have
also asked that street lighting standards be modified to allow less illumination,
preserving views of nighttime skies. In addition, because of the equestrian uses
prevalent in these areas, access from lots to feeder, collector and regional trail systems
should be considered in subdivision design. Goal CD 3 and the accompanying
objectives and policies further define the City's commitment to preserve the unique
character of rural lifestyles within the planning area.
Suburban Residential Development
The suburban development pattern is characterized by single family detached dwelling
units constructed by a tract builder on land which was previously subdivided, at
densities ranging from three to six units per acre. Approximately seventy-six percent of
the dwelling units in Palmdale fit this description and are located in suburban
neighborhoods.
Various types of suburban residential development found in Palmdale are indicative of
forces which affected housing trends nationally. From older tracts developed in the
post-war housing boom of the 1950's to golf course subdivisions and planned unit
developments, Palmdale's single family housing stock reflects development patterns
shaped by federal regulations, financing and marketing considerations, and building
industry practices.
The older subdivisions in the central part of town exhibit characteristics called for in the
guidelines issued by the Federal Housing Administration in the 1930's and 1940's. The
grid street patterns use narrower rights of way than is now required, with sidewalks
separated from the curb by a landscaped strip. Small subdivisions are enclosed by
block walls, and are self-contained with dead-end streets that don't connect to adjacent

neighborhoods. Although these neighborhoods contain the City's older housing stock,
they provide affordable units in a relatively low-density neighborhood. Many of these
areas provide a pleasant living environment through the presence of mature street
trees, front doors near the street, landscaped parkways and proximity to community
services.
From a community design perspective, there are two major challenges to the City in
preserving and enhancing these areas. The first is a lack of adequate infrastructure, or
adequate capacity in existing infrastructure, to support the density of development. This
issue has been dealt with in some areas through formation of assessment districts to
finance street and other public improvements, and is further discussed in the Public
Services Element. The second major challenge is maintaining these properties in a
safe, attractive condition. Many of these units have become rental properties, with
some entire blocks purchased by out-of-town investors. Property maintenance
conditions have become a major concern in some areas. In 1994, the City adopted a
Property Maintenance Ordinance (No. 1028) to assist staff in obtaining compliance with
City codes. Other General Plan policies have also addressed the need to upgrade and
rehabilitate older housing throughout the City (see the Land Use and Housing
Elements).
During the mid-1980's Palmdale was swept up in a housing boom resulting in a rate of
population growth unmatched in California. Since the beginning of 1985, over 250
tentative maps creating over 26,000 lots have been approved, and over 18,200
residential lots have been recorded. Expanses of land stretching the fourteen miles
from 70th Street West to 70th Street East were converted to roof-tops. Construction
activity in the single family residential market sector accelerated rapidly, beginning in
1985 and peaking in 1990, after which it declined due to a national recession and other
factors slowing the California economy.
Subdivision design during these years was influenced by financial, economic and
marketing concerns. Financial investors in the housing market sought to protect their
investment by isolating subdivisions from potentially detrimental surrounding
neighborhood environments. Marketing and real estate promoters targeted certain
market sectors for each subdivision--first-time buyer, move-up or executive--thereby
creating a relatively homogeneous neighborhood within each tract. Traffic engineering
standards were adopted which increased street widths and curve radii, eliminated
planted parkway strips, and isolated neighborhoods from arterial streets in order to
increase arterial travel speeds and capacity.
The marketing trend towards golf course subdivisions and Planned Unit Developments
was also evident in Palmdale. A golf course subdivision was created in 1972 (Country
Club Estates), and the Rancho Vista planned development promoted home sales on the
                                           CD-7                 Adopted by City Council
                                                                                12/14/94

basis of a future golf course, parks and other amenities. In 1992 the City approved two
additional planned developments in the southwest portion of the planning area (the City
Ranch and Ritter Ranch Specific Plans), both of which contain clearly defined programs
of public improvements and amenities which are to be constructed as development
occurs.
With the rapid pace of development activity in the late 1980's, community design issues
took a lower priority than the City's desire to facilitate economic development. After the
economy slowed down, however, City officials took a closer look at the uncoordinated
development patterns resulting from this growth cycle, and several concerns became
evident. In some subdivisions, streets did not connect to the adjacent subdivision.
Streets started and stopped in a disjointed fashion, blocking through-access between
neighborhoods. Houses were cut off from adjacent homes, schools and parks by block
walls. Some streets were lined with block walls for miles, creating streetscapes
dominated by concrete and masonry, unrelieved by shade trees or views of open
spaces. Public safety vehicles patrolling neighborhoods had limited visibility of
residential streets, and emergency vehicles had trouble finding street addresses in
confusing mazes of cul-de-sacs. Within neighborhoods, residents began complaining to
City officials that traffic sped through their streets, endangering their children.
Based on these concerns, the City reviewed its subdivision development procedures,
and determined that a need existed to establish design guidelines. An initial set of
Subdivision Design Guidelines was accepted for use by the City Council on February 9,
1992. Some of these guidelines, relating to circulation and infrastructure issues, were
expanded and incorporated into the Circulation and Public Services Elements of the
General Plan in January, 1993. Other guidelines were determined to be appropriate for
inclusion in the Community Design Element. These guidelines have been expanded
and are contained under Goal CD 4 in Section 3.
Collectively, the subdivision design guidelines are intended to promote development of
neighborhoods within the City of Palmdale which are cohesive, functional, and create a
sense of community. Emphasis is given to promoting interaction within and between
neighborhoods, and providing links between community facilities and the neighborhoods
they serve. To accomplish this goal, planning and design must extend beyond the
boundaries of an individual subdivision. The focus should be on geographic areas that
encompass an entire neighborhood, rather than on limiting the scope of design and
review to individual tract boundaries. Neighborhood planning areas are typically defined
by arterials, railroad rights-of-way, drainage courses, topographic features, and other
similar barriers which function as neighborhood boundaries. If the guidelines are
properly implemented, there will be an economy and efficiency of infrastructure
construction and maintenance, a logical integration of circulation routes for both

vehicles and pedestrians, the creation of lot patterns that enhance livability; and a
heightened sense of neighborhood.
It is important to recognize the limitations of public agency involvement in the housing
development process. With the exception of publicly assisted affordable housing
projects, cities are not in the development business; they do not finance, design,
construct or market subdivisions. The City's authority is limited to establishment of
policies which will clearly communicate to developers and builders what type of
neighborhoods the City wants, and the approval authority (through the discretionary
review and entitlement process) to gain certain design considerations. Equally
important, however, is the concept that public and private development interests can
work together to create livable neighborhoods which retain their value and provide for
community life. This cooperative approach to subdivision design should be a common
goal.
Multiple Family Residential Development
In 1994, eighteen percent of the dwelling units in Palmdale were multiple family
attached units. With the exception of a few projects, the bulk of the multi-family units in
the City were built prior to 1986. The trend towards construction of single family
detached instead of multi-family units in Palmdale over the last ten years appears to be
due to a faster absorption rate for detached units and the availability of financing.
Changes in the tax laws affecting rental properties in 1986 may also have had an effect
on the rate of construction in this sector of the housing market.
Because Palmdale has not processed many proposals for apartment or condominium
units over the last five years, serious concerns over design issues on new multi-family
complexes have not been raised. The City has, however, been faced with safety
problems in older apartment complexes--primarily relating to crime prevention--which
are caused by certain design characteristics. Based upon the City's recent experiences
with law enforcement and community-based policing in predominantly multi-family
residential areas, it has become apparent that in the future certain requirements should
be made at the design review stage for new multi-family development projects to ensure
residents' long-term health, safety and welfare.
Major issues of concern are visibility of publicly-accessible areas, to increase safety and
discourage vandalism; adequate lighting for public safety; provision of amenities and
places for children, seniors and other residents to recreate; availability of parking and
trash enclosures within a reasonable distance of each dwelling unit; adequate
secondary or emergency access from each development; and provision for
maintenance of site amenities, landscaping and buildings. Another concern is how
these areas can integrate into the surrounding neighborhoods, in order to encourage

interaction between residents and adjacent uses. Site designs which provide barriers
around the perimeter of multi-family developments, such as unbroken rows of carports,
parking areas and solid fencing, do not encourage community interaction. While
fencing and gates may be needed in some areas to provide security, consideration
should be given to creating neighborhoods rather than a series of self-contained
enclaves.
The factors identified above are addressed in Goal CD 5 and the accompanying
objectives and policies in Section 2 of this Element, which are included to ensure that
multiple family housing meets the City's community design goals.
Approximately six percent of the City's housing stock is provided by mobilehomes and
manufactured dwelling units, which are primarily located within mobilehome parks. As
with multiple family units, most of the mobilehome parks within the City were developed
prior to the mid-1980's. Many were developed under conditional use permits granted by
Los Angeles County, and later annexed to the City. As a result, the City has had limited
experience with applying design standards to new parks. However, many of the design
guidelines for single family and multiple family neighborhoods contained within Goals
CD 4 and CD 5 of Section 3 are applicable to manufactured home developments. The
concepts of connectivity, recreational amenities, diversity of design, landscaping,
convenient access, pedestrian and transit connections, and creation of neighborhoods
should be applied to any new manufactured housing development. Therefore, a policy
has been included requiring that manufactured home subdivisions and parks comply
with applicable residential design standards contained in this element.
Senior housing projects merit special attention with respect to the unique living needs of
aging people. Visits by staff members to senior housing projects in other cities, and
conversations with administrators and residents in these projects, have contributed to a
better understanding of what these needs are. One of the components of senior
housing to consider from a design standpoint is the aging of the senior population within
the complex. While residents in a senior project may enter the units in a relatively
active and healthy condition (in their sixties or early seventies), those people may stay
until they reach very advanced ages; during that time, their needs and abilities change.
Staff asked administrators of three senior projects how they would design the buildings
differently if they were given the opportunity to start over, based upon what they had
learned over time by observing residents' needs. We were told that residents do not
use outdoor balconies much, and would prefer larger living rooms than balconies if
given a choice. Seniors enjoy work spaces for light carpentry and gardening;
workshops with power tools and greenhouses were heavily used. All residents need
more storage. Door closers are needed for each unit, but must be light enough for the
most frail elderly residents to open. Frost-free, free-standing (not built-in) refrigerators

are recommended, as are microwave ovens. Handrails and adequate lighting are
needed in hallways, and hallways should be broken up visually to avoid confusion.
Benches along long hallways are helpful, as are plants and pictures to provide visual
landmarks. Low thresholds should be used on doorways, to avoid tripping and improve
wheelchair accessibility. Utilities are recommended to be included in the monthly rent,
but separate metering should be provided for more equitable division of utility expenses.
Parking ratios are recommended to be less than for standard multi-family development;
many jurisdictions use a ratio of one space per three dwelling units. It was
recommended that about ten percent of the units be fitted for wheelchair accessibility,
including bathroom and kitchen fixtures and lowered countertops. An alternative would
be to make all units wheelchair adaptable. It was suggested that front entryways and
common areas be designed with a homelike atmosphere, avoiding a hotel-like or
institutional look. Open space areas were most successful when they received sun in
all seasons, with shade trees provided and movable seating so conversation groups
could form.
These are among the design concepts which should be considered in reviewing senior
residential projects. Policies directing that the special housing needs of seniors be
considered in the design of any new senior project are contained under Objective CD
5.6.
2.       Commercial and Industrial Development
With the exception of older structures located within the downtown core of Palmdale,
most of the commercial development in Palmdale has been constructed within the last
ten years. The regional mall, auto center, power center (including Home Depot and
Walmart), Marketplace (including Target and Best Buy) and K-Mart have all opened
since 1989, within and adjacent to the Palmdale Trade and Commerce Center.
Numerous smaller-scale projects have also been constructed to serve neighborhood
commercial needs throughout the City, including four market-drug centers along Avenue
S, one on Rancho Vista Boulevard, and several along Palmdale Boulevard. The rapid
increase in new retail construction over the last decade reflects a concerted effort by the
City of Palmdale to capture sales tax revenues generated by the burgeoning Antelope
Valley population. As a result of its recent development, Palmdale's commercial sites
are generally structurally sound, adequately parked and lighted, landscaped, and exhibit
unified design themes within each center.
Architecturally, many of the newer commercial buildings are designed with
mediterranean motifs, including beige or earth-tone stucco coatings, red tile roofing and
colored tile accents. In and around the regional mall, peaked roof lines and tower
treatments are recurring features. An attempt has been made in the Palmdale Trade
                                           CD-11                Adopted by City Council
                                                                                  12/14/94
Community Design Element
And Commerce Center Specific Plan area to maintain unity in design through use of
these elements.
The commercial corridor along Palmdale Boulevard, extending from 10th Street West to
35th Street East, shows less uniformity of design, primarily due to the lack of an
underlying specific plan and the uncoordinated nature of individual development efforts.
Portions of this corridor are mediterranean or Spanish style, while others are of a more
eclectic nature. Interspersed with newer centers are older buildings, especially in the
downtown "core" area of the City. Specific design standards for development around
the Sierra Highway/Palmdale Boulevard intersection and surrounding vicinity will be
addressed in the Downtown Revitalization Plan.
The majority of Palmdale's industrial uses are located on or near Air Force Plant 42.
Most of the buildings owned or leased by government contractors in this area are not
accessible to the general public, due to security measures. Although the massive size
of the structures needed for aircraft assembly makes them visible from long distances,
individual design features of these buildings and sites have not traditionally been a
major concern for the City because they are set apart from areas frequented by the
general public.
Scattered industrial development has also occurred along highly visible corridors such
as Sierra Highway, Sixth Street East, 10th Street West, and along Avenues M, N, P and
Q. Newer buildings in these areas have been developed in a business park setting by
speculative builders for lease to a variety of industrial and office users. Older industrial
uses include lumber and truss yards, contractors yards, machine and carpentry shops,
equipment and storage yards, and vehicle services.               As with the commercial
development in the City, newer industrial structures are generally of good quality and
materials and have adequate circulation, parking, lighting and landscaping. Some of
the older uses could improve in design, but may remain as nonconforming uses until the
land is reutilized.
A major design issue for commercial/industrial development in Palmdale is the need to
consider multiple modes of transportation in site planning for these areas. While this
issue is a matter of convenience for site users, it is also mandated under State and
Federal clean air regulations requiring reduction of vehicle trips. Many of the existing
commercial/industrial sites within the City seem to give automobile-related features
primary emphasis, while offering little in the way of pedestrian pathways, shaded
walkways and seating areas, or bicycle access and parking areas. In addition, public
transit stops have not been provided with turnouts, benches or shade in many locations,
and convenient pedestrian access from bus stops to building entrances have rarely
been provided.
Adopted by City Council                   CD-12
12/14/94
                                                            Community Design Element
Another visible sign of the predominance of the automobile in site planning is the large
expanses of parking lots located adjacent to the street. Most large commercial tenants
require that parking be provided within a specified radius to their front door;
consequently, site plans typically set buildings to the rear of the site and (with the
exception of some out-parcels) place parking along the street frontage. The resulting
streetscape is not inviting to pedestrian window-shoppers, and discourages access by
any other than vehicular users. If a pedestrian does enter the site, there are no clearly
delineated walkways offered and foot traffic must compete with automobiles for use of
travel ways, or wend a path between parked cars.
In some commercial areas where a pedestrian-oriented shopping environment is
desired, this development pattern must be reversed; buildings should be placed at the
edge of pavement in order to provide interest and immediate access by pedestrians,
while parking should be located behind the buildings or on the periphery of the district.
This development technique will be required in the Downtown Revitalization Plan in
order to create a active shopping district in the Civic Center area, and may be
appropriate in other locations as well. Where appropriate, building setbacks should be
flexible to accommodate the need for pedestrian-oriented commercial uses. Policies
encouraging pedestrian and other modes of transportation within commercial/industrial
areas are contained in Section 3 under Goals 6 and 10. (General Plan Amendment 97-2
adopted by City Council June 11, 1997.).
Another design issue for commercial/industrial development is the need for integration
of each site into its surrounding area, with respect to circulation inter-connectivity,
building placement, consistency of design features, and landscaping. If individual site
plans within a shopping district are properly designed, it should be possible for a
customer to park a vehicle and walk to several places of business without having to
drive from one to the other. In addition, vehicles should be able to access various parts
of a commercial development without exiting onto a public street.
Each portion of a development plan should consider adjacent structures and their uses.
For example, one building should not place its loading dock and trash compactor
adjacent to another building's front door. If one site user has created a pleasant
outdoor seating area for food service, another user should not erect an adjacent
structure which permanently shades this area with a large and foreboding block wall.
Each site and building design should fit into its context, in order to present a unified
image to the street and a convenient, pleasant environment for users. Policies requiring
integration of site designs are also contained in Section 3, Goals 6 and 10. (General Plan
Amendment 97-2 adopted by City Council June 11, 1997.)

3.      Mixed Use Development
Traditional zoning practices have separated different uses, rather than allowing them to
co-exist on the same site. Increasingly, however, cities are recognizing the benefits of
allowing mixed use development. By mixing uses, businesses can provide commercial
goods and services in close proximity to the residents they serve, and benefit from the
ready customer base living in the immediate area. Mixed uses can provide employment
opportunities within walking distance of residential neighborhoods, reduce the area
devoted to vehicle parking, limit travel times, vehicle trips and traffic congestion, and
minimize air emissions. Providing opportunities for people to live and work in the same
location can cut overhead costs for beginning entrepreneurs and artisans, and provide
for more stable family situations for working parents with young children. In addition,
mixed-use neighborhoods have the potential to create an interesting and exciting social
fabric within a community. For these reasons, Palmdale has included mixed use
designations within the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance to allow and encourage
mixed use development.
Goal CD 7 addresses desirable design features for mixed use areas. As with other
sections of the Element, emphasis is given to interconnectivity of uses by all travel
modes, and integration of uses to maximize benefits and minimize adverse impacts.
4.      Public Facilities
The Community Design Element addresses each type of land use with great detail in
terms of layout, function and appearance. It is the City's intent that these same design
considerations be applied to land within the public realm, including rights-of-way, public
buildings and open spaces. Goal CD 8 outlines specific policies the City will adopt for
various public projects and capital improvements, in order to ensure that the community
character which the City is attempting to achieve will be found in both private and public
places. Design guidelines for streetscapes, drainage facilities and public buildings are
contained in Section 2 under Goal CD 9.
C.      Conclusion
To achieve the design goals outlined in Section 3 will require a unified effort by the staff
of each City department involved in development decisions, as well as the Planning
Commission and City Council. Various implementation measures are outlined in
Section 4 of this Element. A primary tool in this effort will be the City's updated Zoning
Ordinance, which contains specific requirements designed to ensure compliance with
the community design goals. The Downtown Revitalization Plan will expand on design
criteria appropriate for a pedestrian-oriented commercial core combining specialty retail,
entertainment, office and civic uses. The City's engineering design standards will be

modified to recognize the special design needs of rural areas, and enforcement will be
used to enhance property maintenance where needed. These are all City-sponsored
measures which can be taken to implement this Element.
Section 4 also outlines measures which should be taken to involve the private sector in
community design objectives. Specifically, coordination with private businesses to
upgrade older facades and landscaping and to enhance new development could be
addressed through business incentive programs, including low interest loans or other
means. In addition, presentation of the City's design goals in clearly stated, illustrated
handouts should be made available so that designers can incorporate these features
into their development plans.
The City will also actively investigate and pursue available funding sources for
landscaping, utility undergrounding, city beautification and other programs targeting
community improvement, as well as committing certain City funds to these measures
when feasible.
With cooperation on these implementation measures and adherence to the goals and
policies contained in this Element, the City of Palmdale will demonstrate its commitment
to creation of a well-designed and livable community.
