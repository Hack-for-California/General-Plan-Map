LAND USE DEVELOPMENT INTENSITY
The type and amount of physical development that could occur in the City is governed by the
General Plan Land Use Map and the densities promulgated in Table LU-2, General Plan
Land Use Designations. Table LU-3
Land Use Acreage Designations by Acreage and Development Intensity – City Boundaries,
projects the development intensity, including the maximum amount of dwelling units and
employment square footage, that could occur in the City’s currently incorporated boundaries.
Table LU-4, Land Use Acreage Designations by Acreage and Development Intensity – Exist-
ing Sphere, projects the development intensity, including the maximum amount of dwelling
units and employment square footage, that could occur in the City existing sphere of influ-
ence. Table LU-5, Land Use Acreage Designations by Acreage and Development Intensity
– Proposed Sphere (Northern Expansion Area), projects the development intensity of the
Land Use Plan, including the maximum amount of dwelling units and employment square
footage, that could occur in the proposed Northern Expansion Area. Table LU-6, Land Use
Acreage Designations by Acreage and Development Intensity – City Boundaries + Existing
Sphere + Proposed Sphere (Northern Expansion Area), projects the development intensity
of the Land Use Plan, including the maximum amount of dwelling units and employment
square footage, that could occur in the City, inclusive of both the City’s currently incorpo-
rated boundaries, the existing SOI and the proposed SOI.

               Land Use by Density and Square Footage
               Given the wide range of development which presently exists and what is anticipated, the
               diversity of the natural environment within the Victorville Planning Area, and the large area
               governed by the General Plan, the City and sphere of influence areas are divided into ten
               Planning Areas. The boundaries of the ten Planning Areas were delineated using topog-
               raphic features, man-made features, and land use characteristics. The Planning Areas are
               indicated in Figure LU-2 and in the individual Planning Area land use maps as identified in
               Figures LU-3 through LU-12.

   Section D, Assisted Hous-ing At Risk of

   early tax-credit financing contracts. Such
   projects are at risk of losing those rent
   restrictions within the next few years,
   which can result in significant rent in-

          based on a percentage of the area median income (AMI) determined by HUD and HCD, as
          follows:

             Very Low Income – between 31% and 50% of the area median income

            Mixed Use Residential District: As part of its General Plan 2030, the City established a new
            mixed use residential district that allows a residential density of up to 60 dwelling units per acre.
            The General Plan designates 609 acres of this mixed use density. Based on the development
            standards described below and expected development trends, this designation is expected
            would allow for development of up to 9,264 very high density dwelling units (at an expected av-

   ber to accommodate current and pro-
   jected households.
The 2000 RHNA allocation for Victorville as-
signed the City a regional housing need of
5,323 units, consisting of: Very Low Income
                                                                                                       Housing
1,425 units; Low Income, 930 units; Moder-
ate Income, 1,188 units; and High Income,
1,779 units. This allocation extended from
1998 to 2005.
The City met this need through new construc-
tion and preservation and rehabilitation of
existing affordable housing. As indicated in
Table 9, between 2000 and 2005, the City
housing stock increased from 22,656 units to
33,509 units, a 10,853 unit or 48% increase.
As presented in this document, the majority
of Victorville’s housing is affordable to lower
income households.

      Term                                        Definition
Decibel (dB)       A unit of level that denotes the ratio between two quantities that
                   are proportional to power; the number of decibels is 10 times the
                   logarithm (to the base 10) of this ratio.
Frequency (Hz)     Of a function periodic in time, the number of times that the quantity
                   repeats itself in one second (i.e., number of cycles per second).
A-Weighted         The sound level obtained by use of A-weighting. The A-weighting

(dBA)              nents of the sound in a manner similar to the frequency response
                   of the human ear and correlates well with subjective reactions to
                   noise.

Lmax, Lmin         The maximum and minimum A-weighted sound levels measured
                   on a sound level meter, during a designated time interval, using
                   fast time averaging.
Ambient Noise      The all-encompassing noise associated with a given environment
Level              at a specified time, usually a composite of sound from many
                   sources at many directions, near and far; no particular sound is
                   dominant.
Intrusive          The noise that intrudes over and above the existing ambient noise
                   at a given location. The relative intrusiveness of a sound depends
                   upon its amplitude, duration, frequency, and time of occurrence
                   and tonal or informational content as well as the prevailing ambient
                   noise level.
