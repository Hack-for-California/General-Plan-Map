1.000 LAND USE ELEMENT
1.100	INTRODUCTION
1.110	Purpose
The Land Use Element delineates in written and graphic terms Atherton’s goals, objectives and policies concerning future land uses within the Town’s jurisdiction. The Element sets forth the distribution, location and extent of residential, open space and public land uses.
1.120	Relation to Other Elements
While the Land Use and Circulation Elements are the primary General Plan policy elements, other parts of the Plan contain policies and proposals which relate to the Land Use Element. Elements of the Plan which are related to the Land Use Element include Circulation, Housing, Open Space, Conservation and Noise.
1.200	LAND USE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
1.210	Goal
To preserve the Town’s character as a scenic, rural, thickly wooded residential area with abundant open space.
1.220	Objectives
1.221	To establish a framework for determining the location and extent of land uses within the Town’s area of interest.
1.222	To limit the nature of land uses to those which are compatible with the overall land use planning goal.
1.223	To retain the high quality of maintenance and living environment existing in the Town’s residential neighborhoods.
1.300	RESIDENTIAL LAND USE
1.310 General Description
Residential areas are designed to contain housing and related facilities such as schools and churches. Residential land uses determine the level of need for schools, public facilities, roads and parks.
LU-1
1.320	Residential Land Use Categories
1.321	Residential Density and Building Intensity Standards
Residential density is expressed in dwelling units per net acre. Population density is expressed in people per acre and is derived by multiplying the average population per household by the dwelling unit density. It is estimated that the population density figures will remain relatively constant through the year 2020.
Note: Population per household projections are found in Housing Element Table H-10 and are listed below:
YEAR	POPULATION PER HOUSEHOLD
T990	2.78
2000	2.85
2010	2.89
2020	2.86
Therefore, when rounded, the population density is about 3 people per acre. Planned residential building densities are based on the number of dwellings per net acre. Net density is defined as the horizontal projection of the gross land area in acres, less the area devoted to road rights-of-way divided into the total number of residential units. In calculating net density, areas that will be dedicated to permanent open space are included in the gross land area. In the General Plan, density ranges are used to define the broad land use categories. Specific densities are designated in the various zoning districts. Population densities were derived by multiplying the population per household (from 2000 U.S. Census) by the building intensity range. Population density numbers were rounded to the nearest whole number.
The Zoning Article of the Municipal Code limits the residential building intensity and bulk by the use of floor area ratios. The Code specifies the maximum amount of gross floor area that can be constructed on residential lots based on lot size. Floor area is defined as the total square footage of all roofed structures exceeding six feet in height on a residential lot, but not including open structures such as arbors.
TABLE LU-I: RESIDENTIAL DENSITY AND INTENSITY

Low Density	3	HTSUO	9	R-1B
LU-2
1.322	Single Family, Low Density
The single family low density designation is applied to all residential land in Atherton. This land use density is intended to minimize environmental damage to sensitive, scenic and open space areas. The conventional single family detached home is the standard structural type planned for these areas.
1.330	Residential Land Use Policies
1.331	Future plans for residential development or redevelopment are severely limited ' due to the fact that the Town has been almost entirely developed.
1.332	The development of high density and/or high rise residential structures or commercial uses of any kind would destroy the scenic, rural and open space, character of the Town, and is, therefore, prohibited.
1.333	Minimum lot sizes in hillside areas (defined as areas with average cross slopes greater than 20 percent) shall be related to the slope and shall not be less than:
TABLE LU-2: MINIMUM LOT SIZES IN HILLSIDE AREAS
	
0-19.9%			1 Acre
20-34.9%	2 Acres	’
35% +	5 Acres
1.334	Structures higher than 34 feet shall be prohibited.
1.335	Proposed residential subdivisions, as well as proposals to replace existing homes, shall adhere to the following design criteria:
A.	Maintenance of existing neighborhood environments shall be promoted by the design of the subdivision and subdivision improvements. Designs shall be visually harmonious and compatible with neighborhood character.
B.	Adequate drainage and off-street parking shall be provided. Street lighting shall be kept to a minimum. Temporary or guest on-street parking areas shall be minimized.
C.	Uniformity of lot design should be avoided by using such techniques as meandering streets.
D.	Trees shall be preserved to the maximum extent feasible while allowing for construction within established parameters for setbacks and lot coverage in
/
LU-3
accordance with the Municipal Code chapter regulating removal of and damage to heritage trees.
E.	Residential land uses shall be designed in accordance with the density, floor area ratio, height, bulk and other standards established by the Town.
F.	All utilities installed in conjunction with new subdivisions shall be placed underground.
G.	Residential land uses shall be consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the Atherton General Plan Housing Element.
H.	Second residential units are permitted when consistent with adopted standards.
I.	Privacy is a factor which shall be incorporated into subdivision, subdivision improvements and home design.
J.	The Town allows minimum lot size subdivisions only where such minimum lot sizes do not significantly degrade established levels of privacy, wooded areas, and/or the open space environment.
K.	Residential improvements shall follow the model policies developed for the San Mateo Countywide Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program to minimize the discharge of pollutants into the waterways.
1.400	OPEN SPACE LAND USE
1.410	General Description
Open space refers to both used and unused land. It includes developed and undeveloped park lands, visually significantT/p.en.Lands, water areas and wildlife habitat, and undeveloped land which is intended to be retained in an undeveloped state in the future.
Open space land use is generally intended for the following purposes:
A.	Outdoor recreation.
B.	Preservation of natural resources.
C.	Managed production of resources.
D.	Public health and safety.
E.	Lands designated for use as parks and open space on the General Plan
LU-4
Map are zoned POS and include Holbrook Palmer Park, the California Water Service property and other sites located throughout town. In addition, some of the lands zoned PFS, as well as many privately held parcels contribute to the town’s inventory of open space.
1.420	Open Space Land Use Policies
1.421	The Town shall continue to preserve the open space characteristics of existing schools, churches and park facilities.
1.422	Land uses which diminish the open space character of the Town, such as commercial and high density residential uses, shall be prohibited.
1.500 PUBLIC AND QUASI-PUBLIC LAND USE
1.510	General Description
This land use category typically includes the types of activities and facilities which are generally recognized to be more conveniently provided by public or quasi-public agencies than by the private sector. Such uses include utilities such as water, sewer and power, basic facilities such as local government and schools, and services such as police and fire protection. Lands designated for public and quasi-public use on the General Plan Map are zoned PFS.
1.520	Public Facilities
Atherton has a wide variety of public facilities available to its residents. Some of these services and facilities are operated by the town, while any are provided by special districts and private companies. The boundaries of special districts are generally not related to or contiguous with Town boundaries.
1.530 Town Administration
Town administrative functions are located in several buildings grouped at the comer of Ashfield Road and Station Lane. The administrative building houses the administrative offices and the Town’s police headquarters. The Town Permit Center is located in portable buildings across Station Lane between the Corporation Yard and the train depot parking lot. Building, Engineering/Public Works and Planning functions are accommodated in the Permit Center. Park and Recreation offices are located in the main building at Holbrook Palmer Park. The City Council chambers are located on the south comer of Ashfield Road and Station Lane. The Town desires to consolidate these activities (i.e. those currently housed in portable buildings) within ,xa permanent Town building if and when feasible.
LU-5
1.540 Public Services: Police, Fire and Libraries
The Town of Atherton has its own police force, while fire protection is handled by the Menlo Park Fire Protection District. Library facilities are provided by a branch of the San Mateo County Library, located on Station Lane.
1.550 Schools
PUBLIC
Public elementary schools in Atherton fall under the jurisdiction of three separate districts: Redwood City, Menlo Park and Las Lomitas. The number of primary school age children has increased somewhat over the past 10 years as indicated by U.S. Census Data. However, the increase has been accommodated within existing or expanded schools. Public secondary school students generally attend Menlo/Atherton High School and Woodside High School, which are administered by the Sequoia Union High School District.
PRIVATE
There are six private schools in Atherton. Sacred Heart Schools includes three schools on its campus on Valparaiso Avenue: a Montessori preschool, St. Joseph’s Elementary School and Sacred Heart Preparatory High School. Menlo School on Valparaiso Avenue has a middle school and a high school. Menlo College on El Camino Real is a four-year college with a major evening college component. Private schools in Atherton are requested to submit Campus Master Plans to the Town for public information purposes. The Master Plans are required to be reviewed annually. Conditional Use Permits for new or relocated buildings and facilities are required to be consistent with the Master Plan.
1.560 Public Utilities
/
The Town’s water comes from the City and County of San Francisco operated Hetch Hetchy System. The water supply is delivered by the California Water Service Company. Sewage is collected by the West Bay Sanitary District and Fair Oaks Sanitary District for transmission to treatment facilities located in the eastern portion of Redwood Peninsula in Redwood City and operated by the South Bayside Systems Authority. Some stormwater drainage falls under the jurisdiction of the Atherton Channel Drainage District and/or San Mateo County Flood Control District. Pacific Gas and Electric Co., furnishes natural gas and electricity to Atherton.
1.570 Solid and Liquid Waste Disposal
Solid waste and recycling generated by the Town of Atherton is handled by a contractor, which hauls the waste to a transfer station and recyclery in San Carlos and then to a disposal site at Ox Mountain north of State Route 92 and
LU-6
Skyline Boulevard. Construction &, Demolition debris is generally recycled at Zanker. Yard waste is sent to Newby Island for composting. The Ox Mountain Ranch Sanitary Land Fill operation is divided into two phases. The first phase, which is underway, is the filling of the Corinda los Trancos Canyon. A future phase will involve the filling of Apanolio Canyon in the same vicinity. Liquid wastes are collected by the West Bay Sanitary District and Fair Oaks Sanitary District and transmitted to facilities operated by the South Bayside Systems Authority in Redwood Shores.
1.580	Public and Quasi-Public Land Use Policies
1.581	Town administrative functions are located primarily at the Ashfield Road/Station Lane Administrative facilities.
1.582	Surplus school sites and other public lands shall be used for purposes which are compatible with the surrounding neighborhood and consistent with the General Plan land use designation.
1.583	The Town shall practice the use of drought tolerant vegetation in future landscaping of public lands to reduce the need for irrigation.
1.584	The Town supports recycling as a means of reducing the amount of waste material requiring disposal in the landfill. The Town’s objective is to reduce the amount of waste material by continuing to participate in the South Bayside Waste Management Authority’s recycling and clean waste programs. The Town shall encourage recycling and waste reduction efforts for residents, schools and in public and private development projects.

INTRODUCTION
Purpose
The Circulation Element describes facilities and policies for the movement of people and goods throughout the Town. It includes a plan of roadways, in addition to facilities for pedestrian, bicycle and rail transportation. Since Town policy seeks to preserve all streets and highways as scenic routes, this Element shall also serve as the Scenic Roadways Element of the General Plan.
Relation to Other Elements
The Circulation Element is most closely related to the Land Use and Housing Elements. It is particularly essential that the Circulation Element reflects and reinforces the goals and objectives set forth in the Land Use Element. Specifically, roadways and other transportation facilities must be planned and designed under the overriding principle of maintaining the Town’s rural character.
CIRCULATION GOAL AND OBJECTIVES
Goal
To develop a circulation system that is compatible with the needs of various land uses planned within the Town of Atherton.
Objectives
To preserve the streets of Atherton as scenic routes.
To minimize the encroachment of the circulation network on the residential and open space uses which prevail throughout most of the community.
ROADWAYS
General Description
Roadways in the Town of Atherton may be divided into four classifications: highways; minor arterial streets; collector streets and local streets. While the vast majority of Atherton’s roadways fall into the last category, each of these four categories is represented by at least one road.
CI-9
The following table shows the normal range of traffic capacity for each type of roadway, in terms of average daily traffic (ADT).
TABLE C-l: TRAFFIC CAPACITY BY ROAD TYPES
Road lype	Volume (AD L)	Lanes
Freeways & Highways	Greater than 50,000	TTU
		
Minor Arterial	10,00(F257RJ0	2
		
Collector	2,500-12,000	2
		
Local Streets	Less than 1,000	2
2.320 Freeways & Highways
Freeways are multi-lane facilities with no fixed interruptions to traffic flow. The Town of Atherton contains no freeways; however, the Junipero Serra Freeway (Interstate 280) abuts the western edge of the incorporated Town limits. The single highway through the Town is El Camino Real (State Route 82) which provides for through traffic.
2.330	Minor Arterial Streets
Minor arterials are streets with traffic signals that primarily serve through traffic and provide access to abutting properties as a secondary function. The main role of minor arterial streets is to link residential districts to other transportation facilities and to act as emergency service and evacuation routes.
-2:340'; ■ Collector Streets '	......
Collector streets provide both land access and traffic circulation service within residential areas. Unlike minor arterials, their operation is not always dominated by traffic signals. While not as important as minor arterials, collector streets should still be designed to carry through traffic. Their function is to transfer traffic from local traffic generators (homes, schools, etc.) and local streets to arterials.
Table C-2 below lists Atherton’s major streets type and their classification by road type.

2.350 Local Streets
Aside from the roadways cited above the remainder of Atherton’s roads are -	. .classified as local streets. Such roads are used to provide access to abutting
property, locations for easements, open space for light and air and a fire break between buildings. Carrying traffic is a secondary function of local streets and
they should be designed to discourage through traffic.
2.360 Street Standards
The general standards for street right-of-way and improvements are listed in Table C-3 below. Local conditions may necessitate modification of these standards where topography, building location or other conditions warrant. Detailed standards for street improvements are set forth in the Atherton Municipal Code.

2.372	Meandering street lines shall be preserved consistent with traffic safety.
2.373	A public street shall be accepted by the Town only on the condition that it has been improved in accordance with Town standards existing at the time of acceptance.
2.374	Use of Town streets as thoroughfares by trucks and other large vehicles shall be carefully controlled.
2.375	Paving for temporary on-street parking within the roadway right-of-way will be prohibited.
2.376	Valley gutters or rolled curbs may be required in all new subdivisions.
2.400	SCENIC ROADWAYS
2.410	General Description	"	"
Scenic roads are an important resource to San Mateo County and to Atherton for both aesthetic and recreational purposes. Scenic corridors can best be defined as the visual land area outside the road right-of-way and generally described as the “view from the road”. It is within this area that development standards are applied to retain and enhance scenic qualities and restrict unsightly use of the land. These standards may include architectural and site review procedures and regulations on building setbacks, signs, grading, tree removal and underground utility lines. The Junipero Serra Freeway (Interstate 280) is the only roadway located in Atherton’s Sphere of Influence which has been designated as a scenic highway pursuant to the provisions of Section 260 et seq. of the California Streets and Highways Code. However, it is Town policy to preserve all streets and highways as scenic routes.
CI-12
2.420	Scenic Roadway Policies
2.421	All streets and highways in the Town of Atherton shall be preserved as scenic routes.
2.422	The development of arterial streets and/or highways through the Town shall be prevented to minimize disruption of its scenic features.
2.423	The intrusion of El Camino on the ecology of the Town shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible by:
A.	Preserving center planting on El Camino Real;
B.	Minimizing the number of lots with access onto El Camino Real;
C.	Promoting the maintenance of walls, shrubbery and trees along the sides of El Camino Real
2.424	For reasons discussed above the Town also seeks to minimize the number of lots with access onto Alameda de las Pulgas and Middlefield Road.
2.425	On-street and visible off-street parking of vehicles and other means of transportation shall be carefully controlled.
2.426	Street lights and signs shall be kept to a minimum.
2.427	Trees located in the right-of-way shall be preserved to the extent consistent with traffic safety.
2.500	TRANSIT AND RAIL TRAFFIC
2.510	General Description
The San Mateo Transit District provides intra-county bus service to all of the cities of Bayside San Mateo County. The Transit District has assumed the commute function of the Greyhound Line within the County. Local service is available via routes along El Camino Real and Middlefield Road.
Rail service to Atherton consists of the Joint Powers Board Railroad line from Gilroy to San Francisco with access points at the Menlo Park, Atherton and Redwood City train stations. Union Pacific and Cal Train provide both freight and passenger services through the Town.

3.000 HOUSING ELEMENT (2001 UPDATE)
3.100	INTRODUCTION
3.110	Purpose
The State of California requires that all cities within the San Francisco Bay Area update the Housing Element of their General Plan by December 31, 2001. The purpose of this document is to meet this requirement by evaluating the existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments of Atherton, evaluating existing policies and programs aimed at the preservation, improvement and development of housing and developing new ones.
The contents of this update includes an analysis of housing needs, statements of goals and policies, a schedule of programs and actions and an estimate of the number of housing units the Town expects to be developed, improved and maintained in the local housing stock. Programs and policies included in the existing Housing Element are evaluated and modified where necessary to reflect changing market conditions and policy priorities.
3.120	Definition of Income Categories
Since the determination of housing need is often discussed in terms of income categories, it is important to define the categories used in this update at the outset. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has established household income categories based on a proportion of the area's median family income as summarized below:
TABLE H-O: HUD INCOME CATEGORIES DEFINED
,111	„ ( III III	% ot Median
Very Low income	Below 50% of Median
Low Income	50-80% of Median
Moderate Income	80-120% of Median
Above Moderate Income	Above 120% of Median
The income limits established by HUD for San Mateo County in 2001 are presented in TableH-lA.
Housing affordability limits are derived using the Standard Definition of Affordability level. Thirty percent of gross household income is the standard affordability level. A household that spends greater than 30% of its gross income on housing is described as overpaying for housing. The housing affordability limits are calculated from the income limits established by H1UD for San Mateo County in 2001 and are presented in Table H-1B.

3.130	Relation to Other Elements
The Housing Element is closely related to the Land Use, Open Space and Circulation Elements. In the Housing Element, residential land use is translated into terms of household units to be accommodated in the future. Lands designated for residential use are identified in the Land Use Element; the location, site area and terrain suitable for housing is related to both open space and land use; and the capability of serving residential neighborhoods by an efficient circulation system is discussed in the Circulation Element.

3.140 Information Sources for the Housing Element Update
Data from the 2000 Federal Census formed the basis of the 2001 Atherton Housing Element update. Unfortunately, a significant portion of the results from the 2000 Census will not be available in time for inclusion in the update. In many cases, key indicators such as income estimates, housing prices and rents have been updated using the best available information from the Department of Finance, HUD, local Realtors and other sources. In some instances, however, it has not been possible to forecast beyond the 1990 Census data in	updating	the	2001	Housing	Element.

ASSESSMENT OF HOUSING NEEDS
3.210	Analysis of Population and Employment in Atherton
This section contains background information on the Town's population and employment characteristics, including historic population growth, age and income characteristics of the population and the condition of the housing stock. It also includes an analysis of population and employment trends, and documentation of Atherton’s existing and projected housing need including the Town’s share of the regional housing need as determined by the Association of Bay Area Governments (AB AG) in March 2001.
3.211	Historic Population Trends
At the time of incorporation, in 1923, the Town of Atherton had a population of 650 people1. Over the next three decades, the town expanded to 3,630 people. The most significant growth took place between 1950 and 1960 when the population more than doubled to 7,717 people. Population growth slowed dramatically in the following decade and reached a peak by 1970 of just over 8,000. The 1980 Census counted 7,797 people, a 3.5 percent decline from 1970. The population declined further in 1990 (8.1%) and increased slightly in 2000 (0.4%). In the period 1970-2000 Atherton’s population actually decreased by 11 %.

3.212	Age Characteristics
In 1970, the percentage breakdown of Atherton residents in various age groups closely corresponded to the County-wide percentages; Out of a total of 8,085 people, 32 percent were children under 18, 60 percent were between the ages of 18 and 64, and approximately 8 percent were seniors 65 and over.
The 1980 Census revealed an overall aging of the population. The percentage of young people under age 18 declined to 24 percent. The percent of people between the ages of 18 and 64 increased slightly to 63 percent, and the number of seniors increased to nearly 13 percent. County-wide trends were comparable.

Data is not available from the U.S. Census for the year 2000, however the trends over the past 20 years plus more recent studies show some very distinct patterns. While the number of males in the labor force has remained relatively constant, the percentage of females has increased, from 29 percent of the women age 16 and over in 1970 to over 45 percent in 1990. Only 60 percent of those Atherton residents 16 and over are in the labor force while County-wide, the proportion is 71 percent.

By far the most occupation types stated by Atherton residents over the past 30 years have been managerial and professional specialty jobs. These have consistently accounted for 58-59 percent of the work force. The second most significant category has been technical, sales and administrative support, which has been increasing, from 22 to over 30 percent by 1990. Service occupations have accounted for 6 to 9 percent of the work force.

3.215	Population and Employment Projections
Bi-annually ABAG publishes its 20 year forecasts for the San Francisco Bay Area. The forecasts are for population, labor force, households, income and jobs. These projections are made for the 9 county region and then distributed among the counties and cities of the region. The latest study and publication is “Projections-2000” issued by ABAG in December 1999. The forecasts for Atherton are found in Table H-9.
HS-26
As defined in the glossary, two basic living situations are counted by the U.S. Census and subsequently used by ABAG in its forecasts. Those are people living in households or living in group quarters. Most Atherton residents live in households, however 300-400 students live in Menlo College dorms and are counted as living in group quarters.
When the factors contributing to the ABAG forecasts are analyzed in light of the 2000 Census count, it appears that their projections are over optimistic. First, the 2000 population per household Census count was actually 2.85 where ABAG forecast 2.91. Second, the actual number of households counted in 2000 was 6,876 as opposed to the ABAG projection 7,100. Third, the number of dwelling units in Atherton has remained constant over the past 20 years, the Town is essentially built out. Therefore, the opportunity for significant new household formation is limited. It seems more reasonable to project population per household to follow the pattern expected for San Mateo County. That is 2000-2.85, 2010-2.89, 2020-2.86. A more realistic population estimate is shown in Table H-10 and graphically in exhibits H-0 and H-1.

3.216	Determination of Housing Needs
Regarding the determination of local housing need, Article 10.6, Section 65584 of the Government Code, states the following:
“Based upon population projections on data provided by the Department^ of Finance, and regional population forecasts used in preparing regional transportation plans, and in consultation with each Council of Governments, the Department of Housing and Community Development shall determine the regional share of statewide housing need ... The appropriate Council of Governments shall determine the share for each City and County consistent with the criteria or this subdivision...”
3.217	ABAG Housing Needs Determination ~ 2001 to 2006
In December 1999, ABAG projected that San Mateo County would grow by approximately 6,500 households between 2000 and 2005. ABAG Forecast that Atherton's share of this growth wouldbe slightly less than its ratio to the County's population, so the Town' could be expected to experience an increase of 60 households. ABAG has produced local projections that indicate Atherton will grow by an estimated 220 people between 2000 and 2005 (Projections-2000). Over this same time period, ABAG has determined that Atherton has a "total projected need" of 166 additional housing units based on its Housing Needs Determinations report.
3.218	Atherton's Quantified Housing Objectives
The objective of the Town of Atherton is to encourage the addition of 166 units to the housing stock during the 2002 to 2006, consistent with the housing needs estimate of the Association of Bay Area Governments. The Town shall endeavor to ensure that the aforementioned units be distributed by income level as follows:

The housing policies and programs set forth in this document are intended to achieve the above housing production figures within the 2002 to 2006 planning period.
3.220	Housing and Household Characteristics
3.221	Housing Units and Mix
A total of 2,496 housing units were counted in Atherton during the 1980 Federal Census, 103 units more than in 1970. That number has stayed essentially constant through the year 2000. The 2000 Census counted 2,505 housing units in Atherton. The Census figures revealed that the average household size declined in 1980 to 3.0 persons per household, from 3.5 persons per household in 1970. A further decline occurred in 1990. There was a modest increase in the year 2000 to 2.85 persons per household. All of the housing units in Atherton, with the exception of group quarters, are single-family homes. The primary group quarter facilities are located at Menlo College, which can accommodate on-campus residency of approximately 450 students.

The most recent Census data available regarding the age of residential structures in Atherton is from 1990. As of that year almost 90 percent of the City’s housing stock was 20 years old or older. However, in the mid-and late 1990’s a trend of demolishing existing single-family houses and replacing them with larger houses, has developed. That trend continues through the summer of 2001. An average of approximately 40 houses per year have been replaced over a 7 to 8-year period.

The condition of nearly all residential structures in Atherton is well-maintained. Renovation permit requests are common according to Building Department records. A windshield survey of all residential structures in Atherton was conducted as part of the background research for this update. The results of this survey showed that there are no areas or virtually no structures in need of major rehabilitation or replacement.
3.223	Housing Tenure
As in the case of housing age, the most recent Census data available is from 1990. As of that year almost 62 percent of housing units in Atherton were occupied by their residents for over 10 years. The long-term residency in Atherton is likely related to the high proportion of owner occupied units in the City. Since 1980, the percentage of owner occupied units in Atherton has remained between 93 and 95 percent.
However, the trend in home replacement has most likely changed the tenure statistics. It is expected that the year 2000 Census will show a higher proportion of householders having moved into their home in recent years.

3.224	Household Size
The population of Atherton is fairly evenly dispersed throughout the community in a low-density single family home development pattern. The two greatest concentrations of population are housed in the group quarters at Menlo College and those at Sacred Heart.
In 2000, the average household size for all residential units in Atherton was 2.85 persons. For owner occupied units the average was slightly lower at 2.84 persons per unit, and for renter occupied units it was higher than the overall average at 2.94 persons per unit.

3.225	Level of Payment Compared to Ability to Pay
The income versus affordability comparison is only available from the 1990 Census. Like several other data sources, this information had not been released at the time of the writing of this document. Therefore, the most current information available is from the 1990 Census.
The data correlating housing cost to household income is presented in tables H-15 A-D: Tables H-15 A and B show the correlation for owner-occupied households with incomes 80% or less and 50% or less of median, respectively. Tables H-15 C and D show the correlation for renter-occupied households also with incomes 80% or less and 50% or less of median, respectively. Those households with incomes at or below 80% of median income are defined as low-income households. Those households with incomes at or below 50% of median income are defined as very low-income households. In 1990 the median income for San Mateo County was $46,437. Low-income households had an income of $37,150 or less and very low-income households had an income of $23,218 or less. Overpaying is defined in terms of a percentage of the gross household income a household spends for housing including utilities. Thirty percent of gross household income is the standard affordability level. Severe overpaying occurs when households pay 50% or more of their gross income for housing.
The 1990 Census data was computed for the 30% level, but not for the 50% level. In Atherton, 96 of the 2,253 households or 4.3% of households had low incomes and were overpaying for either renter or owner-occupied housing units according to the 1990 Census. The data for very low-income households show that 83 of the 2,253 households or 3.7 % of the households were overpaying for either renter-occupied or owner-occupied housing units according to the 1990 Census.
This section will be updated by the Atherton Building and Planning Department to reflect data on level of payment compared to ability to pay when that information from the 2000 U.S. Census is released.

3.230	Inventory of Land Suitable for Residential Development
Table H-16 identifies lands suitable for residential development in Atherton. Each site is identified by address and includes the site acreage and existing land use. Existing zoning falls into the categories listed below. It should be noted that Atherton has only four zoning districts, the three listed below plus a Parks and Open Space District.
R-1A (Residential District)- Limits land uses to single-family detached homes on minimum one-acre size lots.
R-1B (Residential District)-Limits uses to single-family detached homes on minimum size 13,500 square foot (0.31 acre) lots.
PFS (Public Facilities and Schools District)- Limits land uses to public and private schools including affiliated residential uses, town hall, library and other similar public and quasi public uses without limitation on lot size.
There are no vacant parcels in town. The residential parcels included in the table are identified as underutilized since they are of sufficient size to be further subdivided according to the existing zoning lot size limits.
All parcels have adequate infrastructure, this includes existing paved streets, sewer, water supply for domestic and fire suppression purposes and drainage facilities. Available public services include Police, Fire, Parks and Recreation, Public Works, Building -Inspection and Town Administration.-------------------------------0
The development capacity indicates the number of dwelling units that could realistically result, in accordance with present zoning density limits, from further subdivision of underutilized parcels. However, since each underutilized parcel currently contains a single-family home, that home would most likely need to be relocated or demolished. Therefore, the net number of potential additional dwelling units per parcel is one less than the development capacity.	,
3.231	Menlo College Faculty and Student Housing
Menlo College is a private four-year institution with a current enrollment of about 540 full time traditional age students and 200 degree completion working adult students (primarily attending evening classes). It currently employs about 185 faculty and staff members. The institution has recently embarked on a Campus Master Plan program with one of its goals to “encourage more students to continue to live on campus beyond their first two years at the college. Also included in this program are new residential environments that will attract quality faculty and staff who might otherwise be deterred from the area by the Peninsula’s high cost of housing. The intent of this housing is to have a significant portion of the units qualify as below market rate (BMR) units. When available, these units could accommodate Town of Atherton employees.” In addition to
HS-36
the more conventional college residence halls, the Master Plan includes proposals for both new faculty and junior and senior student housing designed for independent living. All of these units would meet the current US Census definition of a housing unit, including separate living quarters with direct access from outside or through a common hall. These projects are described below.
Faculty Housing Village (19,600 sq.ft.: net 30 units)
Approximately 30 units (includes 16 new units and 14 rehabilitated or replaced units) are proposed within new faculty and staff two-story duplexes to encourage further interaction between faculty, staff and students.
•	Townhouse units include 2 bedrooms, 1 foil kitchen, a living room, small study, a foil bathroom and separate entrances (BMR qualifying).
Apartment Style Village (58 units for students, 5 for faculty)
This proposed residential village for students'who are juniors or seniors with three stories of apartment style townhouse units, would provide an attractive on-campus alternative for more senior students, faculty and staff who seek independent living experiences. These townhouses would include a mix of student, staff and faculty and would also be designed as BMR units.
•	Suite (1,250 sq.ft.) includes 4 bedrooms, lounge, foil kitchen, bathroom, and private entrance.
•	Double (800 sq.ft.) includes 2 bedrooms, lounge, kitchen, bathroom, private entrance.
•	Convertible units (1,250 sq.ft.) includes 2 plus 1 bedrooms, study, living room, full kitchen, bathroom, private entrance, and adjacent parking.
The Master Plan places a high priority on constructing; both . the new faculty and junior/senior housing units. These units should be constructed in the early to mid time frame of the Housing Element planning period, perhaps as early as 2003-2005 depending on financing.
Menlo College currently has 19 on-campus housing units rented exclusively to faculty and staff. The current rent structure for these units ranges from $250 to $325 per month.
Menlo College is planning to reserve up to 35 of the units (16 new and 19 rehabilitated or replaced units) for faculty and staff households with incomes in the very low, low and moderate categories. Because the majority of its students have significant financial need, the College anticipates that the majority of new units will be occupied by students in the very low, low and moderate income categories. It also plans to retain the rents within the standard affordable level limits defined in this Element for the next fifteen years.
HS-37
3.232	Menlo School Faculty Housing (net 11 new units)
Menlo School is a private institution providing middle school (grades 6 through 8) and high school (grades 9 through 12) education with a current enrollment of 215 middle and 550 high school students. The institution currently employs 150 faculty and staff members. This institution has also recently embarked on a Master Planning program with one of its goals to provide additional affordable on-site faculty housing as a method of retaining and attracting first rate faculty and staff that otherwise might be deterred from the area by the Peninsula’s high cost of housing. The Master Plan includes proposals for an additional eleven units of such housing that would qualify as BMR units. As currently planned, the units would be constructed in townhouse or 4-plex style, each meeting the U.S. Census definition of a housing unit, including separate living quarters with direct access from outside or through a common hall.
The Master Plan calls for these units to be constructed near the end of the current Housing Element planning period, perhaps 2005-2006.
Menlo School presently has nine on-campus housing units rented exclusively to faculty and staff. The current rents structure for these units ranges from $300 per month for a 2 bedroom, 1 bath unit to $625 per month for a 4 bedroom, 2 bath unit. Comparing these rents to the housing affordability limits in Table H-1B it is clear that the rental structure equates to the very low-income category.
3.233	Further Division of Residential Parcels
A total of 62 single-family residential parcels have been identified as having potential for further division. These have the potential to be divided into from 2 to 9 parcels depending on size and zoning. The net potential number of new dwelling units that could result from division of these properties is 107.
These sites are available to meet Atherton’s regionally defined share of future housing need in the above moderate income category.

3.240	Analysis of Government Constraints
3.241	Land Use Controls
The General Plan and Zoning Ordinance of a community are two primary tools for planning and regulating land use.
A.	General Plan. The Town of Atherton updated its General Plan between 1989 and 1991. The land use character of the Town has remained that of a mainly residential and institutional (i.e. schools) nature. The General Plan reveals that the most significant constraint to housing development is land availability. Most of the Town's land acreage is developed at existing General Plan densities.
B.	Zoning Ordinance. The Atherton Zoning Ordinance designates land uses, height, bulk, density and parking standards throughout the city. The Zoning Ordinance was designed for consistency with the General Plan. The General Plan’s four basic land use designations: Single-Family Residential, Single Family Residential Low Density, Public Facilities and Schools, and Parks and Open Space are directly reflected by the zoning districts of the R-1A (Single Family Residential one acre minimum), R-1B (Single Family Residential - 0.31 acre minimum), PFS (Public Facilities and Schools), and POS (Parks and Open Space). Table H-17 presents the Atherton Zoning Categories and Standards of density, setbacks, height limits, floor area ratios, lot coverage and parking requirements.
The zoning categories reflect the Town’s low-density residential, large lot, single-family detached character. Multiple family residential, commercial and industrial land use are prdhibffdd^Thesstandards are restrictive in that they require large setbacks, limited floor area ratios and height restrictions. However, some standards are quite unrestrictive compared to other cities. For example, Atherton does not require on-site parking, nor is architectural review and approval required.
Second dwelling units are permitted in both the R-1A and R-1B zoning districts. A Conditional Use Permit is required in order to rent or otherwise occupy a second dwelling unit on a full time basis. A guesthouse occupied for less than 30 days per year is permitted by right. A second dwelling unit requires the same setbacks as the main dwelling but is limited to 15 feet in height and 600 sq.ft, of floor area. The requirements for a Conditional Use Permit and setback limits could be considered constraints to construction of new second units or conversion of existing guesthouses to full time occupied second units.
HS-46

* 34’ maximum with increased setbacks and Conditional Use Permit
The Municipal Code and Ordinance provides a variety of lot sizes with densities ranging from one dwelling unit per five acres to three units per acre. Although the
HS-47
Town's low allowable densities constitute a constraint to affordable housing development, the impact is offset somewhat by the relatively large proportion of homes containing second dwelling units. In addition, Atherton's large homes provide opportunities for shared housing. These characteristics of the local housing stock assists the Town in meeting its regional share of affordable housing.
3.242	Building Codes
The latest edition of the Uniform Building Code is enforced in Atherton. The Town's Building Department sees that new residences, additions, auxiliary structures, etc., meet all of the latest construction and safety standards. Building permits are required for any construction work.
3.243	Permit Processing, Procedures and Fees.
Table H-17A describes the Town’s permit process procedures in general. These processes are required for the development of all housing for all income categories. Only two levels of residential permit processing are available; a Conditional Use Permit or a Building Permit. The Town does not have an Architectural Review and approval process.
Where Conditional Use Permits are required, the process involves submitting an application to the Planning Commission for review of the proposal. Preliminarily site plans and elevations are required as part of the submittal. A fee of $750.00 is charged for application review and processing. An advertised public hearing is held by the Planning Commission with mailed notice to all property owners within 500 ft. of the proposed project. Upon Planning Commission approval, plans may be submitted to the Building Department for Building Plan Check and Building Permit issuance.
Building permits must be secured before commencement of any residential construction, reconstruction, conversion, alteration or addition. Approval of permit applications is based on conformity with the Uniform Building Code and the Zoning Ordinance, although the Town has the power to grant variances from the terms of the Zoning Ordinance within the limitations provided in the Ordinance. Fees for Building Permits vary and are based on project valuation. Planning and permit fees are summarized by Table H-17B. In general, permit fees and processing times are similar to those in other Peninsula communities and are not regarded as significant constraints to housing development.
The Building Permit process has very little impact on the development of above moderate income housing in Atherton as evidenced by building activity and the number of replacement housings being constructed. The Building Department currently has approximately 800 active permits and approximately 40 houses are demolished and replaced with new houses each year. The Conditional Use Permit process and Building Permit fees could have an adverse impact on development of low and moderate-income
HS-48
housing. While removal of the process and reduction of fees might function to reduce costs slightly, there are many other factors that act to deter development of such housing. Factors such as the high cost of land (currently at about $3 million per acre), the limitations on density and non- availability of funds (e.g. in the private educational institutions and from local public sources) are the most likely deterrents to the development of low and moderate-income housing.

3.244	Availability of Assistance Programs.
Atherton does not have sufficient staff or financial resources to undertake major housing assistance programs without substantial backing by state or federal agencies. Recent reductions in funding levels of federal and state assistance programs place the Town in a tenuous position, particularly with respect to local programs requiring such assistance. The diminishing availability of outside assistance programs must be viewed as a constraint to affordable housing.
HS-49
3.245	Infrastructure Deficiencies and Budget Constraints
The Town of Atherton is responsible for two primary infrastructure components, street and drainage maintenance and reconstruction. Other infrastructure components are the responsibility of others, for example the water supply infrastructure is the responsibility of California Water Service Company. Sewers are the responsibility of the West Bay Sanitary District or the North Fair Oaks Sewer Maintenance District. The Town is also responsible for parks maintenance and operation.
A recent study of Town drainage facilities revealed various deficiencies in this component of the infrastructure. An engineering study found a total of 97 problem areas within the Town boundaries. These included repairs necessary to maintain Atherton Channel in service, elimination of two major flooding areas that pose significant risk to public safety and private property and resolution of local drainage problems. The authors estimated that the improvements necessary to bring the drainage system into compliance with current standards would cost approximately $40 million.
A similar engineering study with the street infrastructure was conducted with equally serious findings. The study found that many of the streets in town suffer from low sub grade strength, inadequate structural section, poor drainage and erosion of the pavement along unprotected edges. The authors estimate that improvements necessary to bring the street system up to current standards would cost from $19.3 to $27.4 million.
These infrastructure deficiencies and costs necessary to resolve the problems are measured against the revenues and budgetary constraints of a municipality primarily dependent upon property taxes for revenues. The Town has a total annual budget of approximately $7.45 million.

Total	$7,452,430		$7,451,565
The funds available for capital improvements are only 3 % of the budget or about $250,000 annually. The available funds are miniscule when viewed against a backdrop of $59.3 to $67.4 million in costs necessary to upgrade the Town’s street and drainage systems in order to protect the public health and safety. Therefore, the infrastructure deficiencies and budget constraints act as major constraints to the provision of housing.
The Town simply does not have funds to provide, subsidize, or otherwise financially support the provision of affordable housing. However the Town can, through its regulatory powers, support the provision of affordable housing. Such efforts are described in the following section 3.426.
3.246	Local Efforts to Remove Governmental Constraints to Housing Development
Atherton has chosen to not adopt a number of techniques used by other Peninsula cities in regulating the development of housing. By not adopting these techniques, Atherton has actualiy'Teifrb^d^gbvbrnmental constraints to housing development. Specific-exampies'1-5--include:
•	Architectural review and approval is not required.
•	Drainage and other similar impact fees are not required.
•	Most residential construction requires only Building Code review and does not require time consuming discretionary review.
HS-51
3.250	Analysis of Non-Governmental Constraints
Land scarcity and high real estate prices are the most significant nongovernmental constraints to affordable housing in Atherton. There are virtually no vacant lots in Atherton. Land currently sells for about $3 million per acre and can only be acquired by purchase of a developed parcel and removal of an existing house or by subdividing the property, which also most likely involves the removal of an existing residence. The inventory of sites suitable for residential development described in section 3.230 showed a potential of 107 new parcels that can be created by subdividing existing developed parcels. Vacant lots are few in number and render discussions of lot prices virtually meaningless. This is a result of economic forces which are well beyond the capacity of the local government to influence or control. In this context, it is difficult to tihink in terms of market-based affordable housing provision.
Low vacancy rates are an important factor contributing to high housing values in Atherton. Construction costs are also high in the San Francisco Peninsula. Building costs range from $150.00 to $300.00 per square foot. Such costs are not particularly higher in Atherton than in other surrounding jurisdictions. Home financing is generally available and there do not appear to be any mortgage deficient areas within the community. The availability of financing is not a constraint to the construction of housing units consistent with Atherton’s regional housing needs.
3.251	Summary of Resources and Constraints to Housing Development
Because the community is virtually built out, the potential effectiveness of Zoning Ordinance revisions and other policy mechanisms designed to promote housing affordability is severely limited. The constraints associated with high market prices and other factors beyond the control of local government outweigh the governmental constraints to housing development in Atherton.
3.260	Analysis, .ofjSpecial Housing Needs	_
Special needs groups include elderly residents, disabled, large families, femaleheaded households and farm workers. The numbers of people or households in these special needs groups were counted in the 1990 and 2000 Census.

3.261	Elderly Households
It is estimated that approximately 1,451 persons over age 65 lived in Atherton in 2000, representing about 20 percent of the Town’s population. In 1990 about 1,340 persons age 65 or older lived in Atherton or about 18.7% of the Town’s population. 38.3 percent of the Town’s households had at least one individual 65 years or older. Extrapolating from the 1990 Census, there are an estimated 226 people 65+ years of age that have work and mobility disabilities. Existing facilities for the elderly in Atherton include the Oakwood Community at Sacred Heart and two smaller facilities. Housing needs of the elderly are related to their decreased mobility, income limitations, health care costs and smaller living space requirements. Also, housing for the elderly should be located in close proximity to medical, commercial and recreational facilities.
3.262	Disabled Residents
Physical, mental and/or developmental disabilities may prevent a person from working, restrict one’s mobility" or make it difficult to care for oneself. Thus, disabled persons often have special housing needs related to potential limited earning capacity, the lack of accessibility and affordable housing, and higher health costs associated with disability. Disabilities are defined as mental, physical, or health conditions that last over 6 months. Extrapolating from the 1990 Census, it is estimated that 418 persons 16 years of age or older with work disabilities resided in Atherton. Further, it is estimated that 406 of those persons had mobility disabilities. While not all such persons require special housing, some may need specially designed units, located near shopping, transportation and services.
3.263	Large Households
Large family households are defined as households containing 5 or more persons. In many communities there is a limited supply of adequately sized housing units to
HS-54
accommodate large family households, and consequently they are considered a special need group.
In year 2000 Atherton had an estimated 328 households with large families. This group grew from 256 households in 1990. In many communities, households of five or more members may have difficulties finding housing of sufficient size and affordability. In Atherton, however, the large number of rooms per dwelling (7.93) indicates that a sufficient number of homes exists to accommodate such households. The primary policy that may be of benefit to large households is one which calls for a minimum percentage of affordable units to be built. Policies prohibiting housing discrimination are also applicable to households of this nature.
3.264	Female-Headed Households
The number of female-headed households in Atherton was 108 in 2000. This group grew from 84 households in 1990. The special needs of this group include low cost housing, suitable for children and located near schools and child care facilities. Innovative shared living arrangements, including congregate cooking and child care, would also be suitable. Policies contained in the Housing Element Update which benefit this group include those intended to prevent discriminatory housing practices and promote housing affordability.
3.265	Farm Workers
The number of workers employed in fishing, forestry and farming was 27 in 2000. Most of these workers are gardeners, many of whom occupy on-site affordable housing units. The housing needs of such workers are addressed through the availability of second dwelling units.
3.266	Persons in Need of Emergency Shelters
In 1990, the U.S. Census counted ,(I .“hpnie^sss,geople in emergency shelters” and 0 “homeless people visible near streets” in Atherton. However, like all communities, there are and will be Atherton residents in need of emergency
I shelters for a variety of reasons. There are no churches, governmental buildings or similar types of facilities in Atherton available to accommodate an emergency shelter. In San Mateo County, shelters and homeless assistance programs are available on a regional basis and are the main resources available to homeless residents. In 2000 there were three transitional housing shelters operating within San Mateo County serving homeless families with children. Two of these facilities are located nearby in Menlo Park, approximately 2 miles to the south, and in Redwood City, approximately 2 miles to the north. There are also several more specialized shelters for Persons with substance abuse problems and mental illnesses, for victims of domestic violence and for veterans. Additionally, the County’s Regional Housing Trust Fund endeavors to provide more transitional and low-income housing opportunities.
HS-55
The Town of Atherton will amend its annual budget to contribute funds to the Shelter Network, a non-profit San Mateo County organization that provides shelters and homeless assistance programs in San Mateo County.
3.270 Analysis of Opportunities for Energy Conservation
There are many opportunities for energy conservation during the construction of new housing units. In support of this concept, the Town requires the following:
•	All utilities installed in conjunction with new construction shall be placed underground. This reduces energy loss and maintenance requirements.
•	All new development shall utilize water conserving plumbing fixtures.
•	The Town encourages the use of drought tolerant vegetation in landscaping to reduce the need for irrigation.
•	Staff encourages the use of active solar technology and passive solar design in construction or modification of structures
Additionally, Town Planners regularly attend seminars, focused on “green building” and incorporate their new knowledge into their jobs on a daily basis.
•	Staff will continue to regularly attend conferences and seminars on “greenbuilding” and will continue to make developers aware of the above policies.
•	Staff will prepare a handout on “green-building” designs and best procedures to educate developers.
3.280 EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY
The Town shall encourage provision of hohsing opportunities for all people and will take appropriate actions when necessary to ensure that the sale, rental or financing of housing is not denied to any individual on the basis or race, sex, national origin, religion, age, or other arbitrary factors. The Town, through the Office of the City Manager will refer discrimination complaints to the appropriate legal service, county or state agency including the Peninsula Conflict Resolution Center, Legal Aid Society of San Mateo Comity, County Office of Housing, State Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
HS-56
3.290
Analysis of Existing Assisted Housing Developments that are Eligible for Conversion
There are no existing assisted housing developments in Atherton that are eligible to change from low-income housing uses during the next 10 years due to termination of subsidy contracts, mortgage pre-payment, or expiration of restrictions on use. Such assisted housing developments mean multi-family rental housing that receives governmental assistance under federal programs listed in the California Government Code, state and local multi-family revenue bond programs, local redevelopment programs, the federal community development block grant program, or local in-lieu fees.
3.300	HOUSING GOALS, OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Town’s objective for construction of new housing for above moderate income households is 107 and is equal to the AB AG Housing Needs numbers for that income catego|y. As detailed in Section 3.233 “Further Division of Residential Parcels”, the net potential number of new dwelling units that could result from development of underutilized parcels is 107. The Town does not have funds to develop housing on its own and therefore depends on the private sector to implement residential development with Town review and approval. Further, there is no ability to annex additional territory for residential development since all surrounding land is either in another city or within the sphere of influence of another city.
The Town’s objective for construction of new housing for very low, low, and moderate-income households is equal to the ABAG Housing Needs numbers for those income categories. Those can be accommodated through construction of new second dwelling units, new faculty housing at Menlo School and Menlo College, and new, independent living apartment units for junior/senior students at Menlo College.
The Town’s objective for rehabilitation of exi§fflf:e^y^c^-'5ac6me''iU3its are for 9 existing units of faculty housing at Menlo School and 19 existing units of faculty housing at Menlo College. Rehabilitation of above moderate units involves remodeling and additions to existing housing stock based on an average of 50 such projects per year.
The conservation objective refers to the preservation of existing affordable housing stock throughout the planning period.

3.400	Atherton Housing Program-5 year Schedule of Actions 2002-2006
The programs listed below and summarized in Table H-21 set forth the actions the Town of Atherton is undertaking or intends to undertake to implement its policies and achieve the goals and objectives of Housing Element through the administration of land use and development control, provision of regulatory concessions and incentives, and the utilization of appropriate federal and state financing and subsidy programs when available.
3.410	Market Rate Housing Construction
The private construction of market rate housing will, continue to provide the majority of housing units in Atherton. These units will be single family detached on existing or newly subdivided parcels within the Town. Accomplishment of the ABAG established above moderate housing needs objectives would result in the development of many of the remaining sites considered suitable for development in Atherton.
Goal: The goal of this program is to realize the development of 107 new above market rate housing units within Atherton over the next 5 years.
3.420 Second Dwelling Unit Program
Atherton has always had a second dwelling units program in conformity with state law. The residential unit may be occupied full-time upon issuance of a conditional use permit by theBlanhin^Gbmniission. This type of second unit must be located within fheLsame;- /; area as the main building. Many of these second dwelling units are rented to moderate and lower income households.
Atherton intends' to continue its second dwelling unit program and encourages construction of new, full-time occupied second units as a means of providing affordable housing in the community.
Goal: The goal of this program is to realize the construction of 10 new second dwelling units affordable to low income households within Atherton over the next 5 years.
HS-61
3.430
Faculty and Student Housing Program
Atherton supports and encourages the expansion and development of faculty and student housing on campuses within the Town. Private schools particularly have expressed the desire to build additional faculty and student housing units as a means of retaining qualified staff and providing affordable housing on campus for students. All of the faculty units and most of the student units would qualify as affordable.
As described in Section 3.232, Menlo School has indicated the need to construct an additional 11 faculty housing units and to replace 9 existing faculty housing units with new units on their campus. The result would be 20 new faculty units on the Menlo School Campus. As described in Section 3.231, Menlo College has indicated the need to construct an additional 16 faculty units (for a total of 35 units envisioned in the Campus Master Plan) on their campus. The College has also indicated a desire to construct certain student housing for juniors and seniors designated for independent living with separate entries, kitchens and living space. Approximately 58 units of this type of student housing is planned for construction in the near future. Both institutions have stated it is their objective to rent the faculty and independent living student housing to low and moderate-income households at rates affordable to these income levels. The Town intends to enter into agreements with the institutions that will implement the income and rental rate objectives for a term of at least 15 years. Such agreements would result from the Conditional Use Permit approval process. The Town will also assist the institutions’ efforts in providing affordable housing by facilitating permit approvals, facilitating loan and grant applications and expediting building permit processing.
Goal: The goal of this program is to realize the construction of 27 new faculty housing units, the rehabilitation or reconstruction of 28 faculty housing units and the construction of 58 new student housing units with kitchens, affordable to very low, low and moderate income households within Atherton over the next 5 years.

Evaluation of Existing Housing Programs
3.510	Market Rate Housing Construction
In 1991, when the current Atherton Housing Element was adopted, the objective was to facilitate the addition of thirty-one above moderate income (i.e. market rate) units to the housing stock during the 1988-1995 period. Building permit records show the net addition (new units minus demolitions) of fifty-three new, above market rate units to the Atherton housing stock during that period. Therefore, Atherton exceeded its objective by 171%. Dining the period of 1996-2000 above moderate income housing production continued with the net addition of twenty-one more market rate units.
3.520 Second Dwelling Unit Program
During the 1988-1995 period the objective was to facilitate the addition of twenty-three very low, low and moderate-income units to the Atherton housing stock. Conditional Use Permit and Building Department records show that ten new second dwelling units were approved and constructed. It is assumed that those units were rented at rates affordable to low and moderate income households. During the period of 1996-2000, additional second dwelling units were added to the Atherton housing stock.
3.530 Shared Housing Program
The Human Investment Project, San Mateo, California, is a non-profit organization that helps match people or households seeking affordable housing with owners of housing who are interested in renting or sharing space in their home. The organization has been successful in finding both providerssianid:renters willing to participate in the program in San Mateo County. Two such placements were made in the 1988-95 time period. Both placements were for low-income households. Additional placements were made in the period 1996-2001.

EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

The Atherton General Plan Committee had been holding public meetings with the Housing Element on the agenda since October 2001. In order to ensure a significant and inclusive public process, citizen committees, the public, and elected officials are being asked to review and consider the document and policy recommendations.
Copies of a summary of the draft will be circulated to and comments requested from local citizens, affordable housing advocates and other interested parties. The draft will be available upon request. The distribution list includes:
■	Atherton General Plan Committee (eight Atherton residents)
■	Mid-Peninsula Housing Coalition
■	Human Investment Partnership
■	Housing Leadership Council
■	Center for the Independence of the Disabled
■	Samaritan House
■	Peninsula Policy Partnership—Housing Action Team
■	C.A.L.L. Primrose Center
■	Shelter Network
■	C/CAG (City/County Association of Governments)
■	SAMCAR (San Mateo County Association of Realtors
In addition, the draft summary and public hearing information was disseminated in the following ways:
a An article was published in the Athertonian, a Town sponsored newsletter that is mailed to' every household in Atherton describing the Element and inviting residents to Planning Commission and City Council public hearings.
a Press Release- a press release went, to all localmcwspapers	........
a Letters of invitation to all housing-related institutions that the Town has worked with such as Shelter Network, Samaritan House, Human Investment Project, C.A.L.L. Primrose Center, SAMCEDA, Mid-Peninsula Housing Coalition, Center
for the Independence of the Disabled, and Housing Leadership Council, a Distributed to the Fire Department a Posting in City Hall
a Mailing to the Council a Mailing to the school district a Distributed to the Police Department
Additionally, comments from the citizen’s committees, the general public, and the State of California will be incorporated into the Housing Element and the Staff Report and Staff will present the Housing Element during a public hearing to the Planning Commission followed by a public hearing at the City Council.
HS-66
HOUSING ELEMENT GLOSSARY
Family
A family is a household with at least two people who are related, one of which must be the householder. The people can be related by birth, marriage, or adoption. By definition, a household containing related people can contain only one family for purposes of census tabulations.
The various family types are:
Married-Couple Family
A family in which the householder and his or her spouse are enumerated as members of the same household.
Other Family: Male Householder, No Wife Present A family with a male householder and no spouse of householder present.
Other Family: Female Householder, No Husband Present A family with a female householder, no spouse of householder present.
Group Quarters
All persons not living in households are considered by the Census Bureau to be living in group quarters. Persons in group quarters are either institutionalized (under custody or supervised care at the time of enumeration) or noninstitutionalized (where there are 10 or more unrelated persons living in one housing unit). Noninstitutional group quarters include rooming houses, group homes, school dormitories or off-campus boarding houses, military quarters, agricultural or non-ag. workers dormitories, and emergency shelters for homeless persons or runaway children.
Hispanic Origin (Spanish Origin)	*ssssss&^ st* * &
Persons of many races may report they are of Hispanic origin. For example, a Puerto Rican may report he is Black, a Mexican or Canadian native that he is American Indian, a Spaniard that he is White, and someone from the Philippines that he is Asian. At the same time, all of these people may also report they are Hispanic. Origin can mean ancestry, nationality group,' language groups lineage, or country of birth for the respondent or parents of the respondent.
Householder (HLDR.)
One person in each household is designated as householder. This is usually the person in whose name the home is owned, being bought, or rented. Where these conditions are not applicable, any adult in the household 15 years old and over could be designated as householder. A family householder is a householder living with one or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption. A nonfamily householder lives alone or with nonrelatives only.
HS-67
Households (HHLD.)
A household includes all persons who occupy a housing unit. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated persons who share living arrangements. The presence of relatives determines that it is a family household.
Housing Unit
A house, an apartment, a mobilehome or trailer, a group of room, or a single room that is occupied as a separate living quarters, or if vacant, is intended for occupancy as a separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to the intended occupants whenever possible.
Mean
This is the arithmetic average of a set of values derived by dividing the sum of a group (or aggregate) of items by the total number of items. Aggregates are used in computing mean values. Mean family income is obtained by dividing the aggregate of all income reported by persons in families by the total number of families.
Median
The middle value in a distribution, dividing the total frequency into two equal parts. The median is computed on the basis of the distribution as tabulated, which is sometimes more detailed than the distribution shown in Census products.
Persons Per Family
The number of persons obtained by dividing the number of family members by the total number of families (or family householders).
Persons Per Household
Persons per Household equals the total population minus .those persons living in group quarters divided by the number of occupied housing units.
Population
Includes all United States citizens and legally recognized U.S. resident non-citizens. Non-Citizens illegally residing in the U.S. are also included. U.S. citizens living outside the country but declaring a state to be'their legal residence are not included.

4.000 OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
4.100	INTRODUCTION
4.110	Purpose and Content
In order to eliminate duplication, the Open Space and Conservation Elements of the Atherton General Plan have been consolidated into a single document, a procedure authorized by Government Code Sections 65301 and 65302. Programs and policies outlined in this combined Element are to be coordinated with State and Regional open space and conservation policies.
4.120	Relation to Other Elements
In addition to being closely related to one another, open space and conservation relate closely to the Land Use and Circulation Elements. Decisions implemented under policies contained in those Elements could significantly impact upon open space and sensitive environmental features.
4.130	Open Space Land Uses
The State Government Code refers to four different categories of open space:
A.	Open space for the preservation of natural resources;
B.	Open space used for the managed production of resources;
C.	Open space for outdoor recreation;
D.	Open space for public health and safety.
4.200	OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
For the most part, open space lands in Atherton fall into categories (A) and (C). Much of the open space utilized for resource preservation is privately held, while Holbrook-Palmer Park is the most substantial publicly held open space used for recreational purposes. Lands which are characterized by cross slopes in excess of 30 percent can be classified into category (D) above.
4.210 Goal
To protect both publicly and privately held lands from deterioration of their rural charm, scenic value and environmental equilibrium.

Prevent developmental encroachment on open space and sensitive environmental resources.
Open Space and Conservation Policies
The following policies, in addition to those set forth under open space land use policies in the Land Use Element, are intended to help guide decision making in regard to open space and conservation impacts in Atherton.
The Town shall endeavor to protect scenic resources, significant stands of natural vegetation, wildlife habitat, public safety and significant archaeological resources, both publicly and privately held.
The Town seeks to preserve the open space characteristics of existing public and private schools, churches, the Circus Club, the California Water Service property and the public parks.
1
Holbrook Palmer Park shall serve as the Town’s primary outdoor recreational facility subject to the following conditions:
A.	The property shall not be used, occupied or operated for commercial or housing purposes except those which are strictly incidental and appropriate to its use as a public recreational park.
B.	The Park is to be used for the benefit of the citizens of Atherton.
C.	The Park may not be used for political purposes except those which involve the public affairs of the Town of Atherton as a whole.
D.	The Park may be rented for use by others in accordance with the standards established by the Parks and Recreation Commission.
In addition to Holbrook Palmer Park and the Reading Park, public elementary and high school properties are also available for recreational use.
ACTION PROGRAM
Trees shall be preserved wherever possible. This policy shall be explicitly considered during the subdivision process.

5.000 NOISE ELEMENT
5.100	INTRODUCTION
5.110	Purpose
The Noise Element seeks to describe the present and future noise environment of Atherton in an effort to prevent intrusion by harmful and annoying sound levels. Major noise sources are identified, the effects of noise on the community are discussed, and strategies for minimizing unwanted noise are outlined.
5.120	Relation to Other Elements
The Land Use, Circulation and Housing Elements are most closely related to the Noise Element. This is because vehicular traffic, which causes most noise, is largely determined by the land use and circulation pattern, and because people are most sensitive to noise levels which disturb their residential environment.
5.130	General Description
Noise is defined as “unwanted sound” and can be viewed as an adverse environmental impact. Its intensity depends on its effect on the listener. Noise levels are measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels, ranging from 0 to 180. Because the decibel scale is logarithmic, a small decibel change represents a large change in noise intensity; however, it usually takes a change of about 10 decibels before a doubling of loudness is perceived by the human ear. Table N-l illustrates a variety of commonly encountered noises as measured in decibels.
5.200	THE NOISE ENVIRONMENT IN ATHERTON
h	Community noise levels vary continuously; therefore all of the individual
noise readings must be averaged over a 24-hour period to give an equivalent level. This equivalent noise level, expressed as Ldn (Day-Night Average Level), has been estimated based on traffic counts and train schedules, as well as field measurements, using an electronic noise meter. The resulting noise contours and field measurements have been plotted on Table N-l to illustrate areas of significant noise exposure in the Town.
Table N-l illustrates that the major contributors to the noise environment in Atherton are transportation sources located in the eastern section of the Town. Lands surrounding El Camino Real and the Joint Powers Board Railroad right-of-way are the primary areas where noise levels reach the 60 to 70
N-73
decibel range. Flights from and to San Francisco International, San Carlos and Palo Alto Airports, and traffic on Interstate 280, contribute to community noise levels. Overall, however, no Atherton residents should be subject to prolonged, unacceptable noise levels. This is a critical factor in maintaining the Town’s desirability as a residential community.

In terms of future noise impacts, traffic increases along inter-regional roadways will be the largest contributor to heightened community noise levels. Increased traffic volume along El Camino Real may result in a widening of the 60 dB noise contour by approximately 75 feet by 2005. Although forecasts of freeway traffic volumes are not available, similar increases along Interstate 280 could widen its 60 dB contour by roughly 110 feet. Thus, it appears probable that a higher number of Atherton properties

5.300	RELATION OF NOISE ELEMENT TO STATE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE
Title 25 of the California Administrative Code requires that an acoustical analysis be prepared for new hotels, motels and multiple-family dwellings which are to be located where the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) is greater than 60 CNEL outdoors. Although Atherton contains no land uses of this nature, detailed acoustical analysis is sometimes required for residential uses in high impact areas. The acoustical report must discuss how the exterior noise levels can be controlled to 60 CNEL, and how the noise environment inside these structures can be controlled to not exceed 45 CNEL. The acoustical analysis is appropriately included as part of an Environmental Impact Report, or can be a separate report accompanying the building permit

application when no EIR is required.
INTERPRETATION OF THE LAND USE COMPATIBILITY CHART
Normally Acceptable
The range of noise levels in this category is compatible with the specified land use type. No special noise insulation is required in buildings of conventional construction.
Conditionally Acceptable
The range of noise levels in this category is higher than those normally acceptable for the specified land use type. A detailed acoustic study should be undertaken to set forth design features that will reduce exterior noise levels and/or for construction to control the amount of ’exterior noise reaching interior use spaces.
Normally Unacceptable
New construction or development of the specified land use type should be discouraged. If development is to proceed, a detailed acoustic study must be prepared and needed noise insulation features incorporated into the design.
Unacceptable
New development of the specified land use type should not be undertaken when the site falls within the range of noise levels in this category.
NOISE MITIGATION METHODS
In situations where the range of noise levels are higher than that considered normally acceptable for a specified land use type it may be possible to reduce the effective noise level to achieve better compatibility. Each site has its own characteristics and problems, thus mitigation measures which are effective for one project may not apply to another. For this reason, it is not appropriate to predetermine the method by which noise levels should be reduced or controlled throughout the community. Regardless of the mitigation measure or combination of measures which is used, it is almost always less costly to include the mitigation in the design phase rather than dealing with the problem later. At the present time, there is no need for systematic enforcement of noise mitigation techniques discussed below. If in the future the Town Council deems appropriate, a program for implementation of mitigation measures will be developed.
The measure or combinations of measures that can be used to mitigate noise
N-76
fall into four general categories:
A.
Site Planning
B.
Architectural Treatment
C.
Noise Barriers
D.
Construction Modification
510 Site Planning
By taking advantage of the natural shape and contour of sites it is often possible to orient buildings and other uses in a way that will reduce or eliminate noise impact. The ways in which site planning can be used to reduce noise impacts are as follows:
A.	Increase the distance between the noise source and the receiver.
B.	Place non-noise sensitive land uses (parking lots, maintenance facilities, utility areas) between the source and the receiver.
C.	Use non-noise sensitive structures (garages) to shield noise sensitive areas.
D.	Orient buildings so outdoor areas are shielded from noise.
520 Architectural Layout
By attention to the types of uses being accommodated in a structure, the noisesensitive uses can be moved to the quiet side of the building. Some typical examples are listed:
A.	Put bedrooms on the side of the house farthest from roadways.
B.	Do not locate outdoor balconies or patios facing major roadways.
C.	Design “U” shaped buildings to shield patios.
.530 Noise Barriers
Solid barriers between the noise source and the noise-sensitive area block out sound waves. The minimum acceptable surface weight for an effective noise barrier is four pounds per square foot (equivalent to 3/4 inch plywood) with no cracks or openings. To be effective, the barrier must interrupt the line of sight between the noise source and the receiver. Noise barriers are created by
N-77
topographical features in some situations. Earth berms can be created by grading to achieve the same result. It should be noted that short barriers are not effective regardless of height because sound waves will pass around the end of them and still reach the receiver. This effect, called flanking, can be minimized by bending the wall or barrier back from the noise source at the ends of the barrier.
5.540 Construction Modification
Indoor noise levels due to exterior noise sources can be controlled by the noise reduction characteristics of the building’s shell. In general, windows and doors are the weakest links in the acoustic skin of a building. The amount of insulation and sealing required depends on the amount of noise reduction required. The following approaches may be considered:
A.	Use solid core doors having an acoustic door gasket.
B.	Use double paned glass or gasketed window systems.
C.	Add insulation material to walls, ceilings and floors.
5.600	NOISE ELEMENT GOAL
To maintain the serene atmosphere of the Town by minimizing the intrusion of noise generating activities.
5.700 NOISE ELEMENT POLICIES
5.710 A survey of noise contours has been conducted in accordance with Section 65302(G) of the Government Code and accompanies this Element.
5.720 Information contained in the survey of noise contours shall be used as a tool for land use decision making. ‘
5.730 If complaints about noise increase in the future, procedures for dealing with complaints in the community will be established.
5.740 Minimum Contents of Acoustical Reports - Site specific reports should contain a brief description of the project and the sensitivity of the land use type to noise, an accurate map describing the setting with surrounding uses and noise sources identified, and a quantitative description of the noise environment. For multi-story structures, the report should discuss noise effects for the upper floors. Field noise sample measurements should be taken over several days and the average CNEL calculated should be based on daytime, evening and nighttime readings. If the project is located within the vicinity of a previously collected measurement, as shown on the contour map,
N-78
a measurement should also be duplicated at that point for purposes of updating the Community Noise Level Contour Map.
5.750 Qualifications for Preparing an Acoustical Report - Noise reports should be prepared by an acoustical engineer holding a degree in engineering, architecture, physics or allied discipline able to demonstrate a minimum of two years experience in the following areas of acoustics: transportation noise forecasting, building acoustics, field measurement of noise and noise mitigation.

6.000 COMMUNITY SAFETY ELEMENT
6.100
INTRODUCTION
6.110
Purpose
The Safety Element is intended to describe natural and man made disasters which may pose a hazard to the residents of Atherton. It sets forth policies for responding to threats to public safety.
6.120
Relation to Other Elements
The Safety Element is closely related to the Circulation, Land Use, Open Space and Conservation Elements.
6.130
General Description
The County of San Mateo, through its Area Disaster office, maintains an emergency plan for the County-wide area. The plan describes responsibilities for the coordinated response actions in the event of a disaster. Within that document are found specific plans for earthquake response, hazardous materials incident response, and multi-casualty incident response.
The Town of Atherton will continue to work closely with the Operational Area of the Governor's Office of Emergency Services to ensure up to date information and planning for disasters and other emergencies that might occur. The Town of Atherton will continue to maintain contact with other governmental agencies regarding the protection of residents of Atherton and the County of San Mateo to include nuclear, biological and chemical preparedness. This planning includes response to threats made to public
facilities, drinking water treatment facilities, and • other necessary-----------------
infrastructure.
Types of emergencies which could occur in Atherton include a major fire, earthquake, hazardous chemical spill or multi-casualty incidents. The likelihood of such an occurrence necessitates that the community prepare appropriate response procedures. Fire safety and hazardous chemical spills are primarily the responsibility of the Menlo Park Fire Protection District. Multi-casualty incidents involve all public safety agencies. Consequently, this element focuses on Seismic Hazards.
CS-81
6.200
SUMMARY OF SEISMIC HAZARDS IN ATHERTON PLANNING AREA
The primary seismic threat to the Town of Atherton is represented by the San Andreas fault and its attendant rift valley which lies approximately five miles to the west of the Town. This fault has a long history of earthquake activity. While there are no known active or potentially active faults within the Town of Atherton, it is subject to periodic, very strong earthquakes which originate either on the San Andreas or from the Hayward and Calaveras faults in the East Bay. Most geologists agree that an earthquake of comparable magnitude to that which occurred in 1906 may well be experienced by the current generation of Bay Area residents.
Seismic hazards associated with earthquakes include the following:
A.	.	Surface Faulting - which is usually limited to a narrow zone along the
fault which is undergoing rupture.
B.	Ground Shaking - which poses the most serious potential hazard to Atherton.
C.	Ground Failure - in which the ground no longer holds together as a result of strong earthquake shaking, causing damage to buildings and other structures.
D.	Seismically Induced Water Waves - which are caused by ground vibrations during an earthquake.
In the future the major source of earthquake damage is likely to come from the San Andreas Fault system, including the Hayward fault and the Calaveras fault branches in the East Bay area. The worst possible earthquake magnitude should not exceed the 1906 level of 8.3 on the Richter Scale, according to authorities. The principal effect of such an earthquake inmost ''ofmevTbwn! will be the sudden, unexpected initiation of a strong shaking motion of the ground, which will last approximately one minute. This ground shaking can be expected to be hazardous to people during the earthquake.
Evacuation Routes, Peak Load Water Supply Requirements and Fault Zones
Pursuant to the State Planning Guidelines, evacuation routes have been designated below. Also, State Planning Guidelines require the Safety Element to include a statement specifying the peak load water supply requirements for the Town. Peak load water supply requirements currently average just under five million gallons per day during the months of August and September. A map illustrating the proximity of the Town to major earthquake faults has been included in this element.

SAFETY ELEMENT POLICIES
The Town recognizes the potential danger to public safety that may result from natural or man made causes and seeks to minimize the public risks in such hazards.
The emergency evacuation routes established in this General Plan Element are El Camino Real, Middlefield Road, Marsh Road, Alameda de las Pulgas and Valparaiso Avenue.
Minimum road widths and clearances around structures shall be in accordance with generally recognized minimums consistent with fire protection.
Emergency service personnel shall maintain high levels of effort in areas of emergency preparedness training, action plan development and drills, education and new techniques for community response and prevention, and inter-agency cooperation for public safety.
The Town shall incorporate geotechnical hazard data such as the fault map contained in this document into future land use decision making, site design and construction standards.
Public education, research and information dissemination on seismic hazards and emergency response shall be encouraged.
The Town shall seek to improve inteijurisdictional cooperation with other agencies for geotechnical safety in land use planning, hazard prevention and emergency response.

PROJECTDESCRIPTION
The latest version of the Atherton Housing Element was adopted in 2010. This update is being completed in compliance with the California Planning and Zoning Law requiring the 2014-2022 Housing Element update.
The proposed Housing Element Update includes:
•	An update of population, employment, income, housing and household characteristics in Atherton, using the latest U.S. Census data available.
•	A current inventory of land suitable for residential development.
•	An analysis of governmental and non-governmental constraints to the provision of housing and recommendations for ways of removing those constraints.
•	An analysis of groups with special housing needs such as the elderly, disabled and large households.
•	Programs designed to facilitate the development of new housing in order to meet the assigned Regional Housing Needs Allocation approved by the Association of Bay Area Governments. Those programs include second dwelling units, faculty and student housing at private schools, and subdivision and development of new parcels of land with market-rate housing.
Specifically, the proposed programs described in the Housing Element are:
•	Market-rate Housing Construction- Private construction of market-rate single-family detached housing on existing or newly subdivided parcels within the Town. The program facilities the construction of new single-family residences consistent with the above moderate housing needs objectives established by the Town. Approximately 3 new units are anticipated to be developed during the 2014-2022 planning period.
•	Second Dwelling Unit Program - Currently second dwelling units, in addition to the main dwelling, are in the R-1A and R-1B zoning districts without a Conditional Use Permit. Second dwelling units may be attached or detached, may be up to 1,200 sq. ft. in size and may encroach into certain setbacks. Internal Living Quarters, separate living quarters in main dwellings but lacking full kitchen facilities, are also allowed in the R-1A and R-1B zoning districts without a Conditional Use Permit. A 2010 Zoning Ordinance amendment allows installation of full kitchen faclities in Internal Living Quarters, thereby making them Second Dwelling Units, it was found that almost ail Second Dwelling Units and Internal Living Quarters were affordable to extremely low to moderate income households according to a recent Atherton survey. Approximately 40 new Second Dwelling Units are anticipated to be developed during the 2014-2022 planning period.
•	Faculty and Student Housing at Private Schools- Approximately 11 new affordable residential units are proposed for faculty at Menlo School in the next planning period. Approximately 16 new affordable units are propsed for construction at Menlo College to be used for faculty and staff. Approximately 63 new affordable units are planned for construction for junior and senior student independent living at Menlo College in the next planning period.

proposed Housing Element The basic goals and policies of the Housing Element would not be changed from the currently adopted Element.
Potential environmental effects discussed in the initial study are based on the assumption that development in Atherton will proceed under the existing General Plan. Specific projects will require further environmental analysis, public review and hearings at such time as they are proposed for implementation.
SURROUNDING LAND USES AND SETTING
The project area includes the entire Town of Atherton, located approximately 35 miles south of San Francisco in rural and suburban portions of San Mateo County. The Town is bounded by the City of Redwood City and unincorporated areas of San Mateo County to the north and east, the City of Menlo Park to the south of the Town of Woodside and unincorporated areas of San Mateo County to the west. Atherton is situated between two major freeways: U.S. 101 and interstate 280. U.S. 101 and Interstate 280 are major north-south links between the cities of San Francisco and San Jose.
The land use is primarily low density residential with a number of public and private schools interspersed. Most privately owned land in Atherton is developed.
The topography of the Town is relatively flat east of Alamdea de las Pulgas and with moderate slopes and hillside areas west of Alameda de las Pulgas, The Atherton Channel traverses the Town, and geological constraints are not uncommon in the hillside areas. Although no active faults are recorded within the Town, the San Andreas Fault is located west of Interstate 280 in the Town of Woodside. Therefore, hazards associated with earthquakes can occur in Atherton.

b)
Less than Significant Impact- Increased housing can result in increased traffic and consequent impacts to air quality. The policies and programs contained in the Housing Element relate to the development of new single-family homes, second dwelling units and faculty and student housing that could increase the number of accessory living units within the Town. Since the Housing Element projects less than a 10% increase in the number of total dwelling units at scattered locations in Atherton resulting from complete implementation of the Plan, there does not appear to be a significant adverse impact to traffic or air quality.
a,c-e) No Impact - The proposed project wouid not alter air movement, moisture, or temperature, or cause a temperature change. It would not expose sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant concentrations. It would not create objectionable odors affecting a substantial number of people. There would be no increase in permitted square footage of development All Town streets operate below capacity as defined by the Highway Capacity Manual and are adequate to handle the increased traffic. No significant increase in traffic will result from the project.	8

BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES DESCRIPTION
a-f) No Impact - The buildings and access drives contemplated as part of the proposed project are
currently permitted by existing zoning. The proposed project would allow slightly larger buildings, it would not change the location where the buildings or access drives can be built. The identified sites suitable for residential development are all currently developed with buildings, structures, landscaping and pavement and, because of this, are highly unlikely to support any species indentlfied as a candidate, sensitive or special status species. Local policies and State and federal regulations prohibit development on or near riparian habitat and other sensitive natural communities. The identified sites suitable for residential development are not near any federally protected wetlands nor would they interfere with the movement of any native resident migratory fish or wildlife species.
There is no habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan existing in the project area. Any heritage tree in conflict with a new building or access drive would require Planning Commission approval and site specific analysis.

Therefore, no significant impacts to archaeological resources would be anticipated to occur upon implementation of the proposed project. There are no historical resources included in the identified sites suitable for residential development, The proposed project would not cause a physical change that would affect any known unique ethnic cultural values or restrict any existing religious or sacred uses within the project vicinity.

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
a)	No Impact - According to the Atherton General Plan, the Town does not lie within any Atquist Prtolo Special Study Zones, areas designated by the State as containing active faults. Therefore, the proposed project would not expose people to potential impacts involving surface rupture along known earthquake faults.
The Town is located in a seismically active region which has experienced many strong earthquakes. The westerly side of Town is approximately 0.5 miles and the easterly side of Town is approximately 5.0 miles east of the San Andreas fault. While there are no known active or potentially active faults within the Town of Atherton, it is subject to periodic, very strong earthquakes which originate either on the San Andreas or from the Hayward and Calaveras faults in the East Bay. The project site has the potential for seismic ground shaking and has experienced such hazards during the 1906 and 1989 earthquakes. The proposed new residences could be disrupted by strong seismic activity, however, this potential impact is avoided by design in accordance with the Uniform Building Code and Seismic Engineering Standards for the Bay Area Region.
The proposed project would neither result in nor expose people to potential impacts involving a seiche, tsunami, or volcanic hazard. USGS studies indicate that the Town has no susceptibility to seiches, tsunamis or volcanos.
Impacts from landslides or mudflows would not occur because the project is located on relatively flat land.
b)	Less than Significant Impact - The project has the potential for soil erosion and loss of topsoil. However, mitigation required by Town Ordinances including revegetation with native trees, shrubs and grasses will reduce the impact to less than significant.
c-d)	No Impact - The potential for subsidence, liquefaction or damage from expansive soils
would be mitigated through appropriate design in accordance with the accepted Engineering Standards.
e)	No Impact - Septic tank/drain field wastewater disposal is not used in Atherton.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS DESCRIPTION
a) Less than Significant Impact - The additional housing units proposed in the Housing Element Update will not generate significant greenhouse gas emissions either directly or indirectly. The number of addition housing units is small; less that 10% of the total existing housing units in the Town. Most of the new housing units will be attached Second Dwelling Units located within new or remodeled single family homes. The size of single family houses, including Second Dwelling Units, is limited by the zoning ordinance. Therefore greenhouse gas emissions that may be produced from the new housing units will be a very small part of any development activity that occurs in the Town.

"^HAZARDS“AND~HAZARCTOa^lVIATERlALS"DESrCRIPTION“~---------------------------------------	----“-------
No Impact - The proposed project would not utilize hazardous materials or generate hazardous waste. Construction activities would involve the standard use of fuels and lubricants for construction equipment, but would similarly not be expected to utilize hazardous materials or generate hazardous waste. Therefore, the proposed project would not be expected to pose any risk of accidental explosion or release of hazardous substances.
No Impact - None of the identified sites suitable for residential development are included on the list of hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5. Neither are any of the identified sites suitable for residential development located within territory covered by an airport land use plan nor within the vicinity of a private airstrip.
No Impact - The project would not interfere with any emergency response or evacuation plans.
Less than Significant Impact - For those identified sites suitable for residential development located west of Alameda de las Pulgas, and particularly along Walsh Road and its tributary streets, there is a potential for wild land fire. However, the condition is reduced to a less than significant impact because there are only 9 identified sites suitable for residential development in this vicinity and the residents and the Menlo Park Fire Protection District have developed an emergency response plan for this area in recognition of this potential.

HYDROLOGY AND WATER QUALITY
a-d,f-g) No Impact - Wastewater generated by the project would be collected and discharged into the municipal wastewater disposal system and would therefor not violate any water quality standards. It would not involve depletion of ground water supplies, would slightly alter the existing drainage pattern but would not contribute runoff which would exceed the capacity of the storm drainage system. There are no areas in Town that lie within the 100-year flood hazard area. The additional residences would not impede or redirect flood flows. The project area is not subject to inundation by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow and there are no nearby dams,
e) Less than Significant Impact - Atherton is located in the watershed of Atherton Greek (know locally as the Atherton Channel). The stream is intermittent and generally carries water only in the winter rainy period. Atherton Channel has been stabilized with riprap along various sections of the creek. Other sections remain natural. The Atherton Channel Drainage District is responsible for mainenance of the creek. Water quality in the Atherton Channel is potentially threated by common urban pollutants in storm water runoff. The proposed Housing Element programs would not alter the quality or quantity of the runoff. All future development is required to comply with NPDES requirements. The proposed project would not increase allowable building square footage, coverage or change setbacks, It is possible that the proposed project could encourage greater use of less than full-time occupied buildings and construction of new buildings. At the time of new construction the building would need to meet current drainage and runoff requirements. In addition, all new residential development is required to retain water during storm peaks resulting in runoff equal to the undeveloped condition during storm conditions. No significant water quality or storm water impacts are anticipated as a result of the proposed Housing Element. Water capacity issues will be reviewed individually and cumulatively for specific projects.

“	" NOISE DESCRIPTION	““'"“ ——	•	... ““““	....
a)	Less Than Significant Impact - Increased housing can result increased traffic and
consequent impacts to noise levels. The policies and programs contained in the Housing Element could increase the number of living units within the Town. Since the Housing Element projects less than a 10% increase in the number of total dwelling units in Atherton, there does not appear to be a significant adverse impact in relation to traffic or noise. Also, future projects would need to be consistent with the General Plan and Noise Ordinance noise standards and thresholds.
b-f)	No Impact - The policies and programs contained in the Housing Element Update would
not expose persons to or generate excessive ground borne vibration or noise levels. They would not increase the ambient noise level either permanently or temporarily. While there could be a slight increase in residential noise levels, additional noise is not the standard against which environmental effect must be measured. The standards relate to noise in excess of established standards, such as the Town’s Noise Ordinance or Noise Element of the General Plan, It is not expected that occupants of a second unit or internal living quarter would generate any more noise at any one time than the occupants of a main building. The noise generated by a single unit- usually including voices and residents’ cars - does not typically approach the levels prohibited by the Noise Ordinance or found unacceptable in the Noise Element. Noise levels in excess of the noise ordinance; for example, due to loud parties, would be illegal and likely to generate complaints. Temporary noise associated with new construction is currently regulated by the Atherton Noise Ordinance. The "Length of Contraction" Ordinance insures that construction occurs within a reasonable length of time. The Town is not located within an airport land use plan area nor is it in the vicinity of a private airstrip.

POPULATION AND HOUSING DESCRIPTION
a-c) Less than Significant Impact - The population of Atherton was approximately 7,194 in the year 2000, according to the 2000 U.S. Census. The effect of the proposed changes is not likely to substantially increase the number or size of living units in the City. Atherton population is projected by ABAG to increase by approximately 100 between the years of 2000 and 2010. ABAG states that there are approximately 2.9 people per household. The Housing Element contains projections that approximately 93 new housing units would be needed, if all of these units were constructed in Atherton the result would be less than a 10% increase in the number of total dwelling units in the Town. Therefore the project would not substantially affect population growth or exceed regional or local population projections.
A program in the Housing Element calls for rehabilitation or reconstruction of faculty housing at Menlo Schooi and Menlo College. Approximately 27 units are planned to be rehabilitated or reconstructed. All replacement units would continue to be located on campus. Residents would remain living in the existing units until new units were available. This is considered a less than significant impact
The proposed project involves in-fill housing where infrastructure and services are existing and available.

DESCRIPTION
a)	Less than Significant Impact- Proposed Housing Element programs will not significantly impact
Atherton traffic, parking or circulation. While each new dwelling unitwill generate additional traffic (7 -10 trips per day per dwelling unit), the new units would be scattered throughout the Town and would not significantly impact any particular area or neighborhood. However, specific projects will be reviewed for their cumulative impact on the Town's circulation system.
b-g) No Impact- The policies and programs contained in the Housing Element Update would not exceed the Level of Service (LOS) standard established by the County Congestion Management agency for designated roads or highways. The proposal would generate more traffic but it would be equally distributed throughout Town so the percentage on any one street would be minimal. Most intersections in Atherton operate at LOS "A" or “B” and the minimal traffic added by the proposal would not be expected to degrade the LOS at intersections to any significant degree. Most parking would occur on private property so there would not be much impact on the streets. They would not result in a change to air traffic patterns, They would- not increase hazards due to design features, nor result in inadequate emergency access or inadequate parking capacity.

----------MANDATORY'FINDINGS OF SIGNIFICANCE DESCRIPTION
a)	No Impact - The project would not degrade the quality of the environment. The project would not
substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species or cause such species to drop below self-sustaining levels. The project would not reduce the number or restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal. Historic or prehistoric resources are not present in the project vicinity.
b)	Less than Significant impact - The Housing Element policies and programs do not have
environmental impacts that are cumulatively significant. The Element includes methods of meeting state mandated housing numbers, but does not include or imply approval of any specific project, Town Staff will undertake individual and cumulative environmental analyses of specifc projects If they are initiated by the developer or property owner, The Element will assist Staff in such cumulative analyses by outling development possibilities and providing a preliminary general overview of potential development impacts to resources, services and transportation systems.
It is important to note that, the California Environmental Quality Act generally exempts in-fill development projects and certain affordable housing projects from environmental review.
