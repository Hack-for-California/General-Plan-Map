3 COMMUNITY CHARACTER ELEMENT
  The Community Character Element of the General Plan is best defined as the
  element that preserves and builds upon Truckee’s “sense of place” and unique   While it is principally this Ele-
  identity. A community’s character, or image, is shaped by both physical and    ment that addresses issues of
  intangible elements. It is the essence of a place and what one remembers long  community character, several
  after leaving. The image of a community is not static – it can and will change other General Plan Elements,
  as a community grows and matures. Truckee today is in a state of evolution     notably the Land Use, Circula-
  from a series of rural recreational neighborhoods, commercial centers and      tion, Conservation and Open
  industrial areas loosely grouped around an historic center, to a community of  Space, and Economic Develop-
  vibrant mixed-use centers, a thriving Downtown, and connected neighbor-        ment Elements, are also con-
  hoods each with their own unique qualities.                                    cerned with some of the impor-
                                                                                 tant aspects that contribute to
                                                                                 Truckee’s unique sense of place.
  This Community Character Element will influence the future physical form
  of the community by guiding the desired quality and character of future de-
  velopment, and by protecting the important aspects of the natural and built
  environment that define the image and the spirit of Truckee. It also expresses
  a vision for the future in which the critical components that uphold
  Truckee’s community character – the built and natural environment, the so-
  cial fabric of the community, and the local economy – are held in balance
  with each other in a way that is complementary and mutually reinforcing.
  In many ways the Vision for Truckee is at its heart a statement about com-
  munity character, defining the things that make Truckee the place that it is,
  and the community it wants to be in the future. Preserving the Town’s his-
  toric and scenic assets, safeguarding open space and the natural environment,
  providing physical and social connections within the town, and facilitating a
  strong and diverse economy, are all components of the Vision Statement and
  aspects of community character with which this Element is concerned. While
  many of these topics are also addressed elsewhere in the General Plan, the
  Community Character Element takes a somewhat different approach by
  looking at each topic through a place-based framework that focuses on the
  building blocks of the community: neighborhoods, centers, districts, corri-
  dors, and gateways.
                                                                             3-1

The Community Character Element is an optional element that is not re-
quired by State law for inclusion in a General Plan. However, Truckee has
chosen to include a Community Character Element in the General Plan in
recognition of the importance of preserving Truckee’s small, mountain town
character, and the need to address the wide range of aspects contributing to
local character in a more unified and coherent manner than would be possible
if these topics were scattered throughout the General Plan. The Element also
addresses a number of topics that are required by State law, including preser-
vation of historic and cultural resources, and the important visual and scenic
assets of the community.
This Element addresses five major issues: landscape, open space and scenic
resources; town design; historic and cultural resources; social issues and com-
munity building; and arts and culture. Background conditions for each of
these aspects is first described, followed by a series of goals, policies and ac-
tions, included in Section E, that are relevant to these various topics at hand.
Guiding Principles for the entire Element are provided on the facing page.
A. Landscape, Natural Environment and Scenic Resources
Truckee’s unique natural environment defines many of the most important
aspects of the town’s community character. The mountain landscape domi-
nates the built environment in Truckee. Scenic views of surrounding moun-
tain peaks and ridgelines, and sweeping vistas of the forested hillsides, mead-
ows, and the river valley in which the town lies, provide an environment of
uncommon beauty and a powerful connection to the natural world for
Truckee’s residents.
The natural environment is also, in many respects, Truckee’s “reason for be-
ing.” First as a historic town center that evolved as a naturally-defined stop-
ping point along trans-Sierra transportation routes, and later in the

                                   town’s spectacular mountain environment, the landscape continues to define
                                   Truckee’s identity and its economic fortunes.
                                   Natural Setting and Landscape
                                   Truckee’s landscape can be conceptualized as a series of distinct terrain areas,
                                   defined both by topography and vegetation. They include the high mountain
                                   peaks and ridges of the Sierra Nevada and Carson Range that lie outside the
                                   Town limits but are visible from many places within Truckee; the forested
                                   uplands lying within and bordering the Town; meadowlands; and the valleys
                                   of the Truckee River and Martis Creek watersheds. Truckee's topography
                                   and landscape are illustrated in Figure CC-1.
                                   The mountains surrounding Truckee are a dominant landscape element in
                                   both scale and mass, dwarfing the town’s built environment. Distinct ridge-
                                   lines create a sharp contrast with the sky, draw the eye and reinforce the sense
                                   of the town nestled in the Truckee River Basin, a refuge from the high, rug-
                                   ged mountain environment. The region’s mountains and ridgelines are high
                                   in scenic quality and visual interest, thickly forested at lower elevations and
                                   rocky and often snow-capped at their peaks.
                                   Forested upland areas within the Town limits provide definition to the
                                   town’s form, and a transition to the more gentle landscapes of the Truckee
                                   River Valley and meadowland areas. Forested uplands are primarily concen-
                                   trated in the north and west portions of the town, and include Alder Hill and
                                   upland areas south of Prosser Lake, Tahoe Donner’s uplands, the steep slopes
Natural features and topography    north of the Interstate 80 (I-80) corridor, and, on a more modest scale, McIver

                                   open meadows or treed lowlands, consisting of rolling terrain, scattered trees
                                   and denser stands, and a generally more expansive visual character.

The orientation and alignment of the Truckee River valley defines a natural
corridor that provides a unifying visual and physical element of the town
landscape along its axis. It delimits the linear form of the historic downtown
and the alignment of the railroad and the interstate as they pass through
Truckee, as well as the steep escarpment that lies along the River’s edge for
much of its eastern reaches within Truckee.
Truckee’s other riparian corridors are also important landscape components
within Truckee. Waterways such as Donner Creek, Trout Creek, and Alder
Creek thread their way throughout the Town, providing naturally defined                The alignment of the Truckee

Open Space
Open space is an integral component of Truckee’s landscape and its commu-
nity character. For the Truckee community, open space provides a critical
visual, physical and spiritual connection to the natural environment. Open

spaces allow the town’s stunning mountain scenery to be experienced both
through scenic vistas as well as through outdoor recreation opportunities of
all sorts. Open space also provides habitat for a rich diversity of plant and
animal species, and is a critical aspect of the local and regional economy.
Issues of open space preservation in the Town of Truckee are addressed in the
Conservation and Open Space Element, which defines, describes and maps a
variety of types of open space in Truckee, and presents a wide-ranging series
of goals, policies and actions to preserve, enhance, and connect the town’s
important open space areas.
Scenic Resources
Figure CC-1 illustrates significant scenic resources in Truckee, including sce-
nic vistas and open space areas, prominent slope exposures, ridge and bluff
lines, and designated scenic corridors. Each of these are defining features of
the town, and a valued community assets, contributing strongly to Truckee’s
sense of place and its community character.
While the General Plan seeks to preserve the town's visual resources, it also
recognizes that Truckee's scenic landscapes will not remain static. All devel-
opment with the potential to affect scenic resources must be reviewed in the
context of current conditions, and in light of the particular qualities of scenic
resources as they evolve over time.
Scenic Views and Vistas
Truckee has exceptionally varied topography, ranging from a low elevation of
approximately 5,540 feet near Boca to an elevation of near 7,500 feet in Tahoe
Donner. The valley, hillsides and ridgelines that comprise the town's diverse
landscape provide a rich array of scenic resources, and afford numerous van-
tage points from which scenic vistas can be gained.
Views of peaks and high mountain ridges can be experienced from numerous
locations within the Town, but most obviously, when looking to the east
from central Truckee, and to the east and southeast from upland neighbor-

hoods like Tahoe Donner. Some of Truckee’s most sweeping open space vis-
tas occur from north of the Truckee River looking south towards the Martis
Valley. Roadways connecting into Downtown Truckee provide a different
sort of scenic vista, that of the townscape of the historic center within the
natural setting of the river valley and the forested hills that flank it. The new
Highway 267 bridge has introduced a new, human-made landscape element to
views of Truckee and provides a previously unavailable perspective on the
Town to drivers crossing the bridge, 90 feet above the valley floor.
Donner Lake, its shoreline, and views across Donner Lake’s open waters to
forested Schallenberger Ridge to the south; Donner Ridge to the north; and
the Sierra crest to the west, constitute an additional key scenic resource for
the Town, as do views and landscapes associated with the Truckee River and
the numerous creeks and drainages that flow through the town.
Scenic Corridors
This General Plan identifies two designated scenic corridors in Truckee, one
that encompasses the length of Interstate 80 where it passes through the
Town limits, and the other a portion of Highway 89 North. The scenic cor-
ridor designation recognizes the high scenic value of the landscape along these
thoroughfares, and the need to actively protect the corridors from the en-
croachment of visually incompatible development and advertising signage
that could impair the scenic quality within the roadway’s viewshed. Scenic

to the many millions of motorists that travel the highway annually.

                                  B. Town Design
                                  Town design focuses on the visual and functional relationships of the places,
                                  buildings and structures that define the built environment. It considers the
                                  relationships between people and places, circulation and connections, and the
                                  physical form of the town.
                                  Understanding community character in Truckee comes, to some extent,
                                  through an understanding of the composite parts of Truckee’s built environ-
                                  ment, the “building blocks” of centers, neighborhoods, districts, corridors and
                                  gateways that, in addition to the open spaces described previously, comprise
                                  the fabric of the town. To provide a framework for discussing issues of
                                  community character as it relates to the form of the built environment, this

Element looks at Truckee in terms of a series of discrete places and commu-
nity areas, categorized by type. These types include:
  ♦ Centers, the commercial and mixed use areas of the Town that serve as
     the focus for community life and commercial activity.
  ♦ Residential Neighborhoods, which constitute the majority of Truckee’s
     developed areas.
  ♦ Employment Districts, which include the relatively few places in
     Truckee where job-generating uses dominate.
  ♦ Corridors and Gateways, the linear features of the town that provide
     both connectivity and identity to the community at its entry points.
Truckee’s centers, residential neighborhoods and employment districts are
mapped in Figure CC-2, and corridors and gateways are mapped in Figure
CC-3.
Goals, policies and actions for each community area are included in Section
E, below. They describe the critical land use, transportation and town design
direction that can achieve the desired outcomes expressed in the Vision for
Truckee: retention of Truckee’s unique mountain community feel, its quality
environment and community livability, and a vibrant and sustainable local
economy.
Building community character in Truckee entails strengthening both the
Town’s centers and each of its neighborhoods; preserving open space and
rural character where it is important to do so; defining an edge or interface
between the Town and the mountain environment beyond; and, importantly,
enhancing connections and connectivity within and between the various parts
of the community.
Centers
Centers are the focal points of the community, and are locations that provide
points of convergence and social interaction. A center acts as a nucleus

clude centers of a variety of sizes and types, ranging from the largest, the
Town center, comprising Downtown and the Gateway Area, to the smallest,
which are neighborhood nodes or focal points centered on basic community
amenities. The discussion addresses not only the centers that are in place to-
day, but also new centers and nodes that could further enhance neighborhood
and community character.
Downtown
Truckee’s Downtown is the historic and commercial heart of the community.
With a linear form defined by the Truckee River and the Railroad, the Down-
town, whose boundaries are depicted in the Land Use Map in the Land Use
Element, is bounded roughly by West River Street and the railroad to the
south, Interstate 80 to the north, the Railyard to the east and Highway 89
South to the west.
The Downtown core contains a mix of commercial and residential uses, many
of which are housed in a series of well-preserved historic buildings, and some
civic uses located prominently throughout the area. Visitors and residents
continue to be attracted to Downtown for many reasons: window-shopping,
one-of-a-kind restaurants and stores, the architecture, historic character, and
most importantly, the people. The small-scale, narrow streets and modified
grid pattern of the Downtown, featuring a diversity of architecture and
streetscape features, combine to create an inviting, well-connected pedestrian
environment.
A key element within the Downtown, and perhaps the place most closely
identified with the town center, is Commercial Row, the single-sided stretch
of Donner Pass Road facing the railway station. With a compact assembly of
historic storefront buildings built to the edge of the public right-of-way, wide

feature of the area. Despite its centrality to the character and identity of the
Downtown, the river is separated from Commercial Row by the railroad
tracks. Development along West River Street and Riverside Drive limits ac-
cess to the river and detracts from the natural character of this important en-
vironmental asset within the Downtown.
The Downtown Specific Plan, adopted in 1997, identifies a wide-ranging se-
ries of goals and policies for the Downtown. These include redevelopment of
several key sites within the Downtown, most notably the redevelopment of
the Railyard site at the east end of the town center as a new mixed use district,
and revitalization and improvements along the West River Street corridor.
Gateway Area Town Center

residential areas, strung out along the length of Donner Pass Road between

the Cold Stream Road/Interstate 80 interchange and the Central Truckee
Interstate 80 interchange. Businesses in the Gateway Area primarily cater to
the daily shopping needs of Truckee’s local residents, and include a large gro-
cery and drug-store complex, hardware store, and a variety of smaller busi-
nesses in a number of strip mall developments. The local-serving orientation
of the corridor is reinforced by the location of many community-serving uses
and public facilities, including the high school, one of Truckee’s elementary
schools, the Tahoe Forest Hospital, Truckee Donner PUD, fire station, and
the Department of Motor Vehicles.
The character of development in the Gateway Area today stands in contrast
to that of the Downtown. Commercial development along Donner Pass
Road in the Gateway Area evolved through the 1970s and 1980s into a near-
continuous strip of mostly auto-oriented development. The character of the
development along this critical entry to Truckee from the west is, for the
most part, indistinguishable from similar commercial strips found along the
major arterials of many other U.S. towns and cities. Driving into Truckee
through the Gateway Area, there is little sense of having arrived at someplace
special or unique, and little that speaks to a sense of the town’s essential char-
acter or qualities.
Most of the Gateway Area’s retail developments are set back from the road-
way, fronted by large parking areas, and were developed as standalone com-
mercial developments with little attention paid either to the pedestrian envi-
ronment, or to providing connections to each other. Although the numerous
shopping opportunities in the Gateway Area are within a half-mile walking
radius of several residential areas, and there are sidewalks and transit access
along Donner Pass Road, few people walk between the shopping centers.
Pedestrian crossing of Donner Pass Road and other arterials is difficult due to
the width of the roadway, infrequent crosswalks and heavy traffic.
The Gateway Area today presents a tremendous opportunity for improve-
ment and enhancement of its town-oriented character. The area possesses
many assets: a central Truckee location and proximity to Downtown; a thriv-

ing base of local-serving businesses, public, and civic uses; nearby residential
neighborhoods; and connectedness via road and transit. Careful planning and
development decisions can build upon these assets and redirect the character
of this auto-oriented corridor into a cohesive town center for Truckee and a
place that reinforces a positive image of the community.
Other Mixed Use Centers
Mixed use centers are defined as areas that include a mixture of residential,
retail and office development. In terms of town design, mixed use centers
have come to be recognized as one of the key components of traditional de-
velopment that makes it vibrant and successful. They not only provide a
human presence and support for commercial areas and businesses, but also
provide opportunities for people to live in proximity to where they work and
shop, reducing dependence on the automobile.
At present, the Downtown and Gateway Area are the only two mixed use
centers in Truckee, containing a broad range of commercial and residential
uses within them. However, this General Plan recognizes the importance and
value of developing new mixed use centers in Truckee. As described in the
Land Use Element, three new mixed use centers will be developed in
Truckee, in Planned Community 1 (PC-1), Planned Community 3 (PC-3),
and as part of the Gray’s Crossing Planned Development. PC-1 will likely
include a mixture of residential, commercial (retail and office) and lodging
uses, and PC-3 will provide both a major new grocery store and new light
industrial space for Truckee, as well as clustered apartments and employee
housing. Gray’s Crossing is to include a mixed use “Village Center” that will
provide attached dwelling units as well as retail and office space.
Truckee’s other existing major commercial center, which is focused around
the Crossroads Plaza and includes the nearby commercial uses at the east end
of Deerfield Drive and along Highway 89 South, currently provides a combi-
nation of local shopping and services, as well as some highway-oriented com-
mercial development such as fast food restaurants, a gas station and a motel.
Currently, residential development around this center is relatively limited.
                                                                                3-17

C O M M U N I T Y C H A R A C T E R E L E M E N T
Even though the Crossroads Plaza is the closest grocery shopping area for
people living at the west end of West River Street, including the Donner
Creek Mobile Home Park, pedestrian access along Highway 89 South to the
shopping center is impeded by the dangerously narrow Mousehole railroad
undercrossing. This shopping center could become a mixed use center in the
future, and goals, policies and actions in this Element support that change.
Neighborhood Centers
Neighborhood centers are small local-serving centers, typically providing be-
tween 4,000 to 6,000 square feet of commercial space, although are sometimes
larger when they also serve a broader customer base from drive-by trade.
Uses primarily consist of a mix of convenience-oriented retail, small-business
offices and residential uses. Typically located at a key intersection or along a
major roadway within a residential area, neighborhood centers provide close
and convenient access to the goods and services needed on a daily basis by
local residents.
There are four primary neighborhood centers in Truckee:
  ♦ Donner Pines Center, a 4,200-square foot commercial center located at
     the intersection of Donner Pass Road and Moraine Road.
  ♦ Glenshire Neighborhood Center, a 4,200-square foot neighborhood
     center housed in three clustered buildings at the intersection of Glenshire
     Drive and Dorchester Drive.
  ♦ Northwoods Town Center. This 6,500-square foot center is located
     along Northwood Boulevard in Tahoe Donner, and primarily serves Ta-
     hoe Donner residents, as well as visitors to the Tahoe Donner golf course
     and ski area.
  ♦ Martis Village Center. The 18,000-square foot Martis Village center is
     located along Brockway Road at the intersection of Palisades Drive. Its
     strategic location along this busy corridor means that it serves as both a
     neighborhood center for the residential neighborhoods south of the
     Downtown, and also captures substantial trade from drive-by traffic on
     Brockway Road.

While densities in some neighborhoods may not provide a sufficient customer
base to support a commercial center, all neighborhoods would benefit from
the addition or strengthening of a center or focal point. Such a focal point
could encompass a variety of amenities, from a small neighborhood park, to
elements as simple as a newspaper stand or community bulletin board, com-
bined with some strategically located benches and a water fountain. A small
node like this would be appropriate for many neighborhoods in Truckee,
providing a place to stop and rest on a neighborhood stroll or dog walk, and
an opportunity for social interaction among neighbors.
This Community Character Element includes goals, polices and actions to
work to establish additional neighborhood centers, whether with retail out-
lets or in the form of parks or community facilities.
Residential Neighborhoods
Truckee’s residential neighborhoods comprise the greater part of the devel-
oped areas within the Town limits. This Community Character Element
establishes goals, policies and actions that provide guidance on elements of
town design associated with the various types of residential neighborhoods in
Truckee.
Broadly speaking, Truckee’s neighborhoods beyond the Downtown and
Gateway Town Centers, which are described in the previous section, can be
categorized into one of two types: town residential and rural residential.
Truckee’s neighborhoods are mapped in Figure CC-2.
Town Residential Neighborhoods
Truckee's town residential neighborhoods comprise most of those built in the
1960s and 1970s, including Sierra Meadows and Ponderosa Palisades, Tahoe
Donner, much of Glenshire/Devonshire, and Olympic Heights. In general,
these neighborhoods consist mostly of single family homes, with some du-
plexes and triplexes, and a few larger multi-family developments. These
neighborhoods are typically built at medium densities, with winding streets
and cul-de-sacs. Development is visible and obvious along roadways; homes
                                                                               3-19

C O M M U N I T Y C H A R A C T E R E L E M E N T
are built fronting the street and in relatively close proximity to one another.
While, like all Truckee neighborhoods, trees and open space are scattered
through the neighborhood, nature is secondary in prominence to the devel-
opment that is all around. Open space is found in the form of neighborhood
parks and greenways, and in the landscaping associated with individual prop-
erties.
Rural Residential Neighborhoods
Rural residential neighborhoods encompass other neighborhoods in Truckee
where the natural environment dominates the built environment. Homes are
set “in the trees,” and adjacent stretches of open space and large lots provide a
balance between the built environment and the landscape.
Roadways within rural residential neighborhoods typically lack sidewalks,
and with the exception of the connectors that serve them, are narrow, wind-
ing lanes and rural roads. Houses are frequently situated forward on their
lots, although with substantial setbacks from the roadway. In the most rural
context, such as in the very dispersed development areas on the outskirts of
Glenshire/Devonshire, and south of Prosser Lake, homes will be screened by
trees and vegetation to such an extent as to become almost invisible in the
wider landscape.
Rural residential neighborhoods in Truckee include some of the residential
development areas on the outskirts of Glenshire/Devonshire, such as the
Meadows neighborhood, some of the Prosser neighborhoods, the Armstrong
Tract, some of the Gray's Crossing neighborhoods, and much of the area sur-
rounding Donner Lake, as well as the new development in the Old Green-
wood planned community.
Employment Districts
Employment districts in Truckee encompass the relatively few places where
non-retail job-generating uses, such as light industrial, office, warehousing and
other commercial activity, are concentrated. They include the Pioneer Com-
merce Center and adjacent industrially-designated land, as well as the com-
3-20

mercial and light industrial zone located near the Truckee-Tahoe Airport.
Figure CC-2 maps the town’s employment districts.
The Pioneer Commerce Center project was originally intended to provide a
new area for industrial and service commercial type uses, but has evolved into
a site with a mixture of professional offices and service commercial businesses,
a satellite campus site for Sierra College, and more general commercial uses,
including a fitness center. Development of land uses and the circulation net-
work described in this General Plan, including construction of the Pioneer
Trail and Bridge Street Extension, expansion of light industrial development,
new residential development north of Coachland Mobile Home Park and in
Gray’s Crossing, and the opening of the new Alder Creek Middle School, are
likely to bring changes to the character of the Pioneer Commerce Center
area, which currently sits in relative isolation.
The airport commercial and light industrial areas consists of a number of of-
fice, distribution, retail and professional office buildings, located just east of
Highway 267 near the Placer County line. Truckee’s Town Hall is housed
within this area, sharing an office building with several corporate tenants.
Development in this area is predominantly auto-oriented, reflecting a variety
of architectural styles. Buildings constructed in the last several years reflect
the higher design standards demanded by the Town’s recently adopted De-
velopment Code, whereas older development tends to reflect the more typical
style of office and warehouse buildings found in many cities in the U.S., with
limited detail, blocky facades and prominent parking lots.
Corridors and Gateways
Corridors are linear features, located along major thoroughfares, which con-
nect various parts of the community. Although Truckee has many corridors
associated with its roadway network, this Element focuses on a more limited
number of corridors where it is felt to be most critical to define visual charac-
ter and quality, particularly in light of changes that may occur in conjunction
with development allowed under this General Plan. The corridors and gate-
ways discussed in this section are mapped in Figure CC-3.

Gateways are a particular type of corridor feature, with special status due to
their important role in conveying first impressions to visitors and a sense of
arrival or transition from one place to another. Gateways can also be a point
of orientation for the town, providing information to motorists by directing
them to areas of interest and by providing insights into the historical, cultural
and economic foundations of the area. It should be noted that some of
Truckee’s gateways are located along the key corridors discussed in the fol-
lowing section, and in those cases, are addressed under the discussion of the
corridor in question.
Corridors
This section describes a number of key corridors in Truckee, including the
                                                                                       Scenic and open space corridors
Brockway Road Corridor, West River Street Corridor, and Donner Pass
                                                                                       are discussed earlier in this Ele-
Road Corridor in the Donner Lake area. Other important corridors in
                                                                                       ment; the Gateway corridor is

ment. Natural and linear open space corridors such as that associated with
the Truckee River and other waterways, are also discussed briefly in this
Element, and in greater detail in the Conservation and Open Space Element.
  ♦ Brockway Road Corridor. This corridor extends from the Truckee
     River to the new intersection with Highway 267 at the PC-3 develop-
     ment site. A variety of open space areas interspersed with residential and
     commercial developments can be found along the length of the corridor,
     contributing to a varied, mixed use character. Open space areas along
     Brockway Road include the Ponderosa Golf Course, Truckee River Re-
     gional Park, and some meadowland areas. Existing residential and com-
     mercial development varies in the degree to which it is visible, as well as
     in the quality of its architecture.
     There are presently no sidewalks along Brockway Road, but a multi-use
     trail is planned along the northeast side of the corridor to connect the de-
     velopment along the road with the Truckee River Regional Park, sur-
     rounding neighborhoods and the Downtown, as well as PC-3 and the
                                                                                  3-23

     Airport area. Overhead power lines are visible along most of the corri-
     dor’s length.
     This General Plan allows for a significant amount of development along
     Brockway Road, in recognition of its status as a key town arterial, and its
     proximity to the Downtown and Highway 267. However, the most sig-
     nificant change along this corridor is likely to occur in conjunction with
     the development of PC-3, as described in the Land Use Element. The de-
     velopment site is situated at the key intersection of Highway 267 with
     Brockway Road, and will provide a significant presence at the intersec-
     tion and the south end of Brockway Road, which serves as a key gateway
     to Truckee from the south. The identification of an appropriate visual
     character for development at PC3, in keeping with the desired character
     of the corridor as a whole, is thus a critical concern of the goals, policies
     and actions within this Element.
  ♦ West River Street Corridor. This key town corridor connects the
     Downtown from Brockway Road to Highway 89 South, along the
     alignment of the Truckee River. Land uses on West River Street are var-
     ied, and include residential, including a mobile home park, office, com-
     mercial, mixed use, industrial and automotive repair businesses.
     This General Plan and the Downtown Specific Plan include direction to
     implement a comprehensive revitalization strategy for the entire Down-
     town Truckee Riverfront, which encompasses the length of West River
     Street. The revitalization strategy, which the Town adopted in 2005, ad-
     dresses a wide range of improvements along the corridor. These include
     the relocation of existing industrial uses, extension of commercial devel-
     opment and medium and high density housing along the length of corri-
     dor, new public open spaces, and, significantly, opportunities to improve
     both physical and visual connections to the River.
  ♦ Donner Lake Corridor. Donner Pass Road in the Donner Lake area fol-
     lows the alignment of old Highway 40, connecting the Gateway Area and
     Downtown Truckee to Donner Summit. The corridor provides access to
     Donner Memorial State Park, a variety of public and private beaches, and

     boat launch areas popular for fishing and summer recreation. Lakeside
     neighborhoods have been evolving from an area of modest cabins and
     cottages to one of larger second homes, permanent residences and a vari-
     ety of commercial establishments. This corridor is unique in Truckee
     with its open and expansive views across Donner Lake to mountain
     ridges beyond.
Gateways
While a gateway can be defined as any major entry or access point to the
community, this Community Character Element deals with a more limited
number of gateways that are of strategic importance to the town. Other,
more informally-defined gateways include the points of entry to Truckee
along the Interstate and by means of its access ramps, as well as the State
highway corridors that provide entries to Truckee from the region. In many
cases, these gateways are signified by the transition from the rural mountain
surrounds of the previously-traversed landscape to the more developed envi-
rons within the Town limits. On a more localized scale, the north and south
entrances to the historic Downtown are defined by an abrupt shift in the to-
pography, and character and scale of buildings, creating a strong sense of arri-
val into Truckee’s historic center.
Important gateways in Truckee are:
  ♦ Highway 89 North/Donner Pass Road Gateway. This gateway delim-
     its the entry into central Truckee from Interstate 80 and Highway 89 to
     the north, and from Glenshire to the east, traveling along Donner Pass
     Road. An important feature of this gateway is the perspective upon the
     Downtown that is gained as one travels downward into the river valley.
     With development of the Railyard site, this gateway will increase in
     prominence and importance since it will delimit the east end of Truckee’s
     Downtown main street as it connects through the new Railyard
     neighborhood to Commercial Row.
  ♦ Highway 267 South Gateway. As described above, the Brockway
     Road/Highway 267 intersection is the most significant gateway to
     Truckee from the south. The development of PC-3 will help to define
                                                                                3-25

     the quality and character of this gateway to create a distinct and positive
     sense of arrival in Truckee along this important route.
  ♦ West River Street Gateway. This gateway marks the entry into Down-
     town from the south, paralleling the alignment of the Truckee River and
     railway. As noted in the discussion of the West River Street corridor, ef-
     forts to upgrade the visual character of this corridor have been initiated,
     which will provide an opportunity to enhance its role as a gateway.
  ♦ Highway 89 South Gateway. Passage through the Mousehole railroad
     undercrossing on Highway 89 South provides a distinctive entrance from
     Placer County into Truckee. Desired safety improvements at the Mouse-
     hole will allow for the character of this gateway to be enhanced. Addi-
     tionally, if the proposed Sierra College campus at McIver Hill is devel-
     oped, its primary entrance will be from Highway 89 South. Allowing for
     this access while preserving the scenic qualities of the McIver Hill area
     will provide additional challenges and opportunities within this gateway.
  ♦ Western Donner Pass Road Gateway. The westernmost Donner Pass
     Road exit from Interstate 80 serves as the gateway into Truckee from the
     west, providing access to Donner Lake and Donner Memorial State Park
     to the west, and to the Gateway Area to the east. It also provides a gate-
     way to the major highway commercial area of the town. Opportunities
     to better define this gateway will be presented with development of PC-1,
     and with implementation of streetscape improvements along Donner
     Pass Road, as well as with improvements to Cold Stream Road.
C. Cultural Resources
Historic Resources
As a community, Truckee is rich in historic resources. Primarily focused in
the Downtown, Truckee’s historic buildings and sites reflect the town’s dy-
namic past, and its critical role in the history of California and the west. A
wide range of residential, commercial, civic and industrial buildings, most
dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries are found in Truckee, rep-

resenting a diversity of architectural styles. The Donner Memorial State
Park, east of Donner Lake, is dedicated to preserving the history of the Over-
land Emigrant Trail and the Donner Party tragedy, a key and symbolic chap-
ter in the history of the West’s early settlement.
A historic resource inventory for Downtown Truckee was completed by Ne-
vada County in 1981, and updated by the Town in 2002. The inventory iden-
tifies numerous structures of historic significance in Truckee, comprising one
of the highest concentrations of any community in the state. Based on the
results of the inventory, which contributed to the identification of a series of
nine historic “character areas” in the Downtown, the Town adopted a com-
prehensive Historic Preservation Program in 2003. The Historic Preservation
Program includes a comprehensive series of standards and guidelines concern-
ing preservation and demolition of historic structures, design guidelines for
rehabilitation and new construction, and guidance in the application of his-
toric preservation standards. In 2004, this far-reaching effort by the Town
was recognized with a Governor’s Award from the State Office of Historic
Preservation, which cited the Town’s creative and multi-faceted approach to
historic preservation as a model for other California communities.
Archaeological and Paleontological Resources
Documentation of the presence of historic and prehistoric archaeological re-
sources in Truckee is relatively limited, and much of the Town’s area remains
unsurveyed. In 1996, it was estimated that only between eight and twenty
percent of the Town had been inventoried for cultural resources, as records
associated with these surveys indicate more than 100 historic, prehistoric and
historic-prehistoric sites within the Town limits.1 Historic and prehistoric
archaeological sites scattered throughout Truckee include elements as diverse
as Native American artifacts and sites from the Martis and other cultures,
19th century charcoal production sites, Chinese work camps, and linear sec-
tions of the Overland Emigrant Trail and the Transcontinental Railroad.

Although a number of archaeological sites are known in Truckee, their spe-
cific locations are generally kept confidential in order to avoid disturbance.
The Central Information Center in Sacramento provides site location data
and/or the contents of surveyed sites only to licensed archaeologists, who are
then prohibited from disclosing this information to the public. California
Government Code Section 6254.10 exempts archaeological site information
from the California Public Records Act, which requires that public records be
open to public inspection.
Cultural artifacts tend to be unevenly distributed across the landscape, gener-
ally occurring in concentrations near areas of human activity linked to spe-
cific environmental conditions, such as proximity to water, food sources and
productive natural resources. Almost the entire town is considered moder-
ately to extremely sensitive in terms of cultural resources, with areas of mod-
erate terrain, close to water sources. Since many areas of potential sensitivity
are located throughout the town, this General Plan includes goals, policies
and actions that recommend archival and field study prior to the implementa-
tion of projects involving ground disturbance that might impact subsurface
resources.
D. Community and the Social Environment
The fourth component of Truckee’s community character addressed in this
Element is that of the community itself, the people of the Town of Truckee
and network of social relationships that tie them together. The Vision for
Truckee acknowledges that the people of the Town possess an unusually
strong sense of community, manifest as a deep-felt concern to improve the
quality of life and the strength of social relationships among all of Truckee’s
citizens, with as much commitment as is applied to preservation and im-
provement of the physical environment. The Town of Truckee recognizes
that a strong and healthy community is a critical component in the long term
sustainability and prosperity of the town.

                                    C O M M U N I T Y C H A R A C T E R E L E M E N T
A socially sustainable community can be built in many ways: by bringing
people together through events and festivals that provide opportunities to
interact; by enabling full participation in the decision-making processes un-
dertaken by the Town; and by fostering the support systems that help mem-
bers of the community in need. Each of these aspects serves to remind us that
we are members of a wider community, along with others around us.
Although frequently encapsulated by elements that are intangible and hard to
define, this Community Character Element nonetheless provides, in the fol-
lowing section, a series of goals, policies and actions that the Town can under-
take and support in an effort to strengthen the town’s social fabric and this
critical aspect of Truckee’s community character, the community itself.
E. Arts and Culture
Arts and culture enrich a community in many ways. Public displays of art
and public performances and readings bring educational, intellectual, and
spiritual benefits to residents and visitors alike. These displays, performances,
and readings can also create significant economic benefits for the local com-
munity, particularly restaurants, lodging establishments, art galleries, and the
real estate industry. Support for arts and culture can also lead artists and per-
formers to move to a community, with the result that this “creative class”
enhances social vitality and diversity, and even entrepreneurial spirit.
The Town of Truckee recognizes that its local arts scene could and should
become a more important component of the community in the future, and
that Town support and recognition could assist in making local arts and cul-
tural activities sustainable over time. This support could include having
Town capital improvement and redevelopment projects incorporate a public
art component when appropriate, or it could involve having the Town sup-
port bringing together arts advocates, non-profit organizations, and govern-
mental agencies.

     Policies
       P8.1      Encourage the redevelopment of the Gateway Area from an
                 auto-oriented, strip-commercial dominated corridor, to a place
                 that invites pedestrian activity and provides gathering places
                 and opportunities for interaction.
       P8.2      Reinforce the commercial and mixed use qualities that con-
                 tribute to the “town” orientation of the Gateway corridor.
       P8.3      Avoid future strip commercial development in the area, and
                 encourage the rehabilitation of existing strip commercial de-
                 velopment to improve pedestrian access and activity, and vis-

P8.5 Encourage design oriented to the pedestrian realm through the
     following measures:
      ♦ Building design along Donner Pass Road that is propor-
         tionate to the width of the street that it fronts, is oriented
         to the street, and minimizes setbacks from the public right-
         of way.
      ♦ Appropriate design and siting of parking facilities to mini-
         mize their visual impact and break up their massing.
      ♦ Design of facades and building frontages that provide pe-
         destrian-scale detail and a high level of visual interest along
         the street frontage, including storefront display windows,
         articulated massing, and fine-grain architectural detail.
P8.6 Create new public spaces along the Donner Pass Road corri-
     dor.
P8.7 Encourage landscaping of private properties, and planting of
     street trees along the public right-of-way so as to facilitate an
     overall “greening” of the corridor.
P8.8 Encourage new mixed use development in the Gateway Area,
     particularly projects that incorporate both a residential and
     commercial component. Uses that support and provide op-
     portunities for community interaction should be encouraged,
     such as coffee houses, restaurants, and places for children and
     families.
P8.9 Utilize needed street and intersection improvements as an op-
     portunity to incorporate streetscape enhancements and im-
     provements for pedestrians and cyclists, as well as automo-
     biles. Roadway improvements shall be implemented with
     consideration of the need to balance the need for efficient traf-
     fic movement with the other broad goals for the corridor.

  uses.                                                                               the General Plan to be closely

  The Vision for Truckee recognizes the importance of an adequate and well-
  connected circulation system to support desired future land use patterns and
  foster connections between residential neighborhoods, commercial areas, and
  Truckee’s open spaces. The Vision also recognizes the relationship between
  transportation, the environment and community character by calling for
  compact, connected and neighborhood-oriented development that promotes
  alternate modes of travel and decreases dependence on automobile use. The
  Circulation Element addresses each of these aspects, supporting the Vision
  Statement through a series of guiding principles, goals, policies and actions to
  guide the development of a safe and efficient circulation system for all users,
  in keeping with the Town’s community character.
  Local conditions and development patterns dictate that automobile travel is,     The traffic analysis completed

  To achieve this, a number of circulation system improvements and a frame-
  work for their implementation are set forth in the Element. These improve-
  ments, which are described in greater detail below, include the construction
  of new connector and local roads (such as the Pioneer Trail and Bridge Street
                                                                               4-1

           to provide for the long-range development of the Town's
           roadway system consistent with the existing and future land
           use patterns described in the Land Use Element.
       Maintain acceptable traffic operations on the Town's roads
           through application of Level of Service thresholds, and by
           conditioning new development on the ability of local roads
           and intersections to accommodate projected traffic impacts.
       Eliminate, to the extent feasible, all traffic signals in Truckee.
       Minimize the negative impacts of transportation infrastruc-

           hoods, and the environment.
       Ensure that new development minimizes impacts on the road-

           tem and provides opportunities for use of alternate modes.
       Work cooperatively with adjacent jurisdictions to address re-
           gional traffic issues.
       Reduce automobile travel demand to reduce impacts on the
           Town's roadway system, lessen the need for new or expanded
           road facilities to accommodate increased demand, and de-
           crease pollutants emissions from automobiles.
       Provide a safe, comprehensive, and integrated system of trails
           and bikeways as a key component of the circulation system.
       Promote a safe and efficient transit system, including both bus
           and rail, to reduce congestion, improve the environment, and
           provide viable alternatives to the automobile.

Extension), widening and other capacity-increasing measures for existing
roads, and installation of roundabouts and other intersection improvements.
Since it is traffic from new development (alongside other factors such as in-
creases in regional traffic) that will largely determine the need for these im-
provements, the Circulation Element provides a framework for assessing the
impact of new development on traffic operations, including “Level of Service”
thresholds for traffic operations, and for funding and constructing the im-
provements needed to accommodate projected traffic volumes. Level of Ser-
vice (LOS) standards are described in Table CIR-1, below.
While planned circulation system improvements will offset the effects of in-
creased traffic from development allowed under this General Plan, it is none-
theless acknowledged that traffic congestion is likely to be somewhat worse in
the future than it is today. In addition, there will continue to be times during
the year when more severe congestion and delay occur, such as during peak
visitor periods and when roads are closed due to winter storms. This Ele-
ment's policies aim to maintain acceptable traffic conditions throughout most
of the year, and to reduce the worst impacts of traffic events that are beyond
the Town's ability to control or accommodate, through strategies such as
provision of alternate travel routes and emergency vehicle access.

Although planning for adequate automobile circulation is an important aspect
of the Circulation Element, the Element also aims to reduce transportation
demands and to provide support for alternate modes of travel. These include
facilities and development patterns that facilitate bicycle and pedestrian use
and use of public transit, carpooling and vanpooling, and private transit, all so
as to reduce dependence on the automobile. As important local and regional
facilities, the Element also contains guidance for both rail and air transporta-
tion.
Other key components of the Element include the roadway classifications in
Section C, the listing of future traffic improvements in Section D, and the
goals, policies and actions in Section E.

A. State Law Requirements
The Circulation Element is a required element of the General Plan. As re-
quired by Section 65302(b) of the California Government Code, this Circula-
tion Element is correlated with the Land Use Element, and includes informa-
tion on the general location and extent of existing and proposed major thor-
oughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local transportation
facilities.
State law also requires that a Circulation Element contain data and policies
related to the circulation of water, sewage, storm drainage, and other public
utilities. These components are not included here, and instead are incorpo-
rated in the Land Use Element.
B. Existing Circulation System
This section provides a brief overview of the various components of
Truckee’s transportation and circulation system.
Vehicular Circulation System
Automobiles are the primary mode of transportation in Truckee, with almost          According to the 2000 Census,
every Truckee household owning at least one vehicle. The dispersed pattern          only 1.5 percent of Truckee

Existing Roadway Network
Figure CIR-1 illustrates Truckee’s major existing roadway components, and
the average daily traffic volumes (ADT) on principal sectors of those road-
ways. The volumes illustrated in the figure are based on two different meth-
ods for measuring ADT, depending on the source of the data.
                                                                                4-5

2 0 2 5 G E N E R A L P L A N
C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T
Traffic volumes shown for State highways within Truckee represent peak
month ADT. These figures are reported annually by Caltrans, and are based
on the average ADT over the month during which the highest ADT volumes
occur; or in other words, the total traffic volume for that month, divided by
the number of days in the month. In Truckee, the highest daily traffic vol-
umes usually occur during July or August. Volumes for other roadways illus-
trate peak summer day ADT, representing total traffic volume traveling along
a roadway over the course of a peak summer day. Peak summer traffic vol-
umes were calculated based on traffic counts conducted in the summers of
2003 and 2004, where the peak summer day is defined as the day during
which the 10th highest summer peak hour volume occurs.
Although there is some level of congestion during weekday afternoon peak
periods under existing conditions, all roads and intersections operate at ac-
ceptable Levels of Service. However, several intersections are currently near
capacity and there is limited potential for the Town's existing roadway net-
work to accommodate increased traffic, especially that associated with signifi-
cant new development.
Truckee’s primary regional connections are provided by an interstate freeway
and two State highways. Interstate 80 runs approximately east-west through
the Town, connecting Truckee to Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay
Area to the west, and to Reno, Nevada, and eventually to Chicago to the east.
Highway 267, which runs south from Interstate 80, connects to Highway 28
along Lake Tahoe’s north shore. Highway 89 is divided into two sections.
Highway 89 South travels from Interstate 80 to Tahoe City and Lake Tahoe’s
west shore. The roadway crosses the railroad by means of a narrow tunnel
undercrossing, known as the “Mousehole,” which has been long identified as
a significant safety concern for the many pedestrians and cyclists who use it.
Highway 89 North begins at the I-80/Highway 267/Highway 89 North in-
tersection northeast of Downtown Truckee, and runs north to connect
Truckee with Sierraville, Quincy, and the far north of the State.

Donner Pass Road is perhaps the most important of Truckee’s local thor-
oughfares, and is its most heavily traveled local (non-highway) route. The
east end of Donner Pass Road begins at the intersection with Highway 89
North and travels westward through Downtown and the Gateway commer-
cial area, to Donner Lake, where it continues towards Soda Springs. Donner
Pass Road provides a vital link for local circulation by providing access to
Downtown Truckee, the public and commercial uses in the Gateway area,
and residential and recreational uses around Donner Lake. While congestion
is a significant issue along Donner Pass Road, particularly in the Gateway
area, it is also a primary aim of the Town to improve the visual character and
pedestrian-orientation of this key corridor.
Other major roadways in Truckee, most of which provide connections to the
Town’s residential neighborhoods, include Glenshire Drive, connecting Glen-
shire/Devonshire and Olympic Heights to Downtown; Northwoods Boule-
vard, which connects Tahoe Donner to Donner Pass Road just west of the
Highway 89 South intersection; and Brockway Road, which links the Martis
Summer traffic along the Commercial Row segment of Donner Pass Road.

Drive. The intersection at Donner Pass Road and McIver Crossing operates
with a one-lane roundabout. Three additional roundabouts are due to be
completed in 2006, two are at the Highway 89 South/ Interstate 80 east- and
west-bound off-ramps, and the third at Brockway Road and Martis Valley
Road. Two more roundabouts, at Donner Pass Road/Highway 89 North,
and at Highway 89 North/Prosser Dam Road/Alder Drive are scheduled for
construction in 2007. All other intersections in Truckee are unsignalized.
As explained in the goals, policies and actions in Section E, the Town of
Truckee is committed to the future use of roundabouts as an alternative to
traffic signalization at intersections. Roundabouts are widely employed as
traffic control devices throughout the world, but are relatively little used in
the United States. However, transportation engineers and local communities

have increasingly come to recognize the benefits of modern roundabouts,
which have been shown to improve traffic flows by moving vehicles more
efficiently through an intersection, improving safety, and decreasing emis-
sions from vehicles idling at a traffic signal or stop. By eliminating turn lanes
and reducing vehicle queuing requirements, roundabouts can also serve an
important urban design function by reducing the total size of an intersection,
and by allowing installation of landscaping in the central portion of an inter-
section instead of an expanse of asphalt.
Trucks
Due to the Town’s location at the intersections of an Interstate and two ma-
jor regional highways, substantial truck traffic passes through the Town lim-
its. The opening of the Highway 267 Bypass has eliminated some of the truck
traffic formerly required to travel on downtown streets from Interstate 80 to
the Lake Tahoe region. However, some regional truck traffic, as well as local
truck traffic associated with the Town’s commercial and industrial businesses
and construction industry, continues to use local streets. There are no for-
mally designated truck routes in the town, although Glenshire Drive has a
seven-ton weight limit (put in place prior to construction of the new Truckee
River bridge) and trucks are prohibited on the south end of Northwoods
Boulevard (north of Donner Pass Road) because of its steep grade.                                 Intersection Conflict Points

Facilities for non-automotive travel are an important and intrinsic part of the        (Source: Federal Highways Administration)
Town’s circulation network. These routes serve to connect Truckee’s
neighborhoods and its open spaces, and provide both a circulation and a rec-
reational function for the Town. The Town of Truckee is committed to the
establishment of an extensive and well-connected network of trails and bike-
ways linking all parts of Truckee and the town’s neighboring open space ar-
eas.
At present, the trail and bikeway network within the Town limits is rela-
tively limited. Existing trails include recreational trails/Class I bike paths
that are in place along the Truckee River between the Truckee River Re-

                          Road through the Gateway area. Additional trails/Class I bike paths have
                          been approved for construction in association with the Old Greenwood and
                          Gray’s Crossing developments; short segments will also be built in conjunc-

                          The 2002 Trails and Bikeways Master Plan describes a comprehensive system of
                          bikeways located along Truckee’s existing and future roadways, as well as a
                          dedicated network of trails and pathways for use by pedestrians, equestrians,
                          cyclists and cross-country skiers. Among the key facilities proposed in the
                          Plan are the following:
                            ♦ A major East-West Recreational Trail extending from Donner Lake to
                                the eastern Town Limit, along Donner Creek and the Truckee River.

                                in the eastern part of Truckee and the TTSA/TSD lands south of the
                                Truckee River.
                            ♦ Class II Bike Lanes along the length of Donner Pass Road, Northwoods

    service is provided seven days a week and includes three routes serving
    key commercial areas and some residential neighborhoods in town, as
    well the Northstar and Sugar Bowl ski resorts and the Airport. Much

    route between Downtown and the west end of Donner Lake.
  ♦ Truckee Dial-A-Ride provides curb-to-curb demand response service to
    persons with disabilities with ADA certification as well as the general
    public. Service is offered six days a week, and is generally limited to the
    area within Town limits.
  ♦ Tahoe Area Regional Transit (TART). Tahoe Area Regional Transit
    operates transit service between Truckee and Tahoe City along the
    Highway 89 corridor. TART is operated by the Placer County Depart-
    ment of Public Works, in partnership with the Town of Truckee. This
    service operates seven days a week from 8:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M, with ex-
    tended service hours offered mid-December to mid-April.
  ♦ No Stress Express. No Stress Express is an airport shuttle service oper-
    ating between the Lake Tahoe North Shore and Truckee area, and the
    Reno/Tahoe International Airport. The shuttle service operates seven
    days a week, with 21 daily one-way runs to the Reno airport.
  ♦ Greyhound Bus Lines. Greyhound provides regional and long-distance
    service to and from Truckee seven days a week, including westbound ser-

      runs to Truckee are provided from Reno, and three eastbound runs to
      Reno from Truckee are available daily.
Railroad
The railroad is a defining feature of Truckee’s local history and character.
Today, the Union Pacific line through Truckee provides both passenger and
freight rail service. Daily Amtrak passenger rail service stops in Truckee as
part of the California Zephyr route between the Bay Area and Chicago. Due
to delays along the route, this service often operates substantially behind
schedule, particularly in the westbound direction. The rail route is also heav-
ily used for freight service, providing a vital transcontinental route for trans-
portation of all types of cargo. With millions of annual visitors to the Lake
Tahoe region from the Bay Area, Sacramento, and Reno, and the increasing
number of Truckee residents who commute to jobs in Reno, improved pas-
senger rail service offers promise as an inter-city transit option for the town.
In this historic picture, the California Zephyr travels along the Truckee River about eight miles east
of the town.

Truckee-Tahoe Airport
The Truckee-Tahoe Airport is a general aviation facility that serves the entire
north Lake Tahoe region. Most aircraft served by the Airport are small, pri-
vately-owned piston and light turbine aircraft – with a much smaller number
of medium and large turbine aircraft, including corporate jets. As of 2004, the
airport saw an average of about 100 aircraft operations per day, using two
runways. Peak use of the airport occurs in the summer months. The Tahoe-
Truckee Airport District is responsible for operations at the airport, includ-
ing maintenance of runways, hangars, and other facilities, as well as offering
tie-downs for aircraft, fuel sales, and other aviation services.
C. Roadway Classifications
The Town of Truckee is served by an existing network of freeways, State
highways, arterial roads, collector roads and local roads. Each of these types
can be described by a classification, summarized in Table CIR-3, which in-
cludes its primary function, the type of linkage it provides, as well as certain
aspects of its design, and access. This functional classification system helps to
plan appropriately for the circulation system by identifying the various types
of linkages needed to accommodate the access and mobility requirements of
the development allowed by the General Plan. The locations of existing and
future roadways in each class are mapped in Figure CIR-3, which follows Ta-
ble CIR-5. A listing of the town’s roadways by classification in provided in
Table CIR-4.
In general, roadways have two functions, to provide mobility and to provide
access to property. Whereas high speeds and limited interruption by intersec-
tions and access points are desirable for mobility and providing direct connec-
tions, low speeds are more desirable for safety and property access in residen-
tial and higher density development areas. Local streets emphasize property
access; highways and arterials emphasize higher mobility for through-traffic;
and collectors attempt to achieve a balance between both functions. From a
design standpoint these functions can sometimes conflict, particularly when a
                                                                                  4-19

                    The function of a freeway is to provide for inter-regional and intra-
                    regional travel. Freeways serve high speed traffic and are full access con-
                    trolled with no at-grade crossings interrupting the flow of traffic. Vehi-
  Freeway
                    cle speeds and daily traffic volumes are very high. Interchanges typically
                    connect to major or minor arterials. Interstate 80 is the only freeway in
                    Truckee.
                    Major arterials, similar to freeways, provide for high mobility inter-
  Major
                    regional and intra-regional travel. Major arterials however, are usually
  Arterial

  Highway)
                    Truckee include SR 89 and SR 267.
                    Minor arterials typically provide more land access than do major arte-
  Minor             rials, while still providing adequate mobility for accommodating longer
  Arterial          distance trips. Minor arterials should have Class II bike lanes. Examples
                    in Truckee include Donner Pass Road and Glenshire Drive.
                    Major collectors serve the more important intra-county travel corridors

                    ways such as Alder Creek Drive, Donner Lake Road, Lausanne Way, and
                    the Northwoods Boulevard loop.
                    The function of minor collector roadways is to accumulate traffic from
                    local roads and provide connectivity to higher class major collectors and
  Minor
                    major and minor arterials. Minor collectors may have Class II bike lanes.
  Collector
                    Examples of minor collectors include Dorchester Drive, Martis Valley
                    Road, South Shore Drive, and Rainbow Drive.
                    Local roads can be private or public and primarily provide land access
                    functions (e.g., to residence, business, or other abutting property) and
                    include cul-de-sacs. Their design and control facilitates the movement of
  Local Road        vehicles onto and off the street system from land parcels. Through
                    movement is difficult and is discouraged by both design and control of
                    facility. Vehicle speeds are typically very low. Most neighborhood resi-
                    dential roads are considered local roads.

                                       roadway serves more than one function. For example, prior to construction
                                       of the Highway 267 Bypass, Downtown streets served as the primary route
                                       between Interstate 80 and Highway 267, creating conflicts between a desire
                                       for a pedestrian-oriented downtown and the needs of motorists to efficiently
                                       reach their destination.
                                       The Town of Truckee has established Public Improvements and Engineering
                                       Standards (PIES) for arterial, collector and local roadway classifications,
                                       which encompass all roadways in Truckee that are under local jurisdiction.
                                       Interstate 80 and Highways 267 and 89 in Truckee are under the jurisdiction
                                       of the California Department of Transportation, which controls design, con-
                                       struction and maintenance of these roadways. The PIES regulate a variety of
                                       aspects concerning roadway design including minimum right-of-way width,
                                       design speeds, standard lane width, and number of lanes.
                                       D. Planned Circulation Improvements
                                       Under this General Plan, the Town plans to implement a number of im-

                                       ways and roadway connections, as well as installation of roundabouts, traffic
to implement these improvements,
including establishment of appropri-   signals, and addition of turn lanes at key intersections. In general, as is de-
ate time-frames for implementation,    scribed in Policy P6.5, in Section E, it is the Town's desire to avoid im-
and funding.                           provements that involve widening roads beyond two travel lanes, or creation
                                       of intersections with two or more dual left-turn lanes for a turning move-
                                       ment, except in certain cases, in order to avoid the visual impacts and loss of
                                       community character that are often associated with wide roadways and inter-
                                       sections.
                                       These planned improvements are summarized in Table CIR-5 and are de-

General Plan, as described in the Land Use Element and illustrated in the
Land Use Map.
Additional information concerning some of these improvements is provided,
as follows:
Pioneer Trail Extension and Bridge Street Connection
An arterial connection will be constructed to connect Northwoods Boulevard
with the existing section of Pioneer Trail. An additional arterial connection
will be constructed to connect south from Pioneer Trail to Bridge Street in
the Downtown. This improvement will provide an alternate east-west con-
nection that will relieve congestion on Donner Pass Road in the Gateway
Area, and allow this roadway to operate acceptably without being widened to
four lanes, and avoid the need for a two-lane roundabout at the Donner Pass
Road/Frates Lane/Highway 89 South intersection.
The Pioneer Trail extension needs to be completed and operational before
Donner Pass Road in the Gateway area, or the Donner Pass Road/Frates
Lane/Highway 89 South intersection, operate worse than Level of Service D.
Based on projected traffic increases, without the improvements, LOS E condi-
tions at the intersection would be likely to occur by 2008. Interim improve-
ments at the intersection will delay LOS E at this intersection by several
years.
Downtown and Railyard Circulation Improvements
With development of the land uses foreseen under this General Plan, includ-
ing development of the Railyard as projected in the Downtown Specific Plan,
traffic in the Downtown will increase and cause congestion. The General
Plan's traffic analysis has determined that the Bridge Street/River Street,
Bridge Street/Donner Pass Road, and Donner Pass Road/Glenshire Drive
intersections will reach LOS F by 2010, even without development of the
Railyard.
                                                                                4-27

Several improvements are proposed for consideration to resolve projected
circulation deficiencies in the Downtown area:
  ♦ Improvements to the Glenshire Drive/Donner Pass Road intersection
      and realignment of Glenshire Drive.
  ♦ Construction of an easterly undercrossing of the Union Pacific railroad
      tracks from the Railyard site.
  ♦ Closure of the existing Bridge Street at-grade railroad crossing.
  ♦ Improvements to the Bridge Street/Donner Pass Road intersection.
  ♦ Improvements to the Bridge Street/River Street Intersection.
Implementation of circulation improvements for the Downtown will need to
reflect a variety of interrelated factors that will influence the ultimate scope
and timing of these improvements. Key among these will be the ultimate
development scenario and timing of the Railyard Project, as well as the im-
plementation of the Pioneer Trail Extension and Bridge Street Extension, as
described in the previous section.
Other considerations include the broader goals and policies of the Town con-
cerning circulation and connectivity, community character, and urban design
within the Downtown area. The decision to implement any traffic im-
provement in the Downtown should be considered in light of the other im-
provements that might be implemented, and the range of other concerns de-
scribed above. Such considerations can help determine that a particular solu-
tion is unacceptable for reasons beyond those related to traffic capacity or
Level of Service.
In order to plan and implement the most appropriate set of solutions to pro-
jected traffic issues, this General Plan calls for the preparation of a Down-
town Traffic Study, for which guidance is provided below. Until final deter-
minations can be made concerning the scope and timing of Downtown traffic
solutions, the Town may determine it appropriate to defer improvements and
accept an interim LOS of F at the Bridge Street/River Street, Bridge
Street/Donner Pass Road, and Donner Pass Road/Glenshire Drive intersec-
tions.

Additional information concerning the improvements listed above, and guid-
ance for the preparation of a Downtown Traffic Study is provided in the fol-
lowing paragraphs:
Glenshire Drive Realignment/Railyard Access. In association with the
Railyard development, a road will be constructed from approximately the
location of the Trout Creek Nursery, through the Railyard to an intersection
opposite Church Street, providing the primary access to the Railyard. The
existing Glenshire Drive alignment will be retained to provide access to I-80
and Highway 89 North. The Glenshire Drive realignment will be a required
component in the planning, design and development of the Railyard project.
Other projects, outside of the Downtown Specific Plan Area, will contribute
to the need for this improvement, and should be required to participate in its
funding. The precise alignment, intersection configuration, and classification
of this roadway will be determined during planning and development of the
Railyard project, and the Downtown Traffic Study.
Easterly Railroad Undercrossing/Bridge Street At-Grade Crossing. An east-
erly railroad undercrossing may be constructed between the Railyard site and
East River Street. It should be noted that the Easterly undercrossing is not, in
itself, necessary to enhance the capacity of the Downtown roadway network
or accommodate traffic projected in the General Plan's traffic analysis. How-
ever, the undercrossing could serve to improve overall traffic flow in the
Downtown and reduce vehicle delays that are caused by train traffic. Fur-
ther, the undercrossing might serve to defer, or reduce the scope of improve-
ments needed at other downtown intersections, e.g. the intersections of
Bridge Street/Donner Pass Road and Bridge Street/ River Street, especially if
the Bridge Street at-grade crossing is closed (see discussion below). The con-
struction of the undercrossing shall be considered as an alternative circulation
improvement during the development of the Railyard Master Plan, and in the
Downtown Traffic Study.
                                                                                4-29

C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T
Bridge Street Intersections. Improvements to the Bridge Street/River Street
and Bridge Street/Donner Pass Road, which might encompass signalization
or installation of a roundabout, will be undertaken to increase capacity and
reduce congestion. The Bridge Street/River Street and Bridge Street/Donner
Pass Road intersections are projected to reach LOS F by 2010, even without
development of the Railyard. However, the development of the Railyard
would additionally affect operation of these intersections, as will the imple-
mentation of the Pioneer Trail and Bridge Street extensions. Thus, as noted
above, it may be necessary to defer improvements to these intersections, and
accept an interim LOS F, until the complete range of circulation improve-
ment needed in the Downtown can be defined, through the Downtown Traf-
fic Study, as described below.
Downtown Traffic Study. In light of the various factors outlined above, this
General Plan calls for the completion of a comprehensive Downtown Traffic
Study, conducted in a public forum, to consider and determine the most ap-
propriate solutions to projected traffic issues in Downtown Truckee. The
study should incorporate the following considerations:
  ♦ Traffic circulation impacts of all proposed and alternative improvements,
      including the Glenshire Drive/Donner Pass Road intersection; the Glen-
      sire Drive realignment, the Donner Pass Road/Bridge Street intersection,
      Bridge Street/River Street intersection, Easterly Undercrossing and po-
      tential closure of Bridge Street. The timing and feasibility of these im-
      provements, both with and without future development of the Railyard
      should be considered, as should other alternatives that may have not been
      considered to date.
  ♦ The location and alignment of the easterly undercrossing and its integra-
      tion with the Railyard Master Plan's circulation plan and the Glenshire
      Drive realignment, as described above;
  ♦ Impacts to properties located on East River Street;
  ♦ The potential circulation-related benefits and detriments of closing the
      Bridge Street at-grade crossing. The necessity of doing so should be con-

     sidered both in relation to the circulation conditions associated with the
     new undercrossing, as well as other circulation goals for the Town and
     the Downtown area;
  ♦ Overall impacts to pedestrian circulation and access;
  ♦ Connections to and within the Downtown;
  ♦ Alternatives to closure of the at-grade crossing that would continue to
     meet other circulation goals and objectives;
  ♦ Consistency with Goals and Policies of the Downtown Specific Plan, in-
     cluding impacts to the overall urban design quality of the Downtown, re-
     tention of a successful Main Street character and environment, the design
     of civic spaces, pedestrian circulation, and effects on Downtown's inter-
     nal circulation and parking.
  ♦ Potential economic impacts on Downtown businesses, the historic char-
     acter of the Downtown, and other potential impacts to downtown busi-
     nesses, property owners, and residents that are not directly related to cir-
     culation.
Deerfield Drive Extension
In conjunction with development of PC-1, that portion of Deerfield Drive
east of Cold Creek will be connected with Cold Stream Road. The roadway
may be designed as a possible future local access route to allow development
in PC-1 to access Deerfield Drive, but will be used in the near term as an
emergency access only. The determination of whether this road will ulti-
mately be used as a local access road will be made through the PC-1 Specific
Plan.
As part of the PC-1 specific plan process, an alignment study shall be con-
ducted, which shall follow the guidelines below:
  ♦ Provide for public participation and input from Deerfield Drive residents
     and property owners;
                                                                                 4-31

T O W N O F T R U C K E E
2 0 2 5 G E N E R A L P L A N
C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T
  ♦ Analyze various alignments and connections from PC-1 to that portion
      of Deerfield Drive east of Cold Creek;
  ♦ Avoid an alignment that would substantially impact residences along ei-
      ther side of Deerfield Drive; and
  ♦ Incorporate features to specifically discourage use of the road as a cut-
      through route for non-local traffic if and when the road is opened to
      Deerfield Drive.
Other Roadway Improvements
In addition to the new roadways and connections described above, the Town
plans to make three additional improvements:
  ♦ Cold Stream Road. As part of the PC-1 development, additional
      northbound and southbound through lanes will be constructed between
      Donner Pass Road and the PC-1 project site.
  ♦ Highway 267. An additional northbound and an additional southbound
      through lane will be constructed between Truckee Airport Road and
      Brockway Road/Soaring Way.
  ♦ Mousehole. Widening or other feasible improvements to increase the
      safety of the Mousehole undercrossing of Highway 89 beneath the rail-
      road tracks for pedestrian and cyclists, and to improve traffic flow, will
      be carried out.
In addition to these major improvements, other improvements to the existing
roadway network may be implemented over time, including widening of
roadway travel lanes and shoulders to meet Town engineering and design
standards and/or increase capacity; construction of bicycle facilities, and im-
provements for pedestrian mobility and safety.
Intersection Improvements
The Town will also make a number of improvements to intersections located
along some of Truckee’s major thoroughfares. These improvements, keyed

E. Goals, Policies and Actions
Goal CIR-1 Develop a roadway system that provides access
                  and mobility for Truckee residents and busi-
                  nesses and adequately serves existing and
                  planned land uses while maintaining local
                  community character.
    Policies
    P1.1     Maintain a hierarchy of arterial, collector and local roadways in
             Truckee by planning, designing, and regulating roadways in ac-
             cordance with the functional classification system described in
             this Element.
    P1.2     Undertake improvements to the Town’s roadway network, as
             identified in the Circulation Plan in Figure CIR-3 and in Section
             D, to ensure that the access and mobility needs of existing and
             future land uses can be adequately served.
    P1.3     Ensure that right-of-way for cumulatively needed future road-
             way improvements is reserved or acquired as part of relevant
             project approvals.
    P1.4     Improve existing roadways in Truckee to meet current Town
             engineering standards.
    P1.5     Ensure that existing and future roadway, sidewalk and bikeway
             standards, and the implementation of such standards, take
             Truckee's climatic conditions into account.
                                                                                4-33

      P1.6      Ensure that the design and functionality of the Town roadway
                network in keeping with the goals and policies of this General
                Plan concerning community character. Examples of such poli-
                cies include those listed under Goal CC-3, as well as policies for
                the Gateway Area, Brockway Road and West River Street in the
                Community Character Element.
      P1.7      Improve existing roadways and add new roadways to reduce de-
                lays from train traffic and to improve safety at railroad crossings.
      Actions
      A1.1      Update the timeframes for implementation of circulation im-
                provements as listed in Table CIR-5, including the specific “trig-
                gers” that will initiate the need for a particular improvement.
                These timelines shall be considered as broad targets only, and
                sufficiently flexible to accommodate changes in conditions.
      A1.2      Annually update the Town’s Capital Improvement Program
                (CIP) to include plans for improvements to be completed within
                the five year timeframe of the CIP.
      A1.3      Develop a prioritization and implementation program to up-
                grade roadways that do not meet current Town engineering
                standards, and update the CIP to reflect the needed improve-
                ments.
      A1.4      Update the Development Code and/or Traffic Mitigation Fee
                program to establish guidelines or requirements for new devel-
                opment that will secure needed right of way for future roadway
                improvements.
      A1.5      Update the Town’s traffic model analysis at least every five years
                to reflect changes in land use, local and regional traffic condi-
                tions, and the roadway network. As a result of the updated

           improvements (as listed in Table CIR-5) and amend them as
           needed to address changing conditions.
  A1.6     Amend the Public Improvements and Engineering Standards
           (PIES) to identify cross-sections for all arterial and collector
           roads, including existing and future rights-of-way, paving widths,
           sidewalk and bike lane locations, and edge treatments (landscap-
           ing, lighting etc.).
  A1.7     Prepare a study to analyze alternatives for the construction of
           the eastern railroad undercrossing, and the potential closure of
           the Bridge Street at-grade crossing, and the potential effects that
           these circulation changes might have.
Goal CIR-2 Maintain adequate Level of Service on
                Truckee’s roadways and intersections to ensure
                the safe and efficient movement of people and
                goods throughout the Town.
  Policies
  P2.1     Establish and maintain a Level of Service D or better on road
                                                                                   Level of Service (LOS) standards for

6 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
  The Economic Development Element of the General Plan is directed toward
  fostering a healthy, balanced year-round economy in Truckee in order to
  provide a broad range of economic opportunity for all Truckee residents. It
  supports the Vision for Truckee by providing a framework of guiding princi-
  ples, goals, polices and actions that encourage a diverse and sustainable year-
  round economy in Truckee while maintaining the Town’s community char-
  acter and high quality of life, and ability to maintain superior community
  services.
  Although economic development is not a topic required to be addressed in a
  General Plan, its inclusion in the Truckee General Plan reflects the Town’s
  commitment to maintaining a balanced mix of economic sectors, encouraging
  high-wage jobs, and supporting businesses and commercial activities that
  build upon and enhance Truckee’s unique character and natural environment.
  The guiding principles of the Economic Development Element are shown on
  the following page, and goals, policies and actions in Section C at the end of
  the Element.
  A. Introduction
  This Economic Development Element incorporates the policy framework of

B. Background Information
Truckee’s outstanding mountain environment, plentiful recreation opportu-
nities, and strategic location along key transportation routes have contributed
to the town’s desirability as a place to live, work and visit. These assets have
allowed Truckee to sustain strong growth in residential development and
tourism, even as other communities in California have suffered from declin-
ing economic fortunes.
However, broader economic development in Truckee has lagged behind resi-
dential and tourist development. While local employment conditions and the
economic vitality of the Downtown has shown improvement since the Town
prepared the Economic Development Strategic Plan in 2001, Truckee continues
to face economic challenges. These challenges stem in large part from the
character of the local economy, which is dominated by the retail and service
sectors and by seasonal recreation-based tourism.
Figure ED-1 shows the employment make-up in Truckee in 2000. As shown
in the figure, the services and retail sectors employ the most people in
Truckee, accounting for 31 percent and 27 percent of local jobs, respectively.
These sectors are followed by the government sector, accounting for 18 per-
cent of total employment, and mining and construction, accounting for 15
percent of total employment. The high number of employees in the mining
and construction category can be attributed to the amount of housing con-
struction in and around Truckee.
Truckee’s visitor-based economy is highly seasonal in nature, which generates
large annual fluctuations in demand for goods and services and in the staffing
requirements of local employers. Annual retail business sales patterns reflect
the highly seasonal nature of the Truckee economy: approximately 48 percent
of retail sales are earned during the summer, 39 percent during the winter,
and only 13 percent during the spring and fall seasons combined. This creates
challenges for employers in sustaining a viable business on a year- round basis,
and in managing human resources. Local residents that desire full-time
                                                                                  6-3

 FIGURE ED-1 EMPLOYMENT IN TRUCKEE BY SECTOR, 2000
permanent employment can experience a shortage of such jobs locally. Fur-
ther, many of the jobs associated with the recreation, retail, and service em-
ployment sectors that dominate the local economy do not provide wages at
levels commensurate with local housing costs, contributing to the growing
disparity between the cost of housing and its affordability to the local work-
force.
This Economic Development Element includes a number of strategies that
seek to address the issues described above. Foremost among them is the ex-
pansion of key non-tourism related economic sectors that will help to stabi-
lize the fluctuations in the Town’s business environment, increase year-round
employment opportunities, and provide higher-wage skilled jobs.
Specifically, it addresses the following sectors:
  ♦ Light-industrial development that can provide high density, relatively
     high-wage employment in skilled trades. Many such businesses are small

  scale enterprises that generate minimal environmental impacts compared
  to more traditional industrial uses, focusing on production of specialized
  items, such as woodworking and cabinetry, custom work, and artisan and
  craft products.
♦ “New economy” business, which include high-tech, computer and infor-
  mation-based enterprises. The type of employment reflects a growing
  sector in the California economy, offering “clean”, high-wage and skilled
  employment opportunities. Such businesses are also appropriate for
  Truckee in that they have fewer locational constraints than many other
  industries, relying on remote telecommunications instead of geographic
  proximity to their customer base.
♦ Healthcare and healthcare-related industries, including medical facilities
  and auxiliary industries that support healthcare. Truckee is established as
  a center for healthcare in the North Tahoe region, which is a rapidly-
  growing sector nationwide. Medical employment also offers higher-wage
  and skilled job opportunities in an industry that brings few environ-
  mental impacts to a community.

Other strategies address the expansion of Truckee’s role as a tourist destina-
tion, with a focus on capturing a larger proportion of regional visitor spend-
ing and increasing tourism during the traditional “off-seasons” in the spring
and fall.

7 CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
  The Conservation and Open Space Element of the General Plan is dedicated
  to preserving and improving the quantity, quality, and character of open
  space in Truckee, and to conserving and enhancing the town’s important
  natural resources. It identifies Truckee’s important open space lands and re-
  sources and ensures that future development will respect the natural and sce-
  nic qualities of those places, helping to shape the desired physical form of the
  community by safeguarding open space for future generations. The Element
  also seeks to strengthen the role of the Town and its citizens as environ-
  mental stewards, striving to minimize individual and collective impacts on
  local and global resources and to improve the overall health of the planet.
  The General Plan Vision Statement recognizes that Truckee is a place that is
  defined by its natural setting and open spaces. Dramatic mountain peaks and
  ridges surround the town, and its neighborhoods are knit together through
  the landscape of the Truckee River valley, meadows and forestlands. This
  natural context provides the setting for many of the elements that define
  Truckee’s sense of place and that are central to its quality of life: abundant
  outdoor recreational opportunities, a rich diversity of habitats for plants and
  animals, and uninterrupted vistas and scenic views from almost every part of
  the town. This Element seeks to fulfill the Vision for Truckee through a se-
  ries of guiding principles and goals, policies and actions that safeguard
  Truckee’s precious open spaces and natural resources, provide recreational
  opportunities for all, and protect and enhance the environment.
  Since open space and natural resources issues generally transcend the bounda-
  ries defined by the Town limits, it should be emphasized that, perhaps more
  than some other elements of the General Plan, the Conservation and Open
  Space Element provides guidance for a range issues that affect both the Town
  and the wider Planning Area.
  Conservation and Open Space Element guiding principles are presented on
  the following page and goals, policies and actions in Section E, at the end of
  the Element.
                                                                               7-1

          Truckee’s special biodiversity.
       Protect sensitive biological resources, specifically special status
          plants and wildlife, streams and wetlands, and significant wild-
          life movement corridors.
       Ensure the continued productivity of mineral, grazing and
          forestry areas in Truckee, while minimizing land use conflicts
          and visual impacts associated with these activities.
       Safeguard important and sensitive visual resources associated
          with Truckee’s open space resources.
       Improve Truckee’s parks and recreation facilities and ensure
          the availability of a diverse range of recreational opportunities
          for Truckee’s existing and future population.
       Maintain and improve air quality in the Truckee region to en-
          sure a healthful environment for all.
       Make Truckee a leader in environmental conservation and sus-
          tainability, and strive to reduce the Town’s impact on the local
          and global environment.
       Put into action “low impact development” planning and design
          practices and technologies to simultaneously reduce infra-
          structure costs, conserve and protect natural resource systems,
          and reduce potential environmental impacts.

A. State Requirements
State law requires that a General Plan include both a Conservation Element
and an Open Space Element. The Truckee General Plan combines these two
elements into a single Conservation and Open Space Element that addresses
their similar and overlapping concerns, and satisfies the legal requirements for
both.
Government Code identifies a series of topics which must be addressed in the        Government Code Section
Conservation Element and the Open Space Element. The Conservation Ele-              65302(d) and Public Resources
ment is required to address the conservation, development and utilization of        Code Sections 2762, 2763, and
natural resources, including forests, rivers and other waters, fisheries, plants    2764 specify the required con-
and wildlife, minerals and soils. The Open Space Element must address a             tents of the Conservation Ele-
range of open space types, including four major categories identified in the        ment; Government Code Sec-
Government Code: Open Space for the Preservation of Natural Resources,              tion 65560 and Public Resources
Open Space used for Managed Resource Production, Open Space for Out-                Code Section 5076 those for the
door Recreation and Scenic Resources, and Open Space for Public Health and          Open Space Element.
Safety.
Not all aspects dictated by State law are discussed in this element, because
they are included elsewhere in the General Plan. For example, areas impor-
tant for the preservation of historic and cultural resources are identified in the
Community Character Element and open space for public health and safety is
primarily discussed in the Safety Element.
Table COS-1 summarizes the Government Code Open Space Classifications,
and identifies examples specific to Truckee. The table also indicates the loca-
tion of topics that are included in these classifications, but not discussed in
this Element.
In addition, this Conservation and Open Space Element addresses two addi-
tional topics that are not specifically required by State law. Issues of air qual-
ity are addressed in consideration of the importance of the air as a natural
                                                                                7-3

Element also speaks to wider issues of environmental quality and sustainabil-
ity, in which the Town seeks to play its part in minimizing its own impact on
the global environment, and in promoting sustainable modes of development.
B. Open Space
The term “open space” is used throughout the Conservation and Open Space
Element and the entire General Plan. This section provides both a broad
definition of the term as used in the General Plan, as well as a more detailed
series of descriptions and background information on a variety of open space
types in Truckee that are an important focus of this Element.
Providing these detailed definitions of open space types brings clarity and
specificity to the guiding principles, goals, policies and actions of the General
Plan that identify and prioritize the types of open space that are desired in
Truckee. These definitions also inform the implementation of the General
Plan in the future planning processes, decisions, and regulatory documents
that flow from the General Plan.
Open Space: General Definition
The term “open space” as used in a general context in this General Plan has
the following definition: “Land that is essentially unimproved, that may be un-
der public or private ownership, and that may be of any of the specific open space
types defined in the Conservation and Open Space Element.”
Open Space Types
As noted above, the general definition of “open space” encompasses a wide
range of place types that are essentially free of built development. The vari-
ous types of open space in and around Truckee can be categorized based on
their different characteristics and functions, and the types of activities and
uses that typically occur in such areas.
                                                                                 7-5

                                    This section defines and provides background information regarding seven
                                    basic types of open space that occur in and around Truckee. While each open
                                    space type described is presented as categorically distinct for the purposes of
                                    definition, it is important to note that many open space areas fall under more
                                    than one category, or will contain uses described under more than one open
                                    space type.
“Pristine” open space refers to the
lands in and around Truckee
                                    Pristine Open Space

Biological Resource Areas
Many open space areas are important because they provide habitat for signifi-
cant biological resources. While frequently encompassing wide areas and
pristine open space, important habitat open space can also take a linear form,
such as a river corridor or wildlife migration route; or can exist in smaller
pockets in more developed open space areas. Biological resource open space
areas also frequently possess a high level of scenic value, and often serve as a
venue for low-impact active and passive recreation. The degree of human
access can vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of those resources, but
development is generally secondary to the goals of habitat preservation, and
typically limited to facilities for passive recreational use.
The Truckee Basin and adjacent upland and mountain areas are rich in bio-
logical resources, both within the town and in the surrounding region. Sev-
eral special status habitats, plant species, and wildlife species have been identi-
fied or have the potential to occur in the Truckee area. The General Plan
EIR includes additional information and mapping of special status species that
are known or suspected to occur in the Truckee area, as identified by the
California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB). Truckee’s important bio-
logical resource open space includes both vegetation and habitat areas, as well
as wildlife corridors and migration routes that traverse the town.
  ♦ Vegetation and Habitat Areas. Several important vegetation and habi-
     tat areas exist in Truckee and its surrounds. These vegetation and habitat
     areas host a wide range of flora and fauna, some of which are designated
     as special status species, reflecting the high level of biodiversity present in
     the entire Tahoe region.
Important habitat types found within the town and its surrounding area in-
clude Jeffrey Pine Forest and Great Basin Sage Scrub. Other important habi-
tat is associated with riparian, aquatic and wetland resources. These include
the Truckee River, the most prominent waterway in Truckee, and supporting
riparian habitat; creeks and waterways such as Donner Creek, Martis Creek,
Gregory Creek, Alder Creek, Summit Creek, Cold Creek, and Trout Creek,
all of which are part of the Truckee River watershed; and open waters such as
Donner Lake, and Prosser and Boca Reservoirs. Montane Meadow habitat,

     which is dependent on a perennial or seasonal water source, is also associ-
     ated with some of these aquatic resources.
  ♦ Wildlife Corridors and Deer Migration Routes. Wildlife movement
     corridors are another important component of the natural environment
     in Truckee. These corridors generally reflect areas of undisturbed, con-
     tinuous vegetation, such as riparian areas along the Truckee River and
     streams that provide shelter and food sources for resident and migratory
     wildlife species.
     Truckee’s riparian, shrub communities, and forested areas are important
     habitats for local and migratory deer populations, referred to as the Loy-
     alton-Truckee Herd. The Verdi sub-unit of the herd migrates annually in
     the spring from Nevada to the Martis Valley, utilizing the Truckee River
     and Interstate 80, sometimes making use of the Prosser Village and Fi-
     berboard undercrossings.
Managed Resource Areas
This category of open space includes land under public or private ownership
in which uses focus on the land’s resource values from activities such as cattle
grazing, forestry, or mineral extraction. Generally minimally developed and
covering an extensive area, resource open space often also serves recreational
uses, such as hiking, horseback riding, fishing, camping or off-road vehicle
use. Although important scenic resources can be found within these areas,
some of the particular resource extraction activities, such as timber clear-
cutting or large scale aggregate mining may create an undesirable visual char-
acter.
Managed resource open space in Truckee includes that associated with the
following resources:
  ♦ Mineral Resources. A number of important mineral resource areas, as
     defined by the State of California, exist in Truckee; their location is
     mapped in Figure COS-2. As shown in the figure, these resources are
     generally associated with alluvial deposits along the length of the Truckee
     River Valley, although some mineral resources are associated with vol-
                                                                                7-11

     canic features, such as the Hirschdale cinder cone. Alluvial aggregates
     consist of gravel, sand and broken stone that are used in production of
     concrete and asphalt; cinders are also used for building and road construc-
     tion materials. State law requires that the General Plan include policies
     for important mineral resource areas that address the conservation and
     development of identified mineral deposits, balance the value of these de-
     posits against competing land uses, and minimize the impacts of mining
     activities.
     An example of the need to balance preservation of important mineral re-
     sources with other uses can be found in the case of the mineral areas
     mapped in the Downtown and Gateway areas. Since development of
     mining operations would be entirely incompatible with existing devel-
     opment in these places, the General Plan does not directly support the
     protection of mineral resources in these areas, and instead focuses on
     places where mining would be a compatible land use, such as the
     TTSA/TSD lands in southeast Truckee.
  ♦ Grazing and Forestry Resources. Potential grazing and forestry re-
     source open space generally coincides with rangeland vegetation areas and
     forest land, respectively. Despite the potential for these uses, there is no
     active grazing taking place in Truckee today, and no commercial forestry,
     although some timber harvesting for forest management does occur.
Parks and Recreational Areas
This category encompasses a number of different types of recreational and
active open space areas, including both publicly- and privately-owned types.
These open space areas generally include some level of developed and main-
tained recreation facilities, oriented towards various types of active use, al-
though also frequently offering opportunities for passive use and enjoyment.

Truckee has ten locally-operated public parks, including the Donner Lake
Boat Launch Facility and the Donner Lake Public Piers, that total approxi-
mately 120 acres, plus four public recreation facilities.1 Donner Memorial
State Park is also an important recreation resource for the local community.
The majority of Truckee’s parks are operated by the Truckee Donner Recrea-
tion and Parks District (TDRPD), although some small facilities are owned
and operated by the Tahoe Truckee Unified School District (TTUSD).
Truckee’s parks and recreational facilities are mapped in Figure COS-3 and
inventoried in Table COS-2. Based on an estimated 2004 population of
15,000, the current parks ratio in Truckee is approximately 8 acres per thou-
sand population.2 2
A number of types of developed recreation open space and parks are encom-
passed by this category:
  ♦ Limited Development Recreation Areas. These open space areas in-
     clude places that provide recreational opportunities requiring less inten-
     sive improvement or development such as golf courses, equestrian facili-
     ties, fly fishing, developed ski areas and campgrounds. These areas are
     most commonly under private ownership, but may also include public
     facilities such as a municipal golf course or campground.
  ♦ Regional Park. This open space type is more intensely developed with
     facilities than the limited development recreation areas described above.
     A broad range of facilities, intended to serve the wider region, are pro-
     vided. These facilities encompass both active and passive uses, and might
     include picnic areas, informal playing fields, ball fields, playgrounds, boat
     launching facilities, an amphitheater, rodeo ground or concession stands.
     Typically encompassing a several-acre area, these parks may also have
     certain portions dedicated to habitat preservation and less-intensely de-
     veloped passive recreation facilities.
          1
            This acreage does not include the Donner Memorial State Park.
          22
            Ratio is based on locally-operated, public parks, and does not include the
State Park, private recreational facilities, or TTUSD properties.

  ♦ District Park. This type of open space park is primarily dedicated to or-
     ganized sports activities, oriented towards serving the entire town com-
     munity, or smaller, specialized facilities that serve a town-wide recreation
     resource like Donner Lake. Facilities provided might include soccer
     fields, a baseball diamond, swimming pool or skate park, and tennis or
     basketball courts.
  ♦ Neighborhood Park. As its name implies, neighborhood parks are
     small, public open space areas intended to serve as a neighborhood or
     community facility. Amenities provided might include some recreational
     sports facilities such as a basketball hoop, ball field, playground, tot lot or
     picnic area.
  ♦ Community Gathering Place. These open space areas are the smallest
     and most “town-” oriented public open spaces, intended as a focal point
     for the entire community. Centrally located in the Downtown, a
     neighborhood, or other important community area, they are a place for
     community events and celebrations, a site for public concerts or a farm-
     ers market. Examples of such spaces would be a town square, pocket-
     park or civic plaza.
The TDRPD Master Plan identifies a series of standards for park provision, as
follows:
  ♦  Neighborhood Park: 2.5 acres/1,000 population
  ♦  District Park: 2.5 acres/1,000 population
  ♦  Regional Park: 5.0 acres/1,000 population
  ♦  Greenbelt/Open Space: 20 acres/1,000 population
  ♦  Urban Park/Plaza – no standard specified
While it is the goal of the District, under its current Master Plan, to provide
park facilities at these ratios, the Town of Truckee can only require new de-
velopment to provide park land or in lieu fees at a ratio of up to five acres per
thousand population, in accordance with the requirements of the Quimby
Act.
                                                                                 7-17

Truckee’s Skate Park
 There are also a number of privately-owned and operated recreational facili-
 ties in Truckee. Although public use of these facilities, where allowed, is fee
 based, they nonetheless offer additional recreational opportunities for
 Truckee’s residents and are also significant attractors for the large number of
 tourist visitors who visit Truckee and the Lake Tahoe region. Private recrea-
 tional open space facilities in Truckee include four golf courses that are cur-
 rently in operation; a fifth course will be part of the Gray’s Crossing Planned
 Development. There are also a number of recreational facilities associated
 with the Tahoe Donner resort area, including several private neighborhood
 parks and picnic areas, a downhill and cross-country ski area, equestrian cen-
 ter, and campground. Although it is recognized that golf courses do serve as a
 recreational open space amenity, it is an express policy of this General Plan,
 stated in the Land Use Element, that no new golf courses should be allowed
 in Truckee in the future.

Open Space Corridors
Open space corridors have a linear form and provide important links and              Examples of open space corridors
connections between other dispersed open space areas. Trails, paths and              include the Truckee River, and
bikeways may be sited along such corridors, providing physical connections           the protected linear open space
that facilitate travel between open space areas and connect disparate open           areas that run through Tahoe-

Open space corridors frequently provide a significant biological function,
linking often fragmented habitat areas and providing safe corridors for wild-
life movement and migration. Riparian habitat associated with Truckee’s
network of rivers and streams form natural open space corridors that can
serve a variety of functions, providing critical habitat, movement corridors,
and a naturally-defined alignment for pedestrian trails and bikeways.

                                  The largest single contributor to particulate matter pollution in Truckee in
                                  1998 was emissions from wood-burning appliances. Other major sources are
                                  construction activities such as grading and demolition, and re-entrained dust
                                  and sand (particularly in association with winter road sanding) from vehicles
                                  traveling along Truckee’s highways and paved and unpaved roads. Motor
                                  vehicles also generate particulate matter, along with other pollutants, from
                                  tail-pipe emissions and tire wear. Re-entained road dust and sand may now be
                                  the largest single contributor to particulate matter pollution.
                                  To respond to concerns over declining local air quality, the Town of Truckee
                                  prepared and adopted the Particulate Matter Air Quality Management Plan in

 Particulate matter pollution is a significant problem throughout the Sierra region Photo: USFS
1999. Prepared in cooperation with the Northern Sierra Air Quality Man-
agement District (NSAQMD), the Plan represents a bold and proactive stance
in dealing with air quality issues, and presents a wide-ranging series of pro-
grams to address particulate matter pollution in Truckee. Measures in the
Plan include programs to encourage removal or replacement of polluting
woodstoves, best management practices to minimize construction dust, and
preparation of guidelines for sanding and sweeping operations on Town
roads. Several of these recommended measures have been adopted, including
a 2004 ordinance that requires all non-certified wood-burning appliances to be
removed or replaced by mid-2007.
The Plan appears to have had a positive effect on air quality in Truckee, with
reductions in particulate matter levels since 1999, mostly attributable to a
reduction in the number of non-certified woodstoves, as well as the increased
town-wide availability of natural gas for heating. While emissions from wood
combustion are projected to remain level or decrease, largely due to the
Town’s efforts, emissions associated with motor vehicle travel, including re-
entrained road dust, are projected to rise in step with increased traffic vol-

Environmental Conservation and Sustainability
Like many communities in the Unites States, Truckee has increasingly come
to embrace environmental sustainability and conservation practices. Actions
to minimize impacts on the local and global environment can be performed
in many different ways. Installation of water and energy efficient fixtures,
recycling, and responsible use and disposal of hazardous and toxic household
substances are all activities that can be undertaken by Truckee residents and
businesses on a daily basis.
Interest in other ways to encourage sustainability and decrease impacts on the
environment is also growing. For example, use of “green building” tech-
niques, which incorporate energy efficient design, recycled and non-toxic
building materials, siting and landscaping to maximize passive heating and
cooling opportunities, and incorporation of water efficient systems and land-
scaping, can significantly reduce the environmental impacts of new develop-
ment. New technologies have reduced the cost and increased the feasibility of
alternative fueled vehicles such as those powered by hybrid electric-gasoline
and biodiesel engines. On a wider scale, a sustainable community can be fos-
tered by development patterns that reflect compact, neighborhood-oriented
infill and clustered development that decreases urban sprawl, minimizes loss
of open space and natural resource impacts, and encourages alternative modes
of transportation.
D. Open Space Land Use Designations
This General Plan supports the guiding principles, goals, policies and actions
of the Conservation and Open Space Element by designating certain areas in

8 NOISE ELEMENT
  The purpose of the Noise Element is to identify sources of noise in Truckee
  and to define strategies for reducing the negative impact of noise to the com-
  munity. Noise has become recognized as an environmental pollutant that can
  threaten quality of life and human health by causing annoyance or disrupting
  sleep and everyday activities. With the presence of significant noise sources in
  Truckee, including Interstate 80, the railroad, and the airport, reducing the
  negative impact of unwanted and excessive noise is an important aspect of
  maintaining the Town’s valuable quality of life and community character,
  which includes maintenance of a peaceful mountain environment.
  A.        State Requirements
  State law requires that the General Plan include a Noise Element, which is to    California Government Code
  be prepared according to guidelines adopted by the California Office of Noise    Section 65302(f) defines the re-

  provides a systematic approach to limiting community exposure to noise,          Noise Element.
  including the following components:
    ♦ Quantitative analysis, based on noise measurements and modeling, of ma-
       jor existing and future noise sources in the community, including both
       mobile and stationary sources;
    ♦ Mapping of generalized noise level contours to be used as a basis for land
       use decision-making;
    ♦ Goals, policies and actions to address community exposure to existing
       and projected noise sources.
  This Element is to be used as a guide to identify and mitigate noise problems
  in the Town of Truckee. It establishes uniformity between local policy and
  programs undertaken to control and abate environmental noise. It also serves
  as a guideline for compliance with the State's noise insulation standards.

                                    Noise is generally defined as unwanted sound. The objectionable nature of
                                    sound is caused by its pitch or its loudness. Pitch is the height or depth of a
                                    tone or sound, depending on the relative rapidity (frequency) of the vibra-
                                    tions by which it is produced. Higher pitched signals sound louder to hu-
                                    mans than sounds with a lower pitch. Loudness is caused by the intensity of
                                    sound waves combined with the reception characteristics of the ear. Intensity
                                    may be compared with the height of an ocean wave: it is a measure of the
                                    amplitude of the sound wave.

Beyond the concepts of pitch and loudness, there are several noise measure-
ment scales which are used to describe noise in a particular location. The
most basic noise measurement is the decibel (dB), which is a unit of measure-
ment indicating the relative amplitude of a sound. The zero on the decibel
                                                                                    Generally, the human ear can-
scale is based on the lowest sound level that the healthy, unimpaired human
                                                                                    not perceive a difference between
ear can detect. Sound levels in decibels are calculated on a logarithmic basis.
                                                                                    two noises that are less than
An increase of 10 decibels represents a ten-fold increase in acoustic energy,
                                                                                    three decibels different from one
while 20 decibels is 100 times more intense, 30 decibels is 1,000 times more
                                                                                    another.
intense, etc. Sound measurements are usually taken on an “A-weighted” scale
(represented as dBA) which gives greater weight to the middle range of sounds
to which the human ear is sensitive. Table N-1 describes representative out-
door and indoor noise levels in units of dBA.
Since sensitivity to noise increases during the evening and at night - because
excessive noise interferes with the ability to sleep - 24-hour descriptors have
been developed that incorporate artificial noise penalties added to quiet-time
noise events. The Community Noise Equivalent Level, CNEL, is a measure
of the cumulative noise exposure in a community with a 5 dB penalty added
to evening (7:00 PM - 10:00 PM) and a 10 dB penalty added to nocturnal
(10:00 PM - 7:00 AM) noise levels. The Day/Night Average Sound Level, Ldn,
is essentially the same as CNEL, but only includes the 10 dB penalty for the
10:00 PM to 7:00 AM period. Both CNEL and Ldn represent average noise
levels occurring over a 24-hour period, during which individual noise levels
might be louder or quieter than the average. State law requires that the
Noise Element utilize Ldn or CNEL to describe the noise environment and its
effects.
C.        Truckee’s Existing Noise Environment
As a prerequisite to an effective noise program, a community must be cogni-
zant of the location and extent of local noise problems, including major noise
source locations, noise sensitive receptor locations, and current levels of expo-
sure. This data can be utilized to focus noise control and abatement efforts

be beyond the Town's jurisdiction. However, by recognizing these limita-
tions, more effective land use strategies can be developed to mitigate or avoid
problematic noise.
A comprehensive noise monitoring survey was conducted as part of the Gen-
eral Plan update to document noise generated by the predominant transporta-
tion noise sources that affect Truckee. These noise sources include highways,
local arterial and collector roadways, the Union Pacific Railroad, and the
Truckee-Tahoe Airport. The noise monitoring survey included a combina-
tion of long-term (24-hour duration) and short-term (15-minute duration)
noise measurements throughout the town’s area. Long-term noise measure-
ments characterized the daily distribution of noise levels in areas adjacent to
the predominant noise sources in the community. Short-term noise meas-
urements were conducted at selected locations to supplement the long-term
noise data.
Major existing noise sources in Truckee, and noise levels associated with those
sources are described briefly below. More detailed data concerning the ambi-
ent noise environment in Truckee, based on the noise monitoring survey, can
be found in the General Plan EIR.

timated using the relationships of the peak hour noise level to the CNEL ac-
tually measured.
Noise levels were calculated at a standard distance of 100 feet from the center-
line of the roadways. By selecting a standard distance, the relative noise levels
along the various streets can be readily ascertained. In some cases, measured

                                 noise levels were higher than that which would be expected based on existing
                                 traffic volumes and posted speed limits; this is primarily due to the particular
                                 mix of vehicles on Truckee’s roadways, which includes more four-wheel drive
                                 vehicles or sport-utility vehicles with large mud and snow tires. Other factors
                                 included vehicles traveling faster than posted speed limits along some road-
                                 ways, which also results in higher noise levels. An adjustment was applied in
                                 the existing and future noise modeling to account for these differences.
                                 Noise levels measured along Truckee’s major roadways are as follows:

while train cars generate noise levels of about 70 to 75 dBA at 100 feet from
the railway tracks.
Trains are required to sound their warning whistle near “at-grade” vehicle
crossings (which includes the Bridge Street crossing in Downtown) to warn
motorists of the oncoming train. Oftentimes, trains also sound their warning
whistles when entering or leaving the train station in Downtown Truckee
and at bridges. At a distance of 100 feet, a train warning whistle can generate
maximum noise levels of about 100 to 105 dBA.
Noise measurements along the railroad indicate that, even though they are an
intermittent element, the frequency, duration and loudness of train noise con-
trols the overall average noise level in the vicinity of the tracks during the
course of a day. The resulting noise level, at a distance of 100 feet from the
railroad, is approximately 76 CNEL. This volume includes all noise associ-
ated with the railroad, including the trains themselves, and their whistles.
Truckee-Tahoe Airport
The Truckee-Tahoe airport is a general aviation airport located east of High-
way 267, south of Truckee. The airport is accessed by a mix of general avia-
tion and jet aircraft. The primary flight paths follow the highways in the area
(Interstate 80, Highway 89 North, and Highway 267). Noise generated by
the airport was measured northwest of the airport during the noise monitor-
ing survey. The measured CNEL at the nearest residential land uses was 56
dBA. Individual measurements of maximum instantaneous sounds generated
by aircraft typically ranged from 55 to 71 dBA. During the summer peak
travel season, CNEL noise levels would be approximately 60 dBA at the near-
est residential receivers, which includes homes north of Brockway Road.
Noise complaints from individuals are recorded and reported by the Truckee-
Tahoe Airport District, which operates the Truckee-Tahoe Airport. Of the
197 calls logged between January and April, 2004, almost 70 percent of com-
plaints were received from residents of the Prosser, Ponderosa Palisades and
Sierra Meadows neighborhoods, indicating that these areas of Truckee are
                                                                                8-7

most affected by aircraft noise.1 The Airport District does not have the
power to regulate the flight paths chosen by individual pilots using the air-
port. Instead, the District relies on the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan
(CLUP) and local land use regulations to control sensitive land use in areas
identified as being exposed to aircraft noise. It also attempts to educate pilots
about preferred flight paths that minimize flyovers of residential neighbor-
hoods.
The Foothill Airport Land Use Commission adopted an updated Compre-
hensive Land Use Plan (CLUP), called the Airport Land Use Compatibility
Plan, in December, 2004. The CLUP includes noise contours associated with
aircraft operations that are intended to be used to avoid locating noise sensi-
tive uses in parts of Truckee that are affected by aircraft operations at the air-
port. Public Utilities Code Section 21676 requires Truckee's General Plan to
be in conformance with the land use plan and policies of an adopted CLUP,
unless the Town Council makes specific findings to overrule the CLUP or
portions of it.
Stationary Noise Sources
The Town of Truckee is not significantly affected by stationary noise sources.
Most large noise-generating operations (e.g., aggregate mining) are located
away from residential areas. Noise-generating businesses are generally limited
to commercial or industrial areas where noise does not typically pose com-
patibility problems.
Other stationary noise in Truckee results from temporary and intermittent
sources. Construction and demolition activities may be a source of noise
anywhere in the Town. Although generally short-term and intermittent in
nature, construction noise can be particularly annoying for neighbors, par-
ticularly in the context of a relatively quiet environment like that found in

 many parts of Truckee. At the same time, noise is an unavoidable aspect of
 construction activity. Restrictions on construction hours help to reduce dis-
 ruption from construction noise, while allowing reasonable accommodation
 for construction activity to occur. Domestic noise sources such as loud mu-
 sic, operation of yard maintenance equipment, and barking dogs can also be a
 source of disruption and annoyance for local residents. The Town of
 Truckee, Truckee Police Department, and Truckee Animal Control Division
 have significant powers to address domestic noise sources, which are generally
 dealt with on a complaint basis, relying on the regulations and guidelines set
 forth in Chapter 18.44 of the Development Code.
 D.        Future Noise Environment
 This section describes the projected future noise environment in Truckee
 over the next twenty years. Projection of the future noise environment in
 Truckee was modeled based on the future land uses and traffic volumes de-
 scribed in the Land Use Element and Circulation Element of this General
 Plan and in the General Plan EIR.
Construction activity can be a significant source of community noise.
                                                                                        8-9

Anticipated train noise was taken from existing levels, since it is not possible
to predict if future levels of train activity will increase, remain the same, or
decrease.
The major noise sources in Truckee will continue to be transportation re-
lated, including roadways, trains, and aircraft. To a lesser degree, industrial
sources such as mining and aggregate processing operations will also continue
to generate noise. Transportation noise sources, as well as individual station-
ary and industrial noise generators, must be considered in the planning proc-
ess to ensure long-term noise compatibility. Greater detail on the future
noise environment in Truckee can be found in the General Plan EIR.
The increase in noise levels from existing conditions to future conditions
identifies those locations where anticipated noise impacts may occur. The
greatest increases in noise are projected in the downtown area and along
Highway 89, Highway 267, and Brockway Road. Noise levels along these
roadways are estimated to increase by about 2 to 5 dBA with the build-out of
the General Plan. Noise levels along Interstate 80 are estimated to increase by
about 2 dBA during the same period. Figure N-1 maps the future noise con-
tours associated with area roadways and the railroad based on distance from
the roadway/railroad centerline. These distances are summarized in Table
N-2. Sensitive receptors adjacent to these roadways within these contour areas
may be impacted by future traffic noise. This is particularly true with older
homes that take direct access from the roadway or where individuals in out-
door activity areas such as front or rear yards and porches can see directly to
vehicles driving behind their homes, with no intervening barriers. It is pro-
jected that many existing residences may be exposed to future noise levels
exceeding 60 CNEL, particularly those in neighborhoods north of Interstate
80, in the Downtown and the Gateway area, and in proximity to Truckee's
other highways and major arterials. These residences would experience ele-
vated interior noise levels that would need to be addressed.
Airport noise contours, illustrated in Figure N-2, also show a substantial in-
crease under future conditions. Under average day, peak season conditions,

significantly affected by airport noise, and must therefore be addressed by the

compatibility of a range of noise levels for various land use categories. These
guidelines are used by the Town of Truckee to create both interior and exte-

  Natural and man-made hazards exist throughout California, including in the
  Town of Truckee. The Safety Element of the General Plan seeks to protect
  the community to the extent possible against risks to life and property from
  local environmental hazards, and to empower local residents to be ready and
  responsive in the event of a natural disaster.
  The Safety Element is among the seven General Plan elements required by
  State law. It identifies and evaluates the complete range of natural and hu-
  man-made hazards present in Truckee, and establishes goals, policies and ac-
  tions to reduce those hazards to an acceptable level. Topics addressed by this
  element include:
    ♦ Geologic hazards, including seismically induced surface rupture, ground
       shaking, ground failure and subsidence, and slope instability.
    ♦ Flooding and seiche.
    ♦ Wildland and urban fires.
    ♦ Snow avalanches.
    ♦ Hazardous materials.
    ♦ Airport and aviation safety.
  This element also addresses more general issues of public education and emer-
  gency preparedness, emphasizing proactive measures that can be taken to
  minimize exposure to hazards, and to ensure effective response and recovery.
  A. Background Information
  This section briefly summarizes conditions relating to hazards that are pre-
  sent in Truckee, as background to the goals, actions and policies described in
  sections that follow.

                                            viders are adequately prepared to respond to emergency situa-

                                 Geology and Seismic Hazards
                                 Geologic hazards present within the Truckee Town limits are primarily asso-
                                 ciated with seismic activity, and with steep slope areas that may be subject to
                                 landslides in conjunction with seismic activity and/or weak soils.
                                 Seismic Hazards
                                 As with most places in California, Truckee is subject to some hazard from
                                 seismic activity, although this risk is relatively low compared to other places

                                 A 1986 study by the California Bureau of Reclamation concluded that the
                                 Dog Valley Fault and Mohawk Valley Faults could result in a maximum
                                 credible earthquake of 6.75 and 7.0 magnitude respectively.

There has been seismic activity felt in Truckee in recent years, including a
magnitude 6+ earthquake in 1966, a magnitude 3.6 earthquake in 1998, and a
magnitude 4.5 earthquake, centered six miles south of Truckee, in June,
20041. Figure SAF-1 shows the location of known earthquake faults and epi-
centers in Nevada County.
Steep Slopes
Steep slopes (thirty percent or greater), limit development in several areas of
Town, including some places along the Truckee River, the ridges and hillsides
north and west of Downtown, the ridges north of Gateway and north and
west of Donner Lake, and areas around Alder Hill. These steep slope areas,
particularly where they occur in conjunction with weak soils, may present a
significant hazard in Truckee, although no detailed study has been completed
for landslide hazard in Nevada County.
Hydrology and Flooding
Flooding is a serious concern in several parts of Truckee, particularly within
those areas identified as falling within Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) 100-year flood zones. These include areas around the Don-
ner Lake shore, along Donner Creek, lower Trout Creek, and Cold Creek,
and along the Truckee River. Along the Truckee River, the 100-year flood
zone extends as far as 300 feet from the banks of the river. Areas of Truckee
within these flood zones are shown in Figure SAF-2.
Three dams, located at Prosser Reservoir, Boca Reservoir and Stampede Res-
ervoir, are located just north of Truckee. A smaller dam is also located at
Donner Lake, and another at Martis Creek Lake, south of the town. While
each of these dams has the potential to fail and to release a volume of water
that could result in severe short-term flooding, Truckee would not be signifi-
cantly affected by potential inundation. Based on recent modeling completed
by the US Bureau of Reclamation, maximum outflow from a failure of the
Prosser, Boca and Stampede dams would back-flow upstream into the

Truckee River about two miles from their associated confluences, and would
be contained in the main channel of the Truckee River between three and five
miles from their source, depending on which dam provides the source. Fail-
ure of the Prosser Dam would result in backflow to about half a mile down-
stream of the Truckee sewage plant (about 3.5 miles from Downtown
Truckee). It is anticipated that a segment of I-80 and the railroad, near the
confluence of Prosser Creek in the Truckee River Canyon would be inun-
dated by such a failure. Failure of the Stampede Dam or Boca Dam would
result in backflow to the confluence of Prosser Creek, about five miles south
of Downtown. 2
Inundation from dam failure at Donner Lake is not considered to pose a seri-
ous threat to Truckee, given the relatively small volume of water contained in
Donner Lake (approximately 9,500 acre feet, compared to about 41,000 acre
feet in Boca Reservoir alone). The California Department of Water Re-
sources is undertaking improvements to the Donner Lake Dam, which should
provide additional safeguards against seismically-induced failure.
A seiche is a stationary wave, associated with a lake or semi-enclosed body of
water usually caused by strong winds and/or changes in barometric pressure.
Although Donner Lake is located in Truckee, and a number of reservoirs are
nearby, the risk of flooding associated with seiche is considered minimal, due
to the relatively low levels of seismic activity locally, and the small size of
these water bodies.
Snow Avalanche
The degree of potential hazard from snow avalanche in Truckee is related to a
number of localized conditions, including steepness of slope, exposure, snow
pack composition, recent weather factors such as wind, temperature, and rate
of snowfall and other interacting factors. Three avalanche hazard areas

are mapped in Truckee; these are shown in Figure SAF-3. They include an
area at the west end of Donner Lake, and another south of the lake just west
of the Donner Memorial State Park, as well as a smaller area at the southeast
edge of Tahoe Donner.
Wildfire
The entire Truckee area is considered to be in a high fire hazard severity
zone, as defined by the California Department of Forestry (CDF), although
risks are particularly pronounced in certain parts of the community, particu-
larly where homes are located within areas of dense vegetation and forest
land, and where steep slopes and other similar conditions exist. Calculation
of threat from wildfire hazard is based on a number of combining factors in-
cluding fuel loading (vegetation), topography, and climatic conditions such as
winds, humidity and temperature. Figure SAF-4 shows areas of potential risk
from wildland fire, based on the proximity of population density to those
areas most likely to be at risk due to prevailing physical and climatic condi-
tions.

S A F E T Y E L E M E N T
Residents of Truckee's rural residential areas may be at greater risk from wild-
land fire hazard due to access difficulties for fire-fighting equipment and per-
sonnel in more remote areas, narrow rural roads, and hilly terrain.
The Truckee Fire Protection District was an active participant in the devel-
opment of the Nevada County Fire Plan, which was accepted in May 2005.
The Fire Plan includes an extensive series of recommendations aimed at re-
ducing wildland fire risk in the County, including fuel management and de-
fensible space enforcement strategies, public education, infrastructure im-
provements to increase fire-fighting capacity, and coordination with local fire
agencies in ensuring consistent and effective wildland fire mitigation efforts.
Hazardous Materials
Hazardous materials include a wide variety of substances commonly used in
households and businesses. Used motor oil, paint, solvents, lawn care and
gardening products, household cleaners, gasoline and refrigerants are among
the diverse range of substances classified as hazardous materials. Nearly all
businesses and residences generate some amount of hazardous waste; certain
businesses and industries generate larger amounts of such substances, includ-
ing gas stations, automotive service and repair shops, printers, dry cleaners
and photo processors. Hospitals, clinics and laboratories generate medical
waste, which is also potentially hazardous.
Use, storage and transportation of hazardous wastes is heavily regulated by
federal, State and local agencies, including the California Department of
Toxic Substances Control, which is authorized to implement the regulations
of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. The Nevada County Envi-
ronmental Health Department monitors commercial storage and use of haz-
ardous materials, including issuing permits for use and storage of significant
quantities of hazardous materials or substances.
Airport Safety
The Truckee-Tahoe Airport, which is owned and operated by the Truckee
Tahoe Airport District, is located outside of Truckee Town limits, straddling

the boundary between Nevada and Placer Counties. It is a General Aviation
facility that serves as a regional center for private and charter aviation activ-
ity. As with all airports built in proximity to urbanized areas, maintaining
land uses compatible with safe airport operations is an important considera-
tion.
The Foothill Airport Land Use Commission adopted an updated Compre-
hensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) in December, 2004. The CLUP describes a
                                                                                      The CLUP is titled the Airport

development around the Truckee Tahoe Airport that are intended to safe-
guard against development that is incompatible with airport operations. As
noted elsewhere in this General Plan, Public Utilities Code Section 21676
requires Truckee's General Plan to be in conformance with the land use plan
and policies of an adopted CLUP, unless the Town Council makes specific
findings to overrule the CLUP or portions of it.

  eral Plan also includes polices to guide the annexation of land within the
  Town’s proposed Sphere of Influence from Nevada County’s jurisdiction to
  the Town of Truckee.
  The Land Use Element seeks to fulfill the Vision for Truckee in a number of
  ways. The Element will help to shape the Town's form and character over
  coming decades, by providing a framework for orderly patterns of growth
  and development in Truckee, and by ensuring an appropriate distribution or
  mixture of land uses occurs. It designates land that can accommodate a vari-
  ety of housing types, provide for a diverse range of economic activities, and
  support critical public, open space and recreation uses. The Element also
  gives more detailed guidance for parts of the Town that are likely to undergo
  significant change in the future, and that are of particular concern to the local
  community, including the two undeveloped Planned Community Areas,
  McIver Hill, Downtown Truckee, and the Gateway area, among others.
  Guiding Principles for the Land Use Element are shown on the following
  pages.

 Land Use Element Guiding Principles, Continued
 Discourage future subdivision of estate type parcels (2.5 to
   10 acre parcel sizes) within the Town boundaries outside of
   existing rural subdivisions.
 In order to provide opportunities for infill development and
   help fund the need for a secondary access road out of Tahoe
   Donner, maintain allowed residential densities on 700 acres
   southeast of Tahoe Donner.
 Prevent "commercial sprawl” in Truckee.
 Improve the character and visual quality of development in
   the Gateway area, along the Brockway Road corridor, and
   along the Truckee River in the Downtown Study Area.
 Prevent the negative visual impact of mass parking lots and
   large single building forms.
 Promote mixed-use development in Commercial areas. The
   mix can include office, residential, service and/or retail uses.
 Ensure adequate provision of public services and infrastruc-
   ture to support planned residential and non-residential de-
   velopment in suitable locations.

A. State Law Requirements
As required by California Government Code Section 65302(a) and Public
Resources Code Section 2762(a), the Land Use Element of the General Plan
addresses the following issues:
  ♦ Distribution, location and extent of the uses of land for housing, busi-
     ness, industry, open space, natural resources, recreation and enjoyment of
     scenic beauty, education, public buildings and grounds, and other catego-
     ries of public and private uses of land.
  ♦ Standards of population density and building intensity for the land use
     designations.
In addition to these issues, the Land Use Element also contains goals and poli-
cies related to the provision of adequate public services and infrastructure to
serve the needs of Truckee’s population as it continues to grow.
The Land Use Element is also required to address solid and liquid waste dis-
posal facilities. No solid waste disposal facilities exist or are proposed in the
Town of Truckee. Water treatment facilities operated by the Truckee-Tahoe
Sanitary Agency are located in the extensive public lands northeast of the
Airport, south of the Truckee River. A policy addressing potential future
expansion of these facilities is included in Section G, below.
B. Existing Land Use
Existing land use patterns in Truckee are reflective of the historic develop-
ment patterns of the community, the legacy of land use planning that oc-
curred under Nevada County's jurisdiction, prior to Truckee's incorporation,
and the more recent policies established through the Town's own land use

policy framework. Table LU-1 details how much land within the Town lim-
its is taken up by each major type of land use.1
As shown in the table, about thirty percent of the land within the Town lim-
its is vacant or undeveloped, and another 25 percent is in open space uses,
including parks and recreation areas, Donner Lake, golf courses, permanent
open space easements, and forestry lands. Remaining land within the Town
limits is developed in some form, as described below:
  ♦ Residential. Residential uses comprise about 25 percent of land within
      the town limits, accommodating about 10,800 housing units. Of this,
      the vast majority is single family housing. Housing areas are spread
      throughout the Town, in Downtown Truckee, and the Donner Lake and
      Gateway areas, and in a series of residential subdivisions that include Ta-
      hoe Donner, Glenshire Devonshire, the Prosser Lake neighborhoods,
      Olympic Heights, and Sierra Meadows. Multi-family housing comprises
      about three percent of residential land use in terms of area, but represents
      about 13 percent of the total housing stock in Truckee. Multi-family
      residential development is concentrated in locations closer to the Town
      center, primarily in southeast Truckee neighborhoods along the Brock-
      way Road corridor, and in Gateway. Several multi-family developments,
      primarily condominium projects, are located in the Donner Lake area
      and along Northwoods Boulevard in Tahoe Donner. There are four ma-
      jor mobile home parks in Truckee, one along Brockway Road, one at the
      west end of West River Street, one northwest of the Interstate
      80/Highway 89 North intersection, and one in the Gateway area.
  ♦   Commercial. Commercial uses, including both retail and office devel-
      opment, comprise approximately four percent of all developed land in
           1
             In this table, acreage totals for parcels categorized in the residential, com-
mercial, industrial and public categories count the entire parcel as being in that use,
even if only a small proportion of that parcel is built upon or developed.
                                                                                        2-5

      Truckee. The majority of commercial uses in Truckee are concentrated
      in the Downtown area and in the Gateway commercial district. Smaller
      retail commercial centers are located elsewhere in the town, including
      the Crossroads Plaza south of the Interstate 80/Highway 89 South inter-
      section, and neighborhood centers along Donner Pass Road in Donner
      Lake, on Glenshire Drive on the west side of the Glenshire neighbor-
      hood, and along Northwoods Boulevard in Tahoe Donner. Brockway

     Road has an assortment of commercial uses, including both retail and of-
     fice use, along its length. Larger commercial developments in this area
     include the Martis Village commercial center at the intersection of Pali-
     sades Drive and a cluster of office development located near the airport,
     just north of the Placer County line. The Pioneer Commerce Center,
     located at the east end of Pioneer trail, houses a number of professional
     offices and service commercial uses.
 ♦ Industrial. Industrial uses comprise a very small percentage of total land
    use (approximately 80 acres) in Truckee. The largest industrial areas in
    Truckee are located around the Tahoe-Truckee Airport and in the newer
    Pioneer Commerce Center along Pioneer Trail north of I-80. Older in-
    dustrial uses are located in central Truckee adjacent the railroad, and
    along West River Street.
 ♦ Public/Institutional. Existing (non-open space) public/institutional
    land uses in Truckee include schools, government and utilities offices and
    facilities, the Tahoe Forest Hospital, and a number of churches and reli-
    gious institutions. A number of these uses are concentrated along the
    west end of Donner Pass Road in the Gateway Area; Truckee's Town
    Hall and Police Department are both accommodated within the of-
    fice/light industrial area near the Airport, while other community-
    serving facilities are located within neighborhood areas.
 ♦ Other Land Uses. Other major land uses not included among those de-
    scribed above include land dedicated to infrastructure such as roads and
    the railway, which accounts for approximately 13 percent of all land
    within the Town limit, and the mining operations in the southeast part
    of Truckee, which cover about 200 acres.
C. General Plan Land Use Designations: Introduction and Overview

                                   Truckee. These land use designations set forth the Town’s desired outcome
                                   for the type and intensity of use for each area mapped.
                                   This section of this Element describes the land use designations applicable to
                                   the area within the Town limits; Section D describes land use designations for
                                   a number of areas within Truckee where special planning consideration is
                                   applied; and Section E describes Areas of Special Consideration such as
                                   Planned Community Areas. Section F describes designations in the areas out-
                                   side the Town limits but within the proposed Sphere of Influence. The
                                   Town limit line and proposed sphere are shown in Figure I-2 in Chapter 1.
                                   For each land use designation, the uses allowed and the standards of density
                                   and intensity are specified. Other policies relating to these land use designa-
                                   tions are found in Section G of this Land Use Element and throughout the
                                   General Plan. The amounts of land in each land use designation are shown in
                                   Table LU-2.
                                   Development Density and Intensity
                                   A range of development density and intensity is assigned for each land use.
                                   Densities and intensities in all cases are based on gross acres.
Population density for residential Development intensity for residential land uses is reflected as an average

                                   number of dwelling units per acre; stated density standards for residential uses
through the following formula:
                                   do not include secondary units, which are allowed with a primary single fam-
Population Density = (Dwelling     ily dwelling unit. For planning purposes, except in the High Density Resi-
Units per Acre *1.2 * 2.63) * 0.54 dential designation, one unit in every five is assumed to have a secondary
                                   unit, resulting in an effective allowed density that is 20 percent greater than
                                   the maximum stated. Estimated population density for all land use designa-
                                   tions allowing residential uses is to be based on the average household size in
                                   Truckee in 2004, which is 2.63 persons per household. To account for the
                                   proportion of dwelling units in Truckee that are used as second homes, a fac-
                                   tor of 0.54 is applied to the total population density derived from the above

Note: Total land area shown differs from that shown in Table LU-1 because land use designa-
tion areas include some (but not all) roads, and do not include Donner Lake. Open space lands
have been and will be approved in many of the non-open space land use designations. These
open space lands are not noted in this table and are in addition to the lands in the Open Space
Recreation and Resource Conservation/Open Space land use designations.

For non-residential uses, including commercial, industrial and public land
uses, intensity is expressed as an average Floor Area Ratio (FAR). FAR is
calculated based on total building floor area in proportion to the total size of
the building’s lot.
Densities and intensities shown for each designation reflect an average for the
entire Town. For example, where a Residential land use category has a den-
sity of 1 unit per acre, individual projects or zoning on individual parcels may
be at a higher or lower density, while all land uses within that category
Town-wide will average 1 unit per acre. For non-residential land uses, where
the allowed intensity can average 0.20 FAR, an individual project may have a
higher or lower FAR, while the average intensity Town-wide would be 0.20.
Higher densities and intensities relative to other lands carrying the same des-
ignation are allowed on lands with fewer environmental constraints and with
available services such as sewer, public water, and public roads, as well as on
lands closer to or in existing developed areas, such as infill properties. Indi-
vidual projects may be allowed at higher densities if they provide community
benefits (e.g. affordable housing, public open space) above that which would
be ordinarily required for the project. Lower densities and intensities are al-
lowed on lands that have environmental constraints such as steep slopes and
wetlands; lands which are served by wells and/or septic systems; and lands
which are further from the existing developed core of the Town.
Zoning classifications will be applied through the Development Code to im-
plement the General Plan Land Use Designations and to further specify ap-
propriate densities and intensities in specific areas.
Areas for Special Consideration
The General Plan identifies a number of areas for special consideration when
planning for future development. These include the following:
  ♦ Special Study Area. One Special Study Area has been designated for a
     site with particular constraints or community concern regarding future
2-12

                                                       T O W N O F T R U C K E E

     development. Additional study and community consultation will be re-
     quired when any development is proposed in this area.
  ♦ Planned Community Areas. These Planned Community Areas include
     two large sites for which Specific Plans will need to be prepared and ap-
     proved for any proposed development plan.
  ♦ Specific Plan and other Plan Areas. This designation is applied to areas
     that are the subject of an existing Specific Plan or area for a planned com-
     munity. Examples include the Downtown Specific Plan Area, Tahoe
     Donner Plan Area, and the Gray’s Crossing Specific Plan Area (formerly
     Planned Community 2).
  ♦ Overlay Designations. Seven areas with additional requirements be-
     yond those included in the basic land use designations have been defined
     in this General Plan. These overlay designations encompass areas with
     unique conditions that call for additional policy guidance to supplement
     that provided by underlying land use designations. The location of over-
     lay designations is shown in Figure LU-2.
Each of these special areas is described in Section E of the Land Use Element.
D. Land Use Designations within Town Limits
The following designations apply to lands within Town limits, as mapped in
Figure LU-1. Abbreviations used for the various land use designations in the
Land Use Map and elsewhere in the General Plan are shown in parentheses
after the name of each designation listed below.
Open Space Designations
General Plan Land Use Designations under this heading are intended to pre-
serve Truckee’s important open space areas and the key benefits they provide
to the community in terms of natural resources, preservation of biological
resources, passive and active recreation, and preservation of scenic values.

Open space is generally defined as land that is essentially undeveloped and
devoted to any of the uses defined in the Conservation and Open Space Ele-
ment. Detailed definitions of open space types, and prioritization of open
space as it pertains to the open space requirement for new development, are
provided in the Conservation and Open Space Element.
Resource Conservation/Open Space [RC/OS]
This land use designation is applied to areas containing significant natural
resources, including:
  ♦ Forest land and rangeland
  ♦ Open space uses such as bikeways, trails, access to the Truckee River and
     other public areas
  ♦ Lands with environmentally sensitive features such as important wildlife
     habitat, wetlands and wildlife movement corridors
  ♦ Areas containing significant scenic vistas
  ♦ Areas containing important mineral resources
Open Space Recreation [OSR]
This land use designation is applied to areas where developed recreational uses
would be compatible with the natural resources in the area. This designation
is intended to minimize suburban and rural residential sprawl; to protect sig-
nificant vistas, wildlife movement corridors, biological resource areas; and to
accommodate recreational uses. Lands designated OSR serve as a buffer be-
tween the more intensive development in the Gray’s Crossing Specific Plan
Area and the RC/OS uses in the eastern portion of Town. This designation
differs from the RC/OS designation in that it allows for more intensive, clus-
tered recreational/residential development where appropriate.
Land Uses Allowed: Land uses allowed under this designation are recreational
uses that are compatible with the natural surroundings, such as skiing, camp-
ing, existing and currently approved golf courses, horseback riding, as well as
clustered residential or lodging uses.
                                                                              2-15

Public and Quasi-Public Land Uses
The land use designations under this heading are intended to provide oppor-
tunities for a wide range of public and quasi-public uses, including local and
County government services, public parks, educational facilities, and facilities
associated with provision of community services and infrastructure.
Public [PUB]
This land use designation is applied to areas under public ownership by local,
regional, State and federal government agencies.

Public, Hospital/Office [PUB (H/O)]
This land use designation applies to areas occupied by the Tahoe Forest Hos-
pital, associated private offices, and public offices in the same area, as well as
existing residential uses within the immediate vicinity of the facilities. It also
applies to the area immediately west of the hospital, to allow for possible ex-
pansion of the hospital and/or development of new medical office uses in this
area.
Land Uses Allowed: Land uses allowed in this designation are hospital facili-
ties and associated and related public and private offices, along with some
residential uses.
Density and Intensity: An average Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 0.20 shall apply.
Zoning districts to implement this category shall accommodate mixed resi-
dential/office uses in appropriate areas, and accommodate intensification or
expansion of hospital-related uses in proximity to the hospital.
Industrial and Commercial Land Use Designations
The land use designations under this heading are intended to provide oppor-
tunities for a diverse range of industrial and commercial uses, to provide em-
ployment opportunities, and to serve the commercial and service needs of
Truckee’s resident and visitor population.
Industrial [IND]
This land use designation is applied to some areas of existing industrial uses
and to areas determined appropriate for new industrial development based on
their proximity to existing industrial development and major transportation
facilities, and their distance from potential land use conflicts. Additional
lands, beyond those where existing industrial development is located, are des-
ignated Industrial in order to provide appropriate places for relocation of in-
dustrial uses now located near Downtown along the Truckee River, and to
accommodate projected industrial growth.

Rail Transportation Corridor [RTC]
This designation includes all areas within the Union Pacific Railroad right-of-

Residential Land Use Designations
Land use designations under this heading include residential uses at a variety
of densities, intended to provide a range of housing opportunities and types
throughout the town.
Development within all residential land use designations is required to be
clustered and clustering shall be considered a high priority in all projects.
Clustered residential uses are those located on a portion of a site, with the
remainder of the site essentially free of development, i.e. primarily including
only those uses that do not involve structures or significant paved areas.
Clustering shall be planned so as to protect areas of significant resources, to
avoid areas of significant hazard, and to maximize preservation of open space
areas. The type, location and quality of open space areas preserved through
clustering shall be considered an integral and primary element in the overall
site planning for a project, and may necessitate residential project design that
includes smaller units or lot size in order to accommodate clustering. Types
of open space to be prioritized for preservation through clustering are defined
in detail in the Conservation and Open Space Element. Areas preserved in
open space shall be included as part of the area considered in calculating den-
sity.

clustered low-density development, such as the area east of the Sierra Mead-
ows subdivision.
The RC-10 designation applies to subdivisions which have existing lots in the
8 to 15-acre size range, and to areas which would be appropriate for clustered
development in this density range, such as the area between Tahoe Donner
and Highway 89 North.
New subdivisions outside of existing subdivided areas under the RC-5 and
RC-10 designations will be required to cluster development away from envi-
ronmentally sensitive or constrained development areas, to minimize infra-
structure costs and minimize environmental impacts, and to maximize open
space preservation. As noted above, policies relating to clustered develop-
ment are applicable to development in areas under the RC-5 and RC-10 des-
ignation. These policies are included under Goal LU-7 of this Element, in the
Conservation and Open Space Element, and in the Safety Element.

Special Study Area 1: McIver Hill [SSA-1]
This designation applies to an 83-acre area located at the southeast corner of
the intersection of Interstate 80 and Highway 89 South.
Land Uses Allowed: While more study of this area will be necessary before it
can be developed, land uses allowed in this area may include institutional uses,
including a community college campus; open space for passive recreation,
preservation of habitat and scenic values; and certain commercial uses. These
commercial uses may include limited retail development uses associated with
an educational institution, an office park, or a destination resort. Limited
clustered residential uses may also permitted.
Density and Intensity: A maximum development density of 50 housing units
and intensity of 80,000 square feet of commercial or institutional uses shall
apply. The development would be limited to areas of the site not constrained
by topography or other environmental concerns, which is likely to be a
maximum developable area of about 22.5 acres.
Policies: The following policies apply to SSA-1:
     SSA1-P1      Development of an educational facility or college campus on
                  the McIver Hill site shall be supported, provided such a use
                  meets other important goals and policies of the General
                  Plan.
     SSA1-P2      Any development in SSA-1 shall respect views of the site
                  and shall be designed to be visually unobtrusive and harmo-
                  nious with the site’s wooded open space character.
     SSA1-P3      New buildings should generally be clustered on the flatter,
                  less visible areas at the top of the hill. Steeply sloping areas
                  on the site’s edges and the base of the hill should be avoided.
     SSA1-P4      Provision of adequate access to this site is a concern. Pri-
                  mary access should be provided from the intersection of
                                                                               2-25

                                   the General Plan, would not result in the need for four lanes on Donner Pass
                                   Road or result in conditions on Donner Pass Road worse than LOS D. Poli-
                                   cies addressing this issue are found in the Circulation Element.
                                   Land Uses Allowed: Land uses allowed in this designation are a mixture of
                                   medium-density, clustered residential uses; commercial uses, including visitor
                                   lodging; and open space for passive recreation and preservation of scenic and
                                   habitat values.
                                   Density and Intensity: The maximum amount of development allowed (of
                                   housing units and square feet of non-residential development), is shown in
                                   Table LU-3. A total of 50 acres is assigned for development of all allowed

that exist over much of the site’s area. This acreage is a guideline to be used
in Specific Plan development, and may vary based on the results of detailed
studies completed prior to site development.
Policies: The following policies will guide development of the Specific Plan for
PC-1.
     PC1-P1        The Specific Plan shall include policies and design measures
                   to ensure that development on the site shall be compatible
                   with, and shall not adversely affect the historic or natural
                   character of Donner Memorial State Park.
     PC1-P2        The Specific Plan shall provide adequate setbacks from Cold
                   Creek, Donner Creek, and other riparian/wetland areas.

                   in the near term as an emergency access only. The roadway         Element.
                   shall be designed to discourage use of the road as a cut-
                   through route for non-local traffic.
     PC1-P4        Land uses on the site shall include visitor-serving commer-
                   cial uses and other uses which promote or accommodate
                   tourism as well as commercial uses serving local needs. In
                   order to encourage the development of housing in prox-
                   imity to employment centers, the Specific Plan shall include
                   policies designed to provide for the development of afford-
                   able housing by allowing for mixed uses at appropriate den-
                   sities.
                                                                                2-27

                   ter goals and policies for the Brockway Road Corridor.
     PC3-P8        Ensure that the mix of land uses in the PC-3 Specific Plan
                   will generate an amount of traffic that, in addition to
                   buildout of the General Plan (considering all planned circu-
                   lation improvements), would not result in the need for four
                   lanes on Highway 267 between Interstate 80 and the Brock-
                   way Road/Soaring Way intersection.
Plan Areas
Three Plan Areas are designated in the General Plan. These are the Down-
town Specific Plan Area, the Gray’s Crossing Specific Plan Area, and the Ta-
hoe Donner Plan Area. A Specific Plan or Area Plan exists for each of these
areas and provides detailed land use mapping, goals and policy direction.
Downtown Specific Plan Area [DSPA]
The Downtown Specific Plan Area includes an approximately one square
mile area encompassing Truckee’s historic core, which is the subject of ongo-
ing special study and planning. A Specific Plan was adopted for the Down-
town Area in 1997; the Specific Plan will be amended as necessary to reflect
the goals, actions and policies in this General Plan Update. Additionally,
policies specifically related to the Downtown Specific Plan Area are found in
this section, under Goal LU-6 of the Land Use Element, and under Goal CC-
6 and CC-7 of the Community Character Element.
Land Uses Allowed: This designation allows commercial, industrial, public and
residential uses, and mixed use commercial and residential uses.
                                                                               2-31

Tahoe Donner Plan Area [Tahoe Donner PA]
The Tahoe Donner Plan Area designation recognizes the existing approved
Tahoe Donner community.
Land Uses Allowed: This designation allows buildout of the land uses put in
place for Tahoe Donner prior to the Town's incorporation, as reflected in the
master development plan classifications for the Tahoe Donner planned com-
munity. Such uses include single-family homes, condominiums in clustered
development areas, neighborhood serving-commercial uses, and recreational
facilities. Major changes to the approved land uses for the Tahoe Donner
Plan Area, as reflected in the existing zoning for Tahoe Donner, will require
changes to the Tahoe Donner Codes, Covenants and Restrictions (CC&Rs).
Density and Intensity: Buildout of the Tahoe Donner planned community is
estimated to result in a total of 7,000 housing units and 70,000 square feet of
non-residential uses, which would be mostly recreational facilities.
                                                                               2-37

Policies: The following policies apply to Tahoe-Donner.
     TD-P1.        Land uses, activities and future development at Tahoe-
                   Donner shall take place consistent with the approved master
                   development plan for the community.
     TD-P2.        Major changes in the approved land uses, activities or site
                   plan for Tahoe Donner will be reviewed for consistency
                   with the community’s CC&Rs.
     TD-P3.        Encourage neighborhood services and commercial uses in
                   Tahoe Donner which could reduce vehicle trips into town.
                   Recognizing the limited amount of land available for such
                   uses, require applications for new commercial development
                   to demonstrate an ability to provide goods and services to
                   Tahoe Donner residents.
     TD-P4.        The Town encourages the Tahoe Donner Association to
                   change its CC&Rs to allow second units, consistent with
                   State law.
     TD-P5.        Minimize conflicts between residential and recreational us-
                   ers in Tahoe Donner and protect the natural resource values
                   of Tahoe Donner including Trout Creek and Alder Creek.
                   Support the efforts of the Tahoe Donner Association, Tahoe
                   Donner residents, and others in implementing this policy.
Overlay Designations
This General Plan includes seven overlay designations, as follows:
  ♦ Three Neighborhood Areas: for Donner Lake, Gateway and the Brock-
     way Road Corridor.
  ♦ Three additional sites where specific additional policy guidance for devel-
     opment applies.

     States Forest Service.
In each case, allowed land uses are those specified in the underlying designa-
tion, except as described below. Overlay designations are mapped in Figure
LU-2.
Donner Lake Neighborhood Area
The Donner Lake Neighborhood Area has been designated to address the
unique mix and character of land uses in the area surrounding Donner Lake.
Land Uses Allowed: Land uses allowed in this designation are residential, com-
mercial, mixed residential/commercial uses, and public/institutional uses.
Residential land use designations within the Donner Lake Neighborhood
Area are shown on the Land Use Map. Within the Donner Lake Neighbor-
hood Area, commercial and mixed commercial/residential uses may be al-
lowed in Residential designations through site specific planning and zoning.
Appropriate commercial uses include neighborhood and resort commercial
uses, restaurants, sports stores, hotels, motels, and inns located in or close to
existing commercial areas.
Density and Intensity: Residential densities within this designation range from
0.5 to 6 housing units per acre.
Zoning districts to implement this category shall accommodate a range of
densities based on environmental constraints, existing development patterns,
the need to accommodate duplexes, multi-family housing and mixed commer-
cial uses in appropriate locations, and the potential for new clustered subdivi-
sions on larger undeveloped lots.
Policies: The following policies guide development in the Donner Lake
Neighborhood Area.
                                                                               2-39

     DL-P1.       Recognize the historic and recreational character of the
                  Donner Lake Neighborhood Area by accommodating a mix
                  of residential, recreational, and commercial uses in the Resi-
                  dential and Commercial land use categories:
                  ♦     Accommodate publicly accessible uses such as restau-
                        rants, parks, and other recreational facilities along the
                        lakefront.
                  ♦     Locate new commercial uses in areas which are easily
                        accessible by both vehicles and pedestrians and which
                        minimize impacts on residences.
                  ♦     Ensure new discretionary development minimizes vis-
                        ual impacts, particularly to views across the lake and to
                        adjacent hillsides and ridges beyond, is visually com-
                        patible with existing development, and does not appear
                        out of scale with parcel sizes and adjacent development.
     DL-P2.       Cooperate with the Truckee-Donner Recreation and Park
                  District, the State Department of Parks and Recreation, and
                  the residents at Donner Lake in planning for Donner Lake
                  to minimize conflicts between residential and recreational
                  uses and to protect the natural resource values of the lake.
Policies under Goal CC-16 in the Community Character Element are also
applicable to the Donner Lake Neighborhood Area.
Gateway Neighborhood Area
The Gateway Neighborhood Area overlay designation has been applied in
recognition of the role of the Gateway Area as a central hub of the commu-
nity, with a rich mixture of residential, commercial and public uses. The fo-
cus of the Gateway Neighborhood Area is the Donner Pass Road corridor,
one of the most important thoroughfares in Truckee.

Land Uses Allowed: Land uses allowed in this designation are those uses per-
mitted in the underlying land use designations. These include residential,
commercial, public, and commercial/residential mixed use land uses, as well
as quasi-public uses associated with the Tahoe Forest Hospital and other
medical facilities. Appropriate uses include public facilities such as schools,
government offices, and community recreation and arts facilities; residential
uses of a range of residential types and densities including medium and high
density housing; retail and office uses; and mixed use development.
Density and Intensity: Residential designations, as shown in the Land Use
Map, allow development at densities ranging from one to twelve units per
acre. Commercial uses are allowed at an average FAR of 0.2.
Policies: Policies in this section are intended to provide guidance for future
development and improvements for the Gateway area along the Donner Pass
Road corridor. These policies are intended to recognize and build upon the
centrality and community importance of the Gateway area, and particularly
to enhance its character, livability, walkability, and safety for pedestrians and
cyclists. Policies under Goal CC-8 in the Community Character Element
also apply to the Gateway Area.
     GW-P1.        Ensure that new development and land uses support the fol-
                   lowing goals for the Gateway Area:
                   ♦   An attractive streetscape.
                   ♦   Adequate landscaping and street trees.
                   ♦   Uses and design that encourage community activity and
                       street life, including new civic and public spaces.

                  to reflect the qualities listed in Policy GW-P1, above, and
                  work with public agencies and districts with facilities in the
                  area to improve the visual quality of their street frontages.
     GW-P3.       Maintain the existing cross-section of Donner Pass Road at
                  three lanes (two lanes plus a center turn lane).
     GW-P4.       Develop an urban design plan for the Gateway Area that re-
                  flects the above aspects and those described under Goal CC-
                  8 in the Community Character Element.
Policy P6.3 and Action A6.6 under Goal LU-6 in the Land Use Element also
apply to the Gateway Neighborhood Area.
Brockway Road Neighborhood Area
The Brockway Road Neighborhood Area is applied to the Brockway Road
Corridor, in recognition of this important thoroughfare as a key gateway to
Truckee from the south. It also recognizes the potential for significant
change in this area with conversion of the roadway from a State Highway to a
local road, following the completion of the Highway 267 Bypass.

Policies:
     BR-P1.        Preserve and improve the character of the Brockway Road
                   Corridor, including the following aspects:
                   ♦    Preservation of the corridor's open qualities, which pro-
                        vide an important transition from the developed areas
                        of the Town to the open space of the Martis Valley to
                        the south. This could be accomplished through screen-
                        ing with vegetation, use of landscaped buffers or inter-
                        spersing development nodes with green space and land-
                        scaped areas.
                   ♦    Recognition of the corridor's status as a gateway to
                        Truckee from the south, ensuring that new develop-
                        ment and land uses, particularly those proposed for PC-
                        3, support and enhance this role.
                   ♦    Supporting the corridor's use as a bicycle and pedestrian
                        route through the provision of appropriate facilities for

National Forest [NF]
This designation was applied to lands under the jurisdiction of the United
States Forest Service. In all areas designated NF identified for disposal by the
USFS, an underlying designation is applied to express the Town's intent for
land uses on those lands should they enter private ownership.
Land Uses Allowed: Land uses allowed in this designation are those uses per-
mitted in the underlying land use designation in the event that the parcels are
transferred into private ownership. Zoning districts to implement this cate-
gory should recognize the public uses until such time as the land ownership
changes.
Density and Intensity: Density and intensity standards as specified for the un-
derlying designation are applicable.
                                                                             2-45

F. Land Use Designations for the Proposed Sphere of Influence
Figure LU-3 shows land use designations for land within the Town’s pro-
posed Sphere of Influence.
Planned Residential Development [PRD].
This land use designation is applied to areas outside the Town limits but
within the proposed Sphere of Influence. Three Planned Residential Devel-
opment areas have been identified. Their location is shown in Figure LU-3.
  ♦ Planned Residential Development Area 1: 702 acres located in the Negro
     Canyon area.
  ♦ Planned Residential Development Area 2: 850 acres located adjacent to
     the east boundary of the town.
  ♦ Planned Residential Development Area 3: 868 acres located south of the
     Glenshire area in the Martis Valley.
Levels of permitted development intensity for each of these areas are specified
below.
The PRD designation for each of the areas described above is intended to rec-
ognize the development intensities established by the Nevada County Gen-
eral Plan. The intent of this land use designation is to allow clustered residen-
tial development with supporting commercial uses while preserving land in
undeveloped open space. Prior to subdivision or development of the prop-
erty, a planned development must be approved. The planned development
will be utilized to implement Town General Plan policies including, but not
limited to, protection of steep slopes, drainage courses, wetlands, key wildlife
habitat, sensitive view corridors, and other environmentally sensitive areas.
Land Uses Allowed: Land uses allowed in this designation are clustered resi-
dential uses. Commercial uses supporting clustered residential development
and residential recreational uses are also permitted. Clustered residential uses

are those located on a portion of a site, with the remainder of the site pre-
served in open space. Clustering shall be planned so as to leave areas of sig-
nificant resources or hazard in open space and to maximize preservation of
open space areas. The type, location and quality of open space areas pre-
served through clustering shall be an integral and primary element in the
overall site planning for a project. Types of open space to be prioritized for
preservation through clustering are defined in detail in the Conservation and
Open Space Element. Areas preserved in open space shall be included as part
of the area considered in calculating project density.
Density and Intensity: The density and intensity of development shall be es-
tablished through the planned development. The following descriptions of
each Planned Residential Development area establishes the maximum number
of dwelling units and other development that may be considered through the
planned development and the significant site design issues:
  ♦ Planned Residential Development 1: The land use designation allows
     for a maximum of 38 clustered residential units. Design issues include
     avoidance of steep slopes, wildlife movement corridors, protection and
     restoration of creeks and drainages, and protection of scenic vistas.
  ♦ Planned Residential Development 2: This land use designation allows
     for a maximum of 275 clustered residential units and approximately 10
     acres of neighborhood commercial uses. Design issues include establish-
     ing an appropriate relationship with the adjacent residential areas, wild-
     life movement corridors, protection of creeks and drainages, and ridge
     line protection.
  ♦ Planned Residential Development 3: This land use designation allows
     for a maximum of 189 clustered residential units. Density from the por-
     tion of the site within Placer County may be transferred to that portion
     within the Town’s proposed sphere. Design issues include wildlife move-
     ment corridors, avoidance of steep slopes and other environmentally sen-
     sitive areas, protection of creeks and drainages, and protection of impor-
     tant scenic vistas.

Other Land Use Designation in the Proposed Sphere of Influence
Other land use designations applied to lands in the proposed sphere include
Resource Conservation/Open Space (RC/OS), Residential Cluster 10 (RC-
10), and Residential (RES). These designations are described in Section D.
Policies concerning the annexation of land within the proposed sphere of
influence are included under Goal LU-8 in Section G.
G. Goals, Policies and Actions
Goal LU-1           Manage growth so as to maintain the unique
                    qualities and character of the Town as a small
                    mountain community.
     Policies
       P1.1      All new development shall meet important community goals
                 for design quality, open space preservation, and promotion of
                 a livable, sustainable community. Development that does not
                 fulfill these goals shall not be allowed.
       P1.2      Projects that exceed minimum requirements and mandated
                 levels for provision of affordable and workforce housing shall
                 be given a higher priority for development approval. Such
                 projects may be considered for application of less stringent de-
                 velopment standards in order to facilitate their development.
     Actions
     A1.1     Develop a system whereby development projects can be given a
              rating based on the degree to which they meet goals for preserva-
              tion and enhancement of community character, adherence to
              town design standards, open space preservation, environmental
              sustainability, provision of affordable housing, minimization of

                                   Goal LU-2          Provide an adequate amount of land designated
                                                      for residential, commercial, and industrial uses
                                                      to meet demand within the life of the Plan.
                                   As described in the Introduction to the General Plan and in the introduction
                                   to the Land Use Element, the General Plan Land Use Map, shown in Figure
                                   LU-1, was developed to meet this goal by providing sufficient land for growth
                                   projected for up to the year 2025. The following policies will ensure that the
                                   above goal is implemented as new development occurs.

Goal LU-7          Encourage clustered residential development to
                   create efficient development patterns, and to
                   minimize environmental impacts and threats to
                   public safety.
        P7.1    For all residential developments, require clustering where ap-
                propriate. Clustered development as defined in this General
                Plan includes the following considerations:
                 ♦ Clustering of residential development will allow flexibility
                    of site design in responding to the natural features and re-
                    sources of an individual site.
                 ♦ Clustering means that structures will be located on a site
                    so that larger areas are left as undeveloped open space.
                 ♦ Undeveloped areas may either be preserved in private or
                    public open space, or may be a portion of an individual
                    lot, with deed restrictions prohibiting construction in that
                    portion.
       P7.2     Residential development shall be clustered to avoid areas of
                significant natural resources, including wildlife habitat and mi-
                gration corridors and visual resources.
       P7.3     Clustered development types shall be applied within the Town
                according to the location and character of the development

     site. Clustered development types and their corresponding
     recommended locations are summarized in Table LU-7.
P7.4 Clustered development shall incorporate preservation of open
     space areas as an integral and primary consideration in the
     overall development plan for a site. Considerations in preserv-
     ing open space through clustering shall include the following:
      ♦ Maximizing preservation of open space types that reflect
          the Town’s priorities as stated in the Conservation and
          Open Space Element.
      ♦ Maintaining an appropriate relationship of the site to the
          character and context of adjacent neighborhood areas and
          nearby and adjoining open space areas.
      ♦ Respecting individual site features and characteristics, in-
          cluding topography, natural features, natural hazards and
          constraints, and the presence of sensitive biological re-
          sources.
P7.5 Preserve the portions of parcels not developed with clustered
     residential used as undeveloped open space. Preservation and
     management options for open space include:
      ♦ Dedication to a homeowners association.
      ♦ Dedication to a public agency such as the Parks District,
          or to a land trust or other non-profit agency.
      ♦ Use of building envelopes in conjunction with conserva-
          tion easements or deed restrictions.

             Policies P7.1 to P7.5.
Goal LU-7 is also implemented through policies P1.4, P1.5 and P4.2 in the
Conservation and Open Space Element.
Goal LU-8        Work with adjacent jurisdictions to provide cri-

                 within the Town of Truckee’s proposed Sphere
                 of Influence for development purposes.
Figure LU-3 depicts the proposed sphere of influence, the boundary of which
was developed based on land use designations adopted by Nevada County.
    Policies
      P8.1     Seek agreement with Sierra, Nevada and Placer Counties on
               development review procedures and criteria for major projects
               in the Truckee region.
      P8.2     Consider the extension of urban infrastructure (i.e. sewer and
               water) outside the Town boundaries and within the proposed
               sphere in conjunction with annexation of the property into
               the Town.
      P8.3     Encourage in cooperation with Nevada County that develop-
               ment within the sphere of influence, whether annexed in the
               Town or approved under County jurisdiction, is consistent
               with the Town 2025 General Plan.

              Figure LU-3 as the Town of Truckee’s official sphere of influ-

     A8.2     Develop annexation policies, in collaboration with Nevada
              County and LAFCo, regarding annexation of property into the
              Town for municipal services. These policies shall address the
              following:
                 ♦ Require that consideration of annexation prior to, or in
                    conjunction with, formal consideration of development
                    proposals so that the appropriate development standards
                    may be applied.
                 ♦ Annexation of development into the Town should be
                    revenue neutral. The Town may pursue annexation of
                    property where the cost of providing Town services ex-
                    ceeds the revenue received based on a finding that the an-
                    nexation will provide an overriding benefit to the greater
                    Truckee community.
                 ♦ Planned urban development outside of the Town should
                    be considered the most appropriate for development and
                    annexation to the Town in the following order:
                     a. Areas within the boundaries of established water and
                        sewer providers and where provisions for services to the
                        properties have been made;
                     b. Areas within the boundaries of established water and
                        sewer providers where provisions for services to the
                        properties have not been made;
                     c. Areas outside of the boundaries of established water and
                        sewer providers.

              ♦ The type and level of service provided in areas proposed to
                 be annexed into the Town should be similar to those pro-
                 vided within the existing Town boundaries.
              ♦ Compact development, close to existing infrastructure, is
                 most appropriate for annexation to the Town.
              ♦ Annexation of resource lands or sparsely developed areas
                 is generally not appropriate unless done in conjunction
                 with the annexation of development areas.
  A8.3     Explore the development of a transfer of development credit
           program within the Town. Explore the possibility of transfer-
           ring development rights of properties within the sphere of influ-
           ence to lands within the Town. Involve property owners, the
           Nevada County Local Agency Formation Commission, and Ne-
           vada County in the development of the program and in the con-
           sideration of including properties in the sphere of influence in
           the program.
Goal LU-9       Support development patterns in the Planning
                Area that do not negatively impact the Town
                of Truckee, and that enhance the quality of life
                for residents of Truckee and the wider region.
